Pilot Clinical Trial of Repeated Doses of Macimorelin to Assess Safety and Efficacy in Patients With Cancer Cachexia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated oral administration of macimorelin at different doses daily for 1 week for the treatment of cancer cachexia.
Cancer Cachexia
DRUG: Macimorelin|DRUG: Placebo
Change of Body Weight, The change of body weight(kg)will be measured between day 1 and day (Day 7-Day 1)., 7 days|Change of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Plasma Levels, The change of IGF-1 plasma levels will be measured between day 1 (prior to dosing) and day 7., 7 days|Change of Quality of Life Score, The change of quality of life score (Anderson Symptom Assessment Scale \[ASAS; absolute score\], Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue \[FACIT-F; total score\]) will be measured between day 1 and day 7. The ASAS is a validated measure of quality of life (QOL) associated with symptom clusters commonly seen in cancer patient populations. The absolute score ranges from 0-100 with higher scores indicative of worse cancer symptoms. The FACIT-F is a validated measure of QOL associated with fatigue related to chronic illness. To account for missing items, the FACIT-F total score (sum of subscales) was adjusted by calculating the percent total score of items completed with the following:

(FACIT-F Total Score)/(N items completed ×4 (maximum possible score for each item ) × 100% Scores range from 0 to 160 with higher scores indicative of greater fatigue. Tests consists of 5 subscales: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional Well-Being, and Additional Concerns., 7 days
Food Intake and Diary, Food intake as measured by a food diary to be recorded for 3 days before days 1 and 7 and by a test meal done at screening and on day 7., 7 days|Appetite (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] for Appetite), Change of appetite measured by a validated visual analogue scale between day 1 and day 7. The VAS is a one-item measure that quantifies subjective rating with a 100 mm line anchored at 0 mm with the words "Not at all" and at 100 mm with the word "Extremely" where the participant makes a mark on the line indicative of their current hunger level. Higher scores are indicative of greater perceived hunger., 7 days|Handgrip Strength, Change in muscle strength as measured by handgrip strength., 7 days|Energy Expenditure as Measured by Indirect Calorimetry., Change in energy expenditure as measured by indirect calorimetry., 7 days|Laboratory Assays, Change in Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3), Highly Sensitive C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and glucose between day 1 and day 7., Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (White Blood Cells), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|ECG, Change in electrocardiogram (ECG) at days 1 and 7 before and 1 hour after dosing and on the post-study visit., Day 1 to Day 7|Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Recording of any adverse events from day 1 to day 7., 7 days|Change in Stair Climbing Power (SCP), SCP was assessed on Day 1 \& 7. Participants were asked to climb a standard flight of hospital stairs (13 steps, 15.3 cm each) as quickly as possible, using the handrail if necessary. Two-three trials were attempted with one minute of rest in-between. The shortest completion time was transformed into power and used for analysis where:

W= (body mass (kg) × acceleration of gravity (9.81 m⁄s\^2 )× vertical distance (1.99 m))/(time (seconds)), Day 1 to Day 7|Change in Percent Predicted Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), Change in percent predicted (REE) as measured by indirect calorimetry., Day 1 to Day 7|Change in Respiratory Quotient, Change in respiratory quotient (the ratio of volume CO2 released to volume of O2 utilized) as measured by indirect calorimetry., Day 1 to Day 7|Laboratory Assays (Growth Hormone), Change in Growth Hormone (GH) between day 1 and day 7., Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Red Blood Cells), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Hemoglobin [HGB]; Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin [MCH] Concentration; Protein; Total Albumin), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC) and complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Laboratory Safety (Hematocrit [HCT]; Red Cell Distribution Width [RCDW]; Neutrophil; Lymphocyte; Monocyte; Eosinophil; Basophil), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Mean Corpuscular Volume [MCV]), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin [MCH]), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Platelet), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete blood count (CBC), Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory {Blood Urea Nitrogen [BUN]; Creatinine; Calcium), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Sodium; Chloride; Carbon Dioxide), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Potassium), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Alkaline Phosphatase), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR]), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|Safety Laboratory (Alanine Transaminase [ALT]; Aspartate Aminotransferase [AST]), Change in Clinical laboratory parameters: complete metabolic panel, Day 1 to Day 7|ECG (Heart Rate [HR]), Change in electrocardiogram (ECG) at days 1 and 7 before and 1 hour after dosing and on the post-study visit., Day 1 to Day 7
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated oral administration of macimorelin at different doses daily for 1 week for the treatment of cancer cachexia.
