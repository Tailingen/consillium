Clinical Outcomes of Tislelizumab Combined with Chemotherapy As Induction Therapy in Stage III (cTNM-IIIB/IIIC) NSCLC
This is an observational study evaluating the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes in Stage III (cTNM-IIIB/IIIC) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled, with treatment modalities and clinical outcomes of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from multiple tertiary hospitals in real-world settings since August 2020 being collected and analyzed.
NSCLC Stage IIIB, NSCLC Stage IIIC
PROCEDURE: Tislelizumab Combined with Chemotherapy,
major pathological response, viable tumor cell less than 10%, ;usually 1 week after surgery
R0 resection rate, margin negative resection, ,usually 1 week after surgery|Down-staging rate, clinical and pathological downstaging, usually 1 week after surgery|Impact of Neoadjuvant Therapy on Surgical Outcomes, Surgical Rate, usually 1 week after surgery|The outcome of survival, patterns and Outcomes of Postoperative Disease Recurrence/Progression, usually 12 month after Induction Therapy|12month event-free survival rate, the time from randomization to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progresson or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cases;, rom date of diagnosis until the date of first documented progression, the rate of recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months|OS, From diagnosis to the death;, from date of diagnosis until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Key Inclusion Populationï¼š Stage IIIB/IIIC NSCLC patients confirmed by histological or cytological examination based on the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system.Patients were negative for EGFR-sensitive mutations or ALK/ROS1 fusion alterations.

No prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical intervention, or immunotherapy had been administered.ECOG PS scores of the enrolled patients ranged from 0 to 2.

Neoadjuvant/Induction Therapy Regimen:

Tislelizumab combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy was administered for 2-4 cycles, followed by surgical resection or other therapeutic interventions (e.g., radiotherapy/chemotherapy). Real-world clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed based on patients' subsequent treatment pathways.
