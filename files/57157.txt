Liquid Biopsy in Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess clinical utility of combined circulating tumor cell (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the diagnosis of primary lung cancer.
Lung Cancer (Diagnosis)|Circulating Tumor Cell
Diagnostic sensitivity of combined CTC and ctDNA, To compared the sensitivity of combined CTC and ctDNA with those of CTC and ctDNA alone in diagnosis of primary lung cancer, 1 year
Diagnostic accuracy of combined CTC and ctDNA, To compared the accuracy of combined CTC and ctDNA with those of CTC and ctDNA alone in diagnosis of primary lung cancer, 1 year|Diagnostic specificity of CTC and ctDNA, To compared the specificity of combined CTC and ctDNA with those of CTC and ctDNA alone in diagnosis of primary lung cancer, 1 year
The peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples are collected from the participants.CTC and ctDNA are analyzed from the blood samples.
