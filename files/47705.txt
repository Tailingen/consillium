Study to Evaluate the Bioavailability of Tislelizumab Via Subcutaneous Injection in First-Line Treatment of Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the bioavailability of tislelizumab subcutaneous (SC) injection in the first-line treatment of participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This clinical study will be divided into 2 parts: dose/injection site exploration (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).
