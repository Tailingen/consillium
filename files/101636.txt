DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Artificial intelligence model
Area under the curve, AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a common index used to evaluate the performance of binary classification model., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Sensitivity, Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify a positive result in an individual who actually has the disease. It represents the proportion of cases in which the test is able to detect a positive for the disease, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Specificity, Specificity refers to the ability of the test to correctly identify a negative result in an individual who does not actually have the disease. It represents the proportion of cases where the disease is negative that the test is able to detect., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Accuracy, Accuracy refers to the degree to which the results of the diagnostic test are consistent with the actual situation, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Positive predicative value, Positive Predictive Value indicates the probability that a test result will be true if it is positive. In other words, it represents the proportion of individuals who are diagnosed as positive when the test result is positive who actually have the disease, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Negative predictive value, Negative Predictive Value refers to the probability that if a test result is negative, the result will be true negative. It represents the proportion of individuals who are diagnosed as negative when the test results are negative that are truly free of the disease, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Investigators aimed to develop an ultrasonic intelligent diagnosis system for ovarian mass based on multimodal ultrasound images.
