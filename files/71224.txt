Detection of Ileoanal Pouch/Reservoir Adenomas
The detection of adenomas is the basis for the follow-up of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, after colectomy, with a remnant rectum or an ileal pouch. The optimal method for the adenomas detection is not defined yet. Despite the proven effectiveness of indigo-carmine in different indications dye chromoendoscopy is not used in a consensual way at the international level. The situation of the ileal pouch is specific as adenomas have a usually flat shape and are much more difficult to identify than in the situation of a remnant rectum, even in the situation of \> 5 mm adenomas that should be resected.

Our hypothesis is that indigo-carmine can improve adenomas detection, including \> 5 mm adenomas, in patients with a an ileal pouch after colectomy improving the effectiveness of surveillance programs and potentially reducing the risk of cancer in this population.
Adenomatous Polyps
PROCEDURE: Adenomas detection rate with the different observation methods
Average number of ileal pouch/reservoir adenomas, Average number of ileal pouch/reservoir adenomas detected according to the endoscopic mode (staining or not, virtual or not) based on a paired review of the films with final consensus in case of discordance, 6 months after colonoscopy
