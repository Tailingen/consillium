Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy and Pembrolizumab Versus Treatment of Physician's Choice and Pembrolizumab in Patients With Previously Untreated, Locally Advanced Inoperable or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) between sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) and pembrolizumab versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC) and pembrolizumab in participants with previously untreated, locally advanced inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1).
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|PD-L1 Positive
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective progressive disease (PD) or death (whichever comes first)., Randomization up to approximately 33 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the earlier of the first documentation of objective PD or death from any cause (whichever comes first)., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|Time to Response (TTR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first documentation of CR or PR., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), First dose date up to 53 months plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, First dose date up to 53 months plus 30 days|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Scale as Measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core Questionnaire, Version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the participant)., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|TTD of Pain Score as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the participant)., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|TTD of Fatigue Score as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (ie, a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (ie, a worse state of the participant)., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|TTD of Physical Functioning Domain Score as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning (ie, a better state of the participant), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (ie, a worse state of the participant)., Randomization up to approximately 53 months|TTD of Role Functioning Score as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales, 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales, and 6 single items. Scoring of the QLQ-C30 is performed according to QLQ-C30 Scoring manual. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.
