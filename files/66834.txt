Phase I Trial of BAY1251152 for Advanced Blood Cancers
The purpose of this study is to identify the most appropriate dose that can be safely administered and that can have an effect on blood cancer cells. Once that safe dose is identified, additional patients will be asked to join the study to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the study drug. The study will also investigate the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to the drug), as well as pharmacodynamics (study of what the drug does to the body), which may provide information about the effects of BAY 1251152. The study will also measure some biological markers (markers of biological activity in your body) that can be used to predict the response and safety of the proposed treatment.
