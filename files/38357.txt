AGE Levels in ER+ Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Endocrine Therapy
The purpose of this study is to look at the effects that the study drug (OPC) has on AGE levels in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: OPC
AGE level reduction, The primary objective is to determine if the test agents are able to reduce AGE levels by at least 30% in th 50% or more of test subjects., 85 days
Correlation between AGE level and changes to BMI, Changes in AGE levels and BMI will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Changes in AGE levels and HOMA-IR will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and A1C, Changes in AGE levels and A1C will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and lipids, Changes in AGE levels and lipids will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and diet, Changes in AGE levels and diet will be described using graphs and other models. Diet will be assessed by using the NIH "Eating at America's Table Study Quick Food Scan" and the NCI "Quick Food Scan", 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and quality of life, Measured by FACT-B quality of life questionnaire, 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and plasma IL6, Changes in AGE levels and IL6 will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and leptin, Changes in AGE levels and leptin will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and c-reactive protein (CRP), Changes in AGE levels and CRP will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and malondialdehyde (MDA), Changes in AGE levels and MDA will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and oxLDLs (low density lipoprotein), Changes in AGE levels and oxLDLs will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Correlation between AGE level and sRAGE (soluble receptor for AGE), Changes in AGE levels and sRAGE will be described using graphs and other models., 85 days|Frequency of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v. 4, Toxicities will be tabulated by type, grade and the visit at which they occurred., 85 days|Tumor response to treatment as assessed by RECIST 1.1 or MD Anderson criteria, The anti-tumor response will be measured by comparing baseline and post-treatment imaging using RECIST 1.1 or MD Anderson criteria for bone only disease., 85 days
AGEs are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to see if certain drug (OPC) has an effect on the AGE levels in your blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.
