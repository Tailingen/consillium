Clinical Study of VG161 in Subjects with Advanced Primary Liver Cancer
VG161 is a recombinant human-IL12/15/PDL1B oncolytic HSV-1 Injectable. This phase I study will be conducted in HSV-seropositive subjects with advanced primary liver cancer that are refractory to conventional therapies. This is an open label study and it's divided into two parts.

Part 1: This part is ascending dose design to determine the safety and tolerability of VG161 and find recommended dose of VG161.

Part 2: This part is extended dose design to determine the effectiveness of VG161.

Part 1: This part will be conducted in 5 dose ascending cohorts, including 2 accelerated titration design dose group and 3 dose escalation groups. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data.

Part 2: This part will only include the part 1 recommended dose. Hypothesis test and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data.
