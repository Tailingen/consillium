Oncolytic Virus Ad-TD-nsIL12 for Primary Pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
This is a drug safety assessment clinical trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design, to observe the safety, tolerability and toxicity of a novel oncolytic virus Ad-TD-nsIL12 intratumoral injection in primary DIPG patients (NCI-CTCAE V5.0).
Oncolytic Virus|Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma|Adverse Drug Event
BIOLOGICAL: Ad-TD-nsIL12
Safety of Ad-TD-nsIL12 intratumoral injection in primary pediatric DIPG patients., The trial will look for possible hematologic and neurologic toxicity of Ad-TD-nsIL12 by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 to determine maximum tolerated dose of this oncolytic adenovirus., 3 months after virus injection
Tumor response, To determine tumor response by RAPNO criteria., 3 months after virus injection|Over-all survival (12 months), To determine overall survival at 12 months (OS12)., 12 months after virus injection|QoL, To measure quality of life baseline assessment and any changes over time by PedsQLTM criteria., 2 years after virus injection|Sample Collection, Pre- and post- treatment tumor tissue will be collected and tested to determine the immune response of patients. Collected blood will be used to test possible hematotoxicity of Ad-TD-nsIL12., 3 months after virus injection
