Confocal Laser Microendoscopy (CellTouch) for the Diagnosis of Early Gastric Cancer: A Multicenter Clinical Study
This study is A prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial: The study intends to include subjects suspected of early gastric cancer, including 378 subjects with neoplastic lesions and 200 subjects with non-neoplastic lesions. The subjects are divided into two groups by random envelopes, A and B, and the endoscopic diagnosis in different groups is performed in different order (including: White light endoscopy,CellTouch, Magnifying endoscopy with NBI(ME-NBI)). Finally, the gold standard of histopathology was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CellTouch in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.The study hypothesized that the sensitivity and specificity of CellTouch in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer could reach more than 90% and more than 95%.
Early Gastric Cancer
Histopathology was used as the diagnostic gold standard to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CellTouch in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer., The diagnostic properties of CellTouch include: sensitivity and specificity., 30 min
Using histopathology as the diagnostic gold standard, the diagnostic performance of CellTouch and ME-NBI in early gastric cancer was compared and analyzed., Diagnostic performance related indexes include: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value., 30 min|Using histopathology as the diagnostic gold standard, the diagnostic performance of CellTouch combined with ME-NBI and ME-NBI alone in early gastric cancer was compared and analyzed., Diagnostic performance related indexes include: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value., 30 min|Using histopathology as the diagnostic gold standard, the diagnostic performance of CellTouch and ME-NBI in the differential diagnosis of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was evaluated., Diagnostic performance related indexes include: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value., 30 min
