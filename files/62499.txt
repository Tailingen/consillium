A Screening Study Targeting Tumor-specific Antigens
The purpose of this study is to identify patients who may be eligible to participate in a separate Phase 2/3 treatment study evaluating an individualized neoantigen vaccine GRANITE for first line (1L) maintenance treatment of metastatic, microsatellite-sable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC) sponsored by Gritstone bio. This may include the manufacturing of an individualized vaccine, which involves neoantigen prediction and generating a vaccine targeting neoantigens.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Stage II/III Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: blood collection for research (next generation sequencing [NGS])|PROCEDURE: blood collection for research (HLA typing)|PROCEDURE: blood collection for research (circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA])
Primary, To identify patients with a defined tumor-specific profile (or tumor-specific characteristics, proteins, mutations) for potential inclusion in a separate clinical study that involves investigational study treatment., at study enrollment
The screening study can enroll multiple tumor types in multiple treatment settings for the potential inclusion in a treatment study. Patient's tumors are analyzed to determine if the patient's tumor contains sufficient mutations. This screening study is currently enrolling patients with localized colon cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer for the development of an individualized neoantigen-based cancer vaccine that requires a manufacturing period for each patient.

The process of generating an individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine involves multiple steps, including collection of patient tumor and blood specimens, performing next-generation sequencing (NGS), predicting the neoantigens to be included in the individualized vaccine, and the manufacture and release of the individualized vaccine.

Study participants will not receive any investigational treatment as part of this trial. Patients screened in this study may be able to enroll in a separate investigational treatment study sponsored by Gritstone bio, provided that the patient meets the specified eligibility criteria for that treatment study.
