DRUG: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
Best Objective Response Rate (bORR) at 6 months, This is defined as the proportion of subjects in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set who achieve a best response of Complete Remission (CR) or Partial Remission (PR) following infusion of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection, as determined by the treating physician, and who have the opportunity to complete the 6-month assessment. Before the data cutoff date, all subjects who do not meet the criteria for objective response will be considered as having no objective response (e.g., those without valid assessments or who did not undergo efficacy evaluation)., Up to 36 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time interval from the date of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection infusion to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set., Up to 36 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set who achieve a best response of Complete Response (CR) as determined by the treating physician., Up to 36 months|Partial Response (PR) Rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set who achieve a best response of Partial Response (PR) as determined by the treating physician., Up to 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time interval from the first documented complete or partial response to disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) among subjects who achieve an objective response in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set., Up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time interval from the infusion of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection to death due to any cause in the modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) analysis set. All subjects, regardless of whether they receive any additional anti-tumor treatment after infusion, will be followed up for survival information. The causes of death will also be reported., Up to 36 months
This study is a single-arm, multicenter, prospective Phase II clinical trial, planning to enroll 30 Chinese subjects with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (R/R FL) who will receive Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection. The study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection in treating Chinese patients with R/R FL.
