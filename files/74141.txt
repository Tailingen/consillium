Pomalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Pomalidomide and bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving pomalidomide and bortezomib together with dexamethasone may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given together with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and to see how well it works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Find Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Bortezomib in Combination With Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone Out to 2.5 Years, by Count of Patients With Dose Limiting Toxicities., MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients)., 2.5 years|Number of Participants With a Hematologic Response (PR, VGPR, or CR), The number of participants who achieve PR, VGPR, or CR as defined by The International Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria(2011). sCR: CR as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or \> 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24 h. PR: \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by \>90% or to \< 200 mg/24 h. MR: NA. SD: Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease. PD: Increase of \> 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 0.5 g/dL), Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 200 mg/24 h), 2.5 years
Progression Free Survival, The progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. PD: Increase of \> 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 0.5 g/dL), Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 200 mg/24 h), 2.5 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Reported in Adverse Events section of the results, 2.5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

II. To evaluate the hematologic response rate (PR, VGPR, or CR) of pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Time to progression.

II. To assess the toxicity of pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in this patient population.

OUTLINE : This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II study. Patients receive oral pomalidomide on days 1-21; bortezomib IV on days 1, 8,15, 22; and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, 22 . Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses. Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising oral pomalidomide on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
