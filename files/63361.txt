3D Ultra Sound for Resection of Brain Tumors
Phase 3 randomized open labeled trials will evaluate the 3 D navigable ultrasound (SonoWand) in improving the extent of resection in intra-axial brain tumors. All patients will undergo resective surgery. In the experimental arm, a navigable 3 D ultrasound will be used. In the standard arm, only navigation will be used. This study will help in assessing the usefulness sononavigation in improving radicality of resection in malignant gliomas and also to access the accuracy of SonoWand in predicting residue (histopathological correlation).
Patients With Resectable Brain Tumors
DEVICE: Sonowand|PROCEDURE: Navigation
Percentage of patients where Gross total resection (GTR) achieved, Measure: Volumetric MRI - residual tumor (in cc), Post operative within 72 hrs.
Accuracy of US, Measure: Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, Post operative within 72 hrours
Further resection prompted, Whether use of the SonoWand prompted a further resection after the surgeon thought it was complete (Unanticipated residue), Intraoperative|Survival, overall and Progression-free, 3 years
Routine presurgical evaluation of all patients will be conducted. The preoperative use of steroids, antiepileptics and other medications would be as per standard procedure and would be documented. In addition detailed MRI evaluation will be performed (including contrast enhanced MRI study, diffusion MRI, perfusion MR, MR spectroscopy, dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI for permeability studies, as well as functional MRI, and tractography if required) not more than 1 week prior to the date of surgery.

Navigation specific MR sequences would be performed in all patients (both arms).
