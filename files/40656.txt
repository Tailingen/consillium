Patients with cancer may experience a considerable symptom burden, often requiring hospitalizations for symptom management. The study doctors want to know if daily electronic monitoring of the symptoms, such as pain, nausea, constipation, and diarrhea may improve care while participants are hospitalized.

The goal of this study is to evaluate a new way to deliver oncology care where patients' symptoms are systematically monitored during their hospital admission. The investigators are studying whether patients whose clinicians receive their patients' detailed symptom reports each day have improved symptom management compared to those whose clinicians do not receive their patients' detailed symptom reports each day.

The study will use questionnaires to measure the participant symptoms and involves participating in a study for as long as the participants are admitted to the hospital. The information the investigators collect will help them determine if electronic symptom monitoring improves the care of patients with cancer
