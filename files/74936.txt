Patients With Brain Metastases From HER2-positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal sequences of combined trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and whole-brain radiotherapy in patients presenting brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer in terms of acute toxicities and blood/cerebrospinal fluid T-DM1 pharmacokinetics.
