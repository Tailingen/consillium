SOX Versus XELOX for Patients With Peritoneal Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to compare the activity and safety of Oxaliplatin and S-1 (SOX) and Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (XELOX) in patients with peritoneal metastasis of colorectal cancer.

Peritoneal dissemination from colorectal cancer is common, and it has been traditionally regarded as end-stage disease only amenable to palliation by systemic chemotherapy (sCT), or supportive care .Oxaliplatin and oral fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine or S-1) are active agents for colorectal cancer. Recent a phase II trial of combination chemotherapy of oxaliplatin with S-1 (OS) and several phase II trial of combination chemotherapy of oxaliplatin with capecitabine (XELOX) demonstrated good activity and mild toxicity in advanced colorectal cancer. Oxaliplatin and S-1 or capecitabine have distinct mechanisms of action and no overlap of key toxicities. Furthermore, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil were shown to be highly synergistic, not only in preclinical models but also in subsequent clinical trials.
