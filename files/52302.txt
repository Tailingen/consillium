Regorafenib Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor Therapy for Second-line Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single arm, nonrandomized, single center clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of regorafenib combined with PD-1 inhibitor therapy for second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Regorafenib|PD-1 Inhibitor
DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor
Progression Free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause, one year
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has reached a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit, including complete response and partial response patients, one year|Complete response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions, no appearance of new lesions, and normalization of tumor markers last for at least 4 weeks., one year|Partial response (PR), Sum of the maximum diameters of target lesions is reduced by at least 30%, which lasts for at least 4 weeks., one year|Overall survival (OS), It is the time from when a subject is clearly enrolled to death from any cause., one year|Duration of response (DOR), It is the time from the first-time PR or CR (subject to the earlier one) objectively reported to the first-time disease progression or death., one year|Percentage of patients with stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 4 weeks, It is specifically referred to the percentage of patients with identified SD that can be evaluated for efficacy., one year|Progression-free survival rate at 3 months, It's the percentage of patients with no disease progression or died from any cause after 3 months of treatment with combination of regorafenib and PD-1 inhibitor in the total number of patients whose efficacy can be evaluated., 6 months|Mortality at 12 months, It's the percentage of patients who died of any cause after 12 months treatment with combination of regorafenib and PD-1 inhibitor in total enrolled patients., one year and a half
Adverse Event (AE), Definition: Refers to any adverse medical event that occurs in patients receiving medical product treatment or subjects of clinical studies, which may not have a causal relationship with the treatment. AE includes but is not limited to: abnormal laboratory test results; clinically significant symptoms and signs; allergies, etc., two years|Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR), All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The phrase "responses to a medicinal products" means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out., two years
To observe and evaluate the efficacy, safety and biomarker analysis of regorafenib combined with PD-1 inhibitor for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled for regorafenib combined with PD-1 inhibitor therapy.In the absence of any of the following conditions, such as withdrawal of informed consent by subjects, intolerable drug side effects, or the investigator's determination that further study is not appropriate, the expected study treatment for each subject will continue until radiologically confirmed tumor progression. Efficacy indicators and safety indicators will be observed during the trial.
