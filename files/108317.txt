Comparision of Various Biomarkers Between Peripheral and Pulmonary Blood
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnosis is linked to a better prognosis. Further, surgical resection at the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) results in markedly improved survival rates. Computed tomography (CT)- or bronchoscopy-guided needle biopsies are standard definitive diagnostic procedures for lung cancer and are used to obtain tissue for pathological examination. However, these procedures are invasive, difficult to repeat, expensive, and risk exposure to radiation. Conversely, liquid biopsies, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), are simple and less invasive procedures that can be repeated more frequently than tissue biopsies.

This study is a retrospective blood sample obtained and prospectively comparative analysis of various biomarkers (cancer markers, and exosome markers) derived from peripheral blood and pulmonary venous blood from patients who underwent lung cancer surgery.

And treatment monitoring using biomarkers compare with peripheral and pulmonary blood.
