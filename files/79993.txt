A Study to Assess YH001 in Combination With Toripalimab Injection in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of YH001 administered intravenously (IV) in combination with Toripalimab. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of YH001 when administered in combination with Toripalimab to subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: YH001|DRUG: Toripalimab
Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events, The safety profile of YH001 will be assessed by monitoring the adverse events (AE) per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, From screening up to 1 year|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycle, During Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLT is defined as a toxicity (adverse event at least possibly related to YH001) occurring during the DLT observation period (the initial 21 days) both in run-in phase of YH001 as single agent and in combination phase of YH001 in combination with Toripalimab, During Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)

This trial will have a run-in phase to explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 as a single agent for 21 days as DLT observation period then followed by a combination phase to further explore the safety and tolerability of YH001 combined with Toripalimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) for each dose level during dose escalation.

The dose escalation will follow the traditional "3 + 3" dose escalation scheme. These subjects will be treated with YH001 and Toripalimab. YH001 will be administered intravenously every three weeks (Q3W) for 15 weeks (5 cycles) at doses of Dose A, Dose B, Dose C, Dose D, Dose E, Dose F and Dose G. Toripalimab will be administered by IV (Q3W) by the fixed dose of 240 mg from the 2nd cycle to 5th cycle. A single subject will be enrolled at Dose A as starting dose of YH001, and subsequent cohort will be expanded to include 3-6 subjects.
