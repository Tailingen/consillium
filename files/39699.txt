Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine in Combination With Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The investigators hypothesize that a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with durvalumab will improve the progression free survival of patients with extensive state small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Neoantigen DNA vaccine|DRUG: Durvalumab|DEVICE: TDS-IM v2.0 Device|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draws
Safety and tolerability of the combination of durvalumab and a neoantigen vaccine as measured by number of participants experiencing adverse events, -Safety and tolerability will be measured by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0, Through 90 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years and 3 months)|Feasibility of combining durvalumab with a neoantigen vaccine as measured by the number of participants that had a vaccine produced for them, -Feasibility is defined as the ability to produce a vaccine for 80% of patients enrolled within 24 weeks of the start of consolidation durvalumab., Within 24 weeks of the start of consolidation durvalumab
Progression-free survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of durvalumab to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., 12 months|Response conversion rate, -The response conversion rate is defined as the proportion of patients who improve in RECIST v1.1 category subsequent to vaccination., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years)|Duration of response (DOR), -The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years)|Overall survival (OS), -Defined as time from start of durvalumab to death due to any causes, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 4 years and 3 months)
The investigators hypothesize that a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with durvalumab will improve the progression free survival of patients with extensive state small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
