This is a phase I study to establish the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced CAR T cell products in patients with mesothelin expressing breast cancer. This study will be initiated as a single cohort, however the study is designed to allow for additional disease indications and other investigational CAR T cell products to be explored as separate cohorts under this protocol in the future.

Cohort 1: Cohort 1 will evaluate the use of huCART-meso cells delivered intratumorally in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) which is positive for mesothelin expression by IHC. Eligible subjects must also have an accessible lesion that can be targeted for both intratumoral injection and surgical excision/biopsy by either a surgeon or interventional radiology.
