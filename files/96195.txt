Study of Pimicotinib (ABSK021) for Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (MANEUVER)
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of Pimicotinib (ABSK021) in patients with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Whether the Pimicotinib(ABSK021) works well in patients with TGCT.
* Whether the Pimicotinib(ABSK021) is safe in patients with TGCT.

Participants will be asked to complete the study procedures:

* Receive the administration of Pimicotinib(ABSK021) or placebo (a placebo is a look-alike substance that contains no active drug) about 24 weeks in study part 1.
* Receive the administration of Pimicotinib(ABSK021) about 24 weeks in study part 2.
* Receive the administration of Pimicotinib(ABSK021) till study end in study part 3.
* Complete the study procedures speficied in the protocol, which is guided by researchers.
Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor|Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis|Giant Cell Tumor of Tendon Sheath
DRUG: Pimicotinib(ABSK021)|DRUG: Placebo
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed by central read using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1), Baseline to Week 25
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Tumor Volume Score (TVS), Assessed by central read using Tumor Volume Score (TVS). TVS is a semi-quantitative MRI scoring system that describes tumor mass and is based on 10% increments of the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved. A tumor that is equal in volume to that of a maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath was scored 10; a score of 0 indicated no evidence of tumor., Baseline to Week 25|Range of Motion (ROM), Mean change from baseline in ROM of the affected joint, Baseline to Week 25|Worst Stiffness, Mean change from baseline in the Worst Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at Week 25. The Worst Stiffness Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was a 1-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing the "worst" stiffness in the last 24 hours. The NRS for this item ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (stiffness as bad as you can imagine). Higher scores mean a worse outcomes., Baseline to Week 25|Worst Pain, Mean change from baseline in the Worst Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at Week 25. The Worst Pain Numeric Rating Scale Score (NRS) was a 1-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing the "worst" pain in the last 24 hours. The NRS for this item ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Higher scores mean a worse outcomes., Baseline to Week 25|Physical Function, Mean change from baseline in the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function score at Week 25. The Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) physical function scale was used to assess physical function of the upper and lower limbs. The scale ranged from 1 defined as 'unable to do' or 'cannot do' to 5 defined as 'without any difficulty' or 'not at all', where higher scores represent better outcomes., Baseline to Week 25|Quality of life (QoL), Mean change from baseline in EuroQol visual analogue scale (VAS) score at Week 25. The EuroQol visual analogue scale (VAS) is a Visual Analogue Scale on which the patient rates their current health, with 0 representing the "worst health you can imagine" and 100 representing the "best health you can imagine". Higher scores mean a better outcomes., Baseline to Week 25|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response as measured by RECIST Version 1.1 and Tumor Volume Score (TVS), The time (months) from the first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of radiographic disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.
This study consists of part 1 and part 2. Part 1 is a double-blind phase, eligible patients will be randomized to Pimicotinib(ABSK021) treatment group or matching placebo group and will receive Pimicotinib(ABSK021) or matching placebo until completion of Part 1.

Part 2 is an open-label treatment phase, and all patients entering this phase will receive open-label Pimicotinib(ABSK021) until completion of 24 weeks of dosing or withdrawal from the study.

Part 3 is an open-label extension treatment phase, and patients who completed the part 2 and continuted to be eligible, will go to the Part 3. Patients will receive the open-label Pimicotinib(ABSK021) until all patients withdraw from the study, or the sponsor decides to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.
