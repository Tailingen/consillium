Safety Study of AG-120 or AG-221 in Combination With Induction and Consolidation Therapy in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) With an IDH1 and/or IDH2 Mutation
The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter, clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of AG-120 and AG-221 when given in combination with standard AML induction and consolidation therapy. The study plans to evaluate up to 2 dose levels of AG-120 in participants with an isocitrate dehydrogenase protein 1 (IDH1) mutation and up to 2 dose levels of AG-221 in participants with an isocitrate dehydrogenase protein 2 (IDH2) mutation. AG-120 or AG-221 will be administered with 2 types of AML induction therapies (cytarabine with either daunorubicin or idarubicin) and 2 types of AML consolidation therapies (mitoxantrone with etoposide \[ME\] or cytarabine). After consolidation therapy, participants may continue on to maintenance therapy and receive daily treatment with single-agent AG-120 or AG-221 until relapse, development of an unacceptable toxicity, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The study will end when all participants have discontinued study treatment.
