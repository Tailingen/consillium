Clinical Study of SN301A Injection in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single-arm, open-label study of safety, tolerability, and anti-cancer activity of SN301A (an off-the-shelf CAR NK cell therapy) in patients with glypican-3 (GPC3)-positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

This study is a single-arm, open-label, modified 3+3 dose-escalation early exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), and Pharmacodynamic (PD) of SN301A cell injection in the treatment of subjects with glypican-3 (GPC3)-positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and evaluate the efficacy of SN301A cell injection in the treatment of subjects with GPC3-positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
