Evaluation of the Predictive Value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography and Brain Perfusion Computed Tomography for the Efficacy of Anti-angiogenic Therapy (Bevacizumab) in Recurrent Glioblastoma
In this pilot study, the study evaluators will evaluate the ability of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG PET) and the computed tomography (CT) perfusion scanner, individually and combined, to predict the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic treatment.
