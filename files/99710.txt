Efficacy of Momelotinib Versus Best Available Therapy in Anemic or Thrombocytopenic Subjects With Primary Myelofibrosis (MF), Post-polycythemia Vera MF, or Post-essential Thrombocythemia MF
This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus best available therapy (BAT) in anemic or thrombocytopenic adults with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-PV/ET MF) who were treated with ruxolitinib as measured by splenic response rate at Week 24 (SRR24).

Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or BAT for 24 weeks during the randomized treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive MMB in an extended treatment phase for up to an additional 204 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment or until study termination. For those subjects planning to continue treatment with MMB following the end of the study, the End of Treatment, 30-day, 12-Week, and survival follow-up visits are not required.
Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)|Post-polycythemia Vera (Post-PV)|Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF)
DRUG: Momelotinib|DRUG: Best Available Therapy (BAT)
Splenic Response Rate at Week 24, Splenic response rate at Week 24 is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a spleen volume reduction of ≥ 35% from baseline at the Week 24 assessment as measured by MRI or CT., Week 24
Total Symptom Score (TSS) Response Rate at Week 24, Total symptom score (TSS) is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a ≥50% reduction in TSS at Week 24 versus baseline as measured by the modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) v2.0 diary. Response rate was calculated using the average of the daily TSS from a consecutive 28-day period prior to Week 24, which had ≥20 daily TSS available.

The modified MPN-SAF patient-reported outcome instrument consisted of 8 items assessing worst daily incidence of tiredness, filling up quickly, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, itching, bone pain, pain under ribs on left side, and inactivity. Scoring of TSS in this study was based on 7 of these items, (0-70) excluding inactivity. These items assess the impact experienced by the participant in the 24 hours prior to completing the questionnaire. All items are measured using a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale, with 0 corresponding to "Absent" and 10 corresponding to "Worst Imaginable.", Week 24|Rate of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion in the Randomized Treatment Phase, (the Average Number of RBC Units Transfused Per Month Not Associated With Overt Bleeding), Rate of RBC transfusion is defined as the average number of RBC units transfused not associated with clinically overt bleeding per subject-month during the randomized treatment Phase., Baseline to Week 24|RBC Transfusion Independence Rate at Week 24, (Defined as Absence of RBC Transfusions and no Hemoglobin Level Below 8 g/dL in the 12 Weeks Prior to Week 24, Excluding Cases Associated With Clinically Overt Bleeding), RBC transfusion independence rate is the percentage of participants who achieved transfusion independence at Week 24 (responders). RBC transfusion independence is defined as absence of RBC transfusions and no hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL in the 12 weeks prior to Week 24, excluding cases associated with clinically overt bleeding. Transfusion dependence, (non-responder) is defined as at least 4 units of RBC transfusion, or a Hgb level below 8 g/dL, in the 8 weeks prior to week 24.

Methods used to assess this outcome measure include collection and recording of any instances of RBC transfusions and collection and recording of any local or central lab hemoglobin measurements, Week 24|RBC Transfusion Dependence Rate at Week 24, RBC transfusion dependence is the percentage of participants who are transfusion dependent at Week 24, defined as at least 4 units of RBC transfusions, or a hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL in the 8 weeks prior to Week 24, excluding cases associated with clinically overt bleeding., Week 24
