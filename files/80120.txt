Development of a Personalized Discussion Prioritization Tool for Older Adults Considering Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
The investigators have developed a Discussion Prioritization Tool (DPT) for older adults consider adjuvant chemotherapy that utilizes Conjoint Analysis (CA) methodology and the objective of the current study is to assess usability of this DPT in the target population, older adults with breast cancer and to adapt the tool to optimize usability for the target population.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Experimental
Functional Assessment of the Discussion Prioritization Tool (DPT), System Usability Scale (SUS) (score on a 10-item scale, with a total score ranging from 0-100; a higher score corresponds to greater usability). We will deem the tool usable if our mean SUS score among the 10 patients enrolled is \>68., 2 Months
Given the complexity of adjuvant chemotherapy decision making for older adults with breast cancer, enhancing support and promoting treatment discussions in the context of patient's goals and preferences is an important need. With this need in mind, the investigators have completed interviews with patients with cancer patients who are considering adjuvant therapy. As a result of these interviews, the investigators have developed a common list of attributes (variables found to be important in decision making) that were used to create the Discussion Prioritization Tool (DPT) using Conjoint Analysis (CA) methodology. CA which is a method that can assess the relative importance that patients place on different aspects of care by asking patients to make a series of trade-offs between competing options. The purpose of this study is to assess the usability of a Discussion Prioritization Tool, administered through a tablet, laptop, or computer, for its ability to aid in treatment decision-making. The investigators would like to gather feedback from individuals to improve and adapt the communication tool.
