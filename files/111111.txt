Construction and Application of Precise Health Education Model for Patients With PICC Tube
1. In this study, the risk factors leading to catheter-related complications in the daily life behavior habits of patients with PICC catheter were identified, refined and initially established, and the Delphi method (expert consultation method) was used to further identify the existing and potential risk factors leading to PICC catheter-related complications in the daily life behavior habits of patients. To develop individualized and precise health education programs for risk factors, in order to build an accurate health education model centered on improving patients' daily life and behavior habits.
2. To conduct clinical empirical study to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of precise health education program for PICC patients with catheter, and to observe the impact of this health education model on the knowledge, attitude and practice level of daily management, self-management efficacy and the incidence of related complications after catheter insertion in PICC patients, so as to provide a reference for health education of PICC patients.
Tumor Chemotherapy Patients
BEHAVIORAL: Routine health education|BEHAVIORAL: Routine health education + precise health education
Incidence of complications associated with PICC catheter, It is determined by PICC specialist nurse/sonographer during each patient maintenance, Six cycles of chemotherapy,Each chemotherapy cycle lasted 28 days
Knowledge, attitude and practice score of daily management of patients with PICC tube, Through the results of PICC daily management knowledge, attitude and practice questionnaire, the scores of daily management knowledge, attitude and practice before and after intervention were analyzed and compared between the two groups, Patients before catheterization and after 6 cycles of chemotherapy|Scores of self-management efficacy of patients with PICC tube, Through the results of self-management efficacy questionnaire of patients with PICC tube, the scores of self-management efficacy before and after intervention were analyzed and compared between the two groups., A total of 6 chemotherapy cycles were observed before catheterization and after each chemotherapy cycle (28 days)|Satisfaction of health education of patients with PICC tube, Through the results of the health education satisfaction questionnaire of patients with PICC tube, the satisfaction of the two groups of patients with health education after intervention was analyzed and compared., A total of 6 chemotherapy cycles were observed before catheterization and after each chemotherapy cycle (28 days)
