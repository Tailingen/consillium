C-SSRS is a clinician-administered questionnaire designed to solicit occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related ideation and behaviors. Total score ranges from 1 to 10, score of 0 was assigned (0="no event that can be assessed based on C-SSRS"). Higher total scores indicate greater severity. Maximum score assigned for each participant was summarized into one of 3 categories: no suicidal ideation or behavior (0), suicidal ideation (1 to 5): higher score indicates more suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior (6 to 10): higher score indicates more suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation includes participants who did not have suicidal ideation or behavior at baseline and had suicidal ideation without behavior at some time point post-baseline.

Change From Baseline in Total Myasthenia Gravis - Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) Score Over Time, The MG-ADL was used to assess the participant's MG symptom severity. It assesses eight functions (talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, impairment of ability to brush teeth or comb hair, impairment of ability to arise from a chair, double vision, and eyelid droop) which were rated on a 4-point scale: 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment). The total score is the sum of the eight function scores and ranges from 0 to 24.

MG-ADL was used to assess the participant's MG symptom severity. It assesses eight functions (talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, impairment of ability to brush teeth or comb hair, impairment of ability to arise from a chair, double vision, and eyelid droop) which were rated on a 4-point scale: 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment). The total score is the sum of the eight function scores and ranges from 0 to 24. Higher scores indicated greater symptom severity/difficulty in performing daily living activities., Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, End of treatment (EoT) (up to 253 days post-baseline), Follow-up (up to 257 days post-baseline)|Change From Baseline in Total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score Over Time, The QMG test was used to assess the participant's strength. The quantitative results of each of the 13 strength components were mapped to a 4-point scale where 0 equals to (=) none, 1= mild, 2= moderate and 3= severe. The total score is the sum of the 13 scale scores and ranges from 0 to 39. Higher scores indicated more severe impairment., Baseline up to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, End of Treatment (EoT) (up to 253 days post-baseline), Follow-up (up to 257 days post-baseline)|Change From Baseline in Total Revised Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life - 15 Scale (MG-QoL15r) Score Over Time, The MG-QoL15r was used to assess the participant's limitations related to living with MG. It consists of 15 questions and each of the 15 questions were rated by the participant on a 3-point scale (0= Not at all, 1= somewhat, 2=very much) based on a recall period of "over the past few weeks". The total score is the sum of the 15 question scores and ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicated more limitation., Baseline up to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, End of Treatment (EoT) (up to 253 days post-baseline), Follow-up (up to 257 days post-baseline)|Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Rating Score Over Time, The CGI-S scale is the clinician/physician's global assessment of participants illness severity of MG and is rated by answering on 8-point scale. Considering total clinical experience, participant is assessed on severity of illness according to: 0=not performed; 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline illness; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among most extremely ill patients.

The CGI-I scale is the clinician/physician's global assessment of the change in severity of the patient's generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) since starting this study. The rating is given on a 7-point scale with lower scores indicating greater improvement (1= Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3 = Minimally improved; 4 = No change; 5 =Minimally worse; 6 = Much worse; 7 = Very much worse. Values of 0 (not assessed) were excluded from analysis. Higher score indicates more severity., Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, End of Treatment (EoT) (up to 253 days post-baseline), Follow-up (up to 257 days post-baseline)|Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Classification Score Over Time, Number of participants with change from baseline in MGFA classification score over time were reported. The MGFA was used to assess the participant's MG severity. MGFA classification identifies the subgroup participants with MG who share distinct clinical features or severity of disease: Class I (ocular MG), classes II, III and IV generalized MG with mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively; Class V MG crisis. Separate subclasses under classes II, III and IV are designed: "a" if the predominant weakness is affecting limb/axial weakness or both; subclass "b" if the predominant weakness is affecting oropharyngeal or respiratory muscles or both. In the MGFA classification, lower roman numerals mean less severity. Changes in MGFA classification (regardless of subclass) are categorized as "Improved" (example, III to II), "Same" (example, II to II), or "Worsened" (example, II to III)., Weeks 8, 24 and End of Treatment (EoT) (up to 253 days post-baseline)|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) to Nipocalimab, Number of participants with ADA to nipocalimab were reported.

Neutralizing antibodies to nipocalimab were assessed using a non-cell based competitive ligand binding ECLIA assay., Up to 257 days post-baseline|Change From Baseline in Serum Immunoglobulin (Ig)G Concentration Over Time, Change from baseline in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G concentration over time was reported., Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, up to 253 days post-baseline, up to 257 days post-baseline
