Risk-adapted Therapy for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
In a protocol of treatment of AML used in 1994 for adults with AML up to the age of 50 years, the Spanish CETLAM group showed a complete remission rate 75 % using the combination of daunorubicin (60 mg/m2, 3 days) plus conventional dose cytarabine (100mg/m2/day in continuous infusion during 7 days) and etoposide (100mg/m2 IV/day 3 days). If idarubicin (10 mg/m2, 3 days) was administered instead of daunorubicin, the complete remission (CR) rate in adults up to 60 years was 75%. To improve the proportion of CRs and to decrease relapse rate appearing in 50% of patients, the phase II AML-99 trial includes intermediate dose-cytarabine during induction and risk-adapted post remission treatment based on the improvement in prognostic characterization of AML and the implementation of novel transplantation techniques.

Evaluations of minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry during and after treatment., Study of the immunophenotypic characteristics of the leukemic population at diagnosis and evaluation of MRD during different treatment phases and follow-up., 4 years.|Feasibility to mobilize and collect autologous PBSC after consolidation phase., Evaluation of mobilization failures., 6 months.|Evaluations of the CD34+ cell selection procedure and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)transplantation outcome., CD34+ cell selection from PBSC of HLA-identical siblings.

Induction chemotherapy: idarubicin (12mg/m2/day intravenous), intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h, intravenous) and etoposide (100mg/m2/day, intravenous) in 3+7+3 schedule. This induction therapy is repeated if complete remission (CR) is not achieved after the first course of treatment.

Consolidation therapy: mitoxantrone (12mg/m2/day, intravenous, days 4, 5 and 6) and intermediate-dose cytarabine (500mg/m2/12h from day 1 to 6).

Risk-stratification according to cytogenetics, courses to CR and availability of an HLA-identical sibling:

* Patients in the favorable cytogenetics group \[t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16)\] are treated with high-dose cytarabine (3g/m2/12h, intravenous, days 1, 3 and 5).
* Patients in intermediate cytogenetics group (normal karyotype and a single course to achieve the CR) receive an autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant, regardless of having an HLA-identical sibling.
* The remaining patients are considered in the high-risk group and are treated with autologous or allogeneic PBSC transplantation depending on the availability of a sibling donor. In allotransplants, CD34+ cell selection of hematopoietic cells is performed.
