EBUS TBNA After PET/CT in Diagnosing Patients With Stage I-IIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Evaluated for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
This clinical trial studies how well endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) after positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan works in diagnosing patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer evaluated for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Performing EBUS-TBNA after PET/CT scan may help doctors learn more about the accuracy and ways to find early stage lung cancer.

PROCEDURE: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)
Lymphnode Staging Accuracy, The use of EBUS-TBNA after a PET/CT as a means of improving the accuracy of lymphnode staging in patients considered for SBRT estimated as the proportion of patients identified concordantly as having N0 disease with both PET/CT and EBUS-TBNA., 1 day
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the use of EBUS-TBNA after a PET/CT as a means of improving the accuracy of lymph node staging in patients considered for SBRT.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the usefulness of PET/CT as a diagnostic test in identifying N1 versus N0 staging.

II. To compare survival and recurrence rates in patients with discordant PET/CT and EBUS-TBNA.

III. To describe EBUS-TBNA and SBRT related complications.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo EBUS-TBNA before SBRT.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, then every 3 months for the first 2 years then twice a year for the following 3 years, and annually thereafter.
