CONVIVO System to Discriminate Healthy Tissues vs Tumor Tissues During Brain Tumor Resection
The purpose of the study is to do a direct comparison of the CONVIVO system (camera imaging device) with our normal Stanford pathology process. CONVIVO system is being tested to see if the device creates the images very quickly by touching a special camera to the surgical wound.
Brain Tumor
DEVICE: CONVIVO Confocal Endomicroscopy System
Feasibility of using the CONVIVO imaging system to identify tumor tissue identified by the operating surgeon, Feasibility is defined as a match between the pathologist determination of a mock diagnosis of type of tumor using CONVIVO images of the planned resection area and the pathologist's cryosection-derived diagnosis used in the course of surgery. This outcome will be expressed as a number without dispersion., 12 months
Average time needed for tissue visualization with the CONVIVO system as compared to standard cryosectioning, Time for tissue visualization with CONVIVO system: defined as the total number of minutes from start of imaging device use to mock diagnosis. This is calculated by summing the number of minutes from the start of imaging device use to the end of imaging device use in the operating room and the number of minutes from the neuropathologist's start of image review to arrival at a mock diagnosis.

Time for standard cryosectioning: defined as the total number of minutes required for standard cryosectioning. This is calculated by summing the number of minutes from when the operating surgeon contacts the neuropathology department to request a frozen section analysis of tissue and ends when the neuropathology department calls the operating room with a suspected diagnosis, as measured by study personnel present in the operating room during the surgery, 12 months|Ability of the CONVIVO system capture a readable image, A readable image is defined as an image from which a neuropathologist can make a mock diagnosis. This will be reported as a number without dispersion., 12 months
Primary Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using the CONVIVO imaging system to identify tumor type.

Secondary Objective: The secondary objectives are to determine the average time needed for tissue visualization with the CONVIVO system as compared to standard cryosectioning, and to describe the ability of the CONVIVO imaging

-To describe the ability of the CONVIVO imaging system to generate readable images.
