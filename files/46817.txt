ctDNA-based Minimal Residual Disease Detection for Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Short-term relapse and poor survival are prevalent in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) after surgeries. Despite the importance of adjuvant treatments for resected PAAD patients, there is currently no suitable biomarker to identify those individuals with high risk of recurrence and inform therapeutic decision making. In this study, we aim to examine whether postoperative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could be used as a biomarker for early detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) and predicting relapse in resected PAAD through high-depth targeted next-generation sequencing.
