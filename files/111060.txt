Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab for Lung Adenocarcinoma With Asymptomatic Brain Metastatic
Brain metastasis of lung cancer is one of the most important metastasis pathways in patients with life-threatening diseases. This study explore the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab combining with platinum-containing drug chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of Lung Adenocarcinoma With Asymptomatic Brain Metastatic. Meanwhile, Related biomarkers were explored to provide theoretical basis for efficacy evaluation and resistance mechanism.
