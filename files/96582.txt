Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived Natural Killer Cells Therapy for Refractory and Relaps Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
This is a clinical study on the use of iNK cells for the treatment of refractory relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: iNK cells
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, 12 months|MRD negative rate, 12 months|Progression-free Survival, 12 months|Overall survival, 12 months
Determination of chimerism of iNK cells in peripheral blood of subject., 12 months
Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system and could recognize and kill a wide range of cells in distress, particularly tumour cells and cells infected with viruses. Induced pluripotent setm cells(iPSCs) derived NK cells have better proliferative capacity and homogeneity than donor peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood derived NK cells. We conduct this clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INK cells in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and our purpose is to find new treatment option.
