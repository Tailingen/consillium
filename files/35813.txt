Dopamine D2 Receptors(D2R) Imaging in Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma(NFPA)
To study the in vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma and the predictive role of dopamine dopamine D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists（DA）.
Pituitary Adenoma
DRUG: Drug treatment|OTHER: Surgery
Change from baseline on tumor volume, Change from baseline on tumor volume measured by enhanced pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging（MRI）.

Record the tumor volume from enhanced pituitary MRI on every 3 month follow-up visit., Up to 6 months]
Change from baseline of visual acuity, Record the Visual acuity on every 3 month follow-up visit., Up to 6 months|Change from visual field scale, 2.Record the Visual field scale on every 3 month follow-up visit, 0 = normal, no vision loss; 1 = one quadrant vision loss; 2 = two quadrants of vision loss; 3 = three quadrants of vision loss; 4 = four quadrants of vision loss but retain a central tubular vision; 5 = blind, Up to 6 months
Dopamine agonists are the first line therapy for prolactinoma,which are also effective in some cases of other subtypes of pituitary tumors. It had been showed that dopamine agonists inhibit prolactin secretion by binding to and activating dopamine D2 receptors. PET-MR combined MR images with PET function images is substantial to evaluate the expression of dopamine D2 receptors.The aim is to study the in vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in prolactinoma and the predictive role of dopamine D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists.
