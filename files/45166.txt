This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 basket study to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STI-3031, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with selected RRSTs. All participants will receive STI-3031 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) via IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes.
