A Study of DXC008 in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
This is a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD, DLT, RP2D, the PK characteristics, preliminary anti-tumor activity, the immunogenicity of DXC008 in patients with prostate cancer and other solid tumors such as Ewing sarcoma.
