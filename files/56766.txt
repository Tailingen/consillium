Neuropsychology of Financial Capacity
The present project aims to investigate the financial capacity in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease or parkinsonism, brain tumor (glioma or meningioma) and cerebrovascular lesion (stroke), in order to evaluate the presence and degree of impairment, and the role of some factors as potential predictors of financial incapacity.

The term 'financial capacity' means both operations relating, for example, to asset management or investing money, and activities of daily life such as shopping or using small sums of money; these activities are mediated by different cognitive functions, from numerical and arithmetic skills to decision making. Financial capacity is, in fact, an instrumental activity of daily life (i.e. Instrumental Activity Of Daily Living, I-ADL) whose impairment negatively affects the functional autonomy of the individual, so as to be subject to legal protection.

To assess financial capacity, the Numerical Activities of Daily Living - Financial (NADL-F; Arcara et al., 2017) will be administered, a battery of tests aimed at investigating both financial performance and financial competence according to the most recent neuropsychological models proposed in the literature.
