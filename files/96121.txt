Sorafenib Maintenance for Prophylaxis of Leukemia Relapse in Allo-HSCT Recipients With FLT3 Negative Acute Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT in FLT3-negative acute leukemia patients.

Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that blocks multiple pathways involved in the development and progression of acute leukemia, such as FLT3-ITD, the RAS and RAF gene families, KIT, and the VEGF and PDGF receptors. Recently, two back-to-back randomized controlled trials both reveal that sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT could prevent relapse in patients with FLT3-ITD AML, resulting in a survival benefit. Sorafenib has also been explored in the treatment of acute leukemia without FLT3 mutations and shown promising results. Currently, relapse remains the major cause of transplant failure, especially for high-risk and refractory acute leukemia patients. Once patients relapse after allo-HSCT, the prognosis is dismal. Therefore, prevention of relapse is of great importance to improve the prognosis. Based on the current research status, we plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy and safety of sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT in FLT3-negative acute leukemia patients.
