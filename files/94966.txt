This is a Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Combination Therapies with FWD1802 in Subjects with ER-positive/HER2-negative Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer Stage I|Breast Cancer Stage II|Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (LABC)|ER+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: FWD1802|DRUG: Palbociclib 125mg|DRUG: Ribociclib 200Mg Oral Tablet|DRUG: Abemaciclib 150 MG|DRUG: Everolimus 10 mg
Phase Ib- Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)., Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)., Approximately 1.5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Number and proportion of participants experiencing any treatment-emergent adverse event during the study period.

Assessment criteria: Events will be categorized as "related" or "unrelated" to study drug based on investigator's causality assessment.

Reporting format: Frequency counts and percentages stratified by severity grade (Grade 1-5 as per NCI-CTCAE v5.0)., Approximately 2 years|Severity Grading of Adverse Events, Maximum severity grade of treatment-emergent adverse events experienced by participants.

Assessment tool: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0.

Reporting format: Proportion of participants with events in each severity category (Grade 1=mild; Grade 2=moderate; Grade 3=severe; Grade 4=life-threatening; Grade 5=death)., Approximately 2 years|Clinically Significant Abnormalities in 12-Lead ECG Parameters, Number of participants with clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram parameters from baseline.

Assessed parameters: QTc interval, PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate., Approximately 2 years|Vital Sign Abnormalities, Proportion of participants with clinically significant deviations in vital signs:

Parameters: Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (bpm), respiratory rate (breaths/min), body temperature (°C)., Approximately 2 years|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Incidence, Approximately 2 years|Phase II- Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1., Approximately 2 years
Phase Ib- PK Assessment-Tmax, Time to Cmax (Tmax)., Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- PK Assessment-Cmax, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- PK Assessment-AUC0-t, Area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- PK Assessment-AUC0-inf, The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf), Approximately 1.5 years|Phase Ib- PK Assessment-t1/2, elimination half-life time (t1/2), Approximately 1.5 years|Efficacy Assessment-ORR, Tumor response assessments by the corresponding criteria by RECIST v1.1 to assess Objective response rate (ORR), Approximately 2 years|Efficacy Assessment-CBR, Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Approximately 2 years|Efficacy Assessment-DOR, Duration of response (DoR）, Approximately 2 years|Efficacy Assessment-DCR, Disease control rate (DCR), Approximately 1.5 years|Efficacy Assessment-PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) by IRC according to RECIST 1.1.PFS is defined as time from the first dose until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 2 years|Efficacy Assessment-OS, Overall survival (OS).OS is defined as time from date of the first dose to date of death due to any cause., Approximately 2 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters:Plasma Concentration at Each Sampling Time Point., Approximately 2 years
