Sentinel Node Mapping in Women With Endometrial and Cervical Cancer
The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of applying the SLN mapping technique in combination with FDG-PET/CT imaging in women with high-risk histology endometrial cancer and in patients with cervical cancer tumour size 2-4 cm.
