A Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ABBV-744 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Cancer
This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation (Segment 1) and expansion (Segment 2) study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-744 in participants with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: ABBV-744
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-744, Cmax of ABBV-744., Through Cycle 2 ( each cycle is 28 days)|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of ABBV-744, Tmax of ABBV-744., Through Cycle 2 ( each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt) of ABBV-744, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt) of ABBV-744., Through Cycle 2 ( each cycle is 28 days)|Terminal Phase Elimination Rate Constant (β) of ABBV-744, Terminal Phase Elimination Rate Constant (β) of ABBV-744., Through Cycle 2 ( each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) of ABBV-744, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) of ABBV-744., Through Cycle 2 ( each cycle is 28 days)|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABBV-744, DLT events are defined as clinically significant adverse events or abnormal laboratory values assessed as unrelated to disease progression, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and occurring during the first 4 weeks after administration of the first dose and that meets additional criteria as described in the protocol., Up to 28 days after first dose of study drug|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for ABBV-744, The MTD is defined as the highest dose for which the estimated posterior mean DLT rate is \<= 33% and excessive toxicity probability is limited to maximum of 25% during the first 28 days., Up to 28 days after first dose of study drug|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) for ABBV-744, RPTD will be determined from a review available safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data during the dose escalation phase (Segment 1) of the study., Up to 28 days after first dose of study drug
Composite complete remission (CRc), Percentage of participants who achieve composite complete remission (CRc), comprised of complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) is based on the International Working Group (IWG) criteria and European Leukemia Net criteria., Up to 2 years|Complete Remission (CR) + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), Percentage of participants who achieve CR + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) is based on the International Working Group (IWG) criteria and European Leukemia Net criteria., Up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants who achieve ORR \[composite complete remission (CRc) + Partial remission (PR)\] is based on the International Working Group (IWG) criteria (CRc, PR) and European Leukemia Net criteria., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the number of days from the date of first response to the first occurrence of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Event-free survival (EFS), Percentage of participants who achieve EFS, where EFS is defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of primary refractory disease, relapse from CR or CRi, or death from any cause., Up to 2 years
