Cardiac Rehabilitation Program on the Prevention of Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment With Anthracyclines and/or Trastuzumab
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a cardiac rehabilitation protocol, incorporating aerobic and resistance exercise, in reducing the incidence of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients receiving treatment with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab through a randomized, active control group, open-label clinical trial.
Cancer Therapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction

Incidence of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure as a manifestation of cardiovascular toxicity in the intervention group and control group, Calculate the incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline and/or trastuzumab treatment of two groups following the 2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) definitions for cancer-related therapy cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). LVEF greater than 50% with a relative GLS decrease exceeding 15% and/or a new rise in cardiac biomarkers. LVEF will be determined using Simpson's biplane method, incorporating apical four- and two-chamber views, while 2D-GLS measurements will be performed via velocity vector imaging. All echocardiographic evaluations will be conducted using a Siemens-Acuson 2000 system by a single expert in echocardiography, with results subsequently verified by a second expert to ensure accuracy and reliability. The classification of symptomatic congestive heart failure encompasses, but is not limited to, the presence of one or more of the following clinical manifestations: moist crackles in the lungs, bilateral anterior tibial edema, or lip cyanosis., From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen
Impact on echocardiographic parameters, This study aims to evaluate cardiac function by examining changes in echocardiographic parameters, including chamber volumes, diameters, diastolic function, right ventricular function, and both biventricular and auricular global longitudinal strain (GLS)., From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen|Modification in series of circulating cardiac biomarkers, Classical biomarkers of cardiac injury: C-reactive protein, Troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP)., From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen|Evaluation of cardiorespiratory performance, The study will investigate modifications in cardiorespiratory fitness by measuring peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) through a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) conducted on a bicycle ergometer with individualized workload adjustments., From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen|Quality of Life Questionnaire: FACT-B, Investigators should evaluate the quality of life of the patient with QOL questionnaire (FACT-B), From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen|Explore the role of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, This research will explore the role of conventional cardiovascular risk factors-including smoking, lipid levels, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sedentary behavior, and the Framingham risk score-as potential mediators in the development of cardiotoxicity., From 1 week before starting oncological treatment to 1 year after the start of the chemotherapy regimen
This is a randomized, open-label, with an active control group trial. This study adopts the main evaluation indicator being the incidence of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure as a manifestation of cardiovascular toxicity, assessed following the 2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) definitions for cancer-related therapy cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD).

Participants who pass the inclusion criteria through research will provide written informed consent to take part in the study. Once consent is obtained, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups using a simple randomization process. This will be accomplished through a computer-generated random number sequence list, which will be managed by a designated investigator from the research team. The intervention group will receive standard oncological treatment combined with an aerobic and resistance exercise program, following the FITT principle (Frequency, Intensity, Type, and Time) for exercise prescription. Three out of five weekly sessions will be conducted per week. The control group will continue standard oncological treatment in addition to general recommendations regarding diet and physical activity but without a structured exercise protocol. During the treatment process, both branches of the trial will be followed over a 12 months period, with scheduled outpatient evaluations to assess biochemical parameters, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Both the intervention and control groups will undergo these assessments at four key time points: baseline (defined as the time before the start of the chemotherapy regime and after the study enrollment), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-initiation of chemotherapy. The main outcome of this clinical trial is a composite of incident cardiotoxicity, defined according to the ESC guidelines. Other cardiac function related indicators such as symptomatic congestive heart failure or asymptomatic but decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or global longitudinal strain (GLS) and changes in cardiac biomarkers will be evaluated to determine the occurrence of cardiac toxicity. Secondary outcomes assessed the impact on echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function, fluctuations in biomarkers and blood tests, cardiorespiratory performance, the impact of quality of life and explore the role of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
