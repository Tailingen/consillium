Hepatocellular Carcinoma Imaging Using PSMA PET/CT
The purpose of the research is to evaluate the use of a PSMA PET/CT (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography) scan in the diagnosis of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and comparing it to standard scanning techniques with CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL
True Positive Rate per patient, The probability that HCC is present when the PSMA-PET/CT test result is positive on a per patient basis., 6 months|True Negative Rate per patient, The probability that HCC is absent when the PSMA-PET/CT test result is negative on a per patient basis., 6 months|True Positive Rate per lesion, The probability that HCC is present when the PSMA-PET/CT test result is positive on a per lesion basis., 6 months|True Negative Rate per lesion., The probability that HCC is absent when the PSMA-PET/CT test result is negative on a per lesion basis., 6 months
PSMA uptake, Qualitative uptake of PSMA measured on a per lesion basis., 6 months|Maximum standard uptake value, Maximum standard uptake value of lesions on PSMA PET/CT., 6 months|CT LIRADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) Score, LI RADS Score for CT lesions., 6 months|PSMA expression., Expression of PSMA per lesion., 6 months|GLUT-1 expression, Expression of GLUT 1 per lesion., 6 months
A total of 30 patients will be recruited in this prospective pilot study who have HCC on imaging criteria (LI-RADS 5) for surgical resection, or patients with indeterminate liver lesions (LI-RADS 3 or 4) planned for liver biopsy. 18F-DCFPYL PSMA PET/CT will be performed prior to the planned surgery or liver biopsy
