Oncorine (H101) Combined With Tislelizumab and Chemotherapy in Previously Untreated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single-arm, single-centre phase II study to evaluate the efficacy (PFS, ORR, DCR) and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 in combination with tirelizumab and platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are EGFR/ALK negative. The study is divided into 2 phases.
Untreated Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Recombinant human adenovirus type 5 injection (H101) combined with tirilizumab and platinum-containing two-drug chemotherapy
The time from the date of first treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever event occurs first., Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigators according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 1 year
Proportion of CR and PR in all patients., Objective response rate: ORR, 1 year|Proportion of CR, PR and SD in all patients., Disease control rate: DCR, 1 year|Safety statistics will be analysed for adverse events., Safety statistics will be analysed for adverse events, including AEs, SAEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to dose adjustments, and AEs leading to withdrawal from the trial.All adverse events will also be rated based on the NCI CTCAE version 5.0, and AEs greater than or equal to grade 3 will be statistically summarised., 1 year
Phase 1 is a preliminary exploration of safety and efficacy. The safety and efficacy of the regimen was assessed in the 10 patients enrolled for interim analysis. Phase 2 will continue to expand the sample size to assess the efficacy and safety of the regimen, with 20 patients planned to be enrolled.
