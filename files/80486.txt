Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI regimen|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|DRUG: oxaliplatin
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil followed by irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil in terms of progression free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Evaluate these treatment regimens in terms of overall survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 4 courses of oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Following the initial 4 courses of therapy, patients receive 4 courses of irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed every 8 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-39 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
