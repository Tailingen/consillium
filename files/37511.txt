The Efficacy and Safety of HLX07 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)
Following basal cell carcinoma, Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) is the most common skin cancer and its incidence remains on a steady rise. The vast majority of CSCC lesions are treated with surgical resection and have a cure rate exceeding 90 percent in early-stage disease. In stark contrast, the 5-year overall survival rate is below 50% for locally advanced patients and less than 10 percent for those with distant metastases. Although the commonly used cisplatin-based combination chemotherapies may achieve an overall response rate of up to 80%, the efficacy is usually not durable. Moreover, the use of chemotherapy is limited due to the many adverse events, especially in elderly patients, who are the largest population of concern for CSCC. The purpose of this study was to assess safety, efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic CSCC given HLX07 (Recombinant Humanized Anti-EGFR Monoclonal Antibody Injection).
