A Study of Atezolizumab Compared With Gemcitabine Plus (+) Cisplatin or Carboplatin for PD-L1-Selected Participants With Stage IV Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (IMpower111)
This randomized, open-label study was designed to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab with gemcitabine + cisplatin or carboplatin in PD-L1 selected participants with chemotherapy-naive, Stage IV squamous NSCLC. The study was closed due to low patient enrollment and the Sponsor's decision to include patients with squamous NSCLC into the GO29431 study, NCT02409342. Therefore the planned objectives of this study are no longer applicable and formal analyses of efficacy or safety have not been performed.
