Modulation of Autophagy in Patients With Advanced/Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer - Phase II
The purpose of this study is to examine the combination of one standard treatment for lung cancer plus an additional drug, hydroxychloroquine. The standard treatment for lung cancer being used includes 2 chemotherapy drugs, called paclitaxel and carboplatin. Some patients who have a specific type of lung cancer can also receive another drug, a drug that targets blood vessels, called bevacizumab (also known as avastin). Hydroxychloroquine is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosis.

Antitumor Activity, as Measured by Tumor Response Rate of Hydroxychloroquine, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Bevacizumab (for Eligible Patients) in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent NSCLC Cancer, Assessed using RECIST criteria. Determined using a Simon's two-stage minimax design with a 5% significance level and 80% power., 6 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were calculated. The median survival times and 95% confidence intervals are presented., 6 years
