A Prospective Cohort Study of Myasthenia Gravis in China
The goal of this prospective cohort study is to investigate long-term therapeutic strategies for myasthenia gravis (MG) and identify potential biomarkers. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Whether low-dose oral steroids may lead to a reduction in the recurrence rate among patients with MG.
2. To identify potential biomarkers that can predict disease progression and prognosis.

This study recruits well-controlled patients with MG. Based on patient preferences and considerations such as coexisting conditions (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, severe osteoporosis, obesity), the participants will be non-randomly divided into two groups: a maintenance steroid therapy group and a withdrawal group (withdraw all immunosuppresants). Subsequently, these groups of patients will undergo long-term follow-up assessments.
Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: Steroid Drug|OTHER: Withdraw all immunosuppresants
Relapse of myasthenia gravis, One of the following three is met: (1) MGFA Postintervention Status: failure to maintain MMS (minimal manifestations status) or better. (2) Myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score â‰¥ 3; (3) Re-administration of cholinesterase inhibitors was required after achieving Complete Stable Remission (CSR) on the MGFA Postintervention Status., Within two years after recruitment
Time of relapse, The time between recruitment and relapse of MG., Within two years after recruitment|Change of MG assessment scales at relapse, Change of MG assessment scales at relapse, including MGFA PIS (Postintervention Status), MG-ADL (myasthenia gravis activities of daily living), QMG (Quantitative Myasthenia gravis) and MGC (Myasthenia gravis composite)., Within two years after recruitment|Adverse events of steroids, Using CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) to assess Adverse events., Within two years after recruitment
