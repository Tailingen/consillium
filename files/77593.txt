A Study of BMS-986416 With and Without Nivolumab in Select Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, drug effects, drug levels and preliminary antitumor activity of BMS-986416 when administered alone and in combination with Nivolumab in participants with select advanced solid tumors.
