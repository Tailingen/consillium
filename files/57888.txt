Regorafenib in Bevacizumab Refractory Recurrent Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Regorafenib in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM) who have progressed on bevacizumab. Regorafenib is FDA approved administered as monotherapy during the study.

22 total patients are expected to participate in this study. Even though a participant may meet all the criteria for participation, it is possible that they will not be enrolled in this study.
