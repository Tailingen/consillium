CCI-779 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: temsirolimus
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the anti-tumor activity of CCI-779, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with metastatic melanoma.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
