Study of Neoadjuvant Enfortumab Vedotin and Pembrolizumab in Cisplatin-eligible Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer
This trial is a multi-site, single-arm, phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab in cisplatin-eligible patients with high-grade localized/locally advanced cT1-4 N0-1 M0 upper tract urothelial cancer who are deemed eligible for curative-intent surgery (radical nephroureterectomy or distal ureterectomy) followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Enfortumab vedotin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Efficacy of the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in cisplatin-eligible patients based off pathological response, This trial will estimate the efficacy of combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab given as neoadjuvant therapy in cisplatin-eligible patients with localized/locally advanced upper tract urothelial cancer (cT2-4 N0-1 M0) followed by definitive surgery. The historic pT0/Ta/Tis/T1 (termed 'response' herein) rate with definitive surgery alone for a comparable patient population (H0) is approximately 20%. This study targets an improvement of 20% in the response proportion to a target 40% response rate (H1) with the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab. Patients who are unable to undergo definitive surgery within 16 weeks from the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be considered non-responders for the primary endpoint., up to 16 weeks post last neoadjuvant study drug (at time of surgery)
Assess the safety and toxicity of the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in UTUC, CTCAE v5 criteria will be used to assess the safety and toxicity of combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab in eligible UTUC patients. Safety and toxicity will be reported in all patients who receive treatment with any therapy on trial. Toxicity by grade and attribution will be described using counts and proportions., up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Assess whether patients who receive the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy have increased surgical complications., Surgical complications will be assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification. Grade 1 to Grade 5 (Grade 1 being no deviation and Grade 5 being death)., up to 12 weeks after surgery|Estimate secondary measures of efficacy of neoadjuvant combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy (if tolerated) in response evaluable patients with UTUC by measuring RECIST v1.1 measurable disease., Overall response in the subset of patients with RECIST v1.1 measurable disease in response evaluable patients with UTUC who receive neoadjuvant combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab will be measured. The ORR (Overall Response Rate) will be calculated from the partial responses and complete responses in the subset of subjects with have RECIST 1.1 measurable disease at baseline., up to 2 years post surgery|Estimate secondary measures of efficacy of neoadjuvant combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy (if tolerated) in response evaluable patients with UTUC by measuring 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS)., 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) proportions and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods., up to 2 years post surgery|Estimate secondary measures of efficacy of neoadjuvant combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy (if tolerated) in response evaluable patients with UTUC by measuring 2-year overall survival (OS)., 2-year overall survival (OS) proportions and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods., up to 2 years post surgery|Estimate the number of patients who are able to complete neoadjuvant combination enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab and safely complete definitive surgery., Failure to undergo surgery at all or within 16 weeks from the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy. The number of patients and associated proportion who are unable to undergo definitive surgery within 16 weeks from last dose of neoadjuvant therapy or at all will be reported., up to 16 weeks post last neoadjuvant study drug
Assess comprehensive profiling of tumor and host characteristics (including genomics and assessment of tumor mutational burden) as predictors of response to treatment., Integrative Next Generation Sequencing: We plan to perform integrative Next Generation Sequencing by the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology (MCTP) including but not limited to RNA-seq, PD-L1 status by the 22C3 assay, and tumor mutational burden assessment from tissue obtained at the time of diagnosis or surgery to correlate with response to treatment. Optional tumor biopsy at recurrence may be obtained for integrative next generation sequencing, up to 2 years post surgery|Explore circulating biomarkers as early detectors of cancer recurrence, Early detection of cancer recurrence, ResBio ctDNA will be obtained prior to starting neoadjuvant therapy (cycle 1, day 1), on the last day of neoadjuvant therapy (cycle 4, day 8), after surgery at 4-6 weeks, after surgery at 12 weeks then at 3 month intervals for 24 months (after surgery)., up to 2 years post surgery
