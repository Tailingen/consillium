Radical Resection Vs. Ablative Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Patients With Operable Stage I NSCLC
Rationale: Surgery remains the standard of care for stage 1 (T1-2a N0)non-small cell lung cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a newer radiation treatment that gives fewer but higher and possibly more effective doses of radiation than standard radiation. This technique may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known whether stereotactic body radiation therapy is more effective than surgery in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

Purpose: The primary aim of this randomized phase II trial is to determine if the efficacy of SBRT is comparable to that of standard surgical interventions for patients with T1N0 non-small cell lung cancer.

Percentage of Participants Alive Without Local-regional Failure at Two Years (Local-regional Tumor Control), Local-regional failure (LRF) is defined differently for each arm. LRF after RODS is defined as recurrence, defined by CT, confirmed by PET/CT whenever possible, i.e., development of tumor masses at site of resection, hilum (N1 nodal region), mediastinum (N2-N3 nodes), ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors (N3 nodes), or within 3 cm of the staple line of RODS. LRF after SBRT is defined as tumor progression on CT per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, confirmed by positron PET/CT, within same lobe, hilum (N1 nodes), mediastinum (N2-N3 nodes), or ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors (N3 nodes), or within 3 cm of original planning target volume (PTV). Local-regional control time is defined as time from randomization to the date of first LRF, death, or last known follow-up (censored), whichever occurred first. Rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From date of randomization to two years
Overall Survival (Percentage of Participants Alive), Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The distribution of DFS estimates between the two arms is compared using the log rank test. Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Two-year rates are provided., From date of randomization to date of death or last follow-up. Maximum follow-up was 7.0 years.|Percentage of Participants With Local-regional Failure (LRF), LRF rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. LRF is defined differently for each arm. LRF after RODS is defined as recurrence, defined by CT, confirmed by PET/CT whenever possible, i.e., development of tumor masses at site of resection, hilum (N1 nodal region), mediastinum (N2-N3 nodes), ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors (N3 nodes), or within 3 cm of the staple line of RODS. LRF after SBRT is defined as tumor progression on CT per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, confirmed by PET/CT, within same lobe, hilum (N1 nodes), mediastinum (N2-N3 nodes), or ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors (N3 nodes), or within 3 cm of original PTV. LRF time is defined as time from randomization to the date of first LRF, last known follow-up (censored), or death without LRF (competing risk), whichever occurred first. Two-year rates are provided., From date of randomization to the date of first local-regional failure, death, or last known follow-up, whichever occurred first. Maximum follow-up is 7.0 years.|Percentage of Participants With Distant Failure, Distant failure rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Distant failure is defined as appearance of tumor within another ipsilateral (non-primary) lobe ≥ 2 cm from the original planning target volume (PTV) or distant metastasis, including appearance of tumor deposits characteristic of NSCLC metastasis (chest wall other than incision sites, mediastinal structures/diaphragm, malignant pleural/pericardial effusion), contralateral lung and/or other distant sites. Time to distant failure is defined as time from randomization to the date of first failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without failure (competing risk). Two-year rates are provided., From date of randomization to date of first distant failure, death, or last known follow-up, whichever occurred first. Maximum follow-up was 7.0 years.|Percentage of Participants Alive Without Disease [Disease-free Survival (DFS)], Failure rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, where failure is defined as LRF, DF, or death from any cause. LRF is defined differently for each arm. LRF after RODS is defined as recurrence, defined by CT, confirmed by PET/CT whenever possible, i.e., development of tumor masses at the resection site, hilum, mediastinum, or ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors, or within 3 cm of the staple line of RODS. LRF after SBRT is defined as tumor progression on CT per RECIST criteria, confirmed by PET/CT, within same lobe, hilum, mediastinum, or ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors, or within 3 cm of original PTV. DF is defined as tumor within a non-primary lobe ≥ 2 cm from the original planning target volume or distant metastasis. Failure time is defined as time from randomization to the date of first failure or last known follow-up (censored), whichever occurred first. Two-year rates are provided., From date of randomization to the date of first failure, death, or last known follow-up, whichever occurred first. Maximum follow-up is 7.0 years.|Number of Participants by Failure Site, Local-regional failure (LRF) is defined differently for each arm. LRF after RODS is defined as recurrence, defined by CT, confirmed by PET/CT whenever possible, i.e., development of tumor masses at site of resection, hilum, mediastinum, ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors, or within 3 cm of the staple line of RODS. LRF after SBRT is defined as tumor progression on CT per RECIST criteria, confirmed by PET/CT, within same lobe, hilum, mediastinum, or ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa for upper lobe tumors, or within 3 cm of original planning target volume (PTV). Distant failure is defined as tumor within a non-primary lobe ≥ 2 cm from the original planning target volume or distant metastasis, including tumor deposits characteristic NSCLC metastasis (chest wall other than incision sites, mediastinal structures/diaphragm, malignant pleural/pericardial effusion), contralateral lung and/or other distant sites., From date of randomization to date of last known follow-up. Maximum follow-up was 7.0 years.|Best PET Tumor Response, PET Tumor Response of Irradiated Target Lesions is defined as

* Complete Metabolic Response (CMR): Tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-activity decreased to less than mean background of the aortic arch blood pool.
* Partial Metabolic Response (PMR): At least a 30% decrease in the maximum of relative tumor FDG-activity of target lesions
* Progressive Metabolic Disease (PMD): At least a 20% increase in the maximum of relative tumor FDG-activity of target lesions
