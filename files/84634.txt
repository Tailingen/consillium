This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA) MRX34, in patients with unresectable primary liver cancer or advanced or metastatic cancer with or without liver involvement or hematologic malignancies. MRX34 will be administered daily x 5 with 2 weeks off (total of 21 days) for 3 cycles followed by a no-treatment observation period.
