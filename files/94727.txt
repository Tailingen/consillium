A Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Effectiveness of GSK4418959 Alone or in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Agents in Participants With Solid Tumors
Solid tumours are abnormal lumps of tissue that can occur in different parts of the body. The tumours involved in this study have specific genetic characteristics that can make them more aggressive and challenging to treat. The study will test whether GSK4418959 alone or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor agent can decrease tumor size, is safe, well-tolerated, and how amounts of the study drug decrease in the body over time.
