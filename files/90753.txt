Different Fractionation Schedules of Radiotherapy to the Primary Tumour in Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer
de Novo metastatic prostate cancer with limited metastatic spread benefits from local radiotherapy to the prostate. Two different fractionation schedules will be tested.
Prostate Cancer|Radiotherapy Side Effect|Metastatic Cancer
RADIATION: Moderate hypo-fractionation|RADIATION: Ultra-hypo-fractionation
Toxicity as scored by PROM (Patient Reported Outcome Measures) at 8 weeks, Acute toxicity score by PROM at eight weeks post radiotherapy. The mean PCSS (Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale) bother score for urinary tract will be measured. The primary outcome measurement will be the difference between mean values in the respective treatment arms measured at 8 weeks after end of radiotherapy, 8 weeks|Toxicity as scored by PROM at 8 weeks, Acute toxicity score by PROM at eight weeks post radiotherapy. The mean PCSS bother score for bowel will be measured. The primary outcome measurement will be the difference between mean values in the respective treatment arms measured at 8 weeks after end of radiotherapy, 8 weeks
Failure free survival, To evaluate the proportion of patients that are failure free at 12 and 36 months, failure free survival (FFS), 12 months, 36 months
Patients with de Novo metastatic prostate cancer with limited disease spread has been shown to gain benefit from local radiotherapy to the prostate. The internationally accepted fractionation schedule is 3 Gy (Gray) x 19-20 over a course of 4 weeks.

There is continous evidence for even more hypo-fractionated radiotherapy with higher fractionation doses. We will test if the schedule of 6.1Gy x 6 compares to standard of 3 Gy x 19 with regard to patient reported side-effects.
