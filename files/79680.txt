A Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of JS207 With or Without JS015 in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This study is an open label, multicenter Phase II clinical trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of JS207 with or without JS015 in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX) as a first-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer with MSS/pMMR. The study was divided into two cohorts: Cohort 1 was JS207 combined with XELOX, and Cohort 2 was JS207 combined with JS015 and XELOX.
