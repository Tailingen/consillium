Combining Topical Imiquimod 5% Cream With a Pulsed Dye Laser to Treat Port Wine Stain Birthmarks
Port wine stains are red birthmarks that without treatment persist for a lifetime. They are frequently found on the face and can be conspicuous and disfiguring, negatively impacting social interactions for these patients. Treating Port wine stains is difficult. The standard of care is to use laser treatment, but over 80% of patients fail to completely clear despite multiple treatments. The growth of additional blood vessels (angiogenesis) following the Laser treatment is likely an important factor in why these lesions persist despite therapy.

Higher a\* values indicates a greater reduction in erythema hence better treatment outcome. ΔE detects all three dimensions of colorspace (L\*a\*b\*) and represents the difference in color between normal and PWS skin. Range of ΔE is 0 to 100. Higher values indicates improved treatment efficacy by greater skin color improvement., 8 weeks baseline
