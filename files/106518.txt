This study plans to enroll 8-44 patients to assess the safety of C-CAR031. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will either receive a single dose of C-CAR031 injection, and will be followed up post-treatment for safety monitoringï¼Œor further explore the treatment modality of combination with Lenvatinib or PD-1(L1) monoclonal antibody at explored safe and effective dose level(s) of C-CAR031 monotherapy in specific eligible advanced HCC patients to provide data support for the phase II study of CAR-T combination therapy. The follow-up period will be 12 months.
