Rucaparib and Nivolumab in Patients With Prostate or Endometrial Cancer
This is a phase 1/phase 2a study of the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) in combination with the PARP inhibitor (rucaparib) for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and metastatic/recurrent endometrial cancer.

In the phase 1 portion, the safety of the combination dosing will be determined. If the combination dosing is determined to be safe and feasible, the study will move onto phase 2a.

In the phase 2a portion, participants will be randomized to receive either: rucaparib alone, nivolumab alone, or combination therapy (rucaparib and nivolumab).
