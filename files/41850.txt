Pazopanib Hydrochloride Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works when given before surgery in treating patients with kidney cancer.

Number of Participants Who Could Undergo Partial Nephrectomy After Pazopanib Therapy, The primary end point was the percentage of patients who could undergo partial nephrectomy after pazopanib therapy. A reduction in tumor size, with pazopanib treatment, may permit the use of a partial nephrectomy, as opposed to a radical nephrectomy. This would help preserve additional vascularized parenchyma., Partial nephrectomy performed after 8 to 16-weeks of pazopanib prescription. The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the rate of partial nephrectomy in patients with primary renal tumors otherwise requiring radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety, tumor diameter/volume change, conversion of hilar to non-hilar tumors and surgical morbidity of neoadjuvant pazopanib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily for up to 18 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo either partial or radical nephrectomy at least 7 days after completion of pazopanib hydrochloride.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
