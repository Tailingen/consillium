HAIC (Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy，HAIC）Plus Sintilimab and Donafenib in the First-line Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single-arm exploratory clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAIC in combination with Sintilimab and Donafenib in patients with BCLC-C stage who have not received prior systemic therapy

This trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study of HAIC in combination with Sintilimab and Donafenib in the first-line treatment of BCLC-C stage unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The study is expected to include 38 subjects who meet the screening criteria to receive HAIC plus Sintilimab and Donafenib to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including time to progression（PFS）and overall survival（OS），etc.
