OSPM-Enhanced AI Model to Identify Premalignant and Malignant Ocular Surface Tumors
An OSPM-enhanced deep learning model has been developed for identifying premalignant and malignant tumors using data retrospectively collected from the Ningbo Eye Hospital, Jiangdong Eye Hospital, and the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. To further substantiate the model's effectiveness, we intend to evaluate it prospectively at Ningbo Eye Hospital.
