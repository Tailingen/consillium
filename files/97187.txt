Phase 3 Study of Surgery Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy(XELOX) in Colorectal Cancer With Resectable Liver Metastasis
This study aims to discuss the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin plus capecitabine) .
Colorectal Cancer|Resectable Liver Metastasis
DRUG: neoadjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine|PROCEDURE: resection of liver metastasis
disease free survival rate, 3 year
R0 resection rate, at the time of pathological report|survival rate and over survival, 5 year|surgery related mortality, peri-operation period|response rate and safety of XELOX as a neoadjuvant regimen, no time frame
Liver metastasis is the most important prognostic factor of colorectal cancer. Reasonable multidisciplinary therapy might improve the prognosis of patients with liver metastasis. Surgery has been the first choice under such situation. Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also shown its value in unresectable liver metastasis, for it can increase the chance of R0 resection and give some clues to chemosensitivity of agents. However, for those resectable lesions, the role and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has yet to be confirmed. so we design this study.
