Study of Tucatinib and Doxil in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive (HER2+) Metastatic Breast Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating tucatinib in combination with Doxil in participants with human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to:

* Learn how well the combination of tucatinib and Doxil works
* Learn more about the side effects of the combination of tucatinib and Doxil
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tucatinib|DRUG: Doxil
Objective response rate (ORR) to assess the anti-tumor activity of tucatinib in combination with Doxil using RECIST v1.1., Proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to tucatinib in combination with Doxil according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 40 months.
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v5.0., Incidence of treatment related adverse events (AEs) using CTCAE v5.0., from informed consent (cycle 0 day -28) to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Each cycle is 28 days.|Progression-free survival (PFS) to assess the anti-tumor activity of tucatinib in combination with Doxil using RECIST v1.1., Time from the first day of study drug administration (day 1) until disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1, or death on study., Up to approximately 40 months.
This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study evaluating the combination of tucatinib with Doxil in participants with HER2+ breast cancer who have received at least one prior line of anti-HER2 therapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease or relapsed within 6 months of completion of anti-HER2 adjuvant therapy.

This study will start with a lead-in phase wherein the first 6 patients will be evaluated weekly for one treatment cycle (28 days) to ensure the regimen is safe and tolerable. If no severe and/or unexpected toxicities are observed in these initial patients, the study will continue to enroll a total of 36 patients.
