Phase III Randomized Study of Amonafide (AS1413) and Cytarabine Versus Daunorubicin and Cytarabine in Patients With Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)- the ACCEDE Study
Amonafide is a DNA intercalating agent and inhibitor of topoisomerase II that has been extensively studied in patients with malignant solid tumors. Amonafide has also been studied in patients with AML.

The purpose of this study is to assess the relative efficacy and safety of amonafide in combination with cytarabine compared to daunorubicin with cytarabine in subjects with documented secondary AML.

DRUG: Daunorubicin and Cytarabine|DRUG: Amonafide and Cytarabine
Rate of CR + CRi (which includes CRc and CRd) will be determined by assessing the proportion of patients who achieved CR or CRi among all evaluable patients., Course 1/Course 2 Day 37 bone marrow assessments and confirmation bone marrow 30 days later
Median duration of remission and median duration of disease free survival., Follow-up visits following post-remission therapy
