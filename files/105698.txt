Bone Health Management for Women Diagnosed With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of the study protocol. The study protocol was designed to evaluate questions - "Do educational materials improve dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening rates for women diagnosed with breast cancer" and "Does educational materials delivered by the participant's selected choice change DXA screening rates compared to the conventional mail method?".

"Bone health management" for osteoporosis is important for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Osteoporosis can lead to bones breaking easily. Broken bones may make living independently challenging. Effective bone health management can reduce the risk of broken bones. This study will examine whether providing "osteoporosis information" to women diagnosed with breast cancer will promote their bone health management. With the current advance in technology, people are more interested in receiving information by email or smartphone text messaging. This study will also examine whether delivering osteoporosis information in different ways will change bone health management.
