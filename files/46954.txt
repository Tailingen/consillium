A Clinical Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Fruquintinib in Combination With PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody and Chidamide in Refractory MSS Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study is a single-arm, open-label, single-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor and chidamide in patients with refractory MSS-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 46 patients are planned to be enrolled, with the primary endpoint being median progression-free survival (mPFS). Secondary endpoints include median overall survival (mOS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.
