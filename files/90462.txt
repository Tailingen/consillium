Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Versus Sennosides Study in Opioid-Induced Constipation in Cancer Patients
This is a study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two laxatives for treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult outpatients with cancer treated at the British Columbia Cancer Pain and Symptom Management/Palliative Care clinics. Each participating patient will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
Constipation|Cancer
DRUG: PEG then Senna|DRUG: Senna then PEG
Bowel Performance Scale (BPS), Mean values of Number of Days with Satisfactory Bowel Movements Per Days of Treatment across time by treatment, derived from the mixed effects Poisson regression model. If the BPS rating on a day was -1, 0 or +1, the patient's bowel movement on that day was deemed to be satisfactory., Last 18 days of each 21 day study period
Patient Preference, The patients will be asked to state which treatment period they prefer. Only assessed using patients who completed both arms of the study (n=28)., end of study (6 weeks)|Time (in Days) to Attain an Ideal BPS Score of Goal, Proportion of patients in the study population estimated to reach a BPS at goal in the first period as a function of the time (in days) from day 1, presuming they were followed for 21 days and contributed a BPS score on each of those days.

Constipation was graded using the Victoria Bowel Performance Scale (BPS), a nine-point scale from -4 (constipation) to +4 (diarrhea) which has been validated for use in patients receiving palliative care., 3 weeks (ascertained at the end of period 1)|Incidence of Cramps, The patients were asked to indicate any experience of cramps while on study treatment, Last 18 days of each 21 day study period|Rectal Measures, The patients were asked to indicate any experience of rectal bleeding or rectal pain while on study treatment, Last 18 days of each 21 day study period
One group will be started on a bowel protocol of escalating doses of sennosides, plus a dummy polyethylene glycol (lactose), and the other will receive dummy sennosides capsules (lactose) plus polyethylene glycol, with the same dosing protocol. After three weeks of one active treatment the patients will switch to the alternate active product and dummy preparation. The total duration for the study will be 6 weeks for each patient.
