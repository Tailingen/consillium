This is a First-in-Human, Open Label, Phase I/II Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of HH2710 in Patients with Advanced Tumors, composed of a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion stage and a Phase II dose extension stage.
Advanced Tumors|Melanoma|Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer|Erdheim-Chester Disease|Other RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK Mutated Tumors
DRUG: HH2710
MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose), MTD estimation: After the escalation is completed, select the MTD based on the isotonic regression. Specifically, select the MTD for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate. If there are ties, select the higher dose level when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target toxicity rate and select the lower dose level when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target toxicity rate., Up to 1 cycle (21 days)|Number of Participants Who Experienced DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicities), DLT is defined as: any toxicity meeting the specified criteria and considered at least possibly related to HH2710 (i.e., any toxicity for which a clear alternative etiology such as disease progression has not been identified) should be considered a DLT per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (NCI-CTCAE V5.0) standard, which met any of the following, NCI-CTCAE V5.0 will be used for all grading, and compliance of 80% (i.e. 17 of 21 days) in Cycle 1 is required for a patient to be included in the DLT evaluation. For the purpose of dose-escalation decisions, DLTs will be considered and included in the BOIN., Up to 1 cycle (21 days)|Tumor Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR=CR+PR. ORR was defined as the percentage of patients who had at least one confirmed response of CR or PR defined by RECIST version 1.1 prior to any evidence of progression, and was calculated and summarized by the treatment group, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated by the Clopper-Pearson method., Up to 1 cycle (21 days)

And t1/2，Lambda z (λz), Vz/F, are only applicable for single dose administration., Single dose, C1D1,pre-dose,15min,30min,1h,2h,3h,4h,6h,8h,12h(if available),C1D2, pre-dose(if available)|Pharmacokinetic Measures - Plasma Clearance Rate Constant, Lambda z (λz), Terminal phase rate constant, determined by linear regression of at least 3 points on the terminal phase of the log-linear plasma concentration-time curve. The correlation coefficient (r2) for the goodness of the fit of the regression line through the data points has to be 0.85 or higher for the value to be considered reliable. If the WinNonlin data points are not on the linear portion of the terminal slope, the data points will be selected manually prior to calculation of Lambda_z.
