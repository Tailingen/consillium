Aumolertinib With Chemotherapy or Alone Compared With Osimertinib in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Aumolertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets EGFR mutations. The reason for this study is to learn whether adding chemotherapy to a new investigational drug called aumolertinib helps to slow or stop cancer growth in people with EGFR mutation-positive, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will compare this new combination of drugs to osimertinib, given alone. Aumolertinib given alone will also be used in the study, and it will be looked at in comparison with osimertinib given alone.

This is a randomized, open-label study with 3 different groups that are listed below. "Randomized" means the study treatment participants take will be chosen by chance (decided at random by a computer). "Open-label" means that the participant, the study doctor, and the Sponsor will know which study treatment each participant is receiving.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following 3 treatment groups:

* Group 1: Treatment with aumolertinib alone, taken orally (by mouth) as a pill once a day. Around 100 participants will be randomly assigned to this group.
* Group 2: Treatment with aumolertinib taken orally as a pill once a day, in combination with chemotherapy given intravenously (IV; through a needle placed in a vein) on the schedule provided by the study doctor. Around 200 participants will be randomly assigned to this group.
* Group 3: Treatment with osimertinib alone, taken orally as a pill once a day. Around 200 participants will be randomly assigned to this group.

Because there will be twice as many participants in Group 2 and Group 3 as in Group 1, the chance of a participant being randomly assigned to either of those groups is twice as likely as being assigned to Group 1.

Participants can continue to receive study treatment as long as they have not withdrawn consent, as long as they choose to continue to receive study treatment and are judged by their doctor to continue to receive clinical benefit from receiving the study treatment, and as long as no other study treatment and/or study discontinuation criteria are met .
