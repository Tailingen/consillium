Significance of Duration of Maintenance Therapy With Rituximab in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to determine if an extended maintenance therapy with Rituximab in follicular and a maintenance therapy in other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas has advantages compared to a shorter or no maintenance therapy.
Follicular Lymphomas|Immunocytomas|Marginal Zone Lymphomas|Mantle-Cell Lymphomas|Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Rituximab / observation
Progression free survival, Time from randomization until progress or death of any course, 5 years and ongoing
Remission rate and duration; event free-, progression free-, disease free- and over all survival, Time from randomization until treatment failure due to progression or not achieving any remission; time from achievin CR or PR until progression or relapse, 5 years and ongoing
Results from several randomised studies show a clinical benefit of a maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas. The advantage of a maintenance therapy in other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas is - due to the lower incidence of these diseases- not well investigated.

This study tries to determine the significance of an extended maintenance therapy with rituximab in follicular lymphomas and the significance of a maintenance therapy other indolent and mantle cell lymphomas compared to observation.
