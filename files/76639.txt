A Clinical Study of Sacituzumab Tirumotecan (Sac-TMT, MK-2870) in People With Breast Cancer (MK-2870-032)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat types of breast cancer that are both:

* High-risk, which means the cancer may have a higher chance of getting worse or coming back after treatment
* Early-stage, which means the cancer is in the breast or the lymph nodes around the breast The 2 types of breast cancer in this study are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR)-low positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. These cancers have zero or a low amount of a protein called HER2 and other proteins that attach to the hormones estrogen or progesterone.

Sacituzumab tirumotecan (also known as sac-TMT or MK-2870), the study medicine, is a type of targeted therapy. A targeted therapy is a treatment that works to control how specific types of cancer cells grow and spread.

The main goals of this study are to learn if people who receive sac-TMT, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy:

* Have fewer cancer cells found in the tumors and lymph nodes removed during surgery compared to those who receive only pembrolizumab and chemotherapy
* Live longer without the cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to people who receive only pembrolizumab with chemotherapy

Percentage of Participants with Pathological Complete Response (pCR) at the Time of Definitive Surgery, pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy per current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 30 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 92 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 115 months|Percentage of Participants with pCR with No Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (pCR-no DCIS) at the Time of Definitive Surgery, pCR-no ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (ypT0 ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy per current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 30 weeks|Percentage of Participants with pCR at the Time of Definitive Surgery (High-risk, early-stage, TNBC subset), pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy per current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. The pCR will be presented for the subset of participants who enrolled with high-risk, early-stage, TNBC., Up to approximately 30 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS) (High-risk, early-stage, TNBC subset), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The EFS will be presented for the subset of participants who enrolled with high-risk, early-stage, TNBC., Up to approximately 92 months|Overall Survival (OS) (High-risk, early-stage, TNBC subset), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 115 months|Distant Progression or Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DPDRFS), DPDRFS is defined as the time from randomization to first distant progression or distant recurrence event as assessed by investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 92 months|Change from Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status-Quality of Life Score, The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to Item 30 (""How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") is scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher value indicates a better level of function. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 30 score will be reported., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better level of physical functioning., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Role Functioning Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to questions about their role functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better level of physical functioning., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to questions about their fatigue are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A lower score indicates a better level of function., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ Breast Cancer 42 (BR42) Systemic Therapy Side Effects Score, The EORTC QLQ-BR42 is a 42-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of breast cancer patients. Participant responses to questions about their systemic therapy side effects are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A lower score indicates a lower level of side effects., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to approximately 67 weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to approximately 54 weeks
