Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of HLX51 in Patients With Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
This study is a first-in-class open-label phase I human clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX51 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.
Solid Tumor, Adult Lymphoma
DRUG: HLX51
The Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of HLX51 within 3 weeks after the first Administration, DLT refers to the AEs that are determined to be related to the investigational product by the investigator, whose severity will affect the escalation of dose level. In this study, the DLT observation period lasts for 3 weeks after the first administration of HLX51, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HLX51 within 3 weeks after the first administration, MTD refers to the highest dose at which less than 1/3 of subjects in the same dose group develop DLT in cycle 1 of the dose escalation stage., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
This study is the first-in-class open-label phase I human clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX51 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. In this study, 3 + 3 dose escalation method will be adopted, and the patients will be given different doses of HLX51 intravenously. Observation period of DLT lasts for 3 weeks after the first administration of HLX51.
