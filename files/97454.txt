In this study, 100 patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma were proposed to undergo BCMA CAR-T cell therapy. Under the premise that its safety has been clarified in previous studies, further observation and evaluation of the effectiveness of BCMA CAR-T cell therapy for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; At the same time, on the basis of expanding the sample size, more safety data on BCMA CAR-T cell treatment for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma were accumulated, including rare and delayed complications.
