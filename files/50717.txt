Busulfan, Melphalan, and Thiotepa Followed By a Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With High-Risk Ewing's Tumors
RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of tumor cells and prepares the patient's bone marrow for the stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Giving tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving busulfan together with melphalan and thiotepa followed by a donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with high-risk Ewing's tumors.

Overall Objective Response, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Evaluate disease-free and overall survival of patients with high-risk tumors of the Ewing's family treated with unmodified T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after cytoreduction comprising busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa.
* Determine the regimen-related morbidity and mortality in these patients.
* Determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the biologic response of minimal residual disease in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

* Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -8 to -6, melphalan IV over 20 minutes on days -5 to -3, and thiotepa IV over 4 hours on day -2.
* Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow or T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.
* Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive treatment according to institutional guidelines and are given treatment against infection.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.
