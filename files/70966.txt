Cord Blood Derived Anti-CD19 CAR-Engineered NK Cells for B Lymphoid Malignancies
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the primary safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)-modified NK cells(CAR-NK-CD19) in patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + CAR-NK-CD19 Cells
Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., within 2 years after infusion
Overall response rate(ORR) of administering CAR-NK-CD19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., ORR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Complete response rate(CRR) of administering CAR-NK-CD19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., CRR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Progress-free survival(PFS) of administering CAR-NK-CD19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., PFS will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Duration of Response(DOR) of administering CAR-NK-CD19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., DOR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Overall survival(OS) of administering CAR-NK-CD19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., OS will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion
In vivo expansion and survival of CAR-NK-CD19 cells, Quantity of CAR-NK-CD19 CAR copies in bone marrow and peripheral blood will be determined by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction., within 2 years after infusion
Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown remarkable clinical efficacy in B-cell cancers. However, CAR T cells can induce substantial toxic effects, and the manufacture of the cells is complex. Natural killer (NK) cells that have been modified to express an anti-CD19 CAR have the potential to overcome these limitations.

Cord blood(CB) derived NK cells from healthy donor are the source for production of CAR-NK-CD19 cells. CB derived NK cells are purified and transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the anti-CD19 CAR and interleukin-15.

This is an investigational study. The objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-NK-CD19 cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies.
