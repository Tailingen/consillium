Neoadjuvant Study of DV in Combination Toripalimab or Sequence Chemotherapy in HR-negative, HER2 Low-expressing Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Neoadjuvant study of DV in combination Toripalimab i or sequence chemotherapy in HR-negative, HER2 low-expressing Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin Injection （18 weeks）|DRUG: Toripalimab （18weeks）|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin Injection （12 weeks）|DRUG: Sequential Epirubicin|DRUG: Sequential CTX|DRUG: Toripalimab （12weeks）
Total pathological complete response (tpCR) rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0), Defined as the proportion of participants with a pathological assessment of pCR (ypTO/Tis, ypNO) in the analyzed population;, 1 month after surgery
Breast pathological complete response（bpCR）, Defined as the proportion of participants with a pathological assessment of bpCR in the analyzed population, 1 month after surgery|Objective remission rate (ORR), Objective response rate.ORR assessed according to the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), Baseline to surgery|Disease free survival（DFS）, From the date of surgery to the first local, regional, contralateral or distant recurrence, and death from any cause including 3- and 5-year event-free survival, Up to approximately 3 or 5 years|Event free survival (EFS), The time from random assignment to disease progression, including local progression before surgery; disease recurrence-local, regional, distant, ipsilateral noninvasive, or contralateral (invasive or noninvasive)-or death from any cause;, Up to approximately 3 or 5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., Date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, up to 5 years after the last subject randomized|Adverse events, To evaluate safety including adverse event rate and adverse event grade, Up to approximately 2 months after surgery|Change in cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), CD8 in tumor samples by biopsy at baseline and by surgery immediately after surgery would be evaluated by HE or immune staining., At baseline to surgery|Health-related quality of life - EORTC-QLQ-C30, Change from baseline in the physical functioning subscale of the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores. Scale scores range from 0-100. For functioning and global health status/ QoL scales, higher scores indicate better functioning or global health status/QoL. For symptom scales, higher scores indicate greater symptom burden, Up to approximately 2 years|Residual cancer burden score, According to the extent of the residual cancer in the primary breast cancer site (mm\*mm), the residual cancer (mm\*mm), cell density of residual cancer (%), proportion of carcinoma in situ (%), number of positive lymph nodes and maximum diameter of lymph node metastasis (mm), the RCB index and corresponding RCB classification can be obtained. The RCB index and the corresponding RCB grade can be obtained based on the maximum diameter of the cancer (mm)., 1 month after surgery|Change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Defined as infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from tumor tissue.TILs in tumor samples by biopsy right before the first neoadjuvant therapy (baseline) and by surgery immediately after surgery would be evaluated by HE or immune staining., At baseline to surgery|Change in programmed cell death protein L1 (PD-L1), PD1 in tumor samples by biopsy at baseline and by surgery immediately after surgery would be evaluated by HE or immune staining., At baseline to surgery
This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase II Neoadjuvant Therapy Study designed to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Neoadjuvant study of DV in combination Toripalimab or sequence chemotherapy in HR-negative, HER2 low-expressing Breast Cancer The primary objectives of the study are to explore combination neoadjuvant therapy in participants with previously untreated HR-negative, HER2 low-expressing breast cancer, by assessment of tpCR and EFS.
