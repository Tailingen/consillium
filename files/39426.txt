Registry of Sarcoma Patients Treated With Permanently Implantable LDR CivaSheet速
This patient study will determine the safety and toxicity of a permanently implantable brachytherapy source - CivaSheet速 - which is designed to deliver a therapeutic dose of low dose rate (LDR) radiation with polymer encased Palladium-103. CivaSheet will be implanted in sarcoma patients with disease presenting in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, pelvis and trunk.

Local control rate, rate of local tumor recurrences, 5 years|Reoperation rate, Rate of re-operation for any reason, 5 years|Complication rate, Rate of complications following device implant related or unrelated to the device, 6 months|Dose to target and OAR, Amount of radiation dose delivered to the target volume and the adjacent organs at risk, 90 days
CivaSheet速 is an FDA-cleared product from CivaTech Oncology速. It is a series of small radioactive palladium-103 (Pd-103) sources on bio-absorbable, flexible, bio-compatible membrane. The CivaSheet can be custom cut in the operating room. The CivaSheet is 5 cm wide by 15 cm long and has a rim to allow an easy surface to suture. This flexible device can contour the surgical cavity delivering highly conformal and targeted radiation dose. CivaSheet can deliver a very high radiation dose to the surgical margin to potential prevent local cancer recurrence.

Sarcoma patients have up to 80% local recurrence rates, depending on histology and location of disease presentation. CivaSheet will be implanted at the surgical margin follow tumor removal. Monitoring the rate of acute toxicity is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include disease progression and recurrence rates.
