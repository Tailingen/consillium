Semi-automated Segmentation Methods of SSTR PET for Dosimetry Prediction
Tumor dosimetry with somatostatin receptor-targeted peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (SSTR-targeted PRRT) by 177Lutetium-DOTATATE might contribute to improve follow-up and treatment response of refractory meningiomas. This study aims to evaluate Standard Uptake Value mean (SUVmean) as a tumoral absorbed dose predictive predictive factor and propose semi-automated segmentation method to determine metabolic tumor volume with pretherapeutic 68-Gallium-DOTATOC PET.
