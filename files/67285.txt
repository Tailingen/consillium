Tracking Renal Tumors After Cryoablation Evaluation
TRACE is an observational, open-label, single-arm, multi-center registry of subjects who have undergone renal lesion cryoablation per their physician's standard of care. Patients 18 years of age or older who have been determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation will be offered enrollment into the registry. Subjects will be observed for five years from the date of their cryoablation procedure.
Kidney Neoplasms
DEVICE: Cryoablation
Changes in Lesion Size, Changes to lesion size using greatest trans-axial diameter (cm) from baseline through the follow-up intervals., Baseline and months 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60|Renal Function Status, Determined by the estimated Median Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) measure using mL/min, Baseline and months 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60|Hospital Stay, Length of time in hospital is the duration of the patient's in-hospital time measured in hours, from intervention to discharge with the average duration of hospitalization being 2 days but could be much longer., Average duration of 2 days or longer|Post-cryoablation Lesion Recurrence With Enhancement, Lesions with imaging that showed contrast enhancement based on investigator assessment., Months 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60|Disease-specific Survival Rates, Disease-specific survival rate is the time in days from cryoprocedure to death due to kidney cancer. Subjects who are alive will be censored at date of their last visit. Subjects who have died from causes other than kidney cancer will be censored at the time of death. Patients are followed up for duration of registry which is 5 years., Month 60|Overall Survival Rates, Death due to any cause, Month 60|Quality of Life Assessment, QoL SF12 is a health status survey to monitor outcomes in general and specific populations. Scoring system for the SF12 is norm-based scoring (NBS). This rescaling is done by linear transformation.The scale for each component is provided where the min = worst health and max= best health. Scale range (min-max,range): GH 23.9-63.7,39.8; PF 25.6-57.1,31.5 ; RP 23.6-57.5, 33.9; BP 21.7-57.7,36.1; VT 29.4-68.7, 39.4; SF 21.3-56.9,35.6; RE 14.7-56.3,41.6; HM 18.3-64.2,45.9; PCS 9.9-76,66 MCS 3.2-77.9,74.7, Months 6 and 12|Development of Metastatic Disease., Time between cryotherapy and first evidence of metastatic disease, Month 60|Total Number of Recurrences, Total recurrences based on imaging with enhancement and retreatments (eg: nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy or ablation)., Month 60
Procedure Method Outcomes, An assessment of outcomes across laparoscopic-assisted, percutaneous and open cryoablation procedures., During the procedure and immediately after it, an average of 2 hours.|Standard of Care Follow-up Procedures, Characterization of standards of care for cryoablation procedure follow-up across the participating registry centers., These outcomes are measured at each follow-up visit out to 5 years post-cryo procedure
The registry is non-interventional; it will neither direct the cryoablation procedures performed nor define the post-surgery follow-up of each subject. A subject's participation in the registry will not influence or direct subject treatment procedures or follow-up care. Physicians will use their discretion and personal standards of care to select subjects, perform the cryoablation procedures and define appropriate follow-up visit schedules for their subjects; it is anticipated that subjects will be seen at least once per year during the five-year follow-up period of TRACE. Subjects may be followed by the physician performing the cryoablation procedure or by their local/personal physician. The enrolling physician will be responsible for providing the follow-up data to the registry and will, as appropriate, work with a subject's local/personal physician to collect the follow-up data.
