Deep Learning Model for Diagnosis and Contour of Cervical Lymph Node for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The diagnosis of cervical lymph node in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging based deep learning model may be a noninvasive and rapid diagnostic method for cervical lymph node. Thus, the investigators aimed to develop and externally validate a deep learning model to assist in the diagnosis and localization of metastatic lymph nodes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
