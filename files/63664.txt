Education Intervention in Patients with Rash Due to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Treatment.
The main adverse reaction of EGFR seen in patients is rash. EGFR treated patients have a 24-95% incidence of rash depending on the type of treatment they receive. Skin toxicity may occur in more than 80% of patients treated with cetuximab.

If a severe rash (Grade 3 or 4) occurs, a dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment may be required. Also, infections are the main secondary side effect caused by the rash.

The aim of the study is through a randomized clinical trial feasibility study to investigate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in patients receiving EGFRI therapy.

It will be randomly selected which patients will belong to the intervention group and who in the control group. The type of program involves educational intervention.

In recent years, EGFRI (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor) have evolved as effective anti-cancer drugs. They are distinguished in monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab) and EGFR (TKIs) kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, where they are used in the treatment of colon, rectal, head and neck, lung, pancreas and of breast.

According to studies, the usual treatment for the prevention and treatment of skin rash refers to the use of antibiotics such as doxycycline, tetracycline and cortisone products such as hydrocortisone. It is also recommended to use moisturizing cream.

The study of Carmine P. et al., 2011 mentions the need to investigate educational measures for the rash due to EGFR treatment.
