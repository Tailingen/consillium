A Phase I Study OfLNF2007 Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
A non-randomized, open-ended, phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor efficacy, PK and immunogenic characteristics of LNF2007 in patients with advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Tumors (Phase 1)
DRUG: LNF2007
The incidence of LNF2007 treatment-emergent adverse events, Incidence and severity of AEs and specific laboratory abnormalities graded according to NCI-CTCAE, v5.0, Through up to approximately 30 days following last dose of LNF2007|Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLTs will include Grade 4 neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, ≥ Grade 3 Febrile neutropenia ，Grade 5 toxicity and other Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity etc, Within 28 days after first target dose|The maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended phase II dose of LNF2007, Dose Finding, the first 3 weeks of treatment
A non-randomized, open-ended, phase I dose-escalation and dose-expansion study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor efficacy, PK and immunogenic characteristics of LNF2007 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study is divided into dose escalation stage and dose extension stage.

A total of 9 dose groups were designed in the dose escalation phase. The dose expansion phase is planned to be conducted in two dose groups (determined by discussion between the investigator and sponsor based on available trial data), enrolling approximately 20 participants at each dose. According to the results of dose escalation phase, the pre-excitation dose of dose extension phase is designed.
