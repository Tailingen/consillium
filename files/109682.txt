Part 1: Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) in Combo 450 Group as Compared to Vemurafenib Group, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS was determined based on tumor assessment (RECIST version 1.1 criteria) as per BIRC/central review and survival information. If a participant did not had an event at the time of the analysis cut-off or at the start of any new anti-cancer therapy, data was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 square millimeter (mm\^2)., From randomization until documented disease progression (PD), initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, censoring date or death, whichever occurred first (up to 29 months)|Part 1: Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) in Combo 450 Group as Compared to LGX818 Group, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represented more severe symptoms., Baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1), Day 1 of Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and end of treatment visit (within14 days after the last dose of study drug)|Part 1 and Part 2: Change From Baseline in Social Functioning Scale Score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 at Day 1 of Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and End of Treatment Visit, EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items and is composed of multi-item and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale. The questionnaire employs 28 4-point Likert scales with responses from "not at all" to "very much" and two 7-point Likert scales for global health and overall QOL.

Definitive deterioration was defined as death due to any cause or decrease in ECOG PS by at least one category from baseline score with no subsequent improvement., Baseline up to 30 days from last dose of study drug (up to 30 months for Part 1, excluding Part 1: LGX818 300 mg group; up to 36 months for Part 2 and Part 1 LGX 300 mg group)
This is 2-part, randomized, open label, multi-center, parallel group, phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of LGX818 plus MEK162 to vemurafenib and LGX818 monotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. A total of approximately 900 patients will be randomized.

Part 1:

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment arms:

1. LGX818 450 mg QD plus MEK162 45 mg BID (denoted as Combo 450 arm)
2. LGX818 300 mg QD monotherapy (denoted as LGX818 arm) or
3. vemurafenib 960 mg BID (denoted as vemurafenib arm)

Part 2:

Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms:

1. LGX818 300 mg QD plus MEK162 45 mg BID (denoted as Combo 300 arm) or
2. LGX818 300 mg QD monotherapy (denoted as LGX818 arm)
