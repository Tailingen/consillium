Individualized Systems Medicine Functional Profiling for Recurrent Glioblastoma
A study to determine the feasibility and safety of individualized cancer stem cell targeted therapy based on high-throughput functional profiling of FDA/EMA-approved drugs in patients with GBM that has recurred or progressed following standards-of-care (RT, TMZ).

This protocol describes a prospective single-center phase 1 study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing (HTS) platform of individualized cancer stem cells (CSC) to predict targeted therapies in patients with recurrence of GBM after standards-of-care. Secondary outcome include efficacy of drug treatment. The underlying hypotheses is that treatment of patients based on functional profiling og autologous CSCs using HTS a) is feasible within an acceptable time window for clinical translation, b) safely delay disease progression and c) increase survival. There are increasingly published literature that strongly support the importance of a targeting CSC to improve therapy and prevent tumor recurrence in GBM, as an additional strategy to improve the overall prognosis of patients.
