Stop and go Strategy as First-line Treatment for Widely Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study aimed to investigate the value of a novel strategy of intermittent systematic chemotherapy (ISC) in widely metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (wmNPC) patients who achieve objective response after systematic chemotherapy (SC).

progression-free survival, the time interval from the start of chemotherapy to the date of progression, 1 year
progression-free survival 2, the time interval from the start of chemotherapy to the date of wide progression, 1 year|overall survival, time from the date of the start of chemotherapy to death due to any cause, 1 year
Widely metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (wmNPC) represented a particular subgroup of patients with the worst prognosis, of which palliative systematic chemotherapy(SC) was recommended as initial treatment, however, palliative systematic treatment was often required to be stopped due to the cumulative toxicities while stopping SC may lead to disease progression, a 'stop and go' approach, namely chemotherapy 'holidays', was a new strategy which may keep a good balance of benefit and risk. This study aimed to investigate the value of a novel strategy of intermittent systematic chemotherapy (ISC) in wmNPC patients who achieve objective response after SC.
