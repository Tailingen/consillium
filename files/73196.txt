Dosimetry Study of I-131-CLR1404 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and pharmacokinetics of I-131-CLR1404.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: I-131-CLR1404
Calculate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry of I-131-CLR1404 to determine the millicurie dose which is expected to deliver 35-40 centigray of radiation to bone marrow, 42 days
To determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of I-131-CLR1404, 42 days
I-131-CLR1404 is a small-molecule, phospholipid ether analog that combines lipid-like properties with a cancer therapeutic beta-emitting radioisotope. Cellectar believes that this compound will benefit individuals with cancer due to its selective retention and accumulation in malignant cells versus nonmalignant cells. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that I-131-CLR1404 significantly slows malignant tumor growth in several mouse tumor models.
