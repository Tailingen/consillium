Batiraxcept (AVB-S6-500)/Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of batiraxcept (AVB-S6-500) in combination with paclitaxel (PAC) versus placebo in combination with PAC in patients with platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Batiraxcept|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Placebo
Anti-tumor activity of batiraxcept in combination with PAC measured by progression free survival (PFS) in patients receiving batiraxcept + PAC versus patients receiving Placebo+PAC, PFS is the time interval between randomization and radiologically documented disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 4 months
Overall survival, Time following the treatment until death, 20 months
Duration of response (DOR), Measured from the date of partial or complete response to therapy until the cancer progresses based on RECIST v1.1 criteria., 9 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects who have a confirmed partial or complete response to therapy relative to baseline as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, 3 months|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), 10 months|Quality of Life (QOL), Subject QOL will be assessed using the Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) questionnaire, which consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (7 questions), social/family well-being (7 questions), emotional well-being (6 questions), and functional well-being (7 questions), and 12 additional concerns specific to ovarian cancer. All items are rated on a 5 point scale with 0 "not at all" and 4 "very much". The scoring algorithm allows for eight summary scales: the four core well-being subscales, a subtotal of the 27 core items, a subtotal of the 12 ovarian-specific additional concerns, a grand total of the 39 items, and a trial outcome index (sum of the 17 physical and functional wellbeing items plus the 12 ovarian-specific items)., 10 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), 4 months|Area under the batiraxcept concentration-time curve., 10 months|Maximum observed batiraxcept concentration., 10 months|Minimum observed batiraxcept concentration., 10 months|Pharmacodynamic marker assessment, Change from the baseline in GAS6 serum levels., 10 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers, 10 months|Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels, 10 months
