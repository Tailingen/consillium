Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Autogenous Tumor Infiltrates Lymphocytes for the Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer
Prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label,interventional study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) infusion (HS-IT101) after lymphodepletion preparative with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimen, followed by IL-2, for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.

HS-IT101 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving lymphodepletion treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by infusion of autologous TIL, then finnaly followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
