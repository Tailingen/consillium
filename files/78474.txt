A Study Evaluating Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of HC-1119 in Patients.
This is a phase I study evaluating tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of HC-1119 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study objective is to study the tolerability, safety, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of HC-1119 in patients with mCRPC.
