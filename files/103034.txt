Phase I Trial of Biweekly Gemcitabine & Paclitaxel & Low-Dose Radiation for Metastatic or Recurrent Head & Neck Cancer
This study seeks to establish the safety of gemcitabine, paclitaxel and low-dose radiation in recurrent, metastatic head and neck cancer through a two-stage dose escalation study, first with Gemcitabine dose escalation and then with low-dose radiation escalation.

Treatment Schedule

Treatment will be administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis.

* Gemcitabine:2000 to 3000mg/m2 IV (in the vein) on days 1 and 15 every 28 days over 30-60 minutes.
* Paclitaxel: 150 mg/m2 IV(in the vein)on days 1 and 15 every 28 days over 60 minutes.
* Low Dose Radiation: 50-80 cGy twice daily on days 1, 2, 15, \& 16 every 28 days at least 4 hours apart.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: paclitaxel|RADIATION: radiation
Maximum tolerated dose, toxicity notations made during weeks 3, 5, 7 & 9 of each cycle
Toxicity, weeks 3, 5, 7 & 9 of each cycle & also evaluated throughout study by weekly CBC|Response rate, assessed pre-study & week 8 and as needed during follow-up.|Association of tumor markers p53, p21waf1/cip1, bcl-xL, bcl-2 & bax with response rate, patients who consent to biopsy, obtain pre-study & 3-24 hrs after completion of 4th fraction of radiation, evaluated by immunohistochemistry
Objectives:

1. To assess the MTD of low-dose fractionated radiation in combination with Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer in the relapsed setting.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To assess quantitative toxicities in this group of patients treated with this regimen.
2. To assess response rate in this group of patients treated with this regimen
3. To investigate in an exploratory manner, the association of tumor markers p53, p21waf1/cip1, bcl-xL, bcl-2 and bax (evaluated by immunohistochemistry) with response rate using pre- and post-treatment biopsies.
