The Efficacy and Safety of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin Compared With Capecitabine as First Line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer (P04445/MK-2746-071)
This is an open-label, multinational, randomized, multicenter trial designed to compare pegylated liposomal doxorubicin with capecitabine as first line chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective of the study is to compare the time to disease progression, although overall response rates, overall survival, quality of life, time to treatment failure, and safety and tolerability will also be assessed.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (SCH 200746)|DRUG: Capecitabine
Time to Disease Progression (TTP) Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), TTP was defined as the time from onset of treatment with study drug until first evidence/diagnosis of progressive disease or - in the absence of any diagnosis of progressive disease - until the participant´s death. Diagnosis of progressive disease was done according to RECIST (Version 1.0) and/or investigator assessment based on RECIST. RECIST criteria used changes in the largest diameter of target/non-target lesions. Target (measurable) lesions were up to a maximum of 5 per organ \& \>20 mm by clinical imaging (\>=10 mm with spiral CT scan). Non-target lesions were all other lesions., From Day 1 (Cycle 1) until First Evidence/Diagnosis of Progressive Disease or Death
Number of Participants With an Overall Response (Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response [PR]) Between PLD and Capecitabine Treatment Groups, Overall responses by investigator assessment/RECIST criteria of participant responses; CR=disappearance of target/nontarget lesions + PR=30% decrease in longest diameter sum (noting baseline sum) of target lesions. RECIST used changes in the largest diameter of target/non-target lesions. Target lesions were up to a maximum of 5 per organ \& \>20 mm by clinical imaging (\>=10 mm with spiral CT scan). Non-target lesions were all other lesions. Evaluation of progress was repeated every 3 months (+/-7 days) post first date of lesion measurements, in detection absence until the participant´s death., From Day 1 (Cycle 1) until First Evidence/Diagnosis of Progressive Disease or Death|Overall Survival Time in the PLD and Capecitabine Treatment Groups, Survival time was defined as duration time from onset of treatment with the study drug until death., From Day 1 (Cycle 1) until Death|Time to Treatment Failure in the PLD and the Capecitabine Treatment Groups, Time to treatment failure was defined as the duration of time from the date of the first administration of the study drug to the date of discontinuation of the study drug for any reason., From Day 1 (Cycle 1) until End of Treatment|Quality of Life (QoL) Measured by QoL Questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) + Subjective Significance Questionnaire (SSQ)), QoL questionnaire was an EORTC QLQ-C30 \& SSQ integration. Scores on the SSQ scale ranged from 1 (very much worse) - 7 (very much better). SSQ consisted of 4 items which corresponded to core domains in the 30 Item EORTC QLQ-C30, such as improvement/deterioration in physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, global QoL. Percentages were based on number of participants at each cycle \& rounded to the nearest whole number. Early Withdrawal Questionnaires were obtained in 7-14 days of study drug final dose., From Screening to Day 1 of every Treatment Cycle up to 12 Cycles
