A Web-Based Multimedia Intervention for Head and Neck Cancer Patients
The overall goal is to develop and examine the acceptability of a web-based (Internet) intervention program for patients with head and neck cancer who have recently completed radiation therapy.

Patient Distress, Psychological distress will be assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18. The Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) is an 18-item scale widely used to measure psychological distress. The BSI-18 yields a total score (Global Severity Index), which is a measure of overall psychological distress. Raw scores are converted to t-scores (range 0-100) based on gender-specific normative data from cancer patient populations. A t-score of 50 is equal to the mean of the population. Higher scores represent greater levels of distress. The BSI-18 provides a clinical case-rule classifying respondents who have a t-score score ≥ 63 on the GSI as having clinically significant symptoms. Other studies have used a lower cutoff, with a GSI t-score ≥ 57 recommended as a cutoff for clinically significant symptoms in a study of cancer patients., Up to 6 weeks
The overall goal is to develop and examine the acceptability of a theory-guided, web-based multimedia intervention program for head and neck cancer patients who have recently completed radiation therapy. The effects of this intervention on patients' quality of life (QOL) will also be evaluated.
