TALAVE: Induction Talazoparib Followed by Combination of Talazoparib and Avelumab in Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a multi-institutional pilot trial for patients with advanced breast cancer. The trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of induction talazoparib followed by combination of talazoparib and avelumab. As an exploratory endpoint, the study team will evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of induction talazoparib followed by the combination of talazoparib and avelumab in patients with advanced breast cancer.
