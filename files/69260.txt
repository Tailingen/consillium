A phase 1B study to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dalpiciclib + chidamide in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after the failure of CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy
HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dalpiciclib|DRUG: Chidamide
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Dalpiciclib + Chidamide, Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design method will be used in this clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., 2 Years
Objective response rate (ORR) of different dose groups, According to recist1.1 standard, the proportion of patients whose best remission was CR or PR accounted for the total number of evaluable patients., 2 Years|Safety of different dose groups (incidence of treatment-related adverse events), The severity of adverse events shall be determined according to CTCAE v5.0. During the trial, the adverse event record form should be truthfully filled in, including the occurrence time, severity, duration, measures taken and outcome of adverse events., AE recorded from infromed consent to 28 days after treatment completion|PFS, The time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first., 2 Years
