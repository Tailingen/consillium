Asciminib Used in Consolidation With Imatinib vs. Imatinib to Achieve TFR in CP-CML
The aim of this study is to establish if consolidation of imatinib-treated patients in stable DMR through the addition of asciminib, can lead to superior rates of TFR1, compared to imatinib alone in Chronic Phase-Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia patients.

Event-free survival rate, Occurrence of death or loss of deep molecular response (DMR, MR4 (4-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 or better)) or loss of major molecular response (MMR, MR3 (3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1)) at any time., randomization until 12 months after discontinuation of all TKI among randomized patients
Event-free survival rate, Occurrence of death or "molecular relapse" as defined as any loss of MR4 status during the Consolidation period OR any loss of MR3 by qPCR at any time, randomization to 6 months after discontinuation of TKI among all randomized patients|Time to molecular relapse, Time in months to loss of MR3 among subjects who attempt treatment-free remission (TFR), Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) discontinuation until loss of MR3 (up to 1 year)|Molecular relapse free rate, Sustained MR3 status at 12 months among patients who attempt TFR, TKI discontinuation until loss of MR3 (up to 1 year)|Cumulative incidence of adverse events grade â‰¥ 3 in each arm, using CTCAE 5.0, Safety and tolerability of asciminib when used with imatinib, from first dose/randomization until 30 days post last dose|Association between duration of prior imatinib exposure and TFR (Treatment Free Remission) as assessed by Hazard Ratio, from randomization until up to 12 months post consolidation|Association between duration of deep molecular response (DMR) and TFR (Treatment Free Remission) as assessed by Hazard Ratio, from randomization until up to 12 months post consolidation
