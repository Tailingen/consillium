Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Program in a Community Health System
Research efforts are needed to increase tobacco cessation support and to improve tobacco cessation efficacy. In addition, strategies must be identified to increase access to smoking cessation support and to develop processes to integrate smoking cessation into treatment plans for cancer patients.
Smoking Cessation
BEHAVIORAL: Smoking cessation
The Effectiveness of a Structured Smoking Cessation Program versus Unassisted Smoking Cessation Methods in Cancer Patients Managed in a Community Health System, To determine the effectiveness of an intensive structured smoking cessation program versus unassisted smoking cessation quitting methods in cancer patients seen in a community health care system, 6 and 12 month intervals
The Effectiveness of a Structured Smoking Cessation Program in Cancer Patients in a Community Health System The Effectiveness of a Structured Smoking Cessation Program versus Unassisted Smoking Cessatio, * Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up in patients participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have quit smoking without professional support.
* Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up in patients participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have quit smoking without professional support.
* Examine the impact of implementing a system level smoking cessation program into the ongoing management of our cancer patients who smoke., 6 and 12 month intervals
The Cancer Patient Tobacco Questionnaire (C-TUQ) survey tool will be used to address the primary and secondary outcome measures. This tool is publicly available on the National Cancer Institutes Grid-Enabled Measures website and was developed by NCI and the American Association for Cancer Research. This tool is a 22-item self-report survey designed to capture information about tobacco use by cancer patients and cancer survivors. Comparisons will be made for those patients that enroll in the structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have opted to quit on their own.

Primary:

To determine the effectiveness of an intensive structured smoking cessation program (education and support) provided by a tobacco cessation trained specialist versus unassisted smoking cessation quitting methods (no support, patients have opted to stop on their own) in cancer patients seen in a community health care system

Secondary:

* Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up in patients participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have quit smoking with professional support
* Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up in patients participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have quit smoking without professional support, participants choosing to stop smoking on their own.
* Examine the impact of implementing a system level smoking cessation program into the ongoing management of our cancer patients who smoke.
