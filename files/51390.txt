Comparison Between Rituximab Plus Zanubrutinib Versus Rituximab Monotherapy in Untreated SMZL Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of two medicinal products, rituximab, and zanubrutinib, compared to rituximab monotherapy in patients with Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL), previously untreated and who need systemic treatment.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is the combination rituximab and zanubrutinib a more effective therapy than rituximab monotherapy?
* Is the combination therapy, rituximab and zanubrutinib, well tolerated?

Study participants will be put into one of the two treatment groups (rituximab and zanubrutinib or rituximab alone) for a maximum of two years and will undergo regular visits until three years from treatment start.
Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Zanubrutinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 3 years, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until progression (assessed by the investigator per Lugano 2014 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From the date of randomization to the date of progression or the date of death from any cause until 3 years after randomization
Complete remission rates - Lugano 2014 criteria, Investigator-assessed complete remission rates achieved at 12 and 24 months of treatment, assessed according to the Lugano 2014 criteria, At 12 and 24 months after treatment start|Best response, Investigator-assessed best response achieved at any time during the treatment period (24 months) assessed according to the Lugano 2014 criteria, From date of treatment start until 24 months after treatment start|Complete remission rates - Matutes criteria, Investigator-assessed complete remission rates achieved at 12 and 24 months of treatment, assessed according to the Matutes criteria, At 12 and 24 months after treatment start|Best response - Matutes criteria, Investigator-assessed best response achieved at any time during the treatment period (24 months) assessed according to the Matutes criteria, From date of treatment start until 24 months after treatment start|Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), Investigator-assessed time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT) according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. TTNT is defined as time from the end of treatment until the start of the next therapy, From the end of treatment to the start of the next anti-lymphoma therapy until 3 years after randomization|Duration of response (DoR), Investigator-assessed DoR according to the Lugano 2014 criteria, From the time when criteria for response (ie, CR or PR) are met to the first documentation of relapse or progression until 3 years from randomization|Overall Survival (OS), OS according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. OS is defined as the time from random assignment until death as a result of any cause, From the time of randomization until death as a result of any cause until 3 years from randomization|Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Analysis of type and severity of adverse events (AEs) according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, From the time of ICF signature until 28 days after treatment discontinuation or until resolution of all treatment-related AEs, whichever occurs later, or starting of a new anti-neoplastic treatment up to 3 years from randomization
Phase III, interventional, multicenter, open label, randomized study to evaluate whether treatment with zanubrutinib in combination with rituximab will result in an improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to treatment with rituximab in patients with previously untreated splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL).

Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive zanubrutinib and rituximab (Treatment Arm A) or rituximab (Treatment Arm B). The study will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-Up Phase.

Subjects with investigator-confirmed progressive disease (PD) according to the Lugano 2014 criteria or unacceptable toxicity, or investigator/subject decision must discontinue study treatment.

Patients who complete the treatment and patients who will discontinue treatment for any reason will enter the Follow-up Phase.

The Response Follow-up Phase will occur for subjects who complete the treatment or discontinue for reasons other than disease progression and will include efficacy assessments every 24 weeks until investigator-assessed disease progression.

Subjects with PD during the Response Follow-up Phase will continue to be followed in the Survival Follow-up Phase.

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be responsible for independent review of the interim safety analysis on the first 20 enrolled patients in the experimental arm.
