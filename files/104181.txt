A Trial to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of TST001 in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase I trial of TST001. Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled. The study will consist of two parts: Part A is dose escalation and dose expansion phase for mono-therapy, and Part B is dose escalation and dose expansion phase for combination therapy in gastric, gastroesophageal junction(G/GEJ) and biliary tract cancer, etc.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: TST001|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Nivolumab
Participant Safety as characterized by frequency and severity of adverse events(according to NCI CTCAE 5.0)., An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., up to 30 days following last dose.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD）, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is commonly estimated to be the maximum dose that can be determined through DLT of two among 6 subjects administered with TST001 Q2W in 28 days cycles., up to 28 days following first dose|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD）, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is commonly estimated to be the maximum dose that can be determined through DLT of two among 6 subjects administered with TST001 once every 3 weeks in 21 days cycles., up to 21days following first dose|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be determined during the dose expansion stage of the study. RP2D will be determined using available safety and efficacy data., up to 30 days following last dose|The incidence and case number of DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) in subjects administered with TST001 Q2W in 28 days cycles during observation period, DLT is short for Dose Limiting Toxicity. dose-limiting describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., up to 28 days following first dose|The incidence and case number of DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) in subjects administered with TST001 once every 3 weeks in 21 days cycles during observation period, DLT is short for Dose Limiting Toxicity. dose-limiting describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., up to 21days following first dose|Safety and Tolerability of TST001 in combination with other therapies, e.g. CAPOX, paclitaxel, GP, nivolumab as characterized by frequency and severity of adverse events, Characterization of TST001 + CAPOX safety profile including frequency and severity of adverse events that are related to treatment., Up to 30 or 90 days following last dose
Area under plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) for TST001, Changes in AUC over time in participants with TST001., up to 30 days following last dose|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for TST001, Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration., up to 30 days following last dose|Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), Tmax is the time in hrs/days it takes to reach Cmax after dosing with TST001, up to 30 days following last dose|Terminal elimination half life (t1/2), Time for the plasma level of TST001 to decrease b y 1/2 during the terminal elimination phase., up to 30 days following last dose|Immunogenicity, by measurement of Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), up to 30 days following last dose|Objective response rate (ORR), as measured by RECIST 1.1, up to 30 days following last dose|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first response CR (complete remission)/PR (partial remission) (whichever is first recorded) to the date of radiographical progression/death or date of censoring., up to 30 days following last dose|Disease Control Rate, DCR: CR+PR+SD, up to 30 days following last dose|Progression free survival (PFS) and OS, as measured by RECIST v1.1, up to 30 days following last dose
There are two parts in the study. Part I is mono-therapy dose escalation and dose expansion study, and Part II is dose escalation and dose expansion study of combination therapy.

The dose escalation study will be conducted utilizing 3+3 design with two dosing regimens, i.e. "once every 2 weeks (Q2W)" and "once every 3 weeks (Q3W)".

After MTD/RP2D determined, three cohorts may be included in the expansion plan, with about 30 (20-40) subjects with positive CLDN18.2 expression be treated in each cohort, as shown below (during the study, the treatment cohorts may be adjusted or added based on the clinical and pre-clinical study data).

Approximately 320-540 treated subjects in total
