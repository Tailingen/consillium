Evaluation of Splenic Irradiation in Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia
Retrospective evaluation on the effect of splenic irradiation on clinical and hematological response and toxicity in patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL).
Leukemia, Chronic Lymphatic
RADIATION: splenic irradiation
Clinical and haematological response, Clinical and haematological response measured by number of leucocytes and thrombocytes during and after irradiation. Hemoglobin and size of spleen during and after irradiation in the time period 2000 tot 2013, 13 years
Progression of chronic Lymphatic leukaemia, Progression of chronic Lymphatic leukaemia after irradiation in the time period 2000 tot 2013, 13 years|Death, Patients will be followed from the time of splenic irradiation to death in the time period of 2000 tot 2013, 13 years|Toxicity of splenic irradiation, Toxicity of splenic irradiation during and after irradiation measured by evaluating clinical toxicity based on the CTCAE version 3.0 during and after irradiation (2000 to 2013), 13 years
The study will include patients with CLL treated with splenic irradiation in Maastro Clinic, Maastricht, The Netherlands, Maxima Medisch Centrum Veldhoven/Catharina hospital, Eindhoven, The Netherlands and Modena hospital, Modena, Italy. Data will be collected from patient records in an uniform database. Data will include demographic data, CLL stadium (RAI and Binet) at diagnosis and at the time of irradiation treatment, clinical data at diagnosis (haematology), splenic irradiation data, follow-up data such as date of progression or death
