DETECT IV - A Study in Patients With HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer and Persisting HER2-negative Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).
Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase II study in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and persisting HER2-negative circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Additional research on CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding of the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized therapy for MBC.

DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Eribulin
Progression free survival (PFS), Time interval from randomization until progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever comes first, 8-12 weeks
Overall response rate, Rate of complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) in patients with whom target lesions were defined, 8-12 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), rate of patients who were assessed as having a PR or a CR or who had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, 8-12 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization until death of any cause, 4 weeks|Dynamic of CTCs, Descriptive statistics of regular CTC counts, 8-12 weeks|For Everolimus/Ribociclib cohort only: Levels of pS6, Descriptive statistics of pS6 levels at baseline, at first radiological tumor assessment after about 12 weeks, and at the time of progression, 8-12 weeks|For Everolimus/Ribociclib cohort only: Change in the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-pathway in CTCs, Descriptive statistics of changes in the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-pathway in CTCs as assessed by longitudinal comparisons (at baseline, after 12 weeks, at time of progression), 8-12 weeks|For Everolimus/Ribociclib cohort only: Estrogen-receptor 1 (ESR-1) mutations in CTCs, Estrogen-receptor 1 (ESR-1) mutations in CTCs at baseline, after 12 weeks and at time of progression, 8-12 weeks|For Eribulin cohort only: New metastasis-free survival (nMFS), New metastasis-free survival (nMFS), defined as time from recruitment to death or progression due to appearance of a new metastasis, whichever comes first. If a patient has not had an event, nMFS is censored at the date of last adequate tumor as-sessment, 8-12 weeks
