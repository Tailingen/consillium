Neck Ultrasound by Respiratory Physicians in Patients With Lung Cancer
This is a study of routine neck ultrasound performed by respiratory physicians in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and suspected lung cancer
Lung Cancer Metastatic|Nodes, Lung
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Neck ultrasound guide lymph node sampling
Adequacy of lymph node sampling, Presence of lymphocytes or malignant cells in biopsy samples, 7 days
Proportion of patients with malignant cervical lymphadenopathy, Presence of malignant cells consistent with lung cancer in cervical lymph node samples, 7 days|Proportion of patients with nodal status upstaged, Defined as a change from cN2 to cN3 according to the 8th edition of the Tumour Node Metastasis TNM staging system, 7 days
In the first phase of the study a respiratory physician was trained to perform neck ultrasound and needle sampling of enlarged cervical lymph nodes according to preset criteria. In the second phase patients with suspected lung cancer and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes underwent routine neck ultrasound and enlarged cervical lymph nodes were sampled using fine needle and or core needle biopsy.

The outcomes of interest in the study were the rate of malignant cervical lymphadenopathy defined as pathological evidence of cancer in neck lymph node samples consistent with a lung primary, adequacy of needle sampling, patient reported experience assessed by a visual analogue of discomfort associated with needle neck sampling and EBUS, and the proportion of patients that had nodal upstaging
