Pathological Classification of Pulmonary Nodules in Images Using Deep Learning
This study aimed to develop a deep-learning model to automatically classify pulmonary nodules based on white-light images and to evaluate the model performance. Besides, suitable operation could be chosen with the help of this model, which could shorten the time of surgery.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: gross pathologic photo based deep learning model
1. Pathological subtype, According to WHO classification of pulmonary tumors in 2020, this study classify pulmonary tumors into adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). We would collect the reports of pathological type of pulmonary nodules after surgery., through study completion, an average of 2 year|Area Under the Curve (AUC), The area under the ROC curve based the predicton efficency of model, through study completion, an average of 2 year
All white-light photographs of pulmonary nodules from phones of pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) were retrospectively collected from consecutive patients who underwent surgery between June 30, 2020 and September 15, 2021 at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.Finally, a total of 1037 white-light images from 973 individuals were included in the study. The entire dataset was divided into training and test datasets, which were mutually exclusive, using random sampling. Of these, 830 images were used as the training dataset and 104 images from were used as the test dataset. The CNN model was used in classifying images, namely, Resnet-50. For the CNN model, pretrained model with the ImageNet Dataset were adopted using transfer learning. After constructing the CNN models using the training dataset, the performance of the models was evaluated using the test dataset and the prospective validation dataset.
