Study of Drug 1 (Enzalutamide) Plus Drug 2 (Relacorilant) for Patients With Prostate Cancer
The study is an open-label Phase 1 study of the combination of relacorilant with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

The study is an open-label Phase 1 study of the combination of relacorilant with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be enrolled in 6 patient cohorts with a 6+3 design and a 28 day DLT period. Doses of relacorilant, enzalutamide will be adjusted based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Once a safe dose with appropriate drug levels (PK) has been established, the cohort will be expanded to a total of 12 patients to refine safety and PK at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
