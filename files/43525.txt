Exploring the Value of Urine Proteomics-based Dynamic Surveillance for Early Recurrence After Radical Surgery for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Prospective Cohort Study
In this study, we explored and validated the predictive value of the longitudinal monitoring model of urinary proteomics for postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the predictive value of minimal residual disease (MRD) status, verified whether it is earlier than the recurrence suggested by imaging tests, and initially explored its clinical feasibility in guiding the adjuvant treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in the postoperative period, so as to provide a new idea for the strategy of early intervention in the postoperative period of hepatocellular carcinoma.
