Drug-drug Interaction Study With MDV3100 and a Cocktail of Substrates
A drug-drug interaction study to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between MDV3100 and a cocktail of substrates for pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate), S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate).
