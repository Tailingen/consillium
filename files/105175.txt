Lean Body Mass as a Determinant of Docetaxel Pharmacokinetics and Toxicity
Docetaxel is used as a first line anti-cancer drug in the treatment of several cancers, mainly breast- and metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.

Anti-cancer drugs are being dosed based on patients estimated Body Surface Area in order to equalize total drug exposure. Nevertheless, docetaxel treatment is characterized by highly interindividual pharmacokinetic variation leading to toxicity and under-treatment.

The investigators will determine which anthropometric parameters, LBM, total body weight (TBW) or BSA correlate best to docetaxel exposure (AUC) for both males and females.

relation between docetaxel toxicity and dose/LBM, can docetaxel toxicity be related to dose/LBM? docetaxel toxicity is defined as: number of rates of grade 3/4 toxicity, dose delay, dose reduction, treatment termination and combinations of all four as Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), 1 cycle (21 days)|determine the best method to measure lean body mass, To determine which methods to measure LBM: Bioelectrical Impedance As-sessments (BIA) or formula estimates are accurate enough for dosing calculations to be used for dosing docetaxel. These methods will be compared to the LBM derived from the DEXA scan as the general accepted, accurate and validated method for determining LBM., within one week prior to first docetaxel dose
Docetaxel is used as a first line anti-cancer drug in the treatment of several cancers, mainly breast- and metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.

Anti-cancer drugs are being dosed based on patients estimated Body Surface Area in order to equalize total drug exposure. Nevertheless, docetaxel treatment is characterized by highly interindividual pharmacokinetic variation leading to toxicity and under-treatment.

For most anti-cancer drugs, including docetaxel, other anthropometric parameters, such as Lean Body Mass (LBM), have been suggested to be superior to Body Surface Are (BSA) as a determinant for dosing but this has not been implemented in clinical practice.

The investigators will determine which anthropometric parameters, LBM, total body weight (TBW) or BSA correlate best to docetaxel exposure (AUC) for both males and females.

The investigators will determine if occurrence of docetaxel toxicity can be related to dose/LBM.

The investigators will determine which methods to measure LBM: DEXA, Bioelectrical Impedance Assessments (BIA) or formula estimates are accurate enough for dosing calculations to be used for dosing docetaxel.
