Patients with confirmed EGFR T790M positive NSCLC who have received prior therapy with an EGFR-TKI and concurrent with brain metastasis will be enrolled into the study. All eligible patients will have access to AZD9291 regimen through the ASTRIS study as long as they continue to show clinical benefit.
