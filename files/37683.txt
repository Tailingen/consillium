Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Scan for the Estimation of Tissue Pressure in Patients With Breast Cancer
This clinical trial studies the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in estimating tissue pressure in patients with breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as CEUS, may help estimate tissue pressure noninvasively.

PROCEDURE: Ultrasonsgraphy|DRUG: Perflutren Lipid Microcpheres|PROCEDURE: Contrast - Enhanced Ultrasound
Correlation between subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) results and direct measurements of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), Pearson's correlation coefficients will be computed between SHAPE results and direct IFP measurements by Stryker compartment pressure monitoring system. A Pearson's correlation coefficient above 0.5 will be considered a successful outcome., At baseline
Prediction of malignancy of breast tumor by the 3-dimensional subharmonic aided pressure estimation results, Generalized linear mixed logistic or generalized estimating equations logistic modeling of tumor versus non-tumor samples will be used to explore the potential for using SHAPE results as a novel functional predictor of breast tumor malignancy. Additionally, the subharmonic signal ratio from the tumor will be used to predict the malignancy of breast tumor using a biopsy result as a gold standard. The Mann-Whitney or Student's t-test will be performed depending on the distribution of the results., At baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if the 3-dimensional (3D) subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) results can be used to estimate interstitial fluid pressures (IFPs) in breast tumor and its surrounding tissue.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if the malignancy of breast tumor can be predicted by the 3D SHAPE results.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo ultrasound without contrast. Patients then receive perflutren lipid microspheres (Definity) intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and undergo CEUS.
