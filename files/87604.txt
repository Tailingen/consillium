HIPEC After Radical Cystectomy for High Risk Bladder Cancer
This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, pilot study administering hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with Mitomycin-C in 10 men and women with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder undergoing radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection who have risk factors for tumor recurrence.
Invasive Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: HIPEC
Treatment toxicity, Treatment toxicity will be analyzed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version 4.0. Descriptive statistics will be used to determine proportion of grade III/V treatment toxicity. Expected grade III/V toxicity in surgical patients without HIPEC would be 3 out of 10 patients. With the addition of HIPEC, there would be a significant difference (p=0.05) if 6 out of 10 patients experienced a grade III/V toxicity. Therefore, if less than 6 patients experience a grade III/V we would consider this a "negative" finding., 90 days
