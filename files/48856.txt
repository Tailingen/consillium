Molecularly Targeted Theranostic Approach for the Detection and Treatment of Metastatic Carcinomas
This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G and \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G theranostics pair in patients with metastatic cancer.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G and [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G.
[68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G PET/CT imaging, To assess the ability of \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G to detect lesions in patients with metastatic cancer, 2 hours from time of injection
[177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G treatment, To assess the safety and tolerability of a single treatment with \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G, 30 days from time of treatment|[177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G treatment efficacy, To assess treatment efficacy (response vs. no response) assessed by comparison with a post-treatment scan (standard of care imaging and post second \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G PET/CT, prior to next line of therapy., 60 days from time of treatment
This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G and \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G theranostics pair in patients with metastatic cancer. \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G PET/CT will be used to identify and stratify patients eligible for (and most likely to respond to) the \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G therapy. Up to 40 patients will be enrolled over a 36-month period with metastatic cancer with a life expectancy of at least 3 months, who demonstrate disease progression after at least 1 prior treatment for metastatic disease and have available archival tissue.

The hypothesis are that a) \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G will detect lesions in patients with metastatic cancer, b) the theranostic pair \[68Ga\]Ga DOTA-5G/ \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G will be safe and well tolerated, and c) a therapeutic response will be achieved with a single dose of \[177Lu\]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G.
