This multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase 2 will investigate the efficacy and safety of lerapolturev alone (Arm 1) or in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor (Arm 2). Following a 6 participant safety run-in period, up to approximately 50 participants with cutaneous melanoma who previously failed anti-PD-1/L1-based therapy will be randomized 1:1 to receive either lerapolturev or lerapolturev plus an anti-PD-1.
