Congenital Naevi of Lower Limb in the Child
Depending on its dimensions, it is difficult to predict if a congenital nevi of the lower limb can be surgically removed by a unique simple procedure or by a complex procedure (expander, skin graft etc..), with a good result.

This study retrospectively reviewed the practice of our team of surgeons depending on the size of the naevus to reveal a dimension threshold that can be used in the future to help to choose between a simple or a complex procedure.
