Finite Element Study of Biomechanical Changes After Unilateral Hemilamina and Facet Joint Resection of Cervical Spine
Finite element method was used to simulate unilateral hemilaminectomy of cervical spine and facet joint resection of different degrees, and the range of motion and the stress changes of ligament, intervertebral disc and endplate were calculated immediately after operation
Intraspinal Tumor
PROCEDURE: Hospitalization
Verification of the model, In this study, the pure torque of 2.0Nm was applied to the upper surface of C2 vertebral body along the 1, 2 and 3 coordinates according to the right hand helical rule to generate the corresponding pure torque in the sagittal plane, coronal plane and axial plane, and to simulate the cervical spine flexion and extension, lateral bending and left-right rotation in real life, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The finite element method was used to simulate unilateral hemilaminectomy of cervical spine and different degrees of facet joint resection, and the range of motion and the stress changes of ligaments, intervertebral discs and endplates were calculated immediately after the operation.

Study Design:

This study is a retrospective and general observational study.In this study, a young patient who was hospitalized in the Neurosurgery Department of the Third Hospital of Beijing University of Medicine and had undergone CT examination of cervical vertebra was selected. The patient had no cervical bony deformity, no cervical degeneration, and no history of trauma.

CT imaging data were collected, and a three-dimensional finite element model of C2-T1 segment of human cervical spine was established by finite element software. On the basis of this model, two and three levels of unilateral hemilamina and different degrees of facet joint resection were simulated.The lower end of the T1 vertebral body was fixed as the boundary condition, and three loading modes were adopted, namely, 2.0nm pure torque was applied to the upper surface of the C2 vertebral body along the sagittal plane, coronal plane and axial plane, respectively.The range of motion between vertebral segments was calculated and compared in different lamina surgical models. The tension of ligaments, the pressure of endplates and the pressure of intervertebral discs were obtained by finite element post-processing
