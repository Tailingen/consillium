Comparison Between Different Ways for Using Lidocaine During FB
compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized lidocaine, oropharyngeal lidocaine spray, or their combination for better outcome of topical anesthesia in subjects undergoing diagnostic FB; severity of cough , pain during procedure , cumulative dose of anesthesia needed and its adverse reaction , overall satisfaction .

PROCEDURE: Nebulized lidocaine|PROCEDURE: Lidocaine spray|PROCEDURE: Combination of nebulized lidocaine and lidocaine spray
The severity of cough using cough severity index, Assess the severity of cough during and within 4 hours after the procedure as (0 : absent cough is better ) , ( 5 : disturbing cough is the worst ), During and within 3 hours after procedure|pain during the procedure rated by the subjects on the Faces Pain Rating Scale., As (0 : no pain , the best) , ( 10 : worst pain ), During and within 3 hours after procedure|time taken to cross the vocal cords., the median time in seconds will be calculated during the procedure from the introduction the tip of bronchoscope from the nostril to second at which the tip of bronchoscopy cross the the vocal cords., at the beginning of the procedure(time zero) till seconds after crossing the vocal cords|changes in heart rate, changes in the heart rate from the baseline before procedure, During and within 3 hours after procedure|Changes in oxygen saturation, changes in the oxygen saturation from the baseline before procedure, During and within 3 hours after procedure
cumulative dose of lidocaine administered during the procedure., Less cumulative dose of lidocaine needed during the procedure is better, During the procedure|adverse reactions to lidocaine, assess for any adverse effects related to lidocaine use especially arrhythmia or other adverse effects as convulsions, involuntary movements, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis., During and within 3 hours after procedure|overall satisfaction with the procedure using likert scale ., As (1 : strongly disagree , is the worst) and (5 : strongly agree , is better), During and within 3 hours after procedure
Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a commonly performed procedure in the diagnosis and treatment of several respiratory disease. Although FB is generally a short procedure, it is uncomfortable for the patient. At least the use of topical anesthesia during FB is essential, especially when performed without sedation. Effective topical anesthesia blunts airway reflexes such as gag, cough, and laryngospasm.

The reduction in cough not only improves patient comfort but also makes the procedure easier for the operator.

Among agents used for topical anesthesia, lidocaine is the most widely used drug because of its safety and favorable pharmacokinetic profile.

Lidocaine is available in various formulations (gel or solution) and can be delivered to the respiratory passages by using different modes (spray, nebulization, transtracheal injection, bronchoscope instillation, and others).

In this study, will compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized lidocaine, oropharyngeal lidocaine spray, or their combination for topical anesthesia in subjects undergoing diagnostic FB, for better outcome.
