Recombinant Interferon Gamma in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This pilot clinical trial studies the effect of recombinant interferon gamma on tissue in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of tumor cells.

OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Interferon Gamma
Change in Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Expression After Treatment With IFN Gamma, It would be highly relevant to observe marked increase macrophages (effect size \> 2.5). Four patients gives over 90% power to detect such a large increase with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05., Baseline to up to 2 weeks post-surgery
MHC Class II Expression, To determine whether systemic administration of IFNg will increase class II MHC expression in SS and MRCL tumors., Baseline to 2 weeks post biopsy.|Changes in Immune Response, To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after IFNg treatment., Baseline to 2 weeks post biopsy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether systemic administration of interferon (IFN) gamma (recombinant interferon gamma) will increase class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) tumors.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether systemic administration of IFN gamma will increase class II MHC expression in SS and MRCL tumors.

II. To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after IFN gamma treatment.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive recombinant interferon gamma subcutaneously (SC) every 7 days for 4 weeks before surgery.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks post-surgery.
