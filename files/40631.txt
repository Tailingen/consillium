Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (BOLD MRI) and Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT PET) in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The objective of this pilot study is to determine the effectiveness of Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT PET) and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (BOLD MRI) in assessing tumour response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NA CT) in women with locally advanced breast cancer.
Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (LABC)
PROCEDURE: FLT PET and BOLD MRI scan
Clinical response (partial and complete), Partial clinical response refers to at least a 50% reduction in the dimensions of the tumour mass and a complete clinical response refers to complete absence of the mass on physical exam, as well as absence of inflammation, ulceration and peau d'orange., 6 months (approximately)
Pathologic response, Using the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) index the pathologic response will be divided into categories. The three categories are complete response, near complete response and chemotherapy resistance. A complete pathologic response (pCR) refers to complete absence of invasive cancer., 6 months (approximately)|Imaging Quantification, Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT PET) and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI quantification of tumor responses to predict which patients are likely to achieve a pathologic complete response., 6 months (approximately)
