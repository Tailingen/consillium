Study of Nivolumab in Patients With Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Registrational)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nivolumab in previously treated (cohorts, A, B \& C) or newly diagnosed (cohort D) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma participants.
Hodgkin Disease
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vinblastine|DRUG: Dacarbazine
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on IRRC Assessments in Cohorts A, B, and C, ORR is the percent of participants achieving either a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) according to the 2007 IWG criteria. Analyses of efficacy endpoints were performed separately for each cohort, according to IWG 2007. For cohort A and B, if the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. For cohort C, no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow was required in all participants in lieu of bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy.

CR is the percent of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of CR (disappearance of all evidence of disease) according to the 2007 IWG criteria, based on IRRC assessment.

PR is the percent of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of PR (regression of measurable disease and no new sites) according to the 2007 IWG criteria, based on IRRC assessment.

Confidence interval based on Clopper-Pearson method., From first dose to the date of initial objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurred first (up to approximately 28 months)|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Treatment Related Grade 3-5 AE in Cohort D, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug., From first dose of the considered therapy phase to 30 days after last dose of study therapy phase (or up to first dose of combination if any when considering the monotherapy period) (an average of 8 months and a maximum of 11 months)
Duration of Objective Response Based on IRRC Assessments in Cohorts A, B, and C, DOR is the time from first response (complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR)) to the date of initial objectively documented progression as determined using the 2007 IWG criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For participants who neither progressed nor died, the DOR was censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who started subsequent therapy without a prior reported progression were censored at the last tumor assessments prior to initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy.

CR is the percent of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of CR (disappearance of all evidence of disease) according to the 2007 IWG criteria, based on IRRC assessment.

Censoring was applied as per DOR definition.

A participant is considered as having received an AVD/NAVD dose as soon as they received at least one drug of AVD/NAVD for the considered dose. Participants must have received at least one dose of Nivolumab during the combination therapy phase to be included in participants treated with NAVD. If a participant subsequently met Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing, the combination of nivolumab and AVD could be used. Participants who underwent treatment beyond progression during the Monotherapy phase could use the combination of nivolumab and AVD if all 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy are completed.

Discontinuation can be due to any reason including, but not limited to, drug-related toxicity, diseases progression, or death., From first dose up until the date of treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 100 months).|Number of Participants Who Died in Cohort D, Number of participants who died in Cohort D within 100 days after last dose of study therapy., From first dose of the considered therapy phase to 100 days after last dose of study therapy phase (or up to first dose of combination if any when considering the monotherapy period) (an average of 10 months up to a maximum of 13 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) in Cohort D, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
