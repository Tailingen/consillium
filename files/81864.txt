Treatment for Patients With Non-Myeloid Malignancies Receiving Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to compare the time to hematopoietic response (hemoglobin correction to 12 g/dL or a greater than or equal to 2 g/dL increase from baseline) for subjects randomized to receive darbepoetin alfa with a front load dosing regimen to those receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with a weekly dose regimen during the 12-week comparative treatment period.
