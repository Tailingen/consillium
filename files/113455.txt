Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Diffusion Weighted Imaging : Potential Role in Neurofibromatosis
Whole body MRI will be performed in patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1

PURPOSE 1:

To determine the total tumor load (neurofibroma) and to diagnose plexiform neurofibromas or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. All patients will be scanned two years after the baseline whole body MRI to investigate to investigate the changes of total tumor load.

PURPOSE 2: added value of diffusion weighted imaging in diagnosis of high-risk neurofibromas

PURPOSE 3 : to determine the apparent diffusion coefficient of the malignant nerve sheath tumors and neurofibroma.

PURPOSE 4 : correlation between histopathology of the surgically resected neurofibroma/malignant nerve sheath tumors and MRI findings

Estimation of total tumor load and diagnosis of high-risk neurofibromas, Estimation of the total tumor load of neurofibromas with whole body MRI (head to knee). Diagnosis of high risk neurofibroma in the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities with T2-weighted sequence and diffusion weighted sequence., 1 month
To diagnose high-risk neurofibroma, Some patients with neurofibromatosis have lesions, pre-malignant or malignant neurofibromas. Additional imaging (PET-CT), a biopsy or surgical treatment is necessary in combination with histopathology of the lesion., 2 months
