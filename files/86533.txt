A Study of PF-05082566 In Combination With Mogamulizumab In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a Phase 1b, open label, multi center, multi-dose trial designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended dose for phase 2 (RP2D) investigations of PF- 05082566 in combination with KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Once the MTD of PF-05082566 administered in combination with KW-0761 is estimated (dose finding), one or more expansion cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid tumors (dose-expansion ) will be enrolled to further characterize the combination in term of safety profile, anti tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biomarkers modulation.
