StemRegenin-1 Expanded vs Unexpanded UCB for High Risk Heme Malignancies
This is an open label, interventional, randomized phase II trial comparing StemRegenin-1 (SR-1) cultured umbilical cord blood (experimental arm) to unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (standard of care arm) transplantation after a myeloablative CY/FLU/TBI conditioning. A 2:1 randomization will be employed with a higher chance of being assigned to the experimental arm.
