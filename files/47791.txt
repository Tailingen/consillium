A Comparison Between Child-Pugh and Albumin-Bilirubin Scores
To compare Child-Pugh and Albumin-Bilirubin scores in patients with spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma
Rupture, Spontaneous|Rupture Liver|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatic Impairment
PROCEDURE: Liver resection|OTHER: Transcatheter arterial embolization
Overall survival of all patients, Overall survival of all patients among different Child-Pugh and albumin-bilirubin scores, 5 years
Short-term mortality of all patients, Ninety-day mortality of all patients among different Child-Pugh and albumin-bilirubin scores, Ninety days|Short-term mortality of surgical subgroup, Ninety-day mortality of the surgical subgroup among different Child-Pugh and albumin-bilirubin scores, Ninety days|Short-term mortality of non-surgical subgroup, Ninety-day mortality of the non-surgical subgroup among different Child-Pugh and albumin-bilirubin scores, Ninety days
To compare Child-Pugh and Albumin-Bilirubin scores in patients with spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma. And to determine which is better in predicting long-term survival and short-term survival.
