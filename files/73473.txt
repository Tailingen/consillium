Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of ATG-017 Monotherapy or Combination Therapy With Nivolumab in Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignancies
This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label study of ATG-017 administered orally, alone or in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The study is composed of two modules: ATG-017 monotherapy (Module A) and ATG-017 in combination with nivolumab (Module B). Both Modules A and B will include Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase.
Solid Tumor|Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: ATG-017|DRUG: ATG-017+Nivolumab
AEs/SAEs, Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0., 18 months
Plasma concentrations, Venous blood samples for determination of total concentrations of ATG 017 in plasma to characterise the PK profile of ATG-017 for a particular dose level, 18 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), To determine the overall response rate according to RECIST1.1, Chenson 2014, IWG 2003 and 2006, 18 months|DOR, Duration of time from first occurrence of CR or PR until the first date that disease progression is objectively documented, 18 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from the first dose date until disease progression or death from any cause, 18 months
Level of phospho-p90RSK, Blood samples will be analysed for the level of phospho-p90RSK, 18 months|Level of transcript biomarker, Blood samples will be analysed for the level of DUSP6, 18 months|Level of phospho-ERK, Blood samples will be analysed for the level of phospho-ERK, 18 months|Level of total ERK, Blood samples will be analysed for the level of total ERK, 18 months
The dose escalation of ATG 017 will be conducted with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients with solid tumors (Module A and Module B) and hematological malignancies (Module A) harbouring activating alterations in the RAS-MAPK pathway, and will include the continuous and intermittent dosing schedules.

The Dose Expansion Phase will start based on dose level and schedule (continuous or intermittent)
