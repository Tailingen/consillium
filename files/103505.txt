Can You Breathe Your Way To Better Health?
The purpose of this clinical trial is to explore the effects of either a 2-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or breath training intervention on measures of overall health, circulating biomarkers of stress, and immune function.

Specific aims include: - Does a 2-week HIIT or breath training intervention improve measurements of overall health, including heart rate variability, physical activity, sleep quality, and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress? -Does a 2-week HIIT or breath training intervention improve circulating concentrations of stress-related biomarkers? Does a 2-week HIIT or breath training intervention improve immune function? Researchers will compare HIIT and breath training to see if equivalent immune improvements are observed.

Participants will: -Undergo 2 weeks of HIIT or breath training interventions at a frequency of 3 times per week for 30 minutes or 5 times per week for 5 minutes if placed into an intervention group. -Undergo testing measures at the two pre- and post-intervention time points, if placed in the intervention groups or the healthy control group.

The assay itself takes ~10-12 hours.|Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Heart rate variability (HRV) will be analyzed to determine the fluctuation in the time intervals between adjacent heartbeats to assess autonomic regulation of the heart. Resting HR and HRV were measured using the electrocardiograph (GE CASE Exercise Testing System Version 6.0, Chicago, Illinois). To measure HRV, the standard deviation of normal to normal beats (SDNN) was used with the 10-second electrocardiogram reading.

Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+), PAR-Q+ utilizes yes or no generalized health questions to screen participants interested in engaging in an exercise program for the need of medical clearance and physician release. The PAR-Q+ has 7 general health questions ranging from Does the participant feel chest pain at rest or during activities of daily living? Individuals who are eligible for this investigation require no further medical clearance before participating in an exercise program and should truthfully answer NO to every question. Participants who answer "Yes" to any questions will be required to answer follow-up questions to determine the need for medical clearance. If medical clearance is suggested, the individual will not be eligible to participate., Visit 1 (week 1) 10 minutes|Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), The DASS-21 contains 3 subscales assessing Depression, Anxiety, and Stress consisting of 7 questions for each subscale, where a high score of 28+ indicates "Extremely Severe" levels of Depression, a high score of 20+ indicates "Extremely Severe" levels of Anxiety, and a high score of 34+ indicates "Extremely Severe" levels of Stress, while low scores of 0-9 indicates "Normal" levels of Depression, scores of 0-7 indicates "Normal" levels of Anxiety, and scores of 0-14 indicates "Normal" levels of Stress.

A Polar Heart Rate Sensor H1 will be outfitted for each participant before starting the assessment. Participants will rest for 5 minutes in a seated position when heart rate, blood pressure, and blood lactate are measured. Next, the participant will be fitted to the cycle ergometer and perform a brief 5-minute warm-up at 0.5 kg and 60 rpm. Next, the pedal cadence increases to 75-85 rpm, and the participant starts stage 1. Every stage lasts 3 minutes, at the end of every stage, heart rate, blood lactate, blood pressure, and RPE are recorded, and 0.5 kg of resistance is added to the weight basket. Once blood lactate concentration is above 4.0 mmol/L, an incremental increase of 0.2 kg occurs. Assessment is terminated after volitional fatigue, failure to maintain pedal cadence, failure to increase heart rate or VO2 in subsequent stages, and the participant's request., Visit 2 (week 1) 30-45 minutes
