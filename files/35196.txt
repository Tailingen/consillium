Data Visualization of Kidney and Prostate Tumors Using Routine Pre-Operative Imaging, 3D Printed, and 3D Virtual Reality Models
The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding new methods of data visualization to routine clinical care will improve (i) surgical planning and (ii) surgical outcomes in patients with kidney and prostate tumors.

This early phase I trial studies how well indwelling pleural catheters with doxycycline work compared to indwelling pleural catheters alone in treating participants with malignant pleural effusions. These types of catheters are commonly used to treat pleural effusions (build-up of fluid in the lungs). Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is also used to treat pleural effusions. It is not yet known whether giving doxycycline with indwelling pleural catheters works better than indwelling pleural catheters alone in treating participants with cancerous pleural effusions.
