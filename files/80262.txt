MUTYH-associated Polyposis
This is single-center, prospective, non-randomized study
MutYH-associated Polyposis
GENETIC: Sanger sequencing method
Patients with germIine mutations in MutYH, number of patients with monoallelic and biallelic mutations in the MutYH-gene, from 0 to 6 months
The study will include patients with more than 3 polyps, without mutations in the APC gene. Using molecular genetic research methods (polymerase chain reaction, SSCP, sequencing by Sanger method) mutations in the MutYH gene will be studied. For all patients with mutations in the MutYH gene, an optimal diagnostic algorithm will be developed. The significance of monoallelic mutations in the MutYH gene will be determined. Clinical monitoring will be defined. Optimal amount of surgical intervention will be suggested.
