Study on the Influence of Fluoroscopy in the Diagnosis of Peripheral Lung Lesions With Endobronchial Ultrasound Guidance
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of fluoroscopy improves the diagnostic yield of peripheral pulmonary lesions' biopsy guided by radial endobronchial ultrasound (with the use of a guide sheath).
Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions
PROCEDURE: Fluoroscopy|PROCEDURE: Radial EBUS-guided biopsy
Diagnostic yield, Diagnostic yield of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy for peripheral lung lesions defined as the proportion of patients in whom a specific diagnosis is established by radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy. The analysis will be stratified by lesion size, location, the presence of the bronchus sign, type of echographic image obtained (central/peripheral), physician involved, resident involvement., Upon production of pathology results, usually within 2 weeks after the test|Sensitivity and specificity, Sensitivity and specificity are determined separately for malignancy and benign etiologies. Case records will be reviewed for patients with non-diagnostic specimen and results from other diagnostic procedures (TTNA, surgical biopsy) will be reviewed. For patients without further diagnostic tests, stability or progression of the lesion over time will be used for etiology attribution., Upon completion of ancillary or confirmatory tests, usually within 2 months after the test
Lesion localization, Proportion of patients in whom the peripheral pulmonary lesion was localized using the radial endobronchial ultrasound., Immediate (during the test)|Procedure duration, Total duration of the bronchoscopic test., During the test|Complications, occurrence of pneumothorax (and its management), bleeding more than 50ml, sustained desaturation below 90%, cardiac dysrhythmias, or any other adverse events occuring during or after the procedure., Immediately during the test and up to 4 hours after the test
