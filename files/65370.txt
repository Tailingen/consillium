Study of Intravenous Telisotuzumab Vedotin in Combination Osimertinib or Standard of Care Chemotherapy to Assess Change in Disease Activity in Adult Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has a Mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene and That Overexpresses the c-Met Protein
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a solid tumor, a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. The purpose of this study is to assess how telisotuzumab vedotin in combination with osimertinib affects the disease state compared to standard of care in adult participants with locally advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC that has a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and that overexpresses the c-Met protein. Change in disease activity will be assessed.

Telisotuzumab vedotin is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NSCLC that overexpresses the c-Met protein. Participants are randomly placed in one of the two groups to receive telisotuzumab vedotin and osimertinib or standard of care chemotherapy. Approximately 250 adult participants with locally advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC that has a mutation in the EGFR gene and that overexpresses the c-Met protein will be enrolled in the study in approximately 180 sites worldwide.

Participants will receive intravenous telisotuzumab vedotin every 2 weeks in combination with oral osimertinib tablets daily or standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/pemetrexed as prescribed by the physician). Overall duration of the study is estimated to be approximately 47 months.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.

PFS in the Population of Participants with no Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases at Baseline, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of radiographic progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 per ICR or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier. Participants with no PFS event will be censored at the last evaluable radiographic assessment per ICR. Participants with no event and no evaluable post-baseline assessment will be censored at randomization., Up to Approximately 41 Months

With the exception of 2 pain questions, which have dichotomous response categories (no or yes) and a free response if 'yes' is selected, all items on the QLQ-LC13 are scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to (very much). The items have a 1-week recall period. All scale and item scores are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing increasing symptom levels or impacts., Up to 41 Months|Change in Physical Functioning using EORTC QLQ-LC13 in the Overall Population, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is the lung cancer specific module of the core EORTC QLQ-C30.2 The QLQ-LC13 includes 13 questions that include both multi-item and single-item scales of lung cancer-associated symptoms (e.g., pain, coughing, hemoptysis, and dyspnea) and side-effects from chemo- and radiotherapy (e.g., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth and dysphagia).
