Impact of Low-intensity Chemotherapy Combined With Short-course Blinatumomab on Allo-HSCT in Adults With Ph- B-ALL
This single-arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study will enroll newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients aged 18-60 years. Participants will receive sequential low-intensity chemotherapy followed by a two-week blinatumomab induction therapy.

Treatment Protocol

1. Low-intensity chemotherapy (VIP regimen)

   * V (Vincristine): 1.4 mg/m² (max 2 mg) on days 1 and 8.
   * I (Idarubicin): 8 mg/m²/day on days 1 and 8.
   * P (Prednisone): 60 mg/m²/day (max 100 mg/day) or equivalent dexamethasone dose on days 1-14.
2. Sequential induction therapy:

   * Blinatumomab administered for 2 weeks following the VIP regimen.
3. Consolidation therapy for morphological complete remission (CR)

   * Patients achieving CR receive two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy:
   * Cycle 1: VDCP regimen (Vincristine, Daunorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Prednisone).
   * Cycle 2: VP + HD-MTX regimen (Vincristine, Prednisone + High-Dose Methotrexate).
4. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT):

   * Patients with multiparameter flow cytometry-confirmed minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status proceed to allo-HSCT.

Patients achieving morphological complete remission (CR) will undergo two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. Those with minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status confirmed by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) will proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The primary endpoint is 18-month relapse-free survival (RFS) rate, the secondary endpoints were composite response rate (CRc: CR + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery \[CRi\]), MRD-negative rate (assessed by MFC/NGS),18-month overall survival (OS) post-transplant, non-relapse mortality (NRM), cumulative incidence of acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cumulative relapse rate and 18-month GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) post-transplant.
