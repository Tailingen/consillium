Single-arm, Multi-center Clinical Study of Pyrotinib Maleate Tablets Combined With Albumin-bound Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Her2-positive Early or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
This study aimed to evaluate the Pyrotinib in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel and trastuzumab to neoadjuvant therapy efficacy and safety of Her2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel and trastuzumab
Pathological complete response rate (pCR) (ypT0/is N0), No microscopically detectable remnants of aggressive tumors in breast and axillary lymph nodes, ductal carcinoma in situ is allowed, Estimated up to 2.5 year
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects with CR or PR as the best response during the period from the beginning of the treatment to the progression of the disease or the completion of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy 【(CR+PR)/Analysis of the total number of people】.The solid tumor response assessment standard (RECIST 1.1 standard) was used to assess the objective tumor response., Estimated up to 2.5 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients with complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable disease (SD) (≥4 weeks) confirmed by the RECIST 1.1 standard among patients with evaluable efficacy., Estimated up to 2.5 year|Complete remission rate of breast pathology (bpCR）, No microscopically detectable remnants of aggressive tumors in breast, ductal carcinoma in situ is allowed, Estimated up to 2.5 year|Adverse events (AEs) [ Time Frame: From screening phase until AEs returns to Grade 0-1 or baseline ], AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE.

The type, grade and frequency of AEs will be reported., Estimated up to 2.5 year
Subjects who met the criteria for admission were treated with pyrotinib combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel and trastuzumab (q3w) neoadjuvant therapy for 6 cycles before surgery, and DCR and ORR were assessed before surgery.All subjects who are suitable for surgery undergo surgery and evaluate their pCR rate (pathological complete remission rate).After the operation, the subjects received adjuvant chemotherapy of epirubicin hydrochloride + cyclophosphamide (q3w) for 4 cycles, and at the same time, according to the researcher's recommendation, they chose the follow-up anti-HER2 treatment plan: it is recommended that subjects who have achieved pCR receive preoperative the same anti-Her2 treatment for 1 year; for non-pCR subjects, T-DM1 or trastuzumab and Pertuzumab can be used for anti-her2 treatment for 1 year.For subjects whose estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) are positive, endocrine therapy can be started at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy.If there are clinical indications at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be given.
