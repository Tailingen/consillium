A Study of IMC-TR1 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of anti-TGFβRII monoclonal antibody (IMC-TR1) in participants with advanced solid tumors, as well as gather evidence of anti-tumor activity.

BIOLOGICAL: IMC-TR1
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as an AE occurring during Cycle 1(first 6 weeks of treatment) that was considered at least possibly related to study drug, was considered dose-dependent, and fulfilled a criteria selected (using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,version 4.0 \[NCI-CTCAE v 4.0\] \[NCI 2009\]):Grade(Gr)≥3 nonhematological toxicity,Gr4 thrombocytopenia lasting at least 5 days and/or complicated with bleeding,Gr≥3 febrile neutropenia(ntr),Gr4 ntr of \>5 days' duration,increase(incr)of at least 1 gr from a preexisting Gr1 valvular insufficiency or any new Gr≥2 valvular toxicity,left ventricular(vtr) ejection fraction decrease of 10% in absolute value or 16% in relative value,incr in right vtr systolic pressure dysfunction from mild to moderate(mod) or from mod to severe,incr in left atrial or ventricular chamber size of ≥2 cm and ≥1cm respectively,any other life-threatening toxicity,significant morphologic on cardiac echocardiogram,any major ocular., First Dose Up to 6 Weeks
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IMC-TR1, The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤33% of participants experienced a DLT during Cycle 1., First Dose through Cycle 1 (6 Weeks)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of IMC-TR1 (1.25 mg/kg LY3022859 ) for Participants Receiving a Weight-Based Dose, The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤33% of participants experienced a DLT during Cycle 1., First Dose through Cycle 1 (6 Weeks)|Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), First Dose through Cycle 1 (6 Weeks)|Immunogenicity - Development of Antibodies Against IMC-TR1, Cycle 1 - Day 1 and Day 29, Cycle 2 - Day 15, Cycle 3 and Each Consecutive Cycle - Day 1|Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate [ORR]) (Antitumor Activity of IMC-TR1 as Monotherapy, Assessed Via Tumor Measurement by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1), ORR is the best response of CR or PR as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of not-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., First Dose to Measured Progressive Disease (Up To 21.3 Weeks)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC[0-tlast]) and AUCτ of IMC-TR1, AUC (0-tlast) is area under the concentration versus time curve from the time zero to tlast.

AUCτ is area under the concentration versus time curve during 1 dose interval (336 hours)., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1: 1, 2, 4, 8 hours (h); C1 D2: 24 h; C1 D3: 48 h; C1 D5: 96 h; C1 D8: 168 h; C1 D15: 336 h; C2 D15: 1, 2, 4, 8 h; C2 D16: 24 h; C2 D17: 48 h; C2 D19: 96 h; C2 D22: 168 h, C2 D29: 336 h|Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of IMC-TR1, Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1: 1, 2, 4, 8 hours (h); C1 D2: 24 h; C1 D3: 48 h; C1 D5: 96 h; C1 D8: 168 h; C1 D15: 336 h; C2 D15: 1, 2, 4, 8 h; C2 D16: 24 h; C2 D17: 48 h; C2 D19: 96 h; C2 D22: 168 h, C2 D29: 336 h|Pharmacokinetics - Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of IMC-TR1, Pharmacokinetics - Minimum concentration (Cmin) of IMC-TR1, Cycle 2 Day 1: Prior to fourth infusion 0 hour (h)
This is the first-in-human Phase 1 study of IMC-TR1.
