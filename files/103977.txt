A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Carboplatin + Paclitaxel in Subjects With Squamous NSCLC
This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III clinical study. Target population is patients with stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer who had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 + carboplatin + paclitaxel with placebo + carboplatin + paclitaxel in study population in China. SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.

In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept study treatment. Subjects who randomized into control will have the opportunity to receive cross over treatment of SHR-1210 monotherapy after confirmed disease progression. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be 4-6 which will be decided by investigators.
