Acute Kidney Injury in Cancer Patients Receiving Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Monoclonal Antibody vs Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The goal of this a retrospective real-world study is to compare the AKI events in cancer patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody (AntiVEGF) vs immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The main question it aims to answer is whether the choice between AntiVEGF and ICIs affects the risks of acute kidney injury in cancer patients.

Cancer patients receiving AntiVEGF will be compared to those treated with ICIs to see if the AKI incidence is higher in patients receiving ICIs.
AKI Incidence of Cancer Patients Receiving AntiVEGF or ICIs
DRUG: AntiVEGF|DRUG: ICIs
accumulative incidence of sustained AKI, sustained AKI will be defined as the elevation ≥1.5 times baseline sCr for ≥72hours according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) sCr criteria, 12 months after index date
