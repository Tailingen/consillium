Clinical Study of BYM338 for the Treatment of Unintentional Weight Loss in Patients With Cancer of the Lung or the Pancreas
A safety \& efficacy clinical study of the investigational medicinal product BYM338 for the treatment of unintentional weight loss in patients with cancer of the lung or the pancreas
Cachexia
DRUG: BYM338 active drug|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage Change From Baseline of Thigh Muscle Volume (TMV) by MRI Scan at Week 8, Thigh Muscle Volume (TMV) change was evaluated by a responder analysis. Patients whose loss of muscle TMV by MRI was no more than or equal to 2% at Week 8 was considered responders., Baseline, week 8
Percentage Change in Body Weight From Baseline at Week 7 and Week 9, Percentage Change in body weight from baseline in killograms (kg) at week 7 and week 9, Baseline, Week 7 and Week 9|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax), Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation were drawn on Day 1 30mg/kg BYM338 (Core)or week 8 Late 30mg/kg BYM338 (when placebo subjects were rolled over to active). PK parameters were calculated from plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Week 8|Time to Reach the Maximum Concentration After Drug Administration (Tmax), Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation were drawn on Day 1 30mg/kg BYM338 (Core)or week 8 Late 30mg/kg BYM338 (when placebo subjects were rolled over to active). Tmax was directly determined from the raw serum concentration-time data., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Week 8|Percentage Change From Baseline in Total Lean Body Mass (LBM) by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometery (DXA) Compared to Placebo: at Week 8, total lean body mass (LBM) is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).Percent Change = \[(LBM at Visit - LBM at Baseline) / LBM at Baseline\] \* 100., Baseline, Week 8|Percentage Change From Baseline of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometery (DXA) Compared to Placebo at Week 8, Bone Mineral Density (BMD)is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).Percent Change = \[(BMD at Visit - BMD at Baseline) / BMD at Baseline\] \* 100., Baseline, Week 8|Percentage Change From Baseline of Physical Activity Levels (Using the ActivPAL™ Device) Number of Steps Taken Compared to Placebo at Week 4 and 7, Each patient was required to wear the ActivPal™ for a span of 6 days at Week 4 and Week 7 for patient home activity recording. The ActivPal™ was given to patients in clinic to wear for 6 consecutive days. The ActivPAL™ records periods spent sitting, standing and walking, sit-to-stand transitions, step count and rate of stepping (cadence) over a maximum period of 10 days with a fully charged new battery., Baseline, Week 4 and Week 7|Percentage Change From Baseline of Physical Activity Levels (Using the ActivPAL™ Device) Time Sedentary Taken Compared to Placebo at Week 4 and 7, Each patient was required to wear the ActivPal™ for a span of 6 days at Week 4 and Week 7 for patient home activity recording. The ActivPal™ was given to patients in clinic to wear for 6 consecutive days. The ActivPAL™ records periods spent sitting, standing and walking, sit-to-stand transitions, step count and rate of stepping (cadence) over a maximum period of 10 days with a fully charged new battery., Baseline, Week 4 and Week 7|Percentage Change From Baseline of Physical Activity Levels (Using the ActivPAL™ Device) Time Standing Compared to Placebo at Week 4 and 7, Each patient was required to wear the ActivPal™ for a span of 6 days at Week 4 and Week 7 for patient home activity recording. The ActivPal™ was given to patients in clinic to wear for 6 consecutive days. The ActivPAL™ records periods spent sitting, standing and walking, sit-to-stand transitions, step count and rate of stepping (cadence) over a maximum period of 10 days with a fully charged new battery., Baseline, Week 4 and Week 7|Percentage Change From Baseline of Physical Activity Levels (Using the ActivPAL™ Device) Time Stepping Compared to Placebo at Week 4 and 7, Each patient was required to wear the ActivPal™ for a span of 6 days at Week 4 and Week 7 for patient home activity recording. The ActivPal™ was given to patients in clinic to wear for 6 consecutive days. The ActivPAL™ records periods spent sitting, standing and walking, sit-to-stand transitions, step count and rate of stepping (cadence) over a maximum period of 10 days with a fully charged new battery., Baseline, Week 4 and Week 7
