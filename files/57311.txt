HNSCC Immuno-genomics Project
For locally advanced and recurrent / metastatic head \& neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the is an unmet need for the development of efficient treatment combinations, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors. HNSCC have been characterized at the genetic / molecular level concerning characteristics of malignancy and potential clinical actionability ; currently, however, the integration of molecular characteristics of both the malignant cells and the host immune response are considered fundamental for the selection of treatment that best suits these patients .

The primary objective of the NCR-17-12885 project is to classify HNSCC for the selection of optimal therapeutic interventions for the patients, based on genomic characteristics and mutational processes operating in these tumours and on the prevailing activated immune pathways.

Utillization of existing bioinformatics tools. Predictions will be validated for IFNG and PD-L1 expression, different groups of cell mediated cytotoxicity, early and late inflammatory response gene expression, APOBEC and DNA repair gene expression. The aim is to finally produce a simple genomic test (because knowing the genomic status is currently unavoidable) reliably reflecting the status and potential dynamics of the tumor-host microenvironment., 10 years|Reclassification of HNSCC with the "immuno-genomics test", Molecular classification of HNSCC based on immuno-genomics test, 10 years|Publication of the results, Publication of results for further expolitation, 10 years
Herein we propose the development of a combined genomic and gene expression assay for the comprehensive evaluation of HNSCC for the classification of tumors into (a) those with activated checkpoint molecules and activated T cells, likely to respond to checkpoint inhibition in the case of non-operable disease or recurrent disease without prior treatment; (b) those with inducible checkpoint and T cell response prior to the administration of checkpoint inhibitors; (c) those with activated early inflammatory response that needs to be transformed to cell mediated activation; and (d) those with stable genomes and no immune activation probably necessitating induction of genomic instability and T cell activation.

The test to be developed will provide information on the genomic integrity of the tumor and on a global immune related gene expression profile, both by next generation sequencing
