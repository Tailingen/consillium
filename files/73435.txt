Protocol number: TLCTLC388A1008

Primary objective:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability, including maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), of Lipotecan based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) unsuitable for local treatment.

Secondary Objective:

The secondary objective is to explore the efficacy of Lipotecan based CCRT in patients with HCC and PVTT and the effect on quality of life.
