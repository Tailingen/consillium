Camrelizumab Plus Apatinib for Advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC Previously Treated With First-Line Immunotherapy
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus Apatinib in the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC previously treated with first-line immunotherapy
Advanced Non Squamous NSCLC
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is determined by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., up to 1 year
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR:

Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 by investigator., up to 1 year|Duration of Response, Duration of Response, determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate, determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is the time interval from the date of randomization to death due to any reason or lost of follow-up, up to 2 years|Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events(SAEs), The number of participants experiencing an AE and SAE will be assessed.Adverse, up to 1 year|QLQ-LC13, Quality of Life questionnaire lung cancer module 13, up to 1 years|EORTCQLQ-C30, European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer C30, up to 1 years
This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab plus Apatinib in participants with advanced non-squamous NSCLC previously treated with first-line immunotherapy. The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the Camrelizumab plus Apatinib improves progression-free survival (PFS) . All the efficacy and safety are assessed by investigator : 1) response rate (ORR), 2) duration of response(DoR), 3) overall survival(OS), 4) disease control rate (DCR); the safety and quality of life assessment Explore objective is potential biomarker associated with efficacy.
