PRICE Survey Of Extubation Following Infratentorial Craniotomy
The PRICE study primarily aims to identify predictors of early extubation following elective infratentorial craniotomy in adults. It also aims to (i) measure the rate of early extubation in different clinical settings; and (ii) study how the decision to extubate early is made and communicated in clinical practice. The first phase of the study (PRICE1) is a brief online survey addressed to physicians in charge of neurosurgical patients (neuroanesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, neurocritical care specialists) in multiple countries.
Infratentorial Neoplasms
OTHER: Survey
Prevalence of early extubation, Percentage of patients being extubated early, as estimated by responders. Early extubation is defined as extubation at the end of surgery, in the operating room, prior to discharge to recovery or intensive care., 3 months
Inventory of perceived main predictors of early extubation, Participants to the survey can select up to 3 of the following options:

Survey options are:

Patient's level of consciousness Evidence of brainstem dysfunction Patient's physical status prior to surgery History or suspicion of difficult airway Preoperative imaging Duration of surgery Course of surgery Time of day when surgery ends Other (to be completed by responder), 3 months|Personnel perceived to make the decision to extubate early, Participants to the survey can select 1 or several of the following options:

Anesthesiologist Neurosurgeon Neurocritical care physician, 3 months
