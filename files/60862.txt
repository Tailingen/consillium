A Dose Escalation Study of Duvortuxizumab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (any harmful effect of a drug) (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and preliminary clinical activity of duvortuxizumab when administered intravenously to participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies \[diffuse-large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\].

DRUG: Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Duvortuxizumab|DRUG: Part 2 (Dose Expansion): Duvortuxizumab
Part 1: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Duvortuxizumab, The RP2D will be determined based on safety, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in participants with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies \[diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\]., Approximately 15 months|Part 2: Number of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per criteria for response assessment of Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) or International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL), or complete response (CR), complete response with partial hematologic recovery (CRp), or complete response with incomplete recovery of counts (CRi) per response criteria for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)., Approximately 2 Years
Part 1 and 2: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to End of Dosing Interval (AUC tau) of Duvortuxizumab, The AUC tau is the area under the serum concentration versus time curve during a dose interval time period (tau)., Approximately 2 Years|Part 1 and 2: Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Duvortuxizumab, The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of duvortuxizumab., Approximately 2 Years|Part 1 and 2: Half-Life (t1/2) of Duvortuxizumab, The t(1/2) is defined as 0.693/Lambda (z), Approximately 2 Years|Part 1 and 2: Total Systemic Clearance (CL) of Duvortuxizumab, The CL is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body., Approximately 2 Years|Part 1 and 2: Volume of Distribution at Steady-State (Vss) of Duvortuxizumab, The Vss is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired serum concentration of duvortuxizumab at steady state., Approximately 2 Years|Part 1 and 2: Immunogenicity of Duvortuxizumab, Plasma levels of antibodies to duvortuxizumab for evaluation of potential immunogenicity., Approximately 2 Years|Part 2: Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR is defined as the time from the first observed response (CR or PR) to documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 2 Years|Part 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS) for DLBCL, FL, MCL, and CLL, The PFS is defined as the time from date of the first dose of study drug to documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 2 Years|Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR), The CR is defined as a best response of CR according to the Criteria for Response Assessment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL), International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Response Criteria for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)., Approximately 2 Years|Part 2: Percentage of Participants with Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of the study drug to the date of death for DLBCL, FL, MCL, CLL, and ALL., Up to followup (Approximately 2 Years)|Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Screening up to follow-up (Approximately 2 Years)|Part 2: Relapse-Free survival for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (RFS for ALL), Relapse free survival (RFS) is defined as time from the date of the first dose of the study drug to relapse from CR, progressive disease, or death due to any cause for ALL., Approximately 2 Years
This first in human study consists of 2 parts: a) The dose escalation part and b) The dose expansion part. This is an openlabel (all participants know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (more than one study site) study to evaluate the safety, establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to determine the preliminary efficacy of duvortuxizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. The dose escalation part of the trial (Part 1) will be comprised of 3 different patient groups based on disease indication: Group 1 (DLBCL, FL, MCL)余 Group 2 (CLL)余 Group 3 (ALL). The duvortuxizumab dosing will be done on biweekly and weekly basis. Duvortuxizumab weekly escalating dosing will be investigated. Dose escalation will begin with Group 1 and will initially follow an accelerated dose titration design, followed by a traditional 3+3 design. At each dose escalation level the treatment of the second participant should be initiated after at least 72 hours of observation after the start of the first duvortuxizumab dose of the first participant. Dose escalation in Groups 2 and 3 will follow a 3+3 design and will begin after the initial dose level in Group 1 is deemed safe. Participants \[Group 1 (DLBCL, FL, MCL), Group 2 (CLL) Group 3 (ALL)\] are enrolled into cohorts of increasing dose levels of duvortuxizumab administered in 28 day treatment cycles. Up to 3 RP2Ds may be determined in Part 1 (one RP2D for Group 1, one RP2D for Group 2, and one RP2D for Group 3). In the cohort expansion part of the trial (Part 2), participants with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies (DLBCL, FL, MCL, CLL and ALL) will be enrolled according to tumor type in up to 5 cohorts and receive duvortuxizumab at the RP2D determined in Part 1 for their disease type. The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug)余 Treatment period \[first dose of study drug until the End of Treatment Visit (within 30 days after the last dose)\]余 and follow up period \[End of Treatment Visit and continue until death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end (as determined by the sponsor), whichever occurs first\]. Number of participants who achieve an overall response in each Dose Expansion cohort will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
