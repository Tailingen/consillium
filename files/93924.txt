The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of alpelisib and olaparib compared with single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with platinum resistant or refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA mutation detected.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)
Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. If a participant has not had an event, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment, From randomization until the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to approximately 23 months
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a participant is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the participant was known to be alive, From randomization until death, assessed up to approximately 44 months|Number of participants with dose interruptions and dose reductions, Tolerability measured by the number of participants who have dose interruptions and dose reductions, From randomization until end of treatment, assessed up to approximately 18 months|Dose intensity, Tolerability measured by the dose intensity of study drug. Dose intensity will be computed as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received and actual duration of exposure., From randomization until end of treatment, assessed up to approximately 18 months|Time to definitive deterioration of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), PS will be assessed using ECOG scale. The scale consists of 6 grades (from 0 to 5) where 0 implies fully active and 5 implies dead. Time to definitive deterioration in ECOG PS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date when ECOG PS has definitively deteriorated by at least one category compared with baseline. Deterioration is considered definitive if there is no subsequent improvement in ECOG PS back to the baseline category or above., Up to approximately 18 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) with confirmed response based on BIRC assessment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, ORR with confirmed response is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as per BIRC assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 23 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) with confirmed response based on BIRC assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) with confirmed response is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed CR or PR, or stable disease (SD) lasting for a duration of at least 24 weeks. CR, PR and SD are defined as per BIRC assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 23 months|Time to response (TTR) based on BIRC assessment and according to RECIST 1.1, TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on tumor response data as per BIRC assessment and according to RECIST 1.1, From the date of randomization to the first documented response, assessed up to approximately 23 months|Duration of response (DOR) with confirmed response based on BIRC assessment and according to RECIST 1.1, DOR with confirmed response only applies to participants whose best overall response is confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST 1.1 based on tumor response data per BIRC assessment. The start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR and the end date is defined as the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer, From first documented response to first documented progression or death, assessed up to approximately 23 months|Area under the curve calculated to the end of a dosing interval (tau) at steady-state (AUCtau) of alpelisib and olaparib, The AUCtau will be assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib when administered in combination of olaparib, Day 8 Cycle 1 (pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose), Day 1 on Cycle 2, 4 and 8 (pre-dose)|Area under the curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration sampling time (AUClast)of alpelisib and olaparib, The AUClast will be assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib when administered in combination of olaparib, Day 8 Cycle 1 (pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose), Day 1 on Cycle 2, 4 and 8 (pre-dose)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of alpelisib and olaparib, The Cmax will be assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib when administered in combination of olaparib, Day 8 Cycle 1 (pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose), Day 1 on Cycle 2, 4 and 8 (pre-dose)|Time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of alpelisib and olaparib, The Tmax will be assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib when administered in combination of olaparib, Day 8 Cycle 1 (pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post dose), Day 1 on Cycle 2, 4 and 8 (pre-dose)|Change from baseline in Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Trial Outcome Index (FACT-O TOI), Health-related quality of life will be assessed by the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O). The TOI is an index driven from FACT-O summarizing patients' physical and functional well-being as well as ovarian cancer-specific symptoms driven from FACT-O. The FACT-O TOI score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life., From baseline up to approximately 44 months
This study will include adult women with platinum resistant or refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no germline BRCA mutation detected. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either alpelisib plus olaparib or single agent cytotoxic chemotherapy (paclitaxel or PLD) in this open-label, active controlled study.

Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, or until discontinuation of study treatment due to any other reason. After treatment discontinuation, all participants will enter in the post-treatment follow-up period, which consists of a safety follow-up visit and a 9-week post-progression visit. Once they complete the post-treatment follow-up, participants will then enter the survival follow-up period.
