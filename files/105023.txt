Clusterin Level and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Clusterin, a protein involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and metabolic disorders associated with inflammation and oxidative stress such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's and some malignancies, has elevated levels in metabolic syndrome, PCOS, and the combination of these two groups. Clusterin could be used as an inflammatory marker to predict PCOS and metabolic syndrome.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Ovulation Disorder
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Clusterin level
CLusterin level, primary outcome is the measurement of blood Clusterin (Apolipoprotein J) levels in healthy women with and without PCOS, 7 months
The study included 118 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria and 62 age-matched healthy women without cardiovascular risk factors. The patients diagnosed with PCOS were also classified into phenotypes. No interventional examination was requested for patients A, B, C, and D, except for hormonal tests and blood collection for Human Clusterin. The demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients were compared, with the primary outcome being blood Clusterin levels. The secondary outcomes are blood Clusterin levels in women with and without metabolic syndrome in addition to PCOS, the relationship between PCOS phenotypes and Clusterin levels, and the relationship between Clusterin levels and clinical and laboratory parameters.
