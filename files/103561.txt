Impact of Perioperative Nutritional Status and Management in the Context of Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are frequently in a situation of malnutrition, in a context of functional alteration of the digestive tract, and hypercatabolism.

As a result, nutritional support is frequently necessary perioperatively, but currently does not follow a specific protocol, and without coordination.

It then appears the need to evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition, its impact on perioperative morbidity and mortality, and current management methods.

Depending on the findings, subsequent interventional studies will be carried out on the subject, exploring the different modalities of artificial nutrition.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Study of the Severity of Perioperative Malnutrition in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, The CCI score measures a patient's postoperative outcome based on the number and severity of complications occurring on a scale of 0 to 100:

0: No complications 100: Death, Up to 1 year
