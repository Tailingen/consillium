Salivary Interleukin-32, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Levels in Children
This study aimed to evaluate the levels of interleukin 10, interleukin 6, interleukin 32 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in saliva of children with early childhood caries.
Early Childhood Caries
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ELISA
IL-32, Interleukin- 32 level, Baseline|IL-10, Interleukin- 10 level, Baseline
IL-6, Interleukin- 6 level, Baseline|Tnf-Alpha, Tnf-alpha level, Baseline
Fifty six children ( 28 with early childhood caries and 28 without early childhood caries ; age range 3-6 years) will be recruited for the study. Probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) will be recorded and saliva samples will be collected. Interleukin-32, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-6 and TNF-α will be analyzed in saliva samples by ELISA.
