Clinical and Surgical Outcomes of Thyroid Carcinoma in Children and Adolescents
This study aims to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics, causes of death, long-term survival, and surgical approaches between pediatric and adolescent follicular and papillary carcinoma by exploring data from the SEER database. The research is designed as a retrospective cohort study, primarily focused on collecting and comparing data to identify key disparities and outcomes between these two patient groups. It is anticipated that the findings will provide valuable insights into the management and prognosis of these cancers in younger populations, contributing to more targeted and effective treatment strategies.
Pediatric and Adolescent Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma|SEER Database Analysis
OTHER: Different Pathological Types (FTC vs PTC)
Overall Survival (OS), Time from diagnosis until death from any cause., Up to 20 years post-diagnosis|T (Tumor) - Primary Tumor, T describes the size and/or extent of the primary tumor, T values typically range from T0 to T4, where T0 indicates no evidence of a primary tumor (not detectable), and T4 indicates a large tumor that has significantly invaded surrounding tissues., Perioperatively/Periprocedurally|N (Nodes) - Regional Lymph Nodes, The N staging will classify the extent of lymph node involvement as follows: N0 indicates no lymph node metastasis, N1a indicates metastasis to central compartment lymph nodes, and N1b indicates metastasis to lateral neck lymph nodes., Perioperatively/Periprocedurally|M (Metastasis) - Distant Metastasis, M describes whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body (distant metastasis). M values are usually M0 or M1, where M0 indicates no distant metastasis, and M1 indicates the presence of distant metastasis., Within one month after the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma
This study is a retrospective cohort analysis aimed at elucidating the differences between pediatric and adolescent patients diagnosed with follicular and \[specific type\] carcinoma, utilizing data sourced from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database. The focus of the research is on a comprehensive comparison of various clinical aspects, including demographic characteristics, tumor features, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes.

Key areas of investigation include the examination of clinical characteristics such as tumor size, location, and stage at diagnosis, as well as treatment approaches including surgery types and their impact on patient outcomes. Additionally, the study will assess the causes of death and overall survival rates among these young patients, aiming to identify any significant prognostic factors.

By leveraging the robust and extensive data available in the SEER database, this study seeks to uncover critical insights into the management of follicular and \[specific type\] carcinoma in pediatric and adolescent populations. The findings are expected to contribute to the development of more tailored and effective therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving long-term survival and quality of life for affected patients.
