Implementation of a Rapid Recovery Program in Gynecologic Oncology Surgery: A Pilot Study
Over 600,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the United States. Despite increasing use of less invasive approaches, the majority of hysterectomies are still performed via traditional laparotomy, which can be associated with generally slower recovery and longer lengths of post-operative hospitalization. Rapid Recovery Protocols (RRP) seek to optimize post-surgical morbidity outcomes by returning a patient to normal physiology as quickly as possible following surgery.
Cervical Cancer|Uterine Endometrial Cancer|Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparotomy|DRUG: intravenous narcotics|DRUG: standard anesthesia|DRUG: regional anesthesia|DRUG: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Hospital Stay, Length of hospital stay for patients undergoing laparotomy on the gynecologic oncology service measured as whole days from the day of surgery until discharge, 1 Month
Pain Medications Used, Total daily narcotic pain medication used by patients. Narcotic use was standardized by conversion to morphine equivalents using the methods of Korff et al., Post operative - day 2|Pain Assessment, Secondary outcome is to determine if rapid recovery can improve Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain assessment. VAS scales are a horizontal line 100 mm in length with the left end labeled 'No pain' and the right end labeled 'Very severe pain'. The subject marks a point on the line that represents their perception of their current state. VAS score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) from the left end of the line to the point on the line marked by the subject. The range of possible values for this pain score is 0 to 100 mm., Day 0
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Rapid recovery protocol (regional anesthesia, pain control options with emphasis on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) over narcotic pain medications, early ambulation, and early enteral feeding) or standard of care (traditional laparatomy and supportive care).
