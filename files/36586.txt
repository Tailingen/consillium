A Study of Participants in China With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer That is Unable to be Treated With Surgery
This is a multicenter, observational cohort study in China with both primary prospective data collection and retrospective collection of prior treatment information from medical records, which enrolls and follows patients who are newly diagnosed with unresectable stage IIIB/IIIC/IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in the selected sites.

This study aims to describe the clinical practice and long-term survival benefits of patients newly diagnosed with unresectable stage IIIB/IIIC/IV NSCLC. The study also seeks to explore the condition of biomarker tests utilization, and to assess potential economic impact on patients in the real world. The safety related events will also be summarized in this study.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
Median Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first administration of anti-cancer treatment until the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Median weeks on first-line treatment, First-line treatment will be reported by class of treatment. Median, minimum, and maximum values will be used to summarize the number of weeks on the first line of treatment., Up to 2 years
Tumor Molecular Characteristics, measured by the presence of defined biomarkers, The defined biomarkers to be identified are EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase \[NTRK\] gene fusion, KRAS mutations, and MET mutations. RET rearrangement, ERBB2 (HER2) mutation, and PD-L1 expression., Up to 2 years|Treatment Cost to the Participant, measured by accrued fees; pharmacy fee, treatment fee, examinations fee, insurance coverage, and other medical costs, Up to 2 years|Number of participants with at least one adverse event, with severity determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0), Up to 2 years|Anti-cancer Treatment Duration, Up to 2 years|Number of Cycles of Anti-cancer Treatment, Up to 2 years|Number of Dose Modifications of Anti-Cancer Treatment, Up to 2 years
