The Study of Goserelin Plus Fulvestrant Comparing With Goserelin Plus Anastrozole for Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg comparing with goserelin plus anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Goserelin|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Goserelin
the efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg and the efficacy of goserelin plus anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast cancer in terms of progression-free survival(PFS), Primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time elapsed between randomization and tumor progression(by RECIST version 1.1) or death from any cause, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time elapsed between randomization and tumor progression(by RECIST version 1.1) or death from any cause.Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.
the overall response rate(by RECIST version 1.1) of patients treated with goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg and the overall response rate of patients treated with goserelin plus anastrozole., to compare overall response rate of patients treated with goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg with overall response rate of patients treated with goserelin plus anastrozole., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.|the clinical benefit rate of patients treated with goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg and clinical benefit rate of patients treated with goserelin plus anastrozole., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.
the duration of response of patients treated with goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg and duration of response of patients treated with goserelin plus anastrozole., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.|the duration of clinical benefit of patients treated with goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg and duration of clinical benefit of patients treated with goserelin plus anastrozole., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.|the safety and tolerability(by NCI CTCAE v4.0) of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg compared with goserelin plus anastrozole., Participants will be followed for an expected average of 1 year.
Premenopausal advanced breast cancer patients who failed tamoxifen treatment are possible good candidates for ovarian ablation/suppression and aromatase inhibitors.Fulvestrant has been studied little in premenopausal women despite of its attractive mechanism of actions. Based on this rationale, we introduced high-dose of fulvestrant with LHRH agonist as a randomized trial comparing with AI plus LHRH agonist.

To assess efficacy of goserelin plus fulvestrant 500mg comparing with goserelin plus anastrozole as first line endocrine therapy for pre- and perimenopausal HR+ advanced breast cancer in terms of progression-free survival(PFS)
