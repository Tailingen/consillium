A Study Evaluating the Effect of Frozen-Section Directed Excision Surgery on Vulvar Dysplasia
The purpose of this study is to compare "Frozen-Section Directed Excision", which has been a proven method of surgery used in dermatology, versus the current, standard method called "Wide Local Excision" to treat high-grade vulvar dysplasia.

Rates of positive margins for VIN 2, VIN 3, VIN 2/3 or High-grade Dysplasia NOS, Comparison of rates of positive margins for VIN 2, VIN 3, VIN 2/3 or High-grade Dysplasia NOS in subjects who undergo standard of care Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, At the time of the resection
Recurrence rates at 6 months, Comparison of recurrence rates in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, 6 months post resection surgery|Surgical time, Comparison of surgical time in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, At the time of the resection|Recovery room time, Comparison of recovery room time in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, At the time of the resection and recovery|Narcotic dose required (total during surgery and in recovery), Comparison of narcotic dose required in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, At the time of the resection and recovery|Blood loss, Comparison of blood loss in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, At the time of the resection|Primary wound closure rates, Comparison of primary wound closure rates in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, 2-week post resection surgery|Post-operative quality of life as determined by the SSQ-8, Comparison of post-operative quality of life as determined by the SSQ-8 in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, 2-weeks and 6 months after resection surgery|Sexual function as determined by the FSFI, Comparison of sexual function as determined by the FSFI in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, Screening and 6 months after resection surgery|Wound bed size after surgery, Comparison of wound bed size after surgery in subjects who undergo standard Wide Local Excision versus subjects who undergo Frozen-Section Directed Excision, End of resection surgery
This is a randomized, single-blinded study. The target population is adults ≥ 18 years of age with histological or cytological confirmation of VIN 2, VIN 3, VIN 2/3 or High-grade Dysplasia NOS with a planned excisional procedure, with high suspicion by the enrolling investigator that gross surgical margins of ≥ 3 mm can be achieved without laser or other destructive procedures. One group of subjects will be assigned to the Frozen-Section Directed Excision surgery arm and will undergo this procedure. The other group of subjects will be assigned to the Wide Local Excision (standard of care) arm and will undergo this procedure. The randomization will be 1:1, meaning for every subject who gets assigned to the Frozen-Section Directed Excision surgery arm, one will also be assigned to the Wide Local Excision arm. There is a 50% chance of getting randomized to either the Frozen-Section Directed Excision procedure or Wide Local Excision. Information regarding the surgery procedure, the amount of time the surgery procedure takes, and total amount of pain medication required during surgery and while in the surgery recovery area will be collected. The study team will also look at recurrence rates (return of the cancer) in six months, if any other therapies are required, and subject satisfaction related to the surgery, recovery, and sexual function by using questionnaires before and after the procedure.
