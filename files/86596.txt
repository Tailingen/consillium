Open-label Clinical Trial to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of Allogeneic B-cell Concentrates for Immune Reconstitution After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Measured as Response to a Antedated Single Vaccination
The reconstitution of a functioning immune system after allogeneic stem cell transplantation takes months to years. Particularly memory B-lymphocytes reconstitute poorly with the current conditioning regimes. During the period of intense immune suppression the patients are extremely susceptible to bacterial, fungal and, most importantly, viral infections.The adoptive transfer of B-lymphocytes from the stem-cell donor might significantly enhance humoral immunity for the patient. Aim of the study is to evaluate a new cellular therapy with B-lymphocytes regarding safety. A booster vaccination after B-lymphocyte transfer will evaluate the functionality of the transferred B-lymphocytes in the patient.

BIOLOGICAL: allogeneic donor derived B-lymphocytes
Number of participants with EBV DNA copies/ml plasma higher than 50,000, for 120 days after administration of study medication|Number of participants with signs of a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), for 120 days after administration of study medication|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), adverse reactions (ARs), serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse reactions (SARs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSARs), for 120 days after administration of study medication
Change in the frequency of antibody-producing cells between dose groups, before and 7 days after preponed single vaccination|Change of mean absolute number of B-lymphocytes, naÃ¯ve B-lymphocytes and memory B-lymphocytes between dose groups., 1 day before and up to 120 days after administration of study medication|Change of antigen-specific antibody concentration in serum/plasma between dose groups, 1 day before and up to 120 days after administration of study medication|Change of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA copies/ml plasma between dose groups, 1 day before and up to 120 days after administration of study medication|Number of patients with >5,000 CMV DNA copies/ml plasma or with signs of organ infestation by CMV between dose groups., up to 120 days after administration of study medication
