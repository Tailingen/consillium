EEG Parameters Between Remimazolam- and Propofol-based Anesthesia
This is an observational study comparing perioperative quantitative EEG parameters between the conventional propofol/remifentanil and remimazolam/remifentanil. We aim to compare and analyze the differences in EEG patterns during the postoperative recovery in a group that underwent remimazolam and remifentanil-based total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA), in comparison to propofol and remifentanil-based TIVA

frontal spectral power, Frontal spectral power in EEG (Electroencephalography) refers to the measurement of electrical activity in the frontal lobes of the brain across different frequency bands. Frontal spectral power specifically focuses on the electrical activity in the frontal region of the brain within these frequency bands. Different frequency bands are associated with different states of brain activity. For example, alpha waves are often associated with relaxation or idling of the brain, while beta waves are linked to more active cognitive processing., immediately after awakening at the end of the anesthesia, at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)
Riker sedation-agitation score, The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) is a medical assessment tool used to measure a patient's level of agitation or sedation. The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale typically ranges from -5 to +4, with each level representing a specific state of sedation or agitation., immediately after awakening at the end of the anesthesia, at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)
