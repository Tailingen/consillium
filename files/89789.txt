A Study of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Orelabrutinib (ICP-022) in Patients With r/r B-Cell Malignancies
This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel BTK inhibitor, Orelabrutinib (ICP-022) in Patients with B-cell malignancies. The study contains two parts, Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).
Part 1：r/r B-cell Malignancies|Part 2：B-cell Malignancies
DRUG: Orelabrutinib (ICP-022)
Part 1 Dose Escalation：The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) up to 28 days|Part 2 Dose Expansion：ORR, To assess anti-tumor activity of Orelabrutinib (ICP-022) in Patients with B-cell malignancies including r/r MCL, r/r FL, r/r MZL and CLL/SLL with/without prior treatment., Up to 2 years
Part 1 Dose Escalation：Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) [Safety and Tolerability], The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs will be collected and the safety and tolerability of ICP-022 will be assessed, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：ORR, Objective response rate, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：T1/2, Elimination half-life, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) [Safety and Tolerability], The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs will be collected and the safety and tolerability of ICP-022 will be assessed, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：DOR, Duration of response, Up to 2 years
