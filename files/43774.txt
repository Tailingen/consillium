Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec) and Paclitaxel in Recurrent Patients of Ovarian and Other Cancers of Mullerian Origin
This study is designed to determine whether the combination treatment of Paclitaxel and Gleevec on recurrent ovarian cancer patients or other cancers of mullerian origin will generate better clinical response than Paclitaxel alone.

DRUG: Gleevec/Paclitaxel
the Best Overall Clinical Response, This is defined as the percentage of participants who had either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) as the best overall response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for measurable disease or CA-125 criteria for non-measurable disease. The response is evaluated at 12 weeks of treatment., 12 weeks
Progression-free-tolerance, This is defined as the percentage of participants who continued on treatment with no progression at 12 weeks since the start of treatment.A patient will be considered to have progression-free-tolerance if she does not drop out due to toxicity and does not have disease progression or die by the completion of 12 weeks on treatment., 12 weeks|Progression-free-survival at 12 Months, This defined as the percentage of participants who had progression free survival at 12 months from the beginning of the treatment., up to 12 months
