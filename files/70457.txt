Disitamab Vedotin + Pyrotinib Versus THP in the First-line Treatment for HER2+ Advanced Breast Cancer Clinical Trial
The goal of this multicentre, randomized, double-blind controlled, phase III clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib versus the standard first-line treatment of paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) for newly diagnosed recurrent/metastatic Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive advanced breast cancer, and to explore the impact of biomarkers on clinical efficacy and safety. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Analyse the efficacy and safety of disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib versus the standard first-line treatment of THP.
* Explore the impact of biomarkers on clinical efficacy and safety of the combination of disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib treatment.

Participants in the experimental group will receive disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib for 6-8 cycles (each cycle lasting 28 days), followed by maintenance treatment with trastuzumab in combination with pyrotinib. Participants in the control group will receive paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for 6-8 cycles (each cycle lasting 21 days), followed by maintenance treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Researchers will compare disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib versus the standard first-line treatment of paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab to see if disitamab vedotin in combination with pyrotinib could be a new option for first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer|First-line Treatment
DRUG: disitamab vedotin|DRUG: Pyrotinib|DRUG: trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: taxane drug
Progression Free Survival (PFS), From enrollment to progression or death (for any reason), Estimated 30 months
Overall Survival (OS), From enrollment to death (for any reason), Estimated 8 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Ratio of complete response (CR) , partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) in all subjects, Estimated 30 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Ratio of CR and PR in all subjects, Estimated 30 months|Clinical Benefit rate (CBR), Ratio of CR,PR and SD greater than or equal to 24 weeks in all subjects, Estimated 30 months|Adverse Events (Based on CTCAE 5.0 standards), Safety, From informed consent through 28 days following treatment completion|Quality of Life (QoL) by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer (FACT-B), QoL was assessed using FACT-B. FACT-B is a 37-item questionnaire with 5 subscales assessing physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 for each question. Higher scores generally indicating a better quality of life., Estimated 30 months|Exploration of biomarkers, Next Generation Gene Sequencing (NGS) detection of tissue and blood specimens, including ERBB1/ERBB2/ERBB3/ERBB4/AKT/TP53/PIK3CA and so on. Objective to explore the correlation between biomarkers and the objective response rate (ORR), as well as progression-free survival (PFS)., Estimated 30 months
