C-reactive protein (CRP) and leucocytes are registered as they are inflammation markers., Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in creatinine, Blood values are registered from the patients hospital record in relation to assessments. Creatinine is registered due to their relation to muscle strength.., Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in hemoglobin, Blood values are registered from the patients hospital record in relation to assessments. Hemoglobin is registered due to their relation to muscle strength., Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in body fat percentage, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in fat mass, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in fat-free mass, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in muscle mass, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in bone mass, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in total body water, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in health-related quality of life, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of LifeQuestionnaire, Version 3.0 Scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher ("better") level of functioning, or a higher ("worse") level of symptoms., Baseline and 6 months after treatment start|Change in physical activity level, The International Physical Activity Questionnaires, short form. The Questionnaires covers the frequency and duration of vigorous, moderate, and walking activities over the last 7 days, as well as a single-item question on weekday sitting. Using the instrument's scoring protocol, total weekly physical activity can be calculated to three levels of physical activity and the interpretation of the questionnaire can be categorized in low, moderate and high physical activity, based on the stated time and Metabolic Equivalent of Task (METs min/week) used in different types of activities., Baseline and 6 months after treatment start
Some patients diagnosed with malignant hematological diseases are faced with poor prognosis and thus must undergo a demanding course of treatment associated with severe deconditioning potentially leading to worse prognostic outcomes. It is currently not well-described, to what extend patients body composition at the point of diagnoses should be part of standard clinical evaluation in order to optimize therapy-efficacy. Recent findings suggest that pathophysiological alterations in skeletal muscle mass and function can have significant implications for the risk of disease progression and long-term prognosis.
