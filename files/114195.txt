Metabolic Change in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases on 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT Following Radium-223 Therapy
Broadly, the objective of this study is to evaluate the fractional decline of intensity of tracer uptake measured by SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in bone metastases from prostate cancer following treatment with radium-223 as a surrogate marker for tumor cell killing.
