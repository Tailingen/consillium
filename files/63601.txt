High Dose Versus Routine Dose Icotinib in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Stable Disease
We hypothesize that higher dose icotinib is related with better efficacy. The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival of higher dose and routine dose of icotinib in treating pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with stable disease after 8-week routine dose icotinib treatment.
