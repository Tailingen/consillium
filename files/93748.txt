Safety Study of Individual Paclitaxel Dose Adjustment Based on Pharmacokinetics in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Platinum-based doublets including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or docetaxel are standard 1st regimens in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC). The traditional method of individualizing cytotoxic drug dose is by using body surface area(BSA), which is not correlated with the ability of an individual to metabolize or excrete cytotoxic drugs, because it is not related to liver function and is poorly correlated with glomerular filtration rate, and does not seem to be a determinant of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve have been shown to correlate with toxicity. The advantages of using a fixed dose of antineoplastic agents for all of the patients are obvious. Pharmacokinetically guided treatment would avoid severe adverse effects, which has not been sufficiently investigated in advanced NSCLC.First, the investigators monitor the blood concentrations of paclitaxel and neutropenia blood toxicity after chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients of NSCLC and verify suitable paclitaxel therapeutic window for Chinese patients. Then the investigators compare safety and efficacy between individual paclitaxel dose adjustment based on the therapeutic window compared with conventional dosage.
