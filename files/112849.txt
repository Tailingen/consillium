E7080 (Lenvatinib) in Combination With Dacarbazine Versus Dacarbazine Alone as First Line Therapy in Patients With Stage IV Melanoma
Primary:

* Phase Ib: To define the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine.
* Phase II: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine, compared with dacarbazine alone.

Secondary:

-Phase II: To make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of lenvatinib administered in combination with dacarbazine, compared with dacarbazine alone.
Stage IV Melanoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Dacarbazine
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Lenvatinib Administered in Combination With Dacarbazine (for Phase 1b), DLTs were defined as clinically significant adverse events (AEs) occurring less than or equal to 21 days after commencing study treatment and considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to study treatment., From Day 1 through 21 days (one cycle)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events (AEs/SAEs), Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v. 4.0) grades, and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); and performance of physical examinations. Details of AEs and SAEs are provided in the reported adverse event section., From signing of informed consent up to 30 days after the last dose, up to approximately 2 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS) (for Phase 2), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization of a participant until (1) the date of first documented progression of such participant's disease based on Investigator assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1) or (2) the date of such participant's death due to any cause. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 mm increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions, based on Investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1. If missing assessments, imputed dates were used in the analysis., From the date of randomization until the date of disease progression or death (whichever was earlier) or up to approximately 2 years
Time to Progression (TTP) (for Phase 2), TTP, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of progressive disease., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death or up to approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) (for Phase 2), OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death. Few events of deaths (9 events in the Lenvatinib + Dacarbazine arm and 4 events in the Dacarbazine arm) were reported to calculate the median OS or to draw conclusions regarding the OS., From the date of randomization until death or up to approximately 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (for Phase 2), ORR, defined as percentage of participants with best confirmed response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]). A confirmatory scan was required after no less than 4 weeks and no later than 8 weeks, starting on the date that the response was first recorded., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death or up to approximately 2 years
Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); dose limiting toxicities; performance of physical examinations; concomitant medications and procedures.
