Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT Angiography(OCTA) Deep Learning in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia Patients
This study evaluates the ability of deep learning to improve the knowledge about structural and vascular retinal changes in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia patients, using optical coherence tomography angiography.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
The measurements of retinal and choriocapillary vessel density in Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia patients., The parameters analyzed by optical coherence tomography angiography were: retinal and choriocapillary vessel density matched with clinical parameters resulted from the artificial pancreas device, up to three months
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (mak-roe-glob-u-lih-NEE-me-uh) is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells.

The optical coherence tomography angiography represents a novel and noninvasive diagnostic technique that allows a detailed and quantitative analysis of retinal and choriocapillary vascular features. The study evaluates the changes in optical coherence tomography angiography features in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, elaborating these data with artificial intelligence.
