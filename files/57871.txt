Study of Split-course Chemoradiotherapy For Locally Advanced None-small Cell Lung Cancer
This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of split-course irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy in locally advanced none-small cell lung cancer patients.

This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of split-course chemoradiotherapy(CCRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Patients receive four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 51 Gy/17 fractions and 15-18 Gy/5-6 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with about one-month break. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, which is calculated from the start of RT to the first identification of disease progression or death. Progression-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE V.4.0.
