Clinical Recruitment of Patients With First-line Targeted Drug Resistance or Intolerance to Hepatocellular Cancer With PD-1 Inhibitor (Toripalimab,JS001) Detected on the NGS Platform Combined With Anlotinib
PD-1 inhibitors have become the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular cancer, while targeted drugs such as sorafenib and lenvatinib are the first-line standard treatment for hepatocellular cancer. Recent studies have shown that PD-1 inhibitors combined with targeted drugs can improve the efficacy of hepatocellular cancer.To clear the joint treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) efficacy and evaluate its safety, we proposed to carry out the PD - 1 inhibitor (Toripalimab, JS001) joint anti-angiogenesis small molecules targeting drug anlotinib for clinical research,at the same time, based on joint solution of NGS platform testing to predict the curative effect, bring benefit for the long-term survival of patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC).
