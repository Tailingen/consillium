An Open Label Study of a Peptide Vaccine in Patients With Stage IIb or IIIa Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
EP2101 is a new cancer vaccine containing 10 different peptide antigens. The vaccine is designed to activate the immune system to develop a response against tumor cells in order to delay or prevent the recurrence of cancer. This study will test the safety and measure the level of immune stimulating capability of EP2101 in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
