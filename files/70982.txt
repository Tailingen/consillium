Alternating Systemic Chemotherapy and Intra-Arterial Melphalan (IAM) Chemotherapy in Children With Intra-Ocular Retinoblastoma
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the treatment combination of alternating standard chemotherapy and another (melphalan) chemotherapy at different interval schedules. Researchers want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the treatment combination has on the patients and their retinoblastoma.
