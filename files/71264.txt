AZD9291 Versus Placebo in Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Following Complete Tumour Resection With or Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy.
To assess the efficacy and safety of AZD9291 versus Placebo, in patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung carcinoma, following complete tumour resection with or without adjuvant chemotherapy
Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: AZD9291 80 mg/40 mg|DRUG: Placebo AZD9291 80 mg/40 mg|DRUG: Open-label AZD9291 80 mg/40 mg
Assess the Efficacy of AZD9291 Compared to Placebo as Measured by Disease Free Survival (DFS)., Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence)., Up to approximately 5 years after the first patient is randomized (maximum follow up of 70 months)
Disease Free Survival (DFS) Rate at 2, 3 and 5 Years, Defined as the percentage of patients alive and disease free at 2, 3 and 5 years, respectively, estimated from Kaplan Meier plots of the primary endpoint of DFS., Up to approximately 5 years after the first patient is randomized (maximum follow up of 70 months). DFS rate at 2 years (%), 3 years (%) and 5 years (%) are presented.|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 7 years after the first patient is randomized (maximum follow up of 86 months)|Overall Survival Rate at 2, 3 and 5 Years, Defined as the percentage of patients alive at 2, 3 and 5 years, respectively, estimated from a Kaplan Meier plot of OS., Up to approximately 7 years after the first patient is randomized (maximum follow up of 86 months). OS rate at 2 years (%), 3 years (%) and 5 years (%) are presented.|Patient Health-related Quality of Life and Symptoms (HRQoL) by SF-36v2 Health Survey., Change from baseline will be calculated for each domain and summary scale at each scheduled post-baseline assessment. The SF-36 includes eight domains: Physical Functioning (PF); Role Limitations-Physical (RP), Vitality (VT), General Health Perceptions (GH), Bodily Pain (BP), Social Function (SF), Role Limitations-Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH) and two summary scores: The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Final scores for each scale range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health., Measured by SF-36 Questionnaire at baseline, 12 week, 24 week and then every 24 weeks until study complete, disease recurrence or other discontinuation criteria met, up to 3 years.|Plasma Concentrations of AZD9291, The pharmacokinetics exposure parameters derived from plasma concentrations of AZD9291, Collected at pre-dose, 0.5-1.5hours and 2-4hours post-dose up to 96 weeks (approximately 24 months)|Plasma Concentrations of AZ5104 Metabolites, The pharmacokinetics exposure parameters derived from plasma concentrations of AZ5104 metabolites, From date of dosing to week 96 (approximately 24 months)|Plasma Concentrations of AZ7550 Metabolites, The pharmacokinetics exposure parameters derived from plasma concentrations of AZ7550 metabolites, From date of dosing to week 96 (approximately 24 months)
This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD9291 versus placebo in patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with centrally confirmed, most common sensitising EGFR mutations (Ex19Del and L858R) either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations as confirmed by a central test, who have had complete tumour resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should have consisted of a platinum based doublet given for a maximum of 4 cycles.
