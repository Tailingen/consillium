SBRT Combined with Camrelizumab and Apatinib for Conversion Therapy in Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
•This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phases 2 and phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with Camrelizumab and Apatinib as conversion therapy versus Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib as first-Line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
