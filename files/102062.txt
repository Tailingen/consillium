Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions as assessed by the Investigator: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., up to 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first., up to 24 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) lasting 24 weeksin the ITT analysis set., up to 24 months|Duration of Overall Response(DoR), ime from first recording to CR or PR to disease progression or all-cause death., up to 24 months|Time to response (TTR), TR defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the first objective tumor response when CR or PR is observed., up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Time to death from any cause from the date of first dose of study treatment, up to 24 months|adverse event(AE), Evaluation performed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI)- Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE)v.5.0., Throughout the experiment, assessed up to 24 months.
