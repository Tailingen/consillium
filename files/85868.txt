Comparison of Laparoscopic and Open Surgery for Colorectal Malignancy in Obese Patients
The goal of this observational study is to compare laparoscopic and open surgery outcomes in colorectal cancer patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 . The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

1. the short-term outcome and postoperative outcomes of patients treated with open group versus laparoscopy group
2. the long-term oncologic outcome of patients treated with open group versus laparoscopy group

This study is a retrospective and observational study. Subjects were not be given or offered any treatment during the study. The investigator reviewed the patient's medical history and examination report to determine eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

If there is a comparison group: Researchers compared the open group and laparoscopy group to see if the laparoscopic group have better short-term outcomes with comparable oncologic outcomes to the open group.

This study is a retrospective and observational study. Subjects were not be given or offered any treatment during the study. The investigator reviewed the patient's medical history and examination report to determine eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Given the uncertainty regarding the long-term outcomes of laparoscopy in obese patients with CRC, this study aimed to analyse a decade of data comparing laparoscopic and open surgery outcomes in patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 who had undergone treatment for CRC at the Linkou Chang Gung Hospital.
