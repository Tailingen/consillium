Rituximab Plus CHOP Chemotherapy for Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,prednisone (R-CHOP) in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in Malawi.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma|HIV
DRUG: R-CHOP
Number of DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP who experience NCI grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities, Safety will be assessed by grading toxicity events according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAEv4) other than for hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab. Toxicities will be assessed, graded and documented by investigators at each clinic visit, and then tabulated., 5 years|Number of patients who experience treatment-related death over a course of six cycles, 5 years
Number of DLBCL patients by HIV status receiving R-CHOP who experience grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities over a course of six cycles, 5 years|Number of patients receiving ≥ 90% of the prescribed doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, respectively among DLBCL patients in Malawi with HIV infection, 24 months|Number of patients receiving ≥ 90% of the prescribed doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, respectively among DLBCL patients in Malawi without HIV infection, 24 months|Number of patients with progression free survival with R-CHOP administered, 5 years|Number of patients with overall survival with R-CHOP administered, 5 years|Number of patients with complete response rates with R-CHOP administered, 24 months|Number of years from treatment initiation until disease progression or death., Questionnaire - health-related quality of life (via the EORTC QLQ-C30) among DLBCL patients in Malawi overall and with and without HIV infection receiving R-CHOP, 5 years|Number of years gained after rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy administered, 5 years
The study is a single-center, non-randomized phase II clinical trial of R-CHOP for CD20-positive DLBCL, using the Indian generic biosimilar for rituximab, Reditux™. The investigators will enroll 40 adult patients age 18-60 years (20 HIV-infected with CD4 count ≥ 100 cells/µL, 20 HIV-uninfected) who will receive a maximum of 6-8 cycles of R-CHOP over 18-24 weeks. The primary goal of this study is to establish the safety of R-CHOP in the Malawi population.

Secondary objectives of the study include estimates of complete response (CR) rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In addition, quality of life, costs of care, study patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and other published data from the region will be collected and used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of R-CHOP. If the investigators' study supports incorporating rituximab into treatment regimens in sub-Saharan Africa, this strategy can be examined in larger trials, and provide momentum to increase access to modern cancer medicines globally.
