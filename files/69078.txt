Study of IMGN632 in Patients With Untreated BPDCN and Relapsed/Refractory BPDCN
This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to determine the MTD and assess the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and anti-leukemia activity of IMGN632 when administered as monotherapy to patients with CD123+ disease.
