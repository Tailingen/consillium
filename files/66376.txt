Donor-Derived Ex-Vivo Expanded Natural Killer Cell Infusions in Children and Young Adults With High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Myeloablative HLA-Haploidentical Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
This is a Phase II pilot study to determine the efficacy of three fixed dose (1 x 108/kg) infusions of ex-vivo expanded human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor natural killer (NK) cells (haploNK) in children and young adults with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (haploHCT) with a busulfan and cyclophosphamide-based myeloablative conditioning regimen and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The investigators will also demonstrate the feasibility of performing this trial in a multi-center study.

The investigators hypothesize that the infusion of haploNK in this setting will facilitate immune reconstitution and decrease relapse rates and infectious complications without increasing GVHD, resulting in improved survival as compared to recent historical cohorts of haploHCT without NK cell infusion.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Donor-Derived Ex-Vivo Expanded Natural Killer Cell Infusions
1-year RFS, The proportion and corresponding 95% exact binomial CI of patients who are relapse-free at 1-year from day of transplant (Day 0), 1 year
Number of functional donor-derived NK cells generated from the device, Product manufacturing failure is defined as inability to generate sufficient NK cell product due to failure to meet release criteria or insufficient cells for at least one full dose (â‰¤10\^8/NK cells/kg ABW)., 2 years|GVHD incidence, The incidence of Grade II- IV aGVHD (Day +100) and cGVHD (Day+180, +1 year), opportunistic infections (+1 year), and OS (+1 year and +2 year)., 2 years|KIR ligand-ligand mismatch, The presence of KIR ligand-ligand mismatch between HLA-haploidentical donor and host and the impact on relapse rate., 2 years|Incidence of mixed donor chimerism, Mixed donor chimerism is defined as \>5%, but \<95%, donor cells detected. Full donor chimerism is defined as \>95% donor., 2 years|Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment, The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment from the time of transplant will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death and relapse prior to engraftment as the competing risk. The definition of neutrophil engraftment is a post-nadir ANC \> 500/mm3 for three consecutive laboratory values obtained on different days. The first of the three days will be designated as the day of neutrophil recovery., 2 years|Cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment, The cumulative incidence of platelet engraftment from the time of transplant will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death and relapse prior to engraftment as the competing risk. The definition of platelet engraftment is sustained platelet count \> 20,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first of three consecutive measurements on different days will be designated as the day of initial platelet recovery., 2 years
