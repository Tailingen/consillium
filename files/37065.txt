Radiation Dose Escalation in Esophageal Cancer
The aim of this trial is to find the maximum tolerable dose of radiation that can be delivered combined with chemotherapy (DDP \& Paclitaxel) in patients with inoperable or medically unresectable esophageal cancer.

Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Occurring in Participants, The DLTs were defined as grade \>/=4 esophatitis, any other grade \>/=3 nonhematological toxicity (except nausea and vomiting), or grade \>/=4 hematological toxicity lasting more than 7 days, which are possibly, probably, or definitely associated with protocol treatment occurring during and after completion of the HFRT boost treatment., 15 months
Local Failure, Local failure will be assessed radiographically using endoscopy with biopsy, CT scan, and a positron emission computed tomography-CT scan. which was defined as persistence /recurrence of the tumor in the radiation therapy field., 15 months
The RTOG 8501 has established concurrent radiochemotherapy as the standard of care for cancer of the esophagus.However, locoregional remain problematic, with 25% of patients having persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease following the combined modality approach. New regimen is urgently needed for improving localregional control and survival.
