SGT-53 in Children With Recurrent or Progressive CNS Malignancies
An early phase 1 for pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive CNS malignancies
Childhood CNS Tumor
GENETIC: SGT-53|RADIATION: Radiation|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose. The safety will be assessed by the number and severity of any AE or serious adverse events (SAE) experienced by the patients, and by their relationship to the study drug SGT-53 (e.g. definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated). Severity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0., up to 13 months
Response Rate, The response rate will be calculated from the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment., 36 months|Duration of Response, The duration of response will be the time calculated from documentation of tumor response as indicated by response criteria, to disease progression., 36 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be calculated from date of original diagnoses to death and also from the date of study registration to death., 36 months|Progressive-Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated at all times during follow-up, with particular interest in the 6-month time point. Progression free survival will be calculated from date of first treatment to the date of first observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurological progression or increasing steroid requirements (applies to stable disease only), death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment., 36 months|Characterization of Phenotype of Patients, Tissue will be obtained from each enrolling patient for subsequent testing for TP53 pathway functionality, including assessment of mdm2, p21, and other mutation or expression alterations. This analysis will also include measures of commonly assessed polymorphisms, including MGMT methylation assessment, ATRX mutation among others., 4-5 days|Feasibility of Droplet PCR Assays to Monitor for Tumor Burden, Droplet PCR will be used to assess for the presence of circulating tumor DNA, 12 months
This clinical trial is a early phase 1, open label, single center, single arm study of the combination of intravenously administered SGT-53 and irradiation and/or chemotherapy in pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive CNS malignancies. The objective of the study is to establish the safety and feasibility of administration of SGT-53 in conjunction with conventional radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy in children with recurrent or refractory CNS malignancies.
