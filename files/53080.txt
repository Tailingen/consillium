VIDeOS for Smoking Cessation
The purpose of the current study is to pilot the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of an evidence-based smoking cessation intervention adapted for cancer patients and delivered via video. Investigators aim to assess if this intervention is considered acceptable by participants, feasible to implement, and effective at increasing knowledge about smoking cessation before conducting a fully powered clinical trial.

Acceptability, Acceptability will be measured using the Acceptability of Intervention measure, which contains four items with answer options on a scale from 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher acceptability. We will consider the intervention "acceptable" if an average score of 4 or higher is obtained., 1 week post-randomization|Feasibility, Feasibility will be measured using the Feasibility of Intervention measure, which contains four items with answer options on a scale from 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher feasibility. We will consider the intervention "feasible" if an average score of 4 or higher is obtained., 1 week post-randomization|Retention Rates, We will determine if there are differences in retention rates between intervention groups., 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-randomization
Changes in knowledge about quitting smoking, We will assess changes in knowledge about tools to quit smoking and the role of nicotine, etc. from prior to randomization (before the intervention is delivered) to post-randomization follow-ups. These questions will be generated by the study investigators based on video content., Baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-randomization|Changes in smoking behaviors, We will assess the number of 24-hour quit attempts and 7-day point prevalence at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 month follow-ups., 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-randomization
A randomized controlled pilot study is being conducted to test the acceptability and feasibility of a smoking cessation intervention tailored for cancer patients that is delivered via video. Participants will be in a video intervention or control group that receives information about quitting smoking. Participants will complete surveys prior to randomization, and will complete additional surveys one week, one month, and three months post-randomization to provide their thoughts about the videos, information about changes to smoking behaviors, and knowledge about quitting smoking.
