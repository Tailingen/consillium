Inflammatory Bowel disease (Crohn, Ulcerative colitis) and colorectal cancer are frequent affections and the microbiota plays a major role in their physiopathology involving the immune system. In this setting, the interplay between gut microbiota and brain is still unexplored.

To evaluate the interaction of the microbiota and the immune system with the host in these two chronic diseases, we aim to create a prospective biobank.

A small amount of tissue will be taken during surgery. A whole blood, plasma and stoll samples will also be taken from the patient.

All samples will be anonymized.
