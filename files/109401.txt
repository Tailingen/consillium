MR Based Survival Prediction of Glioma Patients Using Artificial Intelligence
This registry aims to collect clinical, molecular and radiologic data including detailed survival data, clinical parameters, molecular pathology (1p/19q codeletion, MGMT methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, etc) and conventional/advanced/new MR sequences (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, ADC, DTI, PWI, etc) of patients with primary gliomas. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this registry will seek to construct and refine algorithms that able to predict patients' survivals in the frame of molecular pathology or subgroups of gliomas.

Non-invasive and precise prediction for survivals of glioma patients is challenging. With the development of artificial intelligence, much more potential lies in the preoperative conventional/advanced MR imaging (T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging) could be excavated to aid prediction of patients' prognosis in the frame of molecular pathology of gliomas. The creation of a registry for primary glioma with detailed survival data, molecular pathology, radiological data and with sufficient sample size for deep learning (\>1000) provides opportunities for personalized prediction of survival of glioma patients with non-invasiveness and precision.
