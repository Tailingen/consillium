The Clinical Markers for PARP Inhibitors-related Efficacy in Ovarian Cancer
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. PARP inhibitors(PARPi) are an important progress in EOC treatment. The available evidence suggests that BRCAmt or HRD-positive is an effective biological marker for PARPi. However, in our previous clinical observation, it was found that the tumor burden may be the potential clinical markers PARPi. We intend to develop a real-world study to confirm the potential clinical markers and explore new clinical markers for PARPi.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first date of response until the date of first documented progression., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 5.0 to further describe safety and assess toxicities encountered with the use of the proposed treatment regimen in participants., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This study intends to conduct a systematic real-world study to observe the relationship between the clinical characteristics of EOC patients and the efficacy of PARPi based on our existing research foundation and stratified analyse these correlations by BRCA and HRD status.
