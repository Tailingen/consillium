Evaluation of Optimal Treatment Duration of Bevacizumab Combination With Standard Chemotherapy in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the early and continuous addition of bevacizumab for up to 30 months to the standard chemotherapy is more effective than the early and continuous addition of bevacizumab for up to 15 months.
