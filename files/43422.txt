Avelumab Plus 2nd-generation ADT in African American Subjects With mCRPC
This is a nonrandomized, open-label trial of avelumab in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) experiencing PSA or radiographic progression while receiving 2nd generation ADT (abiraterone / enzalutamide/ apalutamide or darolutamide). Metastases must be radiographically evident by whole body bone scintigraphy or CT/MRI scan.

Thirteen African American subjects will be enrolled into the initial cohort.

If at least one positive response (PSA decrease by \>50% and or radiographic per RECIST 1.1) is found, the study will be expanded to accrue a total of 27 patients. The trial will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.

Subjects enrolled in the study will receive avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and continue their previously started 2nd generation ADT (abiraterone or enzalutamide).

Treatment with avelumab will continue until documented confirmed disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject discontinuation from the study, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, subject receives 52 administrations of avelumab (approximately 2 years), or administrative reasons requiring the cessation of treatment.

After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring (serious AEs will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will remain on study and continue to undergo study-related disease assessments until documented disease progression, initiation of a new non-study prostate cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will enter survival follow up, and will be contacted at their regularly scheduled clinic visit, or by telephone approximately every 6 months, until death or withdrawal of consent or end of study.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Avelumab|DRUG: 2nd generation ADT (abiraterone or enzalutamide)
Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Greater Than or Equal to 50%, The primary endpoint is a PSA response at 8 weeks or greater from starting study treatment and with a minimum of 3 treatments administered.

A PSA response is defined as a â‰¥50% PSA decline at 8 weeks or greater from the time of starting study treatment. The two-stage minimax design of the study will be utilized to determine whether further investigation of the study drug is warranted., 8 Weeks, 6 months
PSA Progression-free Survival (PFS), PSA progression-free survival (pPFS) defined as the time from enrollment until PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) or death, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects without pPFS at the time of data cut-off will be censored at the date of last adequate cancer assessment. PSA progression-free survival will be reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates, with 95% confidence interval for median time-to-event., pPFS will be assessed 12 months after enrollment of last subject.|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (PFS), Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) defined as the time from enrollment until radiographic progression by PCWG3 or death, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects without rPFS at the time of data cut-off will be censored at the date of last known to be alive. Radiographic progression-free survival will be reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates, with 95% confidence interval for median time-to-event., rPFS will be assessed 12 months after enrollment of last subject.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from enrollment until death on study. Subjects who are alive at the time of data cut-off will be censored at the date of last known to be alive. OS will be reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates, with 95% CI for median time-to-event., Overall survival with be assessed at 3 years from time of enrollment of last study subject.

The trial will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices.

Subjects enrolled in the study will receive avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and continue their previously started 2nd generation ADT (abiraterone or enzalutamide).

All subjects will undergo radiographic imaging assessments and PSA assessments to evaluate response to treatment at regular intervals. On study imaging will be assessed every 12 weeks. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be adapted per the consensus guidelines of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) as described in Appendix A/B to account for the tumor progression patterns seen in bone metastases in prostate cancer. PSA will be obtained every 2 weeks with PSA progression assessed per PCWG3.

Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.

Treatment with avelumab will continue until documented confirmed disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject discontinuation from the study, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, subject receives 52 administrations of avelumab (approximately 2 years), or administrative reasons requiring the cessation of treatment.

After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring (serious AEs will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will remain on study and continue to undergo study-related disease assessments until documented disease progression, initiation of a new non-study prostate cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will enter survival follow up, and will be contacted at their regularly scheduled clinic visit, or by telephone approximately every 6 months, until death or withdrawal of consent or end of study.
