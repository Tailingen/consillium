Results of the Semi-Structured Interviews with Parents, Analysis of the interview transcripts = verbatim analysis Individual semi-structured interviews will be conducted via videoconference, with an estimated duration of 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. An interview guide has been developed to define the key dimensions to be explored. Each interview will be audio-recorded using a voice recorder and then fully transcribed.

The interviews will undergo a thematic content analysis to identify meaningful patterns ("nodes of meaning") within participants' narratives, using an inductive approach. A double coding will be performed by two investigators on five interviews to strengthen the thematic framework. The remaining interviews will be coded by a single investigator, Socio-demographic data and interview transcripts will be collected during the semi-structured interviews (lasting between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours), thus at a single time point (Day 1). No follow-up is required.
