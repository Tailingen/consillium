Staggered, Chemo-Immunotherapy With Durvalumab, MEDI4736 Pemetrexed & Carboplatin (PC) for Metastatic Non-Squamous NSCLC
This is a Phase II, open label, randomized study of durvalumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin in eligible adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The study will focus on the efficacy of two alternative staggered dosing regimens.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin
Rate of clinical benefit, Described using RECIST 1.1 response criteria., up to 5 years
Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and assessed by CTCAE, v5.0 for assessment of safety and feasibility., up to 5 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Assessed using RECIST 1.1, up to 5 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Assessed as the time between trial initiation and documented progression or radiographic imaging., up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), assessed as the time from trial initiation until death from any cause., up to 5 years
This trial will evaluated two different schedules of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy while simultaneously measuring immune activation, immune resistance and host factors. Both arms will consist of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin, but in arm 1 the chemotherapy will precede the immunotherapy by a week and in arm 2 the immunotherapy will precede the chemotherapy by a week. Staggering these therapies still allows concurrent administration while allowing some degree of temporal isolation to better understand the contributions by chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this setting. Host and laboratory factors will be measured during treatment. We hypothesize that staggered dosing of immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit.
