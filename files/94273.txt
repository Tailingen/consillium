Assessment of Disease Control Rate (DCR), To evaluate anti-tumor activity of oregovomab added to niraparib by Disease Control Rate, defined as the portion of subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) at week 12. The DCR will be determined as defined by RECIST 1.1, At 12 weeks|Assessment of Disease Control Rate (DCR), To evaluate anti-tumor activity of oregovomab added to niraparib by Disease Control Rate, defined as the portion of subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) at week 24.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as date of first dose of study treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression as per RECIST v1.1, Baseline up to two years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the portion of subjects who survive for 24 months after first dose., Baseline up to two years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) to alternate next-line therapy-initiated post Week 12 measured at Week 24 relative to their Week 12 assessment ((new baseline)., Week 12 to Week 24
Phase 2 single arm open label study to evaluate the combination of oregovomab and niraparib as a combinatorial immune priming strategy in subjects with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Approximately 15 subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 10 evaluable subjects.

The study will include:

* Screening period up to 28 days prior to start of study treatment.
* Treatment period up to 24 weeks.
* Post-treatment follow-up period:
* Safety Follow-up: all subjects will be followed at least 30 days after end of treatment for safety.
* Long Term Follow-up: all subjects will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months for 1 year, until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or sponsor decision to close the study; or whichever comes first.
