First-in-Human Study of TAK-280 in Participants With Solid Tumors
The main aim of this study is to find out the safety, tolerability, and effect of TAK- 280 in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer who have experienced treatment failure or are intolerant to standard therapies.

Participants will be treated with TAK-280 for up to 14 treatment cycles. Each treatment cycle will be 28 days.

After the last dose of study drug, participants will be followed up for survival every 12 weeks for a total of 48 weeks.

This study consists of 2 phases: Dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phase.

Dose-escalation phase:

The purpose of the dose-escalation phase is to generate data to characterize the initial safety and tolerability profile of TAK-280 and determine the 2 recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) of TAK-280 to be administered during the cohort-expansion phase.

Cohort-Expansion Phase:

The cohort expansion phase will be conducted in 3 indications. Only in 1 selected indication participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TAK-280 high dose or low dose. In the remaining 2 indications to be studied in the cohort-expansion phase, participants will receive only one dose level of TAK-280.
