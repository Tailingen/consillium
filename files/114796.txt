Prognostic Study of Sentinel Lymph Node and Bone Marrow Metastases in Women With Stage I or Stage IIA Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes and bone marrow may improve the ability to detect and determine the extent of cancer.

PURPOSE: Phase III prognostic study of sentinel lymph node metastases and bone marrow metastases in women who have stage I or stage IIA breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|PROCEDURE: lymphangiography|PROCEDURE: sentinel lymph node biopsy|PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|RADIATION: whole breast irradiation
Overall survival, Up to 10 years
Disease-free survival, Up to 10 years|Axillary recurrence following detection of negative SN with H&E staining in women who did not have an ALND, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the prevalence and evaluate the prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry in women with stage I or IIA breast cancer.
* Estimate the prevalence and evaluate the prognostic significance of bone marrow micrometastases detected by immunocytochemistry in these patients.
* Evaluate the hazard rate for regional recurrence in women whose sentinel nodes are negative by hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining.
* Provide a mechanism for identifying women whose sentinel nodes contain metastases detected by H\&E so that these women can be considered as candidates for ACOSOG-Z0011.
