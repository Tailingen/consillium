Cisplatin/Vinorelbine/Bevacizumab Followed by Docetaxel/Gemcitabine/Bevacizumab Versus the Cisplatin/Docetaxel/Bevacizumab Combination in Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
This trial will evaluate whether the sequential administration of Cisplatin/Vinorelbine/Bevacizumab followed by Docetaxel/Gemcitabine/Bevacizumab versus the Cisplatin/Docetaxel/Bevacizumab combination as first line treatment offers a survival advantage in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

An unanswered question in first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is whether the administration of more than 2 active drugs provides greater efficacy than a two-drug combination. Docetaxel/gemcitabine combination is a well tolerated regimen, which has comparable efficacy to docetaxel/cisplatin or vinorelbine/cisplatin. In a recent phase II study in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC, the sequential administration of vinorelbine/cisplatin followed by docetaxel/gemcitabine produced a response rate of 45.8% and a 1-year survival rate of 51%. The addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen provided a survival benefit in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
