Plasma MicroRNA for Prediction of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
100 patients with diagnosed HCV were evaluated by clinical and ultrasound examination and were categorized as uncomplicated HCV (n=22) and complicated HCV (n=78). All patients were evaluated for hepatosteatosis and liver fibrosis using the computerized hepatorenal index, the hepatic steatosis index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/platelet count index (APRI) and the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores. Blood samples were obtained for estimation of serum levels of liver function tests and plasma levels of microRNA 21 and 126.
