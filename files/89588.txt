Positive Node Traced Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC)
To investigate this regression model by injecting and tracing carbon nanoparticles (CNs) into the fusion node prior to NAC in patients with breast cancer.

The spatial distribution of positive nodes in axillary after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pectoralis minor location, After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whether positive nodes remission (transform to negative), from Level III to Level II, and from Level II to Level I. This means that if the nodes at Level I are negative, the nodes at Level II or Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level II are negative, the nodes at Level III will be negative; if the nodes at Level III are positive, the nodes at Level I and Level II will be positive., During the surgery
The spatial distribution of black-stained in axillary after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pectoralis minor location, If the chemotherapy is sensitive, the number of black-stained nodes will increase from Level I, Level II, to Level III. If the chemotherapy is resistance, the number of black-stained nodes will remain the original number or a little increasing locally., During the surgery|The spatial distribution of positive nodes in axillary after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on intercostobrachiales nerves (ICBN) location, After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whether positive nodes remission (transform to negative), from above ICBN to below ICBN. This means that if the nodes below ICBN are negative, the nodes above ICBN will be negative; if the nodes above ICBN are positive, the nodes below ICBN will be positive., During the surgery
Guided by ultrasound, 0.3 mL of CNs suspension was injected in a fusion node prior to NAC in 110 patients with local advanced breast cancer. Patients underwent breast surgery and total axillary lymph node dissection following 2-6 cycles of NAC. The distribution by intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) of positive nodes, black-stained nodes and lymphovascular invasion was investigated by response to NAC.
