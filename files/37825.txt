Nelmastobart in Combination with Trifluridine/Tipiracil and Bevacizumab in Metastatic/Recurrent Colorectal Cancer
The objective of this multi-center, single-group, open-label Phase Ib/II study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of nelmastobart in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil and bevacizumab in metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer patients with resistance or intolerance to oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in BTN1A1-positive patients.
