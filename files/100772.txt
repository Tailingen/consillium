the Effect of Environmental Factors on Colorectal Cancer Based on Macrogenomes
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on the occurrence, development and prognosis of colorectal cancer; to identify metabolic markers specific to colorectal cancer patients, which will provide a basis for early diagnosis, early intervention and individualized treatment; and to comprehensively understand the mechanism of the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer by integrating the data of environmental factors and the macro-genome, and to develop new predictive and therapeutic strategies.
