A Study of ES101 (PD-L1x4-1BB Bispecific Antibody) in Patients With Advanced Malignant Thoracic Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, RP2D and PK/pharmacodynamic profile of ES101 monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and to further evaluate the antitumor efficacy of ES101 in advanced malignant thoracic tumors, including NSCLC and SCLC.
Thoracic Tumors|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ES101
Phase 1b: Frequency and severity of adverse events of ES101, Adverse events will be assessed and assigned by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0., 1-2 years|Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of of ES101, RP2D of ES101 will be determined., 6 months|Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor response will be determined by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECISTv1.1)., 2-3 years
Anti-tumor activity of ES101, Tumor response will be determined by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECISTv1.1)., 2-4 years|PK profile of ES101, Assess the relationship between ES101 exposure and efficacy/adverse events., 2-4 years|Immunogenicity of ES101, Frequency of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against ES101 will be determined., 2-4 years|Pharmacodynamic markers, Assess PD-L1 receptor occupancy and cytokines, 2-4 years|PD-L1 expression, Assess PD-L1 expression status of tumor tissues, 2-4 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, RP2D and PK/pharmacodynamic profile of ES101 monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and to further evaluate the antitumor efficacy of ES101 in advanced malignant thoracic tumors, including NSCLC and SCLC.
