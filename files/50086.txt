Personalized Tumor Neoantigen mRNA Therapy for Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of personalized tumor neoantigen mRNA therapy iNeo-Vac-R01 combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: individualized anti-tumor new antigen iNeo-Vac-R01 injection|DRUG: Gemcitabine + cisplatin (GP)|DRUG: Sintilimab injection
Safety and tolerable dose, According to the Commonly Used Adverse Events Criteria (CTCAE Version 5.0), the number of subjects with adverse events and/or dose-limiting toxicity was counted as an indicator of the safety and tolerable dose of iNeo-Vac-R01 injection. The evaluation period was the dosing observation period and the safety follow-up period., 21±3 days after the last dose
Objective reponse rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who had tumor evaluated as PR according to RECIST1.1 criteria during the whole study, Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who had tumor evaluated as PR or SD according to RECIST1.1 criteria during the whole study., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival （PFS）, The time from enrolled to disease pregression or death from any cause during the whole study., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The time from enrolled to death from any cause during the whole study., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival Rate (1-Y-OS%,2-Y-OS%,3-Y-OS%), The percentage of patients surviving at 12, 24, and 36 months., Up to 3 years
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of personalized tumor neoantigen mRNA therapy iNeo-Vac-R01 combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
