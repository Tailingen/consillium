An Observational Study of First-Line Bevacizumab (Avastin) With Fluoropyrimidine-Based Chemotherapy in Participants With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This multicenter observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Participants for whom the treating physician has decided to initiate first-line fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab will be observed for approximately 4 years.
