Haplo-identical/Mismatched Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only curative treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially for advanced MDS (blast \>5%). However, many patients cannot find an HLA-matched donor. haploidentical donor is an alternative stem cell source.

the study hypothesis: Haploidentical/mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve the survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
Advanced MDS Without Identical Sibling Donor
PROCEDURE: transplant with haploidentical donor
survival rate, number of participants with survival at one year, participants will be followed for an expected average of one year
incidence of non-relapse mortality, number of participants with non-relapse mortality at one year, one year
