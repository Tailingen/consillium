Treatment of Patients With Advanced Renal Cancer With a Radiolabeled Antibody, Yttrium-90 Conjugated Chimeric G250
This was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of yttrium-90 conjugated chimeric G250 (\^90Y-DOTA-cG250) in patients with advanced, measurable clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Study objectives were to determine the safety, targeting, and dosimetry of \^90Y-DOTA-cG250, using indium-111 conjugated chimeric G250 (\^111In-DOTA-cG250) as a surrogate, as well as to evaluate the immunogenicity of cG250.

Number of Patients With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), version 3.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported based on clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from pre-treatment through the study period. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as follows for the purposes of dose escalation: Grade 4 hematopoietic toxicity in excess of 5 days or Grade 3 or greater nonhematopoietic toxicity., Continuously for up to 5 months
Number of Patients Who Met Protocol-Specified Criteria to Receive ^90-Y-DOTA-cG250 Following ^111In-DOTA-cG250 Administration, In order to receive the therapeutic \^90Y-DOTA-cG250 injection on Day 8, 9, or 10, patients must have demonstrated tumor targeting to lesions \> 2 cm detected by CT scan and must not have exhibited the following characteristics following the nontherapeutic injection of \^111In-DOTA-cG250: excessive liver and/or spleen uptake; excessive uptake in the normal kidney; non-visualization of the cardiac blood pool in the first imaging set; whole body clearance half-life (t1/2) \< 1.5 days; serum t1/2 \< 2 days; rapid clearance of the radiopharmaceutical from the blood pool with prominent marrow uptake on the first image., Up to 5 months|Number of Patients With Samples Collected for Evaluation of Human Antichimeric Antibody, Blood samples were drawn for evaluation of the human antichimeric antibody (HACA) at screening, between Days 22 and 28, between Days 36 and 42, between Days 43 and 57 or at the end of study, and during long-term follow-up (approximately 12 weeks later). Serial dilutions were tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the "double antibody sandwich" technique and pretreatment serum as negative control., Up to 6 months
Patients were enrolled sequentially into cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of \^90Y-DOTA-cG250, defined as the dose level below the dose at which â‰¥ 2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In an attempt to mitigate liver uptake and toxicity, patients initially received a nontherapeutic injection with \^111In-DOTA-cG250 at an imaging dose of 5 mCi of \^111In + 10 mg of cG250 on Day 1. Whole body and blood measurements of radioactivity were obtained on at least 3 occasions for 1 week to determine targeting and dosimetry. Provided that protocol-specified criteria were met, including targeting to lesions \> 2 cm detected on computed tomography (CT) scan, a single dose of therapeutic \^90Y-DOTA-cG250 was administered on Day 8, 9, or 10. The starting dose of \^90Y-DOTA-cG250 was 0.2 mCi/kg of \^90Y + 10 mg of cG250 administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, with escalation of the \^90Y dose in subsequent cohorts in 0.05 to 0.1 mCi/kg increments.

Patients were treated in an outpatient setting and were observed for at least 2 hours following each infusion, at which point vital signs and blood samples were obtained. Patients were followed for 6 to 8 weeks post-treatment (or after recovery from toxicity) with imaging, biochemical, serological, and hematologic tests to determine the safety of \^90Y-DOTA-cG250 and to inform dose-escalation decisions. Extent of disease evaluations, preferably by positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or standard CT, were performed at baseline and 6 to 8 weeks post-treatment (or after recovery from toxicity). Long-term follow-up was performed, when possible, every 12 weeks thereafter for up to 2 years.
