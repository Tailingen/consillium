QUILT-2.025 NANT Neoepitope Yeast Vaccine (YE-NEO-001): Adjuvant Immunotherapy Using a Personalized Neoepitope Yeast-Based Vaccine To Induce T-Cell Responses In Subjects W/ Previously Treated Cancers.
This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), and preliminary efficacy of a personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in subjects who have completed potentially curative therapy for their solid cancer and who would otherwise be entering a period of surveillance for recurrent disease.

This is a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, the RP2D, and preliminary efficacy of a personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in subjects who have completed potentially curative therapy for their type of solid cancer (eg, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and would otherwise be entering a period of surveillance for recurrent disease.

The study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation, and part 2 will involve the expansion of the RP2D to further evaluate the safety of YE-NEO-001. In part 2 of the study, dose expansion will occur when the RP2D has been determined. An additional 4 subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the RP2D.
