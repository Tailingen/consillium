Number Of Patients Experienced Treatment Emergent Adverse Event Assessed by Investigator, An Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant. A serious AE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect or that was considered to be an important medical event. AEs were graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. The grades were defined as follows: Grade 0: no change from normal or reference range; Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE. The focus of AE summaries was on treatment-emergent AE (TEAE).

This will be a Phase 1, open label, multi center, multiple dose, non randomized, Phase 1 clinical trial of lorlatinib in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment and necessary age , weight , and gender matched prospect normal hepatic function patients. This study is intended to evaluate the potential effect of hepatic impairments on the PK and safety of lorlatinib after daily administration of lorlatinib and to provide dosing recommendation for patients with varied degree of hepatic impairment if possible.

Patients in the study will be assigned to different groups (A1, normal liver function, control for group B; A2, normal liver function, control for group C; B, mild hepatic impairment; C, moderate hepatic impairment; D, severe hepatic impairment) according to their liver function. The enrollment of approximately 76 advanced cancer patients is anticipated in this study in order to have 8 PK-evaluable patients in each of Groups A1, A2, B and C, and 6 PK-evaluable patients in Group D for final statistical analysis. Evaluable patients are those who complete the planned PK sample collection on Cycle 2 Day 1 and have no lorlatinib dose modification until completion of Cycle 2 Day 1 PK evaluation. Patients who are not evaluable for PK will be replaced. Each patient will be treated with repeated oral once daily doses of lorlatinib in 21-day cycles until disease progression, patient refusal, or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The dose schedule may be modified as necessary for individual patients according to tolerability.
