Poziotinib in Patients With NSCLC Having EGFR or HER2 Exon 20 Insertion Mutation
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety/tolerability of poziotinib in two patient cohorts for up to 114 previously treated NSCLC patients with any systemic therapy (57 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and 57 patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations).
NSCLC
DRUG: Poziotinib
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieve Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) by the best response from the first dose of poziotinib to the end of study., 24 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, and Stable Disease (SD) by the best response from the first dose of poziotinib to the end of study., 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Number of days from the date that measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first subsequent date that progressive disease or death is documented., 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Number of days from the treatment start date to the date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause., 24 months
The Screening period (Day -30 to Day -1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study. Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to any study procedures.

Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be two patient cohorts and eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutation status:

* Cohort 1 : Previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive NSCLC (N=57)
* Cohort 2 : Previously treated patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation positive NSCLC (N=57) Toxicity will be assessed based on the severity grade of the adverse events using CTCAE version 4.03.

Poziotinib (16 mg) will be taken orally, once daily (QD) with food and a glass of water at approximately the same time each morning.

All patients will be treated until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for patient withdrawal.
