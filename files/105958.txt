Survivorship Promotion In Reducing IGF-1 Trial
This is a prospective, single-center randomized trial with three arms, and an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The study design is an efficacy study to evaluate the effect of metformin and coach-directed behavioral weight loss versus self-directed weight loss on insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-1 to THE IGFBP-III ratio blood levels after 6 and 12 months of intervention. The coach-directed Behavioral Weight Loss arm is a web-based remote delivery and communication system that promotes healthy behavioral changes. The Metformin arm is a pharmaceutical intervention of oral metformin. This is a secondary prevention study for men and women who have survived solid malignant tumors
