Two hundred and sixteen patients with localized prostate cancer will include in this study. The clinical trial validation process will be as follows: (1) all patients are randomly divided into two arms: arm 1, high-frequency irreversible electroporation; group 2, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome is the urinary function and sexual function.
