Ultrasound Liver Intraoperative Imaging With SonoVueÂ®
Hypothesis: Use of contrast ultrasound showed interesting results, which can increase ultrasonography sensitivity performed during surgery in the evaluation of operable liver metastases.

This study is a two-stage phase II multicenter study (Simon's two-stage).
Liver Metastases From Colorectal Primary Cancer
DEVICE: Contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound
Clinical Utility of Intraoperative Contrast Ultrasound in the Surgery of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases., The clinical utility will be evaluated in terms of justified modification of the surgical procedure following contrast-enhanced intra-operative ultrasound (CE-IOUS), compared to the surgical procedure following conventional intra-operative ultrasound. For each patient, we will consider CE-IOUS to be clinically useful:

* if the surgical procedure envisaged at the end of the CE-IOUS is different from the surgical procedure envisaged at the end of the conventional ultrasound
* and if the surgical procedure envisaged at the end of the CE-IOUS is justified We reported the percentage of patients for whom there was a modified and justified surgical gesture following CE-IOUS., At time of surgery
Clinical Utility of CE-IOUS in Subgroup of Patients Who Received Preoperative Chemotherapy, The primary endpoint will be assessed in the subgroup of patients who received preoperative chemotherapy. As for the primary outcome, the clinical utility is evaluated in terms of justified modification of the surgical gesture envisaged following CE-IOUS, compared to the surgical gesture envisaged following a conventional intraoperative ultrasound.

We reported the percentage of patients for whom there was a modified and justified surgical gesture following CE-IOUS in the subgroup of patients who received preoperative chemotherapy., at time of surgery|Performance Evaluation of Intraoperative Ultrasound Contrast: Detection Rate Per Lesion, Detection of malignant lesions by CE-IOUS in chemotherapy-free patients within 3 post-operative months. The detection rate is defined as the proportion of malignant lesions for which there is concordance between the diagnosis established by CE-IOUS and the reference examination., up to 3 months after surgery|Description of Technical Arrangements for the CE-IOUS, Description of technical arrangements for the CE-IOUS duration. The length of time during which contrast injection was useable., At time of contrast-enhanced IOUS|Performance Evaluation of Intraoperative Ultrasound Contrast Per Lesion: Characterisation Rate, Characterisation rate for focal liver lesions: the proportion of lesions whose nature on CE-IOUS is identical to the nature of the lesions defined by the reference examinations among all the lesions seen on CE-IOUS (malignant and benign), up to 3 months after surgery
Hypothesis: Use of contrast ultrasound showed interesting results, which can increase ultrasonography sensitivity performed during surgery in the evaluation of operable liver metastases.
