A Cross-sectional Study on the Association of Peptidoglycan Fragments Derived From Gut Microbiota With Colorectal Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to explore the association of peptidoglycan fragments derived from gut microbiota with colorectal cancer (CRC). The main question it aims to answer is: Are peptidoglycan fragments from the gut microbiota associated with the progression of colorectal cancer? Participants will provide biological specimens (blood, feces, colon tissue obtained during surgery)
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: observational study, no intervention
HPLC-MS/MS was used to detect peptidoglycan fragment content in biological specimens of 200 participants, The content of peptidoglycan fragments was detected by HPLC-MS/MS, baseline (before treatment)
To explore whether peptidoglycan fragments can be used as screening or diagnostic indicators for colorectal cancer
