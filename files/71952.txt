A Phase II Randomized Therapeutic Optimization Trial for Subjects With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Using ctDNA: Rapid 1 Trial
This randomized, phase 2 study will investigate the use of the Signatera ctDNA assay versus the standard scan-based approach to guide treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The aim of this study will be to measure and compare the overall survival, progression-free survival, and best overall response while on study of patients whose treatment has been guided by these two approaches.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: Signatera ctDNA assay|DRUG: pre-specified sequence of FDA-approved drugs and drug combinations
Overall survival, Compare the overall survival in subjects who receive ctDNA assay-guided treatment and scan-guided treatment, 1 year
Progression free survival, Compare the progression free survival in subjects who receive ctDNA assay-guided treatment and scan-guided treatment, 1 year|Best overall response, Compare the proportion of subjects having each category of response during study participation (complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease) per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 1 year
