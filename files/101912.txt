Sunitinib Malate After Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases
RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib malate works after stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the CNS progression-free survival rate in patients with 1-3 newly diagnosed brain metastases treated with sunitinib malate after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

Secondary

* Determine the rate of local (site of SRS treatment) failure at 12 months in these patients.
* Determine the median time to CNS disease progression in these patients.
* Determine the overall survival of these patients.
* Determine the time to progression of systemic disease in these patients.
* Evaluate the safety of sunitinib malate when administered after SRS in these patients.
* Assess the neurocognitive effects of SRS followed by sunitinib malate in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo neuropsychological battery testing at baseline and periodically during study to assess cognitive function (memory, verbal fluency, visual-motor speed, executive function, and motor dexterity), activities of daily living, and quality of life.
