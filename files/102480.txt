Ruxolitinib Phosphate in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in treating patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Ruxolitinib Phosphate
Participants With a Clinical Response, Clinical response will be assessed based on physical examination, complete blood count (CBC), a bone marrow aspiration, a whole body CT scan to be done at screening and 6 + 2 months in accordance with the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) guidelines (Hallek et al., 2008), Up to 6 months after initiation of therapy|Number of Participants With Change of Tumor Burden, Tumor burden will be assessed by bone marrow aspiration, whole body CT scan at screening and 6 months., 6 months after initiation of therapy|Participants With a Response, Response Rate is Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). CR is absence of Lymphadenopathy, Hepatomegaly or Splenomegaly, lymphocytes \< 4000/ul, normocellular, \<30% lymphocytes, no B-lymphoid nodules, Platelets \> 100,000/ul, hemoglobin \>11.0 g/dl and Neutrophils \>1500/ul.

PR is \>/= 50% decrease in lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and Blood Lymphocytes from baseline, 50% reduction in marrow infiltrate or B-lymphoid nodules. Platelet count \> 100,000/ul, Hemoglobin \> 11 g/dl and Neutrophils \>1500/ul or increase \>/= 50% of all over base., Up to 30 days|Time to Next Treatment, Number of months to subsequent therapy per patient., Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the effect of ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib) in patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 recommendations and were either previously untreated or treated with Ibrutinib for less than 3 months and were deemed Ibrutinib intolerant:

Ia. On disease burden. Ib. The rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the time to next treatment of high-risk CLL/SLL who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy according to the IWCLL 2008 recommendations.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment beyond 3 years may be permitted after discussion with the principal investigator.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
