Feasibility of Monitoring Health Data in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy
In this pilot study the feasibility of continous monitoring of health data with a small, on-skin wearable device (the Everion®, by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under chemotherapy for cancer, is studied. Feasibility is assessed by the number of patients wearing the device on seven consecutive days for at least 18h/day, what will be measured by monitored heart rate. Study duration for each participant is 14 days.

No study has proved feasibility of continuous monitoring of health data with a small wearable device such as the device Everion® in pediatric patients. It is not known if children tolerate the device and if data quality sustains with smaller arm circumferences or when worn on the upper leg. Neither is it known if parents and/or patients can and are willing to handle the device in ambulant setting. Therefore, this pilot study assesses the feasibility of continous monitoring of health data with a small, on-skin wearable device (the Everion®, by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under chemotherapy for cancer.
