Dose Escalation Trial of Endoluminal High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy With Concurrent Chemotherapy for Rectal or Anal Cancer in Patients With Recurrent Disease or Undergoing Non-Operative Management
The purpose of this study is to see what amount of radiation is safe to give to rectal or anal cancer patients who are being treated with a procedure called brachytherapy.
Rectal or Anal Cancer
RADIATION: endorectal brachytherapy|DRUG: concurrent capecitabine or 5-FU|BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), will employ a standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3. An initial cohort of 3 patients will be treated to each dose. The dose level will be escalated if none of the 3 patients exhibits any DLT within 90 days of completion of brachytherapy. Dose escalation will not take place until every patient in the prior dose cohort has been monitored for 90 days., 1 year
