Phase Ib/II of TG4001 and Avelumab in HPV16 Positive R/M Cancers
The study will consist of two parts :

In the phase Ib: safety will be assessed in consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at increasing doses of TG4001 in combination with avelumab according to a 3+3 design. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation.

In the phase II part 1, evaluation of efficacy and further evaluation of safety of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab will be performed in a single arm of patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV-16 positive advanced malignancies.

In the phase II part 2, evaluation of efficacy of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab will be performed in a randomized, open-label controlled study comparing TG4001 in combination with avelumab to avelumab alone in patients with HPV-16 positive advanced malignancies.

In both phases, tumor response will be evaluated on local assessment using RECIST 1.1.

All patients will be followed up until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal for any reason, whichever occurs first.

BIOLOGICAL: TG4001|DRUG: Avelumab
Phase Ib: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of TG4001 plus avelumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV-16 positive advanced malignancies, Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) includes the following:

* Grade ≥ 3 drug related adverse event (AEs). However, fatigue, nausea/vomiting adequately treated with anti-emetics, endocrinopathies adequately controlled with one physiologic hormone replacement, skin toxicity and single laboratory values out of normal range without any clinical correlate, asymptomatic grade ≥3 lipase or amylase elevation, tumor flare defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or suspected tumor or a transient Grade 3 infusion adverse event are excluded.
* Liver function test abnormality:

  * AST or ALT \> 5 x ULN
  * Total bilirubin \> 3 x ULN
  * Concurrent AST or ALT \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Drug related AE requiring treatment interruption for more than 2 weeks, Day 28|Phase II part 1: Overall Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, Percentage of patients whose best overall response is either a Complete Response or a Partial Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria over the the total number of evaluable patients., Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years|Phase II part 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS) by RECISIT 1.1, Time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR) by using RECIST 1.1 (phase Ib, phase II part 2), Percentage of patients whose best overall response is either a Complete Response or a Partial Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria over the the total number of evaluable patients, Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (phase Ib, Phase II part 1), Time from the date of first study treatment administration (Phase IB, Phase II Part1) to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration (Phase Ib, Phase II part 1) or time from the date of randomization (Phase II part 2) to the date of death due to any cause., Every 3 months and up to 3 years|Duration of overall Response (DoR), Time from first documented response (CR or PR) until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR, PR, or SD., Every 6 weeks for the first 9 months, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years|Incidence of Adverse Event reported per CTCAE v4.03, up to 90 days after last study treatment administration
