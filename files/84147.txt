Intravenous Immunoglobulin and Plasma Exchange in Myasthenia Gravis
Immunomodulation is effective in treating patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but prior studies have not adequately defined if plasma exchange (PLEX) in superior to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. This study aimed to determine if PLEX was superior to IVIG in the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis.

Patients with MG requiring immunomodulation are randomized to IVIG or PLEX and treated with a full course of immunomodulation. The quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) will be evaluated as the primary efficacy parameter at day 14 to determine if PLEX is superior to IVIG.
Myasthenia Gravid
BIOLOGICAL: IVIG|PROCEDURE: PLEX
Change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMGS) from baseline to day 14 after treatment, QMGS is a validated clinical measure of myasthenia gravis ranging from 0 points (no myasthenic weakness) to a maximum of 39 points, with a defined change of 3.4 units required for clinical significance., QMGS at day 14, and patients followed to day 60
QMGS Score change at days 21 and 28 from start of treatment., Change in QMGS with time to see if effect ad day 14 is sustained., 28 days|Post intervention status, Categorical scale of improvement, worsening, or no change for myasthenia gravis., Day 14, 21 and 28|Single fiber electromyography: jitter, percent abnormal pair, percent blocking, Electrophysiological assessment of neuromuscular transmission., Days 14 and 28 compared to baseline|Repetitive Nerve stimulation studies, Assessment of decrement, Days 14 and 28|Acetylcholine Receptor Antibody titers, Laboratory assay of pathogenic antibody, Day 28 (if positive at baseline)|AntiMUSK antibody, Laboratory measure of pathogenic antibody, Day 28 (if positive at baseline)|Need for ICU admission, ventilation, intubation, Myasthenic deterioration and crisis, 60 days|Hospitalization, Myasthenic deterioration and crisis, 60 days|Need for additional myasthenic treatment, Myasthenic deterioration or crisis, Day 60
