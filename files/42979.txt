A Study to Assess a New Medicine Called IPN01195 When Administered Alone in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to determine the appropriate dosage, safety and effectiveness of a new study drug IPN01195 in adults with advanced solid tumours.

The participants in this study will have advanced solid tumours. 'Advanced solid tumours' refers to cancers that can occur in several places, including cancers in organs or tissues that have spread from their original site to nearby tissues or other parts of the body.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: IPN01195
Part A: Percentage of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Part A: within 28 days of first dose.|Part A and B: Percentage of participants experiencing treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TE SAEs)., An Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. TEAE is an AE for which the start date is on or after the date that the intervention began., From the first IPN01195 administration to 30 days after last dose.|Part A and B: Percentage of participants with dose interruptions and permanent treatment discontinuations, From the first study drug administration to 30 days after last dose.|Part B: Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1., Part B: At end of study (up to approximately 3 years)
Part A: Time to maximum observed drug concentration (Tmax) after single and multiple doses of IPN01195, Cycle 1: at Day 1 and at Day 15.|Part A: Maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax) after single and multiple doses of IPN01195, Cycle 1: at Day 1 and at Day 15.|Part A: Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUCtau) after single and multiple doses of IPN01195, AUCtau is defined as the concentration of drug over one dosing interval., Cycle 1: at Day 1 and at Day 15.|Part A: Geometric mean ratio of Cmax of IPN01195 administered in fed state relative to fasted state., Between Day -8 and Day -3 (fasted period) and between Day -10 and Day -7 (fed state period)|Part A: Geometric mean ratio of AUClast of IPN01195 administered in fed state relative to fasted state, AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration., Between Day -8 and Day -3 (fasted period) and between Day -10 and Day -7 (fed state period)|Part A: Geometric mean ratio of AUCinf of IPN01195 administered in fed state relative to fasted state, AUCinf is defined as the concentration of drug extrapolated to infinite time., Between Day -8 and Day -3 (fasted period) and between Day -10 and Day -7 (fed state period)|Part A: Prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc), Prolongation of QTc defined as the upper limit of 90% confidence interval for change from baseline QTc evaluated over Cycle 1 at the highest clinically relevant exposure., Within 28 days of first dose.|Part A: Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1, Part A: From first study drug administration to end of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Part B: Duration of response (DoR), DoR defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease, as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1., Every 3 months until end of study or death (up to approximately 3 years)|Part B: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first IPN01195 administration to the date of the first documented disease progression, as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1., From first study drug administration to end of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Part B: PFS rate at 4 months, PFS rate at 4 months defined as the proportion of participants who remain alive and progression-free at 4 months, as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1., At Month 4|Part B: Disease control rate (DCR)., DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as determined by investigator per RECIST version 1.1, Part B:From first study drug administration to end of study (up to approximately 3 years)
The study consists of two phases, called phase I and phase II.

Phase I will be conducted in two parts:

Part A: Phase I Part A study (dose escalation) is designed to find the dose range showing activity on the tumour that can be tolerated by the participants by testing different doses of IPN01195.

Part B: Phase I Part B of the study (dose confirmation) will assess the ability of study drug to prevent, slow down, or stop the growth of tumours (abnormal cell growths that can lead to cancer) and how the body processes and responds to the study drug when administered in a "low dose" or "high dose" and further explore the safety and tolerability.

These parts will consist of the following periods:

* A period to assess eligibility (screening period).
* A treatment period that will require at least two visits for the first month followed by one visit every month. There will be also one visit, at the end of treatment, at 30 days after the last administration of study drug.

An assessment visit will be required every 6 weeks up to Week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter to measure the tumour again and to assess how it is evolving, whether it is getting bigger, smaller, is stable or has gone away.

Based on the results obtained from phase I, a phase II extension study will be included through to an updated study plan, to further evaluate the study drug.

In both study phases, participants will undergo blood samplings, urine collections, physical examinations and clinical evaluations. They may continue some other medications, but the details need to be recorded.
