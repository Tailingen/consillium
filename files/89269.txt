Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AZD5851|BIOLOGICAL: AZD0754
Incidence of specific AEs, To determine long-term safety of previous treatment with applicable cell and gene therapy products, Maximum of 15 years post dosing
Disease progression status and Overall survival, To determine long-term efficacy follow-up after previous treatment with a cell or gene therapy product, Maximum of 15 years post dosing.|Kinetics parameters that indicate persistence (eg, Clast and Tlast), To characterise the long-term persistence of the cell or gene therapy product., Maximum of 15 years post dosing
This is a multi-centre and multinational basket study that will monitor the long-term safety and tolerability of cell or gene therapies in participants that have taken part in other AstraZeneca cell or gene therapy studies for up to 15 years.
