A Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy Study of MBS303 in B-Cell NHL
This is a Phase I/Ⅱ, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) and efficacy of a novel T-Cell bispecific (TCB), MBS303, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. This entry-to-human study consists of 2 parts: a dose escalation part (Phase I) and an expansion part (Phase Ⅱ)
