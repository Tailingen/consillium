The PUMA Trial is a Trial of a Single ProHema Modulated-Cord Blood (CB) Unit as Part of a Double CB Transplant in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies.
This study is an open-label randomized, prospectively and historically controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of a single ProHema-CB unit used as part of a double CB transplant following myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning for subjects age 15-65 years with hematologic malignancies. A maximum of 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 10 centers within the U.S.
Hematologic Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: ProHema-CB|BIOLOGICAL: Untreated CB
Rate of early neutrophil engraftment using Myeloablative Conditioning, To determine the rate of neutrophil engraftment after a single ProHema-CB unit is used as part of a double CB transplant following myeloablative conditioning for subjects with hematologic malignancies., Neutrophil engraftment < 26 days|Rate of early neutrophil engraftment using Reduced Intensity Conditioning, To determine the rate of neutrophil engraftment after a single ProHema-CB unit is used as part of a double CB transplant following reduced intensity conditioning for subjects with hematologic malignancies., Neutrophil engraftment < 21 days
All subjects will receive a myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning regimen, after which they will receive 2 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched or partially matched umbilical cord blood (UCB) units. A total of 40 subjects will receive one ProHema-CB as part of a double CB transplant and an additional 20 subjects will be enrolled as concurrent controls. The determination of which CB unit will be the ProHema-CB unit will be made based primarily upon the degree of HLA match.
