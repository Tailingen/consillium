Clinical Trial of Chemotherapy Combination Cisplatin-Fluorouracil-Afatinib in Patients With Inoperable Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Cisplatin,5-Fluorouracil(5FU) and Afatinib as first-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. The study will include 55 patients in all. The patients will receive open-label Cisplatin intravenous 75mg/m2 on Day 1, 5FU 750mg/m2 at 24-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1-4, and Afatinib 40mg per os on Days 3-5, 8-12, 15-19.

The administration of Afatinib will start on Day 3 of each therapy cycle with an administration interval on each weekend ("Weekday on, Weekend off") for 21 days. Instructions are given on the dose reduction scheme in the presence of toxicity. The administration of the combination Cisplatin-5FU-Afatinib will be continued until disease progression, appearance of significant toxicity, completion of 6 treatment cycles, or withdrawal of consent. At completion of 6 cycles of the combination, in the absence of disease progression, the administration of Afatinib as maintenance monotherapy will be continued until disease progression, appearance of significant toxicity, or withdrawal of consent at the weekday on-weekend off schedule. Imaging will be applied once every 8 weeks, and once every 12 weeks in the Afatinib maintenance therapy phase.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin-5FU-Afatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Imaging will be performed once every 8 weeks during treatment with cisplatin-5FU-afatinib (6 cycles), and once every 12 weeks in the Afatinib maintenance therapy phase., At an average of 6 months for each patient
Evaluation of Overall Survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause assessed up to 36 months.|Evaluation of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of disease progression or date of death, assessed up to 36 months.|Assessment of safety and tolerability, Distribution of Adverse Events (AEs) according to severity grade.

Evaluation of AEs will be performed:

On Day 1 and day 10 in cycle 1,on Day 1 in cycles 2-6 (every 21 days) and on Day 1 during maintenance treatment with afatinib (every 4 weeks)., Assessed up to 36 months|Value of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers measured in tissue and blood samples, Immunochemical expression of proteins/messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of the tumor that can be linked to the efficacy / safety of the treatment, the tumor angiogenesis and the mechanism of action of the combination cisplatin/5FU/Afatinib.

In bioptic material for gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma:

* Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) immunohistochemical expression;
* EGFR gene amplification (chromosome 7 gene number by FISH);
* mRNA levels of the EGFR ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin;
* Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) mutations;
* Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemical expression and gene amplification
* HER2 p95, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 4 (HER4) immunohistochemical and mRNA expression

In peripheral blood and plasma:HER2 shed extracellular domain (ECD)

There may be additions to the biomarkers to be analysed, dependent on the clinical and bibliographical data., Tumor blocks and blood samples will be collected at baseline
