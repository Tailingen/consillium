Volume-outcome Relationship in Rectal Cancer Surgery
Hospital centralization effect is reported to lower complications and mortality especially for high risk and complex general surgery operations, including colorectal surgery. However, no linear relation between volume and outcome has been demonstrated. Aim of the study was to evaluate the increased surgical volume effect on early outcomes of patient undergoing restorative anterior rectal resection (ARR).
