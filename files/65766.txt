A Study of Merestinib (LY2801653) in Japanese Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate tolerability of merestinib monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents in Japanese participants with advanced and/or metastatic cancer.
Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer|Biliary Tract Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma|Gall Bladder Carcinoma|Solid Tumor|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Merestinib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Number of Participants with Merestinib Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants with DLTs, Cycle 1 (Part A = 28 Days or Part B = 21 Days)
