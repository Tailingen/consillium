Telo Genomics Technology to Detect & Profile Multiple Myeloma MRD
The purpose :

Detect and profile Multiple myeloma Measurable Residual Disease(MRD) prognostics for monitoring post-transplant Multiple Myeloma (MM) Patients receiving maintenance therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Standard of care
To validate the sensitivity of Telo Genomics assay (measurement tool) to detect MRD (measurement expressed in the number of plasma cells per 100000 cells) and establish the clinical utility of TELO - DMRD for MRD enumeration, Assess the possibility to perform TELO-DMRD on bone marrow aspirate samples vs peripheral blood

Validate TELO-DMRD results with ClonoSeq, as an IMWG recognized MRD assessment method (other IMWG recognized methodologies can be also employed), Approximately 5 years|To assess the utility of TeloViewÂ® technology genomic profiling (measurement tool) to stratify post-transplant MM patients into relapse risk groups (dichotomous measure of high or low) by analyzing the residual MRD plasma cells, o A longitudinal study including transplant eligible patients. Patients to be followed for 6 time points over 24 months at: At point of diagnosis (marrow aspirate \& peripheral blood), 4m post induction (peripheral blood), 3m Post-transplant (peripheral blood), at 12m Post-transplant (peripheral blood), 18m Post-transplant (peripheral blood) \& 24m Post-transplant (peripheral blood), and at point of relapse for patients who will relapse during the follow up time (marrow aspirate \& peripheral blood). Of note, an additional marrow aspirate may be performed if the patient agrees at the time they attain a complete remission, to confirm this status, Approximately 5 years
