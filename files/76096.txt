HAIC Combined With TQB2450 and Anlotinib in Second-line Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Overall, although there are many options for second-line treatment of liver cancer, the ORR is mostly limited to within 20-30%, with a median PFS of 3-5 months and a median OS of 10-20 months. The overall situation is still unsatisfactory, with low objective tumor response rates and targeted immune resistance being the main reasons affecting treatment efficacy. Increasing local treatment or overcoming resistance is currently a hot research topic. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of HAIC combined with TQB2450 and anlotinib for second-line treatment of advanced HCC patients.
