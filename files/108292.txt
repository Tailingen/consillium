Prospective Comparison of Breast MRI vs Contrast Mammography Prior to Surgery in Breast Cancer Patients
In current clinical practice, women with biopsy proven breast cancer can be sent for breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) prior to surgery in order to delineate the extent of a known cancer and / or assess for the presence of occult secondary cancers. This study seeks to compare the global costs (based on actual reimbursement rates) of CEM/breast MRI, downstream imaging testing, and diagnostic procedures in women randomized to breast MRI versus CEM. Secondary goals are to compare patient preferences for CEM vs MRI and clinically relevant outcomes (e.g. conversion from lumpectormy to mastecomy).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breast MRI|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast Enhanced Mammography
Global Costs, The Primary outcome is to compare the global costs (based on actual reimbursement rates) of initial imaging modality (CEM or breast MRI), downstream imaging related to breast cancer evaluation, and diagnostic breast procedures in women randomized to breast MRI versus CEM., Through Study Completion (2 years)
Patient Satisfaction using modified Likert scale, Patient's reported satisfaction with the initial imaging technique received (CEM versus MRI) will be assessed via Post-Imaging questionnaires designed to gauge patient's opinions about the imaging technique they received., Through Study Completion (2 years)|Health-Related Quality of Life, quantifying differences in health-related quality of life (as assessed by the patient reported Euro quality of life 5D questionnaire), Through Study Completion (2 years)|Rate of Conversion, Rate of conversion from planned lumpectomy to mastectomy, Through Study Completion (2 years)|Rate of Re-Operation, rate of re-operation for positive margins, Through Study Completion (2 years)
This is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the global costs of two standard of care imaging techniques in patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis and planned breast conservation surgery. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either CEM or breast MRI. The purpose of this study is to compare the global costs (based on actual reimbursement rates) of initial imaging modality (CEM or breast MRI), downstream imaging related to breast cancer evaluation, and diagnostic breast procedures in women randomized to breast MRI versus CEM.

Secondary endpoints include assessment of patient's reported satisfaction with the initial imaging technique received (CEM versus MRI), quantifying differences in health-related quality of life (as assessed by the patient reported Euro quality of life 5D questionnaire), rate of conversion from planned lumpectomy to mastectomy, and rate of re-operation for positive margins.
