Elastic Abdominal Binder Following Gynecologic Cancer Surgery
Surgery is the primary treatment for gynecologic malignancies. The surgical approach provides opportunities for removal of the affected organs and complete assessment of extent of cancer spread. However, the procedures are often associated with significant morbidity. This is especially true with open laparotomy, the most frequently employed approach in developing countries. Delayed functional recovery influenced by pain and immobilization are important contributing factors for increased morbidity. Elastic abdominal binder, a wide elastic belt that is wore around the patient's abdomen to support surgical incision after surgery, has been employed by clinicians for pain relief, wound complications prevention, improved pulmonary function, and stabilization. Benefits of the abdominal binder use in this patient population have not been properly examined.

The aim of this study is to examine the effect of postoperative elastic abdominal binder use on recovery by comparing pain scores and mobility function (through the 6-minute walk test \[6MWT\]) in postoperative gynecologic cancer patients who use versus do not use the elastic abdominal binder to support incisional site.
Gynecologic Cancer
DEVICE: Elastic abdominal binder
Daily average postoperative pain scores, The participants are asked to rate postoperative pain according to 10-cm visual analog scales from '0' (no pain) to '10' (worst possible pain)., An average of pain scores at 8:00 am and 4:00 pm, up to 7 days postoperation|Six-minute walk test score change from baseline, Six-minute walk test (6MWT), One day before operation and postoperative day 3
Quality of life: EuroQol Group's ED-5D-5L questionnaire, The EuroQol Group's ED-5D-5L questionnaire is employed. The health dimensions assessed include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. For each dimension, the participants are asked to indicate their health state related to that dimension as no problems (score '1'), slight problems (score '2'), moderate problems (score '3'), severe problems (score '4'), and extreme problems (score '5'). For this study, a score of 1-2 is considered "normal" while a scores of 3-5 is regarded as "problem". In addition, the participants are asked to rate their overall health status according to a visual analog scale EQ VAS with '0' corresponding to "the worst health imaginable" and '100' indicating "the best health imaginable"., In the morning of postoperative day 3|Rate of postoperative complications, The complications of interest include febrile morbidity, wound complication, bowel ileus, In the morning, up to 7 days postoperation
