Monotherapy With Eribulin In Her2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer as a First Line Treatment
Multicentre, prospective, non-controlled phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of first line single agent Eribulin in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC) previously exposed to taxanes for early stage.

The primary objective of the study is to determine the median time to progression achieved with Eribulin. Other secondary objectives will be; overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, time to treatment progression, duration of response and toxicity profile.
