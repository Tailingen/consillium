AZD9496 First Time in Patients Ascending Dose Study
This is a phase 1 open label multicentre study of AZD9496 administered orally in patients with advanced ER+ HER2 negative breast cancer. The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of patients. The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose. In addition, expansion cohort(s) at potential therapeutic dose(s) in patients with or without ESR1 mutations will be enrolled to further determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological activity of AZD9496

Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability in terms of adverse events, serious adverse events (including death) and safety measures: ECG, physical examination, vital signs and laboratory variables. Definition of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum feasible dose (MFD) by measuring the number of evaluable patients with dose-limiting toxicities.Time frame DLT period 28 days, Routine safety assessments, throughout the period that patients receive AZD9496 up to 28 days following discontinuation of last dose of study treatment.
