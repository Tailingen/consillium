(1)H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Brain in Patients Who Receive Neurotoxic Therapy
Central nervous system toxicity is a recognized side effect of certain therapies for cancers, particularly cranial irradiation, intrathecal therapy or systemic high-dose chemotherapy. The pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical manifestations vary. Previous studies defining MRI changes and correlating these with neurocognitive deficiencies have been inconsistent. Recent advances in brain imaging may help to better define neurotoxic effects. (1)H-NMRS is a noninvasive method of obtaining in vivo biochemical information from the brain. It has been used to study patients with CNS disorders, including neuronal disorders. In this study, (1)H-NMRS will be used to objectively characterize CNS toxicities in patients with cancer who are receiving potentially neurotoxic therapies. In addition, we will retrospectively evaluate patients with known or suspected neurotoxicity associated with cancer therapy, to determine if changes in spectroscopic patterns are associated with CNS toxicity.

Identify patterns of brain metabolites associated with therapy related neurotoxicity, changes in spectroscopic metabolite patterns defined by neuropsychological testing or abnormalities on conventional MRI, At time of MRI and till date of death
Background:

* Central nervous system toxicity is a recognized side effect of certain cancer therapies, particularly cranial irradiation, intrathecal therapy and systemic high-dose chemotherapy.
* The pathophysiologic mechanisms are not well-defined and clinical manifestations vary. Previous studies defining MRI changes and correlating these with neurocognitive deficiencies have been inconsistent.
* Recent advances in brain imaging may help to better define neurotoxic effects. (1)H-NMRS is a noninvasive method of obtaining in vivo biochemical information from the brain. It has been used to study patients with CNS disorders, including neuronal disorders.

Objective:

-To identify specific patterns of brain metabolites that are associated with therapy-related neurotoxicity using (1)H-NMRS in cancer patients who are receiving or have received potentially neurotoxic therapy.

Eligibility:

-Patients with brain tumors or patients receiving high-dose systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy (lumbar puncture or intra-Ommaya), or cranial radiation therapy OR patients with documented or suspected clinical neurotoxicity presumed to be caused by treatment for cancer.

Design:

* In order to identify metabolite profiles that may be associated with neurotoxicity, NMRS data will be collected in a cross-sectional manner from patients at various stages of treatment and longitudinally throughout the course of therapy.
* NMRS studies will be performed on patients entered on this study at any or all of the following times: prior to therapy, immediately after the first cycle of therapy, prior to subsequent cycles of therapy, or after completion of all therapy.
* Neurotoxicity will also be evaluated by neuropsychological testing.
