Trial of an Investigational Drug After Rejecting the Relapse of an Allogeneic Transplant
Most patients with multiple myeloma (MM) die due to relapse resistant to current treatment, including treatment with anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cells. To overcome some of the potential limitations of this therapy, a new and optimized Anti-BCMA CAR-T has been developed, with the aim of using it in patients with MM who relapse after Allogeneic Haematopoietic Haematopoietic Progenitor. This trial is a prospective phase I/II trial with a 3+3 design. Once Dose Limiting Toxicity is identified, Phase II will begin to assess the efficacy of the procedure.

This trial is a prospective phase I/II trial with a 3+3 design. Once Dose Limiting Toxicity is identified (up to a maximum dose of 6x106 CAR-T/kg divided over 2 days), phase II of the trial will begin to assess the efficacy of the procedure.

A number of 25 patients will be included to evaluate.
