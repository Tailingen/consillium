Two Stage Study Of Single Dose PEGPH20 And Cetuximab In Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Prior To Surgical Resection
This study has several purposes. DCE-MRI will be used to image the tumor. Safety of cetuximab given before surgery will be studied. Cetuximab delivery to the tumor will be studied. In Stage 2 of this study, the safety of cetuximab and PEGPH20 given before surgery will be studied. Also, the effects of PEGPH20 on tumors will be studied.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: PEGPH20|DRUG: Cetuximab|DEVICE: DW & DCE-MRI|OTHER: blood draws
Effects of PEGPH20, administration on resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors. DW- and DCE-MRI and distribution of cetuximab will be used to study tumor permeability to small and larger molecules, respectively. Resected tumors will be carefully studied for evidence of stromal degradation., 1 year
Safety of Administration of PEGPH20 and Cetuximab, in close proximity to surgical resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Safety with regards to operative and post-operative complications will be characterized., 1 year
