A Study of LY3537982 in Chinese Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 1 study of LY3537982 as monotherapy in Chinese participants with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to determine how much of LY3537982 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to eliminate it in Chinese participants. The safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LY3537982 will also be evaluated. Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in this study.
