A Study of Live Tumor Fragments of Surgical Resections
The purpose of this study is to obtain unused resected tumor tissue sample and associated clinical data from patients enrolled in this study to research ex vivo treatment response and integrity of tumor microenvironment using omics analysis and imaging while maintaining cell stability in a live environment.
Cancer|Tumor
OTHER: No intervention
Tissue response to treatment, Tumor sample fragments will be treated with various combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat patients clinically (panel of drugs will be selected based on cancer type). response to the treatment will be assessed at multiple timepoints during a 72-hour period., Up to 72 hours
