* BIBW 2992 and paclitaxel (Taxol)
* BIBW 2992 and paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin)
* BIBW 2992 and carboplatin
* BIBW 2992 and paclitaxel and carboplatin The effect of the different drug combinations will also be assessed.

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the First Cycle for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an Adverse Event (AE) or laboratory abnormality considered as related to study treatment., Cycle 1: 21 days (part C and D) or 28 days (part A and B)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD of afatinib in selected combination treatments was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients experienced DLTs during the first treatment cycle, i.e. the highest dose with a DLT incidence â‰¤17%. The MTD was determined separately for Afatinib in combination with Paclitaxel (part A), Afatinib in combination with Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab (part B), Afatinib and Carboplatin (part C), and Afatinib in combination with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (part D).

In part C, dose escalation was not continued beyond the dose level A40C6, due to safety and pharmacokinetic considerations and upon mutual agreement between the investigators and the sponsor. Formally, no MTD was determined, however a recommended phase II dose was determined and is presented here.

0=not maximum tolerated dose, 1=is maximum tolerated dose

Note, the depicted order of treatment groups is driven by dose level, not by the actual dosing steps., Cycle 1: 21 days (part C and D) or 28 days (part A and B)
