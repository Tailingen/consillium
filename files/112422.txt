A Clinical Studyf of SHR-1701 or Placebo in Combination With BP102 and XELOX in the First-line Treatment of mCRC
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase II/III clinical study to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of SHR-1701 or placebo in combination with BP102 (biosimilar to bevacizumab) and XELOX in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.
