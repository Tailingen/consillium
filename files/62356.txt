Akkermansia Muciniphilia and Metabolic Side Effects of ADT
The overriding objectives of this study are:

1. Primary outcomes:

   1. To confirm that administration of oral acetate increases the proportion of A. muciniphilia in the stool samples of patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer compared to placebo.
   2. To confirm tolerability and assess for side effects of delayed oral acetate supplementation.
2. Secondary outcomes:

   1. To determine if increased counts of A. muciniphilia correlate with improved metabolic parameters and improved bone health.
