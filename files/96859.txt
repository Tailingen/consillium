Optimal Surgical Approach for Early-Stage Breast Cancer in Chinese Patients Aged â‰¤ 40 Years: a Cohort Study
The optimal surgical treatment option (BCS+RT versus MAST) for young patients with early-stage breast cancer remains debated. The present study aims to explore trends in surgical management and compare survival outcomes between BCS+RT and MAST in young patients with early-stage breast cancer, ultimately providing optimal treatment strategies for Asian populations.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: MAST group|PROCEDURE: breast-conserving surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy
Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), Jan 1, 2008 to 31 Dec, 2019|LRFS (Locoregional Recurrence-Free Survival), Jan 1, 2008 to 31 Dec, 2019|DMFS (Distant Metastasis-Free Survival), Jan 1, 2008 to 31 Dec, 2019|OS (Overall Survival), Jan 1, 2008 to 31 Dec, 2019
This study is a unique addition to the current research on young women with early-stage breast cancer, aiming to compare the survival outcomes between BCS+RT and MAST, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness for this group of patients. This study enrolled patients at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Kaplan-Meier analyses with the log-rank test were applied to compare the locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and overall survival (OS). Cox multivariate hazard regression was employed to assess hazard ratios (HRs) between the two groups for survival outcomes.
