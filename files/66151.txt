A Study of Bleximenib in Combination With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Directed Therapies
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) candidate(s) of bleximenib in combination with AML directed therapies (dose selection) and further to evaluate safety and tolerability of bleximenib in combination with AML directed therapies at the RP2D(s) (dose expansion).
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Bleximenib|DRUG: Venetoclax (VEN)|DRUG: Azacitidine (AZA)|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin or Idarubicin
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, Number of Participants with AEs by severity will be reported. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be reported according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., End of Cycle 1 (28 days)
Plasma Concentration of Bleximenib, Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of bleximenib using a validated, specific, and sensitive method., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Number of Participants with Depletion of Leukemic Blasts, Number of participants with depletion of leukemic blasts will be reported., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Percentage of Participants who Achieve Complete Remission (CR), Percentage of participants who achieve complete Remission (CR) will be reported. CR is defined as Bone marrow blasts less than (\<) 5 percent (%); Absence of circulating blasts; Absence of extramedullary disease; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to (\>=) 1.0\*10\^9/Liter (L) (1,000/microliter \[mcL\]); Platelet count \>= 100 \* 10\^9/L (100,000/mcL)., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Percentage of Participants who Achieve Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), Percentage of participants who achieve complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) will be reported. CRh is defined as All criteria of CR with both ANC \>0.5 \* 10\^9/L (500/mcL) and platelet count \>50 \* 10\^9/L (50,000/mcL)., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Percentage of Participants who Achieve Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi), Percentage of participants who achieve complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) will be reported. CRi is defined as All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0\*10\^9/L \[1,000/mcL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 \* 10\^9/L \[100,000/mcL\])., Up to 3 Years 3 months|Percentage of Participants who Achieved Overall Response, Percentage of participants who achieve overall response will be reported. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR, CRh, or CRi, morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) or partial remission (PR)., Up to 3 Years 3 months
