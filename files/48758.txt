Depsipeptide (Romidepsin) in Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well depsipeptide (romidepsin) works in treating patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cavity cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as depsipeptide (romidepsin), work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Depsipeptide (romidepsin) may also stop the growth of ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cavity cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth
Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer|Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer
DRUG: romidepsin
Response rate, Estimated as proportion of patients with complete or partial reduction in tumor burden., Up to 5 years|Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE version 3.0, Up to 5 years|Time to progression, From first treatment until the date of progression, assessed up to 5 years|Survival, From first treatment until death or the last date of contact, assessed up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the response rate of recurrent, platinum-sensitive adenocarcinoma of the ovarian or peritoneal to depsipeptide (romidepsin).

II. To determine the toxicity of depsipeptide in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive depsipeptide (romidepsin) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed up for 5 years.
