Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) in Gastric Carcinomatosis. Phase II Randomized Study
Peritoneal metastasis is a common pattern in advanced gastric cancer leading to a terminal condition in a very short time. Whatever recent progress regarding systemic chemotherapy using multi drugs association median survival is limited to 6 months with altered quality of life (QoL) after 4 months for all patients. We postulated that a new innovative health technology for delivering intraperitoneal pressurized aerosol of chemotherapy (Doxorubicin and Cisplatin) during laparoscopy can transform that situation offering to double the survival with QoL preservation. Interestingly, PIPAC procedure is made to be applied repeatedly, every 4 to 6 weeks. This therapeutic strategy allows to improved Intra Peritoneal (IP) drugs impregnation and maintained Intra-Veinous (IV) chemotherapy meanwhile. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare 24-month progression free-survival in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer treated either with IV chemotherapy and Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) or with IV chemotherapy alone, with preservation of quality of life.
