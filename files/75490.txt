The BURAN Study of Buparlisib in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic HNSCC
The BURAN study is a randomized, open-label phase III study to assess the treatment effect of once-daily buparlisib in combination with weekly paclitaxel compared to weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with refractory, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that have progressed after prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 monotherapy; prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy in combination with platinum-based therapy; or after sequential treatment of anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy, either prior to or post, platinum-based therapy.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Buparlisib & Paclitaxel
Overall Survival (OS), To assess the OS of buparlisib in combination with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, Overall survival will be measured from time of randomization until death from any cause. The analysis will occur when all patients have been randomized and followed for 12 months.
Progression free survival, Defined as the time from randomization date until tumor progression or death from any cause., PFS will be assessed up to 24 months after all patients are randomized|Overall Response Rate, Defined at the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, ORR will be assessed for all patients 6 months after randomization is complete.|Health Related Quality of Life (QoL): Time to Definitive deterioration of Quality of Life as assessed by EORTC C30 questionnaire, A summary of EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores by time window. Time to deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the assessment when definitive deterioration is seen. Definitive deterioration is defined as a decrease in the sub scale score by at least 10% compared with baseline., Assessments will be made from randomization until treatment discontinuation|Safety and Tolerability of Buparlisib in combination with Paclitaxel compared with Paclitaxel alone as Measured by Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)., Treatment Emergent Adverse Events AEs will be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 for severity and will be recorded and classified on the basis of MedDRA terminology.

Anxiety score change from baseline taken at time of screening (General Anxiety Disorder 7 item scale) until end of treatment.

Depression score change from baseline taken at time of screening (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) until end of treatment., From screening until 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation|Pharmacokinetics of Buparlisib: plasma concentration-time profile of Buparlisib during 15 days of treatment, For Sparse PK sampling, blood samples will be collected on Treatment Cycle 1, Days 1, 8, and 15 at pre-dose, 1 (± 0.25), 2 ± (0.25) and 6 ± (0.5) hours post-dose. PK sampling will be collected only for those patients randomized to the buparlisib in combination with paclitaxel arm and pharmacokinetic profile of Buparlisib combined with paclitaxel in the study population will be compared with a simulated population PK model., Day 0 to Day 15 sparse sampling
This study is to assess the impact on overall survival of the combination of Buparlisib and paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in patients with prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 monotherapy; prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy in combination with platinum-based therapy; or after sequential treatment of anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy, either prior to or post, platinum-based therapy.
