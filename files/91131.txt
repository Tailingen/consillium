TGRX-326 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction
This is a drug-drug interaction study for TGRX-326 to evaluate the effects of CYP3A inhibitor/inducer drugs on pharmacokinetic profiles of TGRX-326, an ALK inhibitor indicated for treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer.

Adverse events/serious adverse events, to record and analyse subjects with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), through completion of the study, an average of 1 month|Corrected QT Interval, Corrected QT Interval (QTc) as measured by 12-lead electrocardiogram, At screening; Itraconazole group: Day 1, Days 2-5, Day 11, Days 12-15 and Day 16 (or last day of dosing); Efavirenz group: Day 1, Day 20 and Day 25 (or last day of dosing)
This study is designed as an open-label, single sequence, self-controlled study. The study will be conducted for 2 cycles, 10 days per cycle. Itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, and Efavirenz, a CYP3A inducer, will be administrated orally with TGRX-326 to evaluate the effect of these drugs on the pharmacokinetic profiles of TGRX-326. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated as primary endpoints. Safety evaluation will also be conducted.
