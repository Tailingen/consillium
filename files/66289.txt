This study was a multicenter, open, single-arm, Ib-stage expanded clinical study.

Part I：On the basis of Ia-stage dose escalation study, a safe and effective dose of -300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg was selected to enlarge the enrollment study in patients with c-Met-dysregulated advanced NSCLC, and continuously administered until the disease progressed or could not be tolerated, in order to further evaluate the safety, ttolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of BPI-9016M.

Part II：On the basis of the completed research results of Ia stage and part I, a safe and effective dose of 400 mg twice a day (bid) was selected to conduct an expanded enrollment study in NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping alterations, and continuously administered until the disease progressed or could not be tolerated, in order to further evaluate the safety, ttolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of BPI-9016M.
