Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria according to the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0 toxicity assessment criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug that occurred., During the first treatment cycle (28 days).|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., During the first treatment cycle (28 days).|Adverse events (AEs) rate, The occurrence rate of all AEs during treatment, From date of the first dose until 30 days after last dose or start with new anti-tumor treatment, whichever comes first.|Adverse events (AEs) severity, The severity of all AEs occured during treatment, From date of the first dose until 30 days after last dose or start with new anti-tumor treatment, whichever comes first.

Each cycle is 28 days.|Apparent plasma clearance (CL), Apparent plasma clearance of TQB2922., Pre-dose and 5 minutes post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Pre-dose on Day 15 Cycle 2; 2, 6, 24, 72 hours after dose on Cycle 1 Day 1; 6, 24, 72, 128 hours after dose on Cycle 2 Day 1. Each cycle is 28 days.|Apparent volume of distribution (Vz), The ratio of the amount of TQB2922 in the body to the blood concentration, Pre-dose and 5 minutes post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Pre-dose on Day 15 Cycle 2; 2, 6, 24, 72 hours after dose on Cycle 1 Day 1; 6, 24, 72, 128 hours after dose on Cycle 2 Day 1. Each cycle is 28 days.|Minimum concentration (Cmin), Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of TQB2922, Pre-dose and 5 minutes post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and Cycle 2 Day 1; Pre-dose on Day 15 Cycle 2; 2, 6, 24, 72 hours after dose on Cycle 1 Day 1; 6, 24, 72, 128 hours after dose on Cycle 2 Day 1. Each cycle is 28 days.|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 2 years.|Duration of response (DOR), The time from first documented response to documented disease progression., Up to 2 years.|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the first dose of TQB2922 to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years.|Immunogenicity of TQB2922, Immunogenicity of TQB2922 is assessed according to the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA)., From the time of informed consent to 90 days after the last dose.
