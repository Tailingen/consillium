Study of CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated PD-1 and TCR Gene-knocked Out Mesothelin-directed CAR-T Cells in Patients With Mesothelin Positive Multiple Solid Tumors.
Multiple solid tumors have positive targets of mesothelin expressed on the surfaces of the tumor cells, we use the technique of CRISPR-Cas9 to knocked out the PD-1 and TCR of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to effect the immuno-microenvironment around tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells
study of related adverse events, Grade 3 signs/symptoms, toxicities and clinical, 24 weeks
clinical responses to anti-mesothelin cell infusions, Disease control rate(DCR), 24 weeks
1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 and TCR gene-knocked out chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive multiple solid tumors.
2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.
3. To observe and measure anti-tumor responses for patients with detectable mesothelin positive tumor lesions.
