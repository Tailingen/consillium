A Retrospective Real-World Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Combined With Immunotherapy Maintenance Therapy Following Standard Chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC (ALTER-L059)
This retrospective real-world study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with immunotherapy as maintenance therapy following standard chemoimmunotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).The study population consists of treatment-naïve ES-SCLC patients who did not progress after induction chemoimmunotherapy and subsequently received maintenance therapy with anlotinib plus immunotherapy. The primary objectives are progression-free survival (PFS)，overall survival (OS)

, and safety.

Record and analyze the number of abnormal data., up to 24 months
This multicenter study seeks to retrospectively analyze medical records (January 2022-December 2024) of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) patients treated with anlotinib hydrochloride (12/10/8 mg doses) alongside immune maintenance therapy after first-line chemoimmunotherapy in real-world clinical settings. Key data points will encompass demographics, baseline disease characteristics, treatment regimens, efficacy outcomes (e.g., objective response rate, progression-free survival), and adverse event profiles. Eligible patients must have received anlotinib for ≥6 weeks and possess evaluable radiographic assessments. The primary objectives are to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of this combination strategy in ES-SCLC.
