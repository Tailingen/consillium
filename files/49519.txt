DRUG: Bevacizumab
Time to Disease Progression (TDP), Time to disease progression was defined as the time interval between first-line treatment onset and investigator-assessed disease progression. Disease progression was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to a maximum of 36.4 months
