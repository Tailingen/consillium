Denosumab + PD-1 in Subjects With Stage III/ IV Melanoma
This is a multicenter open-label, single-arm, phase II study designed to investigate the pharmacodynamic and antitumor effects of denosumab alone and in combination with an anti-Programmed death-1 or Programmed death ligand 1 (PD1) agent (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) in patients with unresectable Programmed death-1 or Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor-naïve regional and distant metastatic melanoma (The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III/IV). The pharmacodynamic and antitumor effects will be investigated by performing translational research on peripheral blood and tumor tissue collected before and during denosumab alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment.

The Antitumor Effect of Denosumab Alone as Represented by the Change in Recent Thymic Emigrant Cells in Peripheral Blood, The antitumor effect of denosumab alone (i.e., after two loading doses of denosumab are given on day 1 and day 8) in patients with unresectable stage III or distant metastatic Programmed death-1 or Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor-naïve cutaneous melanoma (stage III/IV) will be assessed by performing translational research on peripheral blood samples collected at baseline and on day 21 of the study. The hypothesis is that denosumab treatment will prevent the destruction of autoreactive T cells within the thymus -and therefore will increase the influx of those T cells into the blood, termed recent thymic emigrants (RTE). RTE will be measured by multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of cluster of differentiation CD4+ and CD8+ RTE isolated from peripheral blood. Results will be expressed as the change in the number of cells/microliter of peripheral blood between the baseline and the day 21 time points., 3 weeks after start of denosumab|The Antitumor Effect of Denosumab Alone as Represented by the Change in Density of Tumor-infiltrating Cluster of Differentiation (CD8+) Cells (TILs) in Tumor Tissue., The antitumor effect of denosumab alone (i.e., after two loading doses of denosumab are given on day 1 and day 8) in patients with unresectable stage III or distant metastatic Programmed death-1 or Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitor-naïve cutaneous melanoma (stage III/IV) will be assessed by performing translational research on tumor biopsy samples collected at baseline and on day 21 of the study. The hypothesis is that denosumab alone will increase influx of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells (TIL).

Procedures

Subjects in this trial will be given denosumab, 120 mg s.c. q4 weeks, starting on day 1 of study treatment. Additional loading doses of Denosumab will be administered on day 8 and day 22 ( after Amendment 1). Nivolumab, 480 mg will be administered intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks and initiated 21 days after the first dose of Denosumab is given. In subjects enrolled prior to Amendment 1 Pembrolizumab, 200 mg will be administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks and initiated 21 days after the first dose of denosumab is given. Combination therapy with both agents will continue as long as subjects benefit from therapy for up to 1 year. Study therapy will be discontinued for intolerable toxicity, disease progression or for other reasons at the discretion of the investigator. If subjects are not withdrawn prematurely then their last dose of study medications will be administered approximately 49 weeks after denosumab was initiated.
