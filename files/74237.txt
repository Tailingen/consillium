Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (HR NMIBC) (MK-3475-676/KEYNOTE-676)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat high-risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer (HR NMIBC). NMIBC is cancer in the tissue that lines the inside of the bladder but has not spread to the bladder muscle or outside of the bladder. High-risk means NMIBC may have a high chance of getting worse or coming back after treatment.

The goals of this study are to learn: 1. If more people who receive pembrolizumab with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) have no signs of cancer in their body and live longer without the cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to people who receive BCG alone. 2. About the safety and how well people tolerate BCG alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to ~5 years|Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs (Cohorts A and B), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to ~5 years|Change from Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life (Items 29 and 30) Combined Score (Cohorts A and B), The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall outcome. The change from baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30) combined score will be presented., Baseline, time of last PRO assessment (up to ~2 years)|Change from Baseline in EORTC-QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning (Items 1-5) Combined Score (Cohorts A and B), EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better quality of life. The change from baseline in Physical Functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5) combined score will be presented., Baseline, time of last PRO assessment (up to ~2 years)|Change from Baseline in EORTC-QLQ-Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Module 24 (NMIBC24) Total Score (Cohorts A and B), The EORTC-QLQ-NMIBC24 is a 24-item questionnaire developed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30 in high-risk NMIBC patients. Each item is scored out of 4 total points (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). All responses are transformed from 0 to 100, with a high score indicating more symptoms or problems. The change from baseline in EORTC-QLQ-NMIBC24 total score will be presented., Baseline, time of last PRO assessment (up to ~2 years)|Change from Baseline in European Quality of Life (EuroQoL)-5 Dimensions, 5-level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analogue Score (VAS) (Cohorts A and B), The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 10 cm vertical, visual analogue scale. It is rated by the respondent on a scale 0 to 100, with 0 being "the worst health you can imagine" and 100 being "the best health you can imagine". The change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS will be presented., Baseline, time of last PRO assessment (up to ~2 years)|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life (Items 29 and 30) Combined Score (Cohorts A and B), EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients.

Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall outcome. TTD in Global Health Status/Quality of Life is defined as the time from baseline to the first onset of a 10 point or greater decrease from baseline in the Global Health Status/Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30) combined score, with or without subsequent confirmation., Time of last PRO assessment (up to ~2 years)|TTD in the EQ-5D-5L VAS (Cohorts A and B), The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale.
