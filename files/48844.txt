(PATHFINDER) Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Avapritinib (BLU-285), A Selective KIT Mutation-targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, in Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis
This is an open-label, single arm, Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of avapritinib (BLU-285) in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM), including patients with aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL)
