Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique on Children With Leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy.
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the effect of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique on anxiety and fatigue among children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. The main research hypotheses are;

* Children with leukemia who receive Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique exhibit less anxiety than those who don't receive it.
* Children with leukemia who receive Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique exhibit less fatigue than those who don't receive it.

Researchers will compare Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique with standardized nursing care on a child's anxiety and fatigue.

PROCEDURE: Jacobson's PMRT
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale:, This tool was developed initially by (Smets et al., 1995) to assess fatigue for the subject. The scale comprised 18 items and 3 subscales which are; General Fatigue, Sleep/Rest Fatigue, and Cognitive Fatigue.

The format, instructions, Likert response scale, and scoring method are identical to the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales, with higher scores indicating a better health-related quality of life (lower fatigue symptoms). A five-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the responses in which (zero= never a problem; one = almost never a problem; two= sometimes a problem; three= often a problem; four= almost always a problem). Items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows:

* 0 = 100-76
* 1 = 75-51
* 2 = 50-26
* 3 = 25-1
* 4= 0, before and after intervention.
Spence Children's Anxiety Scale - Child (SCAS-Child), This tool was developed initially by Spence, S.H., (1997) to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms for the subject. The scale consists of six subscales: Separation Anxiety, Social Phobia, Obsessive Compulsive Problems, Panic/Agoraphobia, Generalized Anxiety/Overanxious Symptoms and Fears of Physical Injury.

Scores consist of a total raw score (range from 0 to 114) and six sub-scale scores, with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety symptoms. Sub-scales are computed by summing the following items:

* Separation anxiety (items 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 44)
* Social phobia (items 6, 7, 9, 10, 29, 35)
* Obsessive-compulsive (items 14, 19, 27, 40, 41, 42)
* Panic/agoraphobia (items 13, 21, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 39)
* Physical Injury (items 2, 18, 23, 25, 33)
* Generalized anxiety (items 1, 3, 4, 20, 22, 24) Items that are not scored in either the total score or the sub-scale scores are 11, 17, 26, 31, 38, 43, 45, and 46. They are not scored because they did, before and after intervention.
Socio Demographic and Medical Data of Children with leukemia Undergoing Chemotherapy Structured Interview Schedule, This tool will be developed by the researcher to assess the socio-demographic and medical data of children undergoing chemotherapy. It will include 2 parts:

Part I: Socio-demographic data: It includes age, gender, educational level, and residence.

Part II: Medical data of children: It includes onset of disease, type of leukemia, prescribed chemotherapy, before intervention
