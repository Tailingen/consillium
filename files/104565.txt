Change From Baseline in Fatigue Scale-Adolescent (FS-A) Score Categorized According to 1-5 Rating Scale of Resource Use and Resource Helpfulness., The FS-A is a 14-item self-report instrument which measures on a 5 point scale ranging from '1 - not at all' to '5 - all the time' the extent to which each of 14 statements describes how the respondent has been feeling during the past 7 days (Hinds et al., 2007). The potential score range is 14-70; higher scores represent greater fatigue (Hinds et al., 2007). The scores (1 through 5) on the Likert-type scales for resource use and resource helpfulness were determined at each post baseline time point, as were change from baseline values for the FS-A. All FS-A change from baseline values, per Resource Use or Resource Helpfulness Categorization, were combined regardless of post-baseline time point., baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks
Cancer-related fatigue is a prevalent and distressing symptom which has a significant impact on quality of life for children and adolescents with cancer and their families. Evidence based guidelines issued by the Oncology Nursing Society and National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend educational interventions for preventing and treating cancer-related fatigue.The primary study aim is to examine the relationships among: intensity of cancer-related fatigue; frequency of use of an evidence based educational resource for self-management of cancer-related fatigue; and perceived helpfulness of resource use. The secondary aim is to examine the relationship between the Fatigue Scale-Adolescent (FS-A) and the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) 'tired' item as measures of intensity of cancer-related fatigue. The tertiary aim is to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining adolescents with cancer for longitudinal study of cancer-related fatigue.
