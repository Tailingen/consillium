Risk Adapted SABR(SABR) in Stage I NSCLC And Lung Metastases
This study is designed to evaluate the safety of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) in selected patients with stage I Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic lung cancer to demonstrate the feasibility and risks of using an ablative dose-adapted scheme with FFF beams. Other aims are To evaluate the incidence of acute and late complications; To evaluate tumour response to local radiation therapy by means of CT, PET/TC and MRI and To evaluate the impact of local therapy on overall and disease-free survival.

probability of not suffering a grade 3 or higher toxicity, Patients will be follow-up during one year. If patient suffered any toxicity grade 3 or higher during this period it will be classified as having toxicity. Otherwise patient will be classified as not having toxicity., one year
Tumour response, To evaluate tumour response attending histology with local radiation using imaging such as CT and PET/CT., One year|Incidence of acute and late toxicities, To evaluate the frequency of acute and late toxicities., One year|Overall survival, To evaluate the impact of local therapy on overall survival., One year|Disease-free survival, To evaluate the impact of local therapy on disease-free survival., One year|Effect in brochopulmonary (COPD) disease., To evaluate the impact of local therapy on bronchopulmonary (COPD) disease., One year|Feasibility, To evaluate the feasibility of this technique in terms of technical complications., One year
The intervention (dose and fractions) depends on topographical parameters: lung disease (primary, peripheral nodes or mediastinal nodes), distance to chest wall, tumour size and distance to main bronchus.
