Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Patients Who Have Undergone Neck Dissection for Oral Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples in predicting oral cancer in patients who have undergone neck dissection for oral cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
GENETIC: microarray analysis|GENETIC: allele-specific oligonucleotide real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: diagnostic laboratory biomarker analysis
overall survival, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To test preliminary data from node-positive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) signatures for their ability to predict lymph-positive primaries using a cohort of OSCC tumors.
* To perform lymph node prediction using sentinel lymph node-biopsied primaries.
* To validate the preliminary data node-positive OSCC signature and test its ability to predict nodal status.

OUTLINE: Patient tissue samples are screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human papilloma virus-specific primers. Samples are analyzed to identify a nodal-metastasis signature for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Samples also undergo microarray analysis to quantify expression levels for targeted genes. Initial data analysis is performed using AffymetrixÂ® Microarray Suite 5.0 to quantify expression levels for targeted genes.
