Organ Preservation With Durvalumab-based Immunotherapy in Combination With Chemoradiation as Definitive Therapy for Early Stage Esophageal Adenocarcinoma With Indication for Radical Surgery
The present clinical trial is a prospective, investigator-initiated, single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase II trial investigating whether a definite organ preservation therapy consisting of the combination of durvalumab with chemoradiation is an efficient and safe treatment option for early stage, cT1 and cT2N0, esophageal adenocarcinoma with indication for radical surgery.

Rate of clinical and pathological complete response (cCR/pCR), Rate of clinical and pathological complete response rate at time of endoscopic re-evaluation (at the end of the core study treatment) according to Becker criteria and investigator-based RECIST v1.1 assessment as well as endoscopic response criteria similar to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association Guideline, 8 weeks after completion of core treatment

* Severity of adverse events by CTCAE v5.0 grade
* Relationship of adverse events to the durvalumab, chemotherapy and/or radiation
* Frequency of clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters to CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), up to 20 months
Patients with early stage, cT1 and cT2N0 esophageal adenocarcinoma with indication for radical surgery (esophagectomy or transhiatal extended gastrectomy) will be enrolled in two cohorts according to their PD-L1 CPS (cohort 1 CPS \< 10, cohort 2 CPS ≥ 10). All patients will receive core treatment consisting of immunotherapy with durvalumab in parallel to 2 cycles FLOT chemotherapy, followed by immunotherapy with durvalumab in parallel to 3 cycles of modified FOLFOX plus concomitant radiation (50 Gy). Eight weeks after this, patients will undergo tumor assessment consisting of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with extensive biopsies (bite-on-bite biopsies and fine-needle aspiration), endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumor thickness, and CT- or MRI-scans for tumor re-evaluation. Surgical resection would be offered only to those patients in whom a locoregional persistence is confirmed on tumor assessment, in the absence of any signs of distant dissemination. Patients with complete remission will enter the maintenance phase receiving durvalumab monotherapy for up to 12 cycles.

The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the treatment efficacy of the combination of durvalumab and chemoradiation as organ preservative treatment option avoiding mortality and surgical complications with rate of clinical and pathological complete response (cCR/pCR) at time of endoscopic re-evaluation defined as primary efficacy endpoint.

The secondary objectives are the further assessment of the efficacy of the combination of durvalumab and chemoradiation as organ preservative treatment option 1-/2- and 3-year cCR/pCR rate, rate of salvage surgery, 90-day and 1-year mortality as secondary endpoints and to assess the quality of life (QoL).
