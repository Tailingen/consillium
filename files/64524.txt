Efficacy and Safety of Relacorilant in Patients With Cortisol-Secreting Adrenal Adenomas
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy, and safety of relacorilant to treat hypercortisolism in patients with cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma or hyperplasia associated with diabetes mellitus/ impaired glucose tolerance and/or uncontrolled systolic hypertension.

This Phase 3 study patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with relacorilant (active drug) or placebo. Patients will receive relacorilant or placebo for 22 weeks. Patients who complete the study may also be eligible to roll over into an extension study.
