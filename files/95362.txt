Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: S-1
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of s-1 in combination with thoracic radiotherapy in elderly patients (> 70 years old) with esophageal Cancer, the MTD will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of six experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment., 3 months per patient
Objective response rate (e.g. complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], or progressive disease [PD])., dependent upon results
Purpose:evaluated the dose-limiting toxicity and recommended dose of S-1 for a future phase II study when administered concurrently with thoracic radiation in elderly patients (\>70 years old) with esophageal Cancer.

Methods:S-1 was administered on days 1-14 and 29-42 at the following dosages: 60, 70, and 80mg/m(2)/day. Thoracic radiation therapy was administered in 1.8Gy fractions five times weekly to a total dose of 54 Gy.
