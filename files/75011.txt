Multidisciplinary Team IntervenTion in CArdio-ONcology (TITAN Study)
People with breast cancer often experience many short and long-term side effects as a result of both the cancer and the necessary treatments.

Receiving extra assessments and care from teams of multiple health professionals has been shown to be helpful for people with other health problems, such as heart disease. These 'multidisciplinary' teams may include nurses, doctors, pharmacists, dietitians, exercise therapists, counselors, and other specialists. Currently, the investigators do not know if receiving extra assessments from a multidisciplinary team is helpful for people receiving cancer treatment.

In this study, the investigators hope to learn the effect of extra assessments and early interventions from teams of health care professionals in people diagnosed with cancer, during and after the treatment period.

After initial assessments, participants will be randomized to multidisciplinary team intervention or usual care.
