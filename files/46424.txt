Aerobic Training and Diet on the Immune System in Postmastectomy Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of aerobic exercise combined with diet protocol on the immune system in post-mastectomy patients receiving chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy reduces circulating lymphocytes levels, which affect lymphocytes in breast cancer patients during the therapy itself or up to 3 months after the last chemotherapy cycle, so the study is developed to investigate the impact of aerobic exercise combined with diet protocol on the immune system in post-mastectomy patients receiving chemotherapy. Sixty post-mastectomy women were receiving chemotherapy and aged from 40-60 years selected from the outpatient clinic of the oncology department in the New Cairo hospital in the Police Academy. They will be assigned randomly into three equal groups, the aerobic exercises and diet protocol group, the diet protocol group, and the aerobic exercises group. The immunological markers; total lymphocyte count (TLC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR) will be measured at baseline and after twelve weeks of intervention.
