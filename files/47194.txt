Brentuximab Vedotin Associated With Chemotherapy in Untreated Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin + AVD combination (doxorubicine, vinblastine, dacarbazine) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma stage I / II with an unfavorable diagnosis, assessed by the negativity of PET (positron emission tomography ) after two cycles of chemotherapy.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Bleomycin|DRUG: Vinblastine|DRUG: Dacarbazine|DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin
PET2 assessment, Assessment of PET after two cycles according to the five-point scale Deauville criteria (Negative = 1, 2, 3 and Positive = 4, 5), based on central review., 8 weeks
Complete response (CR) rate, according to Cheson 2007 criteria, 16 weeks|Progression free survival (PFS), Survival without disease progression, 5 years|Overall survival (OS), 5 years
Patients will receive either ABVD chemotherapy (standard treatment = doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) or the Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy AVD (study treatment), depending on randomization. Radiotherapy is planned after chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy.

PET scans will be performed before inclusion, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy and after 4 cycles of chemotherapy (if PET after two cycles was positive), at the end of treatment and during follow-up period.
