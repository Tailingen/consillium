PEN-866 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
Protocol PEN-866-001 is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1/2a study evaluating PEN-866 in patients with advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.

Maximum concentration (Cmax) of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 ligand and SN-38), Characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 targeting ligand and SN-38), 1 Month (Phase 1a); 14 days (Phase 1b); assessed up to (estimated) 18 months for Phase 2a|Area under the curve (AUC) of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 ligand and SN-38), Characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 targeting ligand and SN-38), 1 Month (Phase 1a); 14 days (Phase 1b); assessed up to (estimated) 18 months for Phase 2a|Half-life (t1/2) of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 ligand and SN-38), Characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of PEN-866 and its components (HSP90 targeting ligand and SN-38), 1 Month (Phase 1a); 14 days (Phase 1b); assessed up to (estimated) 18 months for Phase 2a|Phase 1b: Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination therapies and their components, PK parameters (CMax, AUC) will be evaluated in plasma by standard non-compartmental methods (compartmental modeling may be performed if appropriate)., 14 days|Phase 1a: Tumor response using RECIST 1.1 criteria, Size of tumors by CT or MRI using tumor response criteria according to RECIST 1.1 and duration of response., Baseline and every 6 weeks until date of first documented progression or death (estimated 6 months)|Phase 1b: Disease Control Rate, Efficacy of PEN-866 in combination therapy will be assessed using DCR as defined as CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1., From date of first treatment through the date of date of first documented progression, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months|Phase 2a: Disease Control Rate in patients with SCLC, gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the genitalia (anus, cervix, vulva, and penis), Efficacy of PEN-866 in SCLC, gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the genitalia (anus, cervix, vulva, and penis) will be assessed using DCR as defined as CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1., From date of first treatment through the date of date of first documented progression, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months|Phase 2a: Evaluate the best overall response rate in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Efficacy of PEN-866 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using best overall tumor response rate as defined as CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1, From date of first treatment through the date of first documented progression, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months|Phase 1b and 2a: Duration of Response, Time from first documented response (CR or PR) to date of first documented disease progression or death due to underlying cancer., From date of first treatment until the date of date of death from any cause, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months|Phase 2a: Radiographic progression free survival, Time from first PEN-866 dose to date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, From date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever is first, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months|Phase 2a: Overall survival, Time from first PEN-866 dose to date of death from any cause, From date of first treatment until the date of date of death from any cause, assessed up to (estimated) 18 months
Phase 1a will employ an adaptive model guided with overdose control principle to make dose recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PEN-866 (single agent).

Phase 1b will employ a standard 3 + 3 design to make dose recommendations and estimate the MTD of PEN-866 in combination therapy.

Phase 2a (single agent) will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics profile of PEN-866 (single agent) at the recommended Phase 2 dose determined at the conclusion of Phase 1a in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
