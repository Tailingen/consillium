Study of Abemaciclib and Elacestrant in Patients With Brain Metastasis Due to ER+/HER-2- Breast Cancer
This is a multi-site, global, open-label study that includes a phase 1b evaluation of elacestrant in combination with abemaciclib in women and men with brain metastases from estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) negative breast cancer. Phase 1b was designed to select the recommended phase 2 dose and is followed by an ongoing phase 2 evaluation of elacestrant in combination with abemaciclib in patients with active brain metastases from ER-positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer.

DRUG: Elacestrant|DRUG: Abemaciclib
Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Based on the observed number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle. Dose-limiting toxicity is based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. DLTs will be evaluated during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment in up to 3 cohorts during Phase 1b. A DLT will be defined as any of the toxicities listed in the protocol that are not clearly due to breast cancer or extraneous causes., 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of either a complete response or partial response per blinded independent central review, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., 3 years
Intracranial Response Rate (RR) per RECIST v1.1, Defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial response + complete response, based on intracranial lesions per RECIST v1.1 and blinded independent central review., 3 years|Intracranial RR per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO), Defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial response plus complete response, based on intracranial lesions (per RANO criteria) and per blinded independent central review., 3 years|Duration of Tumor Response (DOR), Defined as the duration of time from the date when criteria are met for either a complete response or partial response, per RECIST v1.1, until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, per blinded independent central review., 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Defined as the proportion of patients who have the best overall response a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease., 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time elapsing between the start of treatment and the date of the earliest evidence of objective disease progression or death of any cause before documented disease-progression assessed through study completion., 3 years
