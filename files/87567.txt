Protein Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor, in Recurrent Glioblastoma
Background:

The brain is separated from the rest of the blood stream by the blood-brain barrier. This is like a filter that protects the brain. But is also a challenge when medicines need to get into the brain. Researchers want to give the new drug LB100 to people before brain tumor surgery. They will measure how much LB100 is in the blood and how much gets into the brain. This may help with the use of LB100 to treat brain tumors in the future.

Objective:

To see if LB100 can pass into the brain.

Eligibility:

People at least 18 years old with a brain tumor that requires surgery.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Physical exam

Medical history

Blood tests

Neurosurgery evaluation

Scans

Heart tests

Tumor sample. This can be from a previous procedure.

Participants will have their brain surgery at the Clinical Center.

Participants will get a dose of the study drug through a plastic tube in a vein for 2 hours during surgery.

Participants will have blood taken 7 times in the 8 hours after getting the study drug.

Tumor samples will be taken during surgery.

Participants will have a heart test after getting the study drug. Sticky pads on the skin will measure electrical activity of the heart.

Two-three weeks after leaving the hospital, participants will have a follow-up visit. They will have a physical exam and blood tests.

One month after surgery, they will be contacted in person or by phone to see how they are doing.

Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 39 months and 6 days.
Background:

* Primary gliomas are an incurable disease in spite of aggressive multimodality therapy consisting of craniotomy, irradiation, and chemotherapy. Therapeutic options for patients with recurrent glioma are limited, and there is an unmet need to identify more effective agents.
* LB100, a water-soluble small molecule novel protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, was commercially developed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) based on our previous intramural research. This compound has shown to be effective in a variety of cancer types in both in vitro and in vivo models. Preclinical studies indicate LB100 has in vitro and in vivo activity as a single agent as well as potentiating the effect of cytotoxic agents including temozolomide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and ionizing radiation. LB100 is active in combination with temozolomide or doxorubicin against xenografts of glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma.
* A complete phase I study of LB100 has established its safety and the recommended phase II dose (2.33 mg/m\^2, daily for three days every 3 weeks).
* Although it is a polar compound, rodent studies suggest LB100 has activity in the brain.
* Whether LB100 can across the human blood brain barrier (BBB), and at what concentration relative to the plasma level is not known. Characterizing these parameters is important because:

  * 1) Our ongoing in vitro studies indicate that LB100 has distinct mechanisms of action at different drug concentrations (e.g., nM versus uM);
  * 2) There are other brain tumors lacking effective medical therapies but without a BBB. Characterizing the LB100 BBB penetration profile will assist in defining its optimal clinical indication.

Objective:

-To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of LB100 in glioma tumor tissues.

Eligibility:

* Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma and grades II-III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
* A clear clinical indication for another surgical resection must be present.
* Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.
* Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60%.
* Patients must have adequate organ function.

Design:

* This is a two stage Phase II, open label, single institution study to determine the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of LB100.
* The dose (established from a Phase I study) will be 2.33 mg/m\^2 delivered intravenously over 2 hours.
* PK and PD effect of LB100 treated tissues will only be evaluated with pathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor. Resected material demonstrating chemoradiation treatment effect or inflammatory response will not be included in the analysis.
* PK will be determined by quantitating LB100 in tumor tissues removed at various time points.
* The primary endpoint is PK response, defined as a binary variable indicating the presence/absence of LB100 in tumor tissues.
* PD effect is defined as statistically significant elevation of phospho-proteins in treated tumor tissues compared to untreated glioma specimens. Untreated inter-patient baseline variance and standard deviation (SD) will be calculated. Post-treatment PD effect difference greater than 2.5 times the baseline SD is statistically significant at the .05 significance level. Due to relatively small sample size, t-distribution is to be used to calculate the cutoff defining the PD response.
* Up to 25 patients may be enrolled to obtain 8 evaluable subjects. A two-stage design will be used. Five patients will be initially treated. If at least one of five demonstrates PK activity, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled. PK effect will be declared to be significant if at least 2 of the 8 patients demonstrate a PK response (presence of LB100 in tumor tissue).
