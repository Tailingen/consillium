FCN-159 Monotherapy Versus Chemotherapy by Investigator's Choice in Pediatric Low-grade Glioma Patients With BRAF Alteration
An open-label, randomized, multi-center phase III clinical study: Aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FCN-159 monotherapy versus the treatment by investigator's choice in patients with pediatric low-grade glioma harboring KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or BRAF V600E mutation
