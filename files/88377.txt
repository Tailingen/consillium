Pharmacogenetic Study of Antimitotic Therapies Involved in Hepatic VOD in Children With Nephroblastoma or ALL
Hepatic veno-occlusive diseases (VOD) during cancer treatment in children are serious toxicities that have occurred with interruptions of chemotherapy and risk of relapse. In addition, these toxicities have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, serious long-term sequelae and are potentially fatal in children.

The risk factors associated with the occurrence of these complications are, to date, unknown, at the exception to the exposition to certain treatments (6-thioguanine, busulfan, actinomycin D, radiotherapy, etc.). To understand the effects of this toxicity and those of susceptibility to the disease becomes a major issue in the treatment of these children.

OTHER: Blood test for genetic analysis
Correlate pharmacogenetic analysis with veno-occlusive disease., Illumina's "Human Omni2.5-8 v1.3" microarrays explore more than 2,600,000 genetic variants, thus covering the entire genome with more than 300,000 genetic biomarkers in exons., One day
Participant characteristics., Age, sociodemographics, personal and cancer history., One day
Case-control study, nested in two French multicenter cohorts, on pharmacognenetic, biological and clinical susceptibility factors associated with the occurrence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease during the anticancer treatment for nephroblastoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with centralized genetic analysis.

After obtaining consent (patient or parents for minor patients), a blood sample is collected during the routine follow-up consultation and tubes are sent directly to Paris for the pharmacogenetic analysis at the end of the study.
