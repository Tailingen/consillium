Clinical Study of QSOX1 as a Biomarker for Colon Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to determine whether the secreted protein QSOX1 can be used as a molecular marker for early rapid diagnosis and accurate treatment of colon cancer.
Colon Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Diagnosis of colon cancer
Detection of RNA for early rapid diagnosis of colon cancer., RT-PCR was used to detect the RNA levels of QSOX1 in the tumor and control groups., 6 months|Detection of protein for early rapid diagnosis of colon cancer., Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of QSOX1 in the tumor and control groups., 6 months
The project mainly selects the tumor group represented by colon cancer and the corresponding healthy people as the control group, with about 100 cases in each of the two groups. Mainly collect blood and tumor tissue samples of patients, detect the expression of QSOX1 in the above samples, and explore the role in the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of colon cancer.
