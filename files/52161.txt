Whole Brain Radiotherapy With or Without Temozolomide at Daily Fixed-dose for Brain Metastases Treatment
RATIONALE

* Fractionated radiotherapy uses high-energy photons to kill, or damage tumor cells. High daily dose temozolomide combined with fractionated radiotherapy may make tumor cells more sensible to treatment.

PURPOSE

* This randomized phase II trial, assess in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors, whether the whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus temozolomide is able to improve the results obtained with WBRT.
Brain Neoplasms
DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Whole brain irradiation
Objective Response Rates. Assessed With Cranial MRI, Objective Response (OR) encompassed the number of participants with Complete Response (CR) and the number of participants with Partial Response (PR). CR is the disappearance of all brain metastases, assessed between two or more cranial MRI. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of the brain metastases, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, assessed between two or more cranial MRI.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the ratio between the number of participants with objective response and the total number of participants., 90 days
Survival Free of Brain Metastases Progression (PFS of BM), Progression free survival of brain metastases is the survival of participants without progressive brain metastases or without neurological symptoms. The progressive brain metastases (PBM) were evaluated with cranial MRI. The PBM were defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new metastases., at 90 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival:Time in months measured from treatment initiation until the date of death or the date of last follow-up., 1 year|Number of Grade 3-4 Adverse Events (AE) That Are Definitely or Probably Related to Both Groups of Treatment., AE, evaluated and graded according to the NCI common terminology criteria (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0

Grade 3 Severe AE.

Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE., 4 months
