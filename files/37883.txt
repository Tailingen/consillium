CRISPR-Edited Allogeneic Anti-CD19 CAR-T Cell Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (ANTLER)
CB010A is a study evaluating safety, emerging efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of CB-010 in adults with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma after lymphodepletion consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Lymphoma|B Cell Lymphoma|B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
GENETIC: CB-010|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Primary outcome measures number of patients with dose-limiting toxicities (Part A)., Incidence of adverse events defined as dose-limiting toxicities with onset within 28 days after CB-010 infusion., 28 days following CB-010 infusion|Primary outcome evaluates tumor response (Part B), The primary endpoint is objective response rate., Up to 12 months
This clinical trial is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label evaluation of safety and emerging efficacy of CB-010 in adults with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study is conducted in two parts: Part A is dose escalation following a 3 + 3 design, with sequential, prespecified, increasing doses. Part B is the expansion portion where patients will receive CB-010 at the dose determined in Part A.
