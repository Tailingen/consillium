Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of HM16390 in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a First-in-Human, Phase 1, Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion study of HM16390, as a single agent to assess safety, tolerability, MTD, RP2D, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Dose-Escalation Part is planned to establish the MTD or RDs for the randomized Dose-Ranging Part. Based on the results of the Dose-Escalation Part, additional eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 into at each dose level. After a comprehensive review of available data from both Dose-Escalation Part and Dose-Ranging Part, the potential RP2D to be tested in the Dose-Expansion Part is determined. Dose-Expansion Part is designed to assess the potential efficacy of HM16390 as a single agent when administered at the potential RP2D to subjects in indication-specific expansion cohorts.
