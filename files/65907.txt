Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Cancer Patients With Depression and Anxiety
Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In addition, cancer is associated with high rates of depression and anxiety among its sufferers, and cancer patients with depression usually have worse treatment outcomes and long-term survival. Surprisingly, many cancer patients with depression do not receive treatment for their depression, perhaps because treatments for cancer-related depression are usually adapted from those used in non-cancer populations and may not be suitable for cancer patients. Moreover, cancer patients with depression are more likely to have a long latency of anti-depressant drug action, negative drug-drug interactions with cancer chemotherapies and an increased susceptibility for systemic side effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new treatment modality for depression that affects the brain directly with no systemic side effects and poses no potential for drug-drug interactions. rTMS therapy was recently cleared by the FDA as an antidepressant treatment for treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder, and now is being evaluated for a wide array of additional psychiatric indications. This randomized, open label, two-arm, pilot study will investigate the safety, tolerability, feasibility and the efficacy of two forms of rTMS (i.e., left (fast) and right (slow) sided rTMS) in cancer-related depression. The study hypotheses are that rTMS will significantly reduce symptoms of depression and that right-sided slow rTMS will be more effective than left-sided fast rTMS for the treatment of severe anxiety.
