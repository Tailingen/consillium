Bevacizumab Plus EGFR-TKIs in Chinese Patients With EGFR-mutant NSCLC: a Real-world Study
This study is a prospective, multicenter, real-world study to investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus epidermal growth factor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Chinese Patients With Stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

Progression-free survival (PFS) for bevacizumab plus first-generation EGFR-TKIs by investigator using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with first-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as measured by investigators, This is a real-world study. The estimated median PFS for bevacizumab plus first-generation EGFR-TKIs is 18 months according to previous data.|Progression-free survival (PFS) for bevacizumab plus second-generation EGFR-TKIs by investigator using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with second-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as measured by investigators., This is a real-world study. The estimated median PFS for bevacizumab plus second-generation EGFR-TKIs is 20 months according to previous data.|Progression-free survival (PFS) for bevacizumab plus third-generation EGFR-TKIs by investigator using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with third-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as measured by investigators., This is a real-world study. The estimated median PFS for bevacizumab plus third-generation EGFR-TKIs is 22 months according to previous data.
Objective response rate (ORR) by investigator using RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations, with or without EGFR T790M mutation,as measured by investigators assessed objective response rate using RECIST v1.1, Baseline overall tumor assessment can be performed up to 28 days after the first-dose of treatment. Post-baseline assessment will be performed every six weeks until 1st disease progression, through study completion, an average of 2 years.|Disease control rate (DCR) by investigator using RECIST v1.1, Disease control rate (DCR) will be analyzed using similar method as objective response rate., Baseline overall tumor assessment can be performed up to 28 days after the first-dose of treatment. Post-baseline assessment will be performed every six weeks until 1st disease progression, through study completion, an average of 2 years.|Overall survival, To evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations,with or without EGFR T790M mutation,as measured by investigators assessed overall survival., The primary analysis on overall survival is espected to perform on 48 months of follow-up.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events using CTCAE V5.0, To evaluate the incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of bevacizumab combined with EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC harbouring activating EGFR mutations,with or without EGFR T790M mutation., This is a real-world study. Safety of the combination treatment is expected to perform until the study completion, an average of 1.5 years,according to CTCAE V5.0.
