A Study of Cesium-131 Brachytherapy Following Sub-Lobar Resection for Early Stage Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
For patients diagnosed with early (Stage I) non-small cell lung cancer, a lobe of lung is usually removed at surgery to treat the cancer. For some patients, the removal of a lobe of lung may leave too little lung behind for easy breathing. For some of these patients, it may be possible to perform a smaller-scale surgery ("sub-lobar resection") and place a radioactive implant behind to prevent the cancer from growing back. This study will see how these patients do in terms of controlling their disease treated with a radioactive implant called Cesium-131.
