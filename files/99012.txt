5x-Multiplier vs 3-Tier Model for Discharge Opioid Prescriptions After Intra-abdominal Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Clinical Trial
To compare 2 different models for prescribing opioid pain medication to provide better pain control to participants with an abdominal cancer who are having surgery.
Intra-abdominal Cancer
DRUG: Hydrocodone|DRUG: Tramadol|DRUG: Oxycodone
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

The co-primary objectives of this study are as follows:

1. To determine differences in the initial OME prescribed upon discharge between each algorithm/model.

1. To determine OME usage by day 14 after hospital discharge.

Secondary Objectives:

Secondary objectives are as follows:

1. To determine rates of patients with zero OME upon discharge.
2. To determine rates of OME refill requests and completions at 15- and 30-days post-operation.
3. To determine number of unused or leftover pills at 15- and 30-days post- operation
4. To determine persistent opioid use at 30-days, 3-months, and 6-months post-operation
5. To elucidate patient, prescriber, and oncologic factors predictive of persistent opioid use
6. To assess quality of life using patient-reported outcomes at 30-days, 3-months, and 6-months post-operation.
7. To determine patient satisfaction with either prescribing model.
