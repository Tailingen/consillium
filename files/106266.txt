Phase I/II Trial: BIBF 1120 Added to Low-dose Cytarabine in Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
RATIONALE: Low-dose cytarabine works in a minority of elderly patients with an acute myeloid leukemia unfit for intensive induction therapy by killing of leukemia cells. Addition of BIBF1120 to low-dose cytarabine might enhance the killing of leukemia cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I / II trial is studying how safe BIBF1120 can be combined with low-dose cytarabine (phase I) and how well the combination of low-dose cytarabine and BIBF1120 works in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia unfit for intensive chemotherapy (phase II).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: triple kinase inhibitor BIBF1120
Phase I: defining maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 4 weeks|Phase II: overall response rate (ORR), up to 6 month
Complete remission (CR) rate, up to 12 month|overall survival (OS), up to 12 month|relapse-free survival (RFS)of the responding patients, up to 12 month|number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, up to 12 month|ORR rate of the Flt3-mutated patients versus the Flt3-wildtype patients, up to 12 month|CR rate of the Flt3-mutated patients versus the Flt3-wildtype patients, up to 12 month|OS of the Flt3-mutated patients versus the Flt3-wildtype patients, up to 12 month|time to response (CR, CRp, CRi) of the responding patients, CRp = complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery CRi = complete remission with incomplete neutrophil recovery, up to 12 month
