A Dose-finding Study of a Combination of Imatinib and BKM120 in the Treatment of 3rd Line GIST Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine a maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose of a combination of imatinib and BKM120 in the treatment of 3rd line GIST patients.
3rd Line GIST
DRUG: STI571|DRUG: BKM120
Frequency and characteristics of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level during the first cycle of therapy, Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (v4.0.3), unless otherwise specified in the protocol., 28 days (1st cycle)
Frequency and characteristics of DLTs at each dose level during the first cycle of therapy. Type, frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions., Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed using CTCAE (v4.0.3), unless otherwise specified in the protocol., 28 days (1st cycle)|Imatinib and BKM120 plasma concentrations vs time profile, and basic PK parameters, including but not limited to AUC, Cmax, Tmax, CL/F., 28 days (1st cycle)|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the rate of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) which lasts for at least 16 weeks., Tumor response will be determined locally by the investigator sites according to Novartis guideline on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, based on RECIST Version 1.1., 28 days (1st cycle)
