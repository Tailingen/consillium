Maintenance Treatment of Apatinib in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for later treatment of patients(after second-line treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma), including overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS); the relationship between EBV DNA copy number and survival after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy; Quality of life score (QoL); evaluation of drug safety.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib mesylate tablet
Objective Response Rate (ORR) after Second-Line Treatment for Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, To evaluate ORR every 6-8 weeks after initiation of apatinib., up to 24 months
Disease-free survival (DFS), The time from the first day of therapy to locoregional relapse, distant relapse again or tumor-related death., up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), The time from the first day of therapy to death or last follow-up., up to 24 months|Toxicity evaluation, Related toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0., up to 24 months
In locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC), although fist-line therapy with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Docetaxel/5-Fu) and second-line therapy with chemotherapy has been given, patients still locally recurrence and distant metastasis. There is no standard treatment recommendation for locally recurrent or metastatic NPC who failed to second-line therapy. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III studies of liver cancer, non small cell lung cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxicities and better tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in locally recurrent or metastatic NPC.
