Standard Versus High-Dose Trivalent Inactivated Flu Vaccine in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients
This is a phase I safety and immunogenicity trial comparing high-dose (HD)trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) to standard dose (SD) TIV in pediatric patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
Pediatric Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: High-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine|DRUG: Standard dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
Local Reactions After Each Vaccination, Number of participants with local reactions after each vaccination, From baseline to 7 days after each vaccination|Systemic Reaction, Number of participants with systemic reactions after each vaccination, From baseline to 7 days after each vaccination
Immunogenicity: Number of Participants With a Post-titer Greater Than or Equal to a Fourfold Titer Rise, Greater than or equal to a Fourfold titer rise three strains (A/California/7/09/H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009/ H3N2, B/Brisbane/60/2008), About 6 months after last dose of vaccine.|Immunogenicity:Number of Participants With a Pre-titer ≥1:40, Pre-titer ≥1:40 for three strains (A/California/7/09/H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009/ H3N2, B/Brisbane/60/2008), About 6 months after last dose of vaccine.|Immunogenicity: Number of Participants With a Post-titer ≥1:40, Post-titer ≥1:40 for three strains (A/California/7/09/H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009/ H3N2, B/Brisbane/60/2008), About 6 months after last dose of vaccine.|Immunogenicity: The Geometric Mean Titers Pre-vaccine in Study Participants, Geometric mean titers pre-vaccine (A/California/7/09/H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009/ H3N2, B/Brisbane/60/2008), baseline|Immunogenicity: Geometric Mean Titers Post-vaccine in Study Participants, Geometric mean titers post-vaccine (A/California/7/09/H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009/ H3N2, B/Brisbane/60/2008), About 6 months after last dose of vaccine.
