Use of an Allograft Set-up (SclerFIX) as Replacement of Sclera Graft for Support of Enucleation Implant
The purpose of this open, monocenter pilot trial is to evaluate the tolerance of the SclerFIX product, an allograft of umbilical cord lining membrane, in the reinforcement of ocular implants in patients who underwent enucleation due to an eye malignant tumor resection.
Enucleated; Eye|Eye Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: SclerFIX
Number of complications and adverse events related to SclerFIX set-up as replacement of sclera graft for support of enucleation implant, Evaluation of SclerFIX tolerance by physical examination of the patient: clean scar; absence of redness, edema, ulcer, granuloma and cystic lesion; absence of signs of protrusion and inflammation, Through study completion (6 months)
Rate of integration of SclerFIX set-up in the orbital cavity with muscles attachment allowing enucleation implant mobility, Evaluation by physical examination by the surgeon of the set-up assembly and its maintenance over time with insertion of oculomotor muscles, integration of these latter, and maintenance of the movement of the implant, 7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months|Evaluation of surgical wrapping and attachment with muscles, Surgeon assessment on completeness and difficulty of oculomotor muscles insertion at the time of product implantation (Day 0), Time of investigational product surgical implantation (Day 0)
As scleral graft is forbidden in France, it cannot be used for support of enucleation implants. This study investigational product, SclerFIX, was developed to substitute scleral grafts in those cases.
