TACE-HAIC Combined With TKIs and Immunotherapy Versus TACE Alone for Hepatocellular Carcinoma With PVTT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized with vascular invasion, particularly of the portal vein, resulting in portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in 10%-40% of HCC patients at the time of HCC diagnosis. The prognosis of these patients is extremely poor.Treatment efficacy and safety using a combined therapy (TACE-HAIC combined with TKIs and PD-1 inhibitors) were compared with TACE alone in treatment of HCC patients with PVTT.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: TACE-HAIC|PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: Targeted therapy|DRUG: PD-1 inhibitors
Tumor Response, The tumor responses were evaluated by measuring the longest diameter of target lesions according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, 24 months|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was measured from the initiation of transarterial therapy to the date of death or the last follow-up., 24 months|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the initiation of transarterial therapy to the time of progression or recurrence or last follow-up., 24 months
Conversion rate, Rate of patients underwent hepatic surgery after careful evaluation when an estimated residual liver volume \>30-40% could be remained after R0 surgery by 2 experienced surgeons, 24 rates
