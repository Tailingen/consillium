An Observational Study to Evaluate Lymph Metastases and Prognoses of the Patients With Esophageal Cancer
The real-world observational study was designed to explore lymph metastases and prognoses of the Chinese patients with thoracic T1-T3 esophageal cancer

This trial is a real-world non-interventional observational study. The Chinese patients with thoracic T1-T3 esophageal cancer enrolled from Jan.1999 to Jun.2017 were included and the study data on pathologically diagnosed patient demographic/tumor biological characteristics were collected to evaluate the relevance of lymph metastases and prognoses of the subjects.
