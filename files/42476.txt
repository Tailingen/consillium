Pivotal Study of Proton Radiotherapy Treatments Using Fixed Beam Chair-Based Delivery System
This study with Chair-Based, Gantry-less Proton System (CBGS) (aka P-CURE Proton Beam Therapy System or Fixed Beam Chair-based Delivery System) is composed of 3 arms, as following:

ARM1: Patients with locally recurrent, previously irradiated thoracic cancer indicated for re- irradiation.

ARM2: Patients with recurrent Head and Neck, Brain and Spinal Cord tumors, indicated for re- irradiation.

ARM3: Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.

The primary objectives of the study for all arms are: 1. to describe the efficacy (local control after 3 month) and acute toxicity for patients treated with a fully-integrated CBGS and (2) to compare treatment plans between the fully-integrated CBGS and Photon therapy defined for each patient, based upon OAR sparing for comparable target coverage.
Thoracic Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable|Brain Cancer|Head Cancer|Neck Cancer
DEVICE: Proton Radiation
Local Control, The duration of local control will be measured from the start date of protocol radiation until the date of progressive disease. Local control will be determined based on RECIST Criteria Version 1.1., 3 months|Acute Toxicity, Incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, 3 months|Treatment Plan Comparison between Chair Based Proton System and Photon therapy, Analysis and comparison of dose volume histograms (DVHs) and isodoses for each modality, 3 months
Progression Free Survival, The time from study registration until the first occurrence of local, regional, or distant progression, or death from any cause, or until last follow-up, 2 years|Overall Survival, The time from study registration until death or last follow-up, 2 years|Long-term Toxicity, Incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, 2 Years|Quality of Life, Lung Cancer Patients: FACT-Lung and EQ-5D Head and Neck Patients: EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 Pancreas Patients: Quality of Life assessment using Patient Reported Outcomes, 2 years
