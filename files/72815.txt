Pre-operative Tumor Treating Fields in Patients With Resectable Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to study the clinical and biologic effects of Tumor Treatment Fields (TTFields) in patients undergoing resection of stage I-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). TTField is a non-invasive treatment that uses low-intensity electrical fields to treat cancer. Resection is the medical term for surgically removing part or all of a tissue, structure, or organ.
NSCLC|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: NovoTTF-200T System
Effect of TTF (Tumor-Treating Fields) on Fanconi anemia-related genes., Determine the effect of TTFields on expression of Fanconi anemia pathway-associated genes in NSCLC., approximately 14-28 days
Safety of administering TTFields, Assess the safety of administering TTFields prior to standard of care lung cancer resection.

Analyses will be performed for all subjects having initiated TTFields therapy. The study will use the CTCAE version 5.0 for reporting of adverse events., approximately 14-28 days
To study the clinical and biologic effects of Tumor Treatment Fields (TTFields) in patients undergoing resection of stage I-IIIA NSCLC.

Participants in this study will have a blood sample collected as well as vital signs along with a tumor tissue sample and tumor scan. Once it has been determined the participant can enroll into this study, he/she will come to the clinic for 5 scheduled visits over a period of 2 months .
