Prospective Evaluation of Radiotherapy Using Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Treatment
The purpose of PERMIT is to collect information on the treatment of radiotherapy patients using a new radiotherapy machine that includes magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging (MR linac) to guide treatment. The aim is to use this information to support the introduction of MR Linac into clinical practice.

PERMIT will collect details on patients treated on the MR linac plus details on their side effects and other outcomes. This information plus technical and imaging information will be combined with information from other centres using this machine. By doing so this will help us learn how best to use the MR Linac in the future and design new radiotherapy protocols
Cancer
DEVICE: MR Linac
Technical feasibility of undertaking MRL based radiotherapy at multiple clinical sites: The percentage of treatment fractions delivered successfully on the MR linac, The percentage of treatment fractions delivered successfully on the MR linac, if more than 20 % of patients (depending on treatment site) need to be treated on alternative machine or treatment protocol changed will lead to the MRL protocol at that site to be judged not feasible., 2 years
