Liquid Biopsy in Advanced Oligometastatic NSCLC Receiving Surgery
A prospective, observational study that assesses the clinical feasibility of ctDNA-based liquid biopsy in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC receiving surgery.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Oligometastatic Disease
GENETIC: ctDNA testing and whole exome sequencing
Association between perioperative ctDNA-MRD characteristics and rogression-free survival, To explore the potential association among perioperative ctDNA-MRD characteristics and rogression-free survival within 2 years., 2-year PFS|Construction of a survival-prediction model, The survival-prediction model based on clinicopathological and genomic characteristics., Through study completion, up to 5 years
Association among ctDNA status before surgery, systemic treatment times, and survival, To explore the potential association among plasma ctDNA status surgery, systemic treatment time duration, PFS and OS., Through study completion, up to 5 years|Genomic characteristics and clonal evolution after systemic treatment, Using whole-exome sequencing to identify genomic characteristics and clonal evolution after systemic treatment, Through study completion, up to 5 years|Potential drug-resistance mechanism identified by plasma ctDNA, Using plasma ctDNA-MRD to identify the potential drug-resistance mechanism., Through study completion, up to 5 years|Assess whether ctDNA-MRD is associated with radiological and pathological response after systematic therapy before surgery, Association among perioperative ctDNA-MRD characteristics, imaging response, and pathological response., 60 patients underwent surgery|Heterogeneity in Genomic and transcriptome between primary and metastatic tumors, Using whole-exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing to identify genomic and transcriptome heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumors., 60 patients underwent surgery
60 eligible patients will be enrolled. Dynamic blood samples before and after surgery and tissue samples will be obtained for exploratory analysis.
