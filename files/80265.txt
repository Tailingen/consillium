Comparison of Drug Eluting Stent and Covered Metal Stent in Malignant Biliary Obstruction (MIRA III)
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of Niti-S Mira-Cover III Biliary Stent with Comvi Biliary Covered Stent for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction.

Cumulative stent patency during 6months after stent placement, Stent patency is defined as absence of stent obstruction and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or ERCP., 6 month
Stent migration, Stent migration is defined as an obvious dislodgement from the intended and original implant position and confirmed by radiography, CT, or ERCP., 6 month|Secondary stent insertion due to recurrent biliary obstruction, 6 month|Mean survival, 6 month|Adverse events, 6 month
In patients with malignant biliary obstruction, endoscopic placement of biliary stents offers similar technical success rates. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP)-guided stent placement has become the preferred approach to palliate malignant biliary obstruction. The major mechanisms of self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) occlusion are tumor ingrowth, tumor overgrowth, and epithelial hyperplasia. These mechanisms provide the rationale for developing a drug-eluting stent in order to improve stent patency. Limited data exist regarding outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents in malignant biliary obstruction. This study is to prospectively compare the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel-eluting covered metal stent and covered metal stent for the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction.
