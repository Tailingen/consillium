Radiation Therapy in Combination With Durvalumab for People With Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if combining durvalumab with standard stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an effective treatment for people with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The researchers will also look at the safety of the combination treatment and any side effects it causes.
