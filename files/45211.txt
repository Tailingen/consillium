A Study of Penpulimab Combination Therapy in Patients With Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody Penpulimab (AK105) combined with chemotherapy ± anlotinib hydrochloride in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AK105|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Anlotinib hydrochloride
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1., up to 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1., up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death from any cause., up to 2 years|Observed concentrations of AK105, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK105 include serum concentrations of AK105 at different timepoints after AK105 administration., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105.|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK105 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable antidrug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105.
