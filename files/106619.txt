Corellation of Mutations, TILs and Age in Breast Cancer
Age may pertain to different tumor genotype characteristics which may interfere with treatment efficacy and prognosis. The investigators investigated the distribution and prognostic effect of mutations (mut) and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) in young and elderly early breast cancer patients (pts).
