Web-based Mindfulness Meditation in Reducing Distress in Participants With Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer and Their Caregivers
This trial studies how well web-based mindfulness meditation works in reducing distress in both participants with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, and their caregivers. Web-based mindfulness meditation, which uses audio exercises and interactive webinars taught by trained meditation instructors, may help participants with GI cancer and their caregivers reduce distress and improve their quality of life.
