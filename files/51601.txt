Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ODM-204 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this first-in-man study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ODM-204 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: ODM-204|DRUG: Prednisone
Safety and tolerability assessed by incidence of adverse events, Until disease progression, an expected average of 6 months|Safety and tolerability assessed by vitals signs and 12-lead ECG, Until disease progression, an expected average of 6 months|Safety and tolerability assessed by laboratory assessments, Until disease progression, an expected average of 6 months
Pharmacokinetic profile assessed by plasma peak concentration (Cmax), 0 - week 12|Pharmacokinetic profile assessed by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 0 - week 12|Pharmacokinetic profile assessed by time to reach peak concentration (tmax), 0 - week 12|Preliminary antitumour activity assessed by prostate specific antigen (PSA) response, Until disease progression, an expected average of 6 months|Preliminary antitumour activity assessed by response in soft and bone tissues, Until disease progression, an expected average of 6 months|Pharmacodynamic profile assessed by hormone and circulating tumour cell measurements, 0 - week 12
The safety profile of ODM-204 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-204 to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM-204 will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels.
