Phase 1 Study of Intratumoral Administration of VAX014 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of VAX014 for intratumoral injections (VAX014) in patients with advanced solid tumors. VAX014 is a targeted oncolytic agent designed to kill tumor cells following intratumoral injection into advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: VAX014
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VAX014, The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after 28 days of treatment have occurred, with the next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing a DLT, up to 28 days|Incidence of Treatment-Emergency Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Toxicities will be assessed in each subject by tracking the occurrence of graded Adverse Events (AEs). AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, Through study completion, an average of 20 weeks|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of intratumoral VAX014, The RP2D will be determined following the determination of the MTD and with agreement by the Safety Review Committee, up to 5 weeks
Characterize systemic exposure by evaluating pharmacokinetics of intratumoral VAX014 [systemic PK], Whole blood will be collected for determination of VAX014 levels. PK data may demonstrate limited exposure or lack of detectable VAX014 in blood., up to 1 week|Anti-Drug Antibodies (Immunogenicity)[systemic ADA], The presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in serum will be assessed by assay., Up to 20 weeks|Overall Response Rate, Response rate will be evaluated for tumor lesions that will be assessed through CT MRI., Up to 20 weeks
Tumor Tissue (immune environment), Tumor biopsies will be assessed for necrosis and immune changes within the tumor., up to 8 weeks|Anti-Tumor T Cells, Changes in the number of Anti-Tumor T cells before and after treatment., Up to 20 weeks|Cytokine levels, Changes in the cytokine levels before and after treatment., Up to 20 weeks|Type 1 IFN response, Changes in type 1 IFN response before and after treatment., Up to 20 weeks|STING expression, Predictive value of STING as a biomarker, Baseline|RIG-I expression, Predictive value of RIG-I as a biomarker, Baseline
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of VAX014 using a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) followed by a dose expansion at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). The DLT assessment period will be the initial 21-days of injections. Subjects will receive weekly injections for the initial 8 weeks. Up to six dose levels will be evaluated (i.e., \[starting dose\], \[starting dose\] x 3, \[starting dose\] x 10, \[starting dose\] x 30, \[starting dose\] x 100, \[starting dose\] x 300).

Subjects may continue on treatment following discussion between the Principal Investigator and Sponsor/Medical Monitor.

The Expansion Phase will consist of up to 20 subjects. Subjects will receive intratumoral injections at the RP2D declared at the end of the Dose Escalation Phase of the study. The SRC will define the RP2D for use in the Expansion Phase of the study and may redefine the RP2D during the Expansion Phase based on accumulating safety data.
