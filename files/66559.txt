Dose Escalation/Dose Expansion Study of PRGN-3007 UltraCAR-T Cells in Patients With Advanced Hematologic and Solid Tumor Malignancies
The purpose of the study is to find out if an investigational drug called PRGN-3007 UltraCAR-T cells (PRGN-3007 T cells) can help people with ROR1-positive hematologic chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and solid tumor triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) malignancies.
