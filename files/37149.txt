Role of Early Versus Late Switch to Lapatinib-Capecitabine
The study will be conducted as a multicenter prospective observational cohort study, trying to cover almost all Brazilian States, in a population of ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients, whose disease has progressed after trastuzumab-containing regimen, comparing outcomes in two groups: Group 1: patients receiving Lapatinib-capecitabine immediately after 1st Trastuzumab progression (second line treatment), and Group 2: patients receiving Lapatinib-capecitabine after 2 or more lines of treatment after 1st trastuzumab progression (third line or greater).

Overall response rate (ORR) determined by treating physician, Percentage of patients showing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) to the given treatment, One year|One year overall survival (OS), Time from the start of lapatinib-capecitabine treatment until death due to any cause (measured at the end of follow-up), One year|Serious adverse events (SAEs), Describe lapatinib-related spontaneous reported serious adverse events, One year|Clinical Global Impression (CGI), CGI assessment by the treating physician in the last visit (visit 4 or discontinuation visit), One year
All cases of ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer, receiving approved standard treatment with lapatinib-capecitabine, after trastuzumab-containing regimen progression in community setting can participate in this observational study, for a period of 12 months of observation since the start of the lapatinib-capecitabine treatment.
