A Study To Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, And Pharmacodynamics Of Satralizumab In Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of satralizumab compared with placebo in participants with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: Satralizumab|OTHER: Placebo
DB Period: Mean Change From Baseline in Total Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) Score in the AChR+ Population, The MG-ADL scale was used to assess the degree of gMG symptoms (six items: diplopia, ptosis, difficulties with chewing, swallowing, talking, and respiratory problems) and functional limitations in carrying out activities of daily living (two items: ability to brush teeth or comb hair and impairment in the ability to arise from a chair) that are present and clinically relevant in gMG participants. Each of the eight items was ranked on a 0-3 scale, with 3 representing the most severe symptoms or impaired performance and 0 representing no symptoms or impaired performance. The total MG-ADL score was calculated as the sum of each item score, with a maximum score ranging from 0 (least severe symptoms/impairment) to 24 (most severe symptoms/impairment). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity., At Week 24

Participants were considered to be ADA-negative if they were ADA-negative or had missing data at baseline and all post-baseline samples were negative, or if they were ADA positive at baseline but did not have any post-baseline samples with a titer that is at least 4-fold (0.60 titer unit) greater than the titer of the baseline sample., Baseline to Week 24|Serum Concentrations of Satralizumab, Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24
