TGF-Î² And PDL-1 Inhibition in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Combined With Chemoradiation TheRapY
The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of treatment with bintrafusp alfa combined with definitive chemoradiation (carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

Biomarker, To perform exploratory biomarker analyses for treatment response, 54 months
Non-randomized feasibility study with paclitaxel, carboplatin, bintrafusp alfa, and radiation. Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC = 2 will be given intravenously (i.v.) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Bintrafusp alfa will be given i.v. every three weeks on day 1, 22, and 43 at a dose of 2400 mg. External beam radiotherapy will be delivered to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, 5 fractions per week, starting the first day of the first cycle of chemotherapy.
