Safety and Efficacy Study of Intracystic TARA-002 for the Treatment of Lymphatic Malformations in Participants 6 Months to Less Than 18 Years of Age
This is a Phase 2a/b single arm open label study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of intracystic injection of TARA-002 in participants 6 months to less than 18 years of age for the treatment of macrocystic and mixed cystic lymphatic malformations. The Phase 2a safety lead-in, age de-escalation study is designed to establish the safety of TARA-002 in older participants 6 years to less than 18 years before proceeding to younger participants 2 years to less than 6 years, then 6 months to less than 2 years. The Phase 2b is an expansion study in which enrollment of participants will be initiated after safety has been established in each cohort during the Phase 2a safety lead-in study. Each participant will receive up to 4 injections of TARA-002 spaced approximately 6 weeks apart.
Lymphatic Malformation
BIOLOGICAL: TARA-002
Proportion of participants with clinical success after one treatment cycle of TARA-002, 8 weeks after the last injection
Safety: Percentage of participants with solicited local site and systemic reactions, 14 days (2 weeks) after each injection|Safety: Percentage of participants with unsolicited adverse events (AEs), Through study completion (approximately 32 weeks after last injection)|Safety: Percentage of participants with SAEs, AEs of special interest, AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study intervention, AEs leading to withdrawal from study, AEs with an outcome of death, and MAAEs, Through study completion (approximately 32 weeks after last injection)|Durable Response: Proportion of participants with clinical success after one treatment cycle of TARA-002 assessed at 8 weeks after the last injection and maintained clinical success at 32 weeks after the last injection, 32 weeks after the last injection|Clinical Success by LM Type: Proportion of participants with macrocystic LM or mixed cystic LM with clinical success after one treatment cycle of TARA-002, 8 weeks after the last injection|Investigator Assessment: Proportion of participants who demonstrate clinical improvement, as assessed by the Investigator, after one treatment cycle of TARA-002 compared to baseline, 8 weeks after last injection and 32 weeks after last injection|Quality of Life: Change in Quality-of-Life assessment based on Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain after one treatment cycle of TARA-002, 8 weeks after last injection and 32 weeks after last injection
