A Study to Learn About Lorlatinib in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Which Has Spread Out.
The purpose of this study is to learn about lorlatinib for the possible treatment of lung cancer which could not be controlled.

This study is seeking participants who:

* have lung cancer that could not be controlled.
* have a type of gene called a ROS proto-oncogene 1. A gene is a part of your DNA that has instructions for making things your body needs to work.
* have received at least 1 treatment before.

All participants in this study had received lorlatinib. Lorlatinib is a tablet that is taken by mouth at home. They continued to take lorlatinib until their cancer was no longer responding. The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicine. This will help to see if the study medicine is safe and effective.
