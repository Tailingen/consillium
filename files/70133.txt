Evaluation of Neratinib for Treatment and Prevention of Subsequent CNS Event(s) in Patients With Brain Metastasis of Advanced HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, non-randomised, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of neratinib in combination with SOC systemic therapy on CNS metastasis both as for secondary prevention (cohort 1), primary treatment (cohort 2) and for the treatment of LM disease (cohort 3) in subjects with HER2 positive metastatic BC.

Subjects with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer will be eligible for the trial and will be enrolled in one of the following cohorts:

Cohort 1: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy and pre-treated with local approaches at least for the previous CNS event and currently progressive but locally treated CNS metastasis. Local therapy includes: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or/and WBRT or/and surgery.

The study will measure the effect of the drug combination on the time to next CNS event(s).

Cohort 2: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy or progressing less than 12 months after end of adjuvant therapy with a first diagnosis of brain metastases.

The study will measure the objective CNS response in each subject.

Cohort 3: Eligible subjects include HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer subjects treated with at least one line of systemic anti HER2 therapy with confirmed LM defined as the presence of malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or combination of typical symptoms and MRI.

The study will measure the effect of the drug combination on the time to CNS progression including LM progression.

As per investigator's choice, eligible subjects in all cohort will receive neratinib in combination with capecitabine or with T-DM1 or with paclitaxel or with vinorelbine as per investigator's choice. Trastuzumab can be added as per investigator's choice to those regimens except for T-DM1.

At screening and during the study treatment period (every 9 weeks), brain MRI for cohort 1 and cohort 2 or contrast-enhanced neuraxis brain and spine MRI for cohort 3 and tumour assessment by thoracic and abdomino-pelvic CT scan for all cohorts should be performed. For cohort 3 only, CSF cytological assessment should also be performed.

Additionally, at screening and at each cycle during the study treatment period, subjects must fill quality of life questionnaires: EORTC core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and brain module (QLQ-BN20).
Breast Cancer|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Neratinib
For cohort1: Efficacy of neratinib in combination with systemic treatment at investigator's choice in preventing the next CNS event in HER2 breast cancer with known and treated brain metastasis, The efficacy will be assessed by calculating the ratio of the time to the subsequent CNS event (T2) according to RANO-BM criteria to the time between the current CNS event and previous CNS event (T1) both treated locally (T2/T1).

The subsequent CNS event is defined as progression of known and treated brain lesions as well as the development of new brain lesions as assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the RANO-BM criteria.

The time to a subsequent CNS event is defined as the time from treatment start of a CNS event to the occurrence of the following one for both T1 and T2, From date of enrolment until the date of subsequent documented CNS event, assessed up to 6 months|For cohort 2: Efficacy of neratinib in combination with systemic treatment at investigator's choice on previously untreated brain metastasis from HER2 metastatic breast cancer, The efficacy will be assessed by calculating the proportion of subjects with an objective CNS response, according to RANO-BM criteria in the absence of progressive extra-CNS disease (according to RECIST 1.1)., From date of enrolment until the date of first documented CNS event, assessed up to 6 months|For cohort 3: Efficacy of neratinib in combination with systemic treatment at investigator's choice on LM disease from HER2 metastatic breast cancer, The efficacy will be assessed by measuring CNS progression-free survival defined as the time between treatment start and date of first leptomeningeal progression (defined according to clinical-neurological or imaging criteria) in the absence of progressive extra-CNS disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or date of death (death from any cause) whatever occurs first., From date of enrolment until the date of first documented leptomeningeal progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
