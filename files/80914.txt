TTX-030 Single Agent and in Combination With Immunotherapy or Chemotherapy for Patients With Advanced Cancers
This is a phase 1/1b study of TTX-030, an antibody that inhibits CD39 enzymatic activity, leading to accumulation of pro-inflammatory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduction of immunosuppressive adenosine, which may change the tumor microenvironment and promote anti-tumor immune response.

This trial will study the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of TTX-030 as a single agent and in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and standard chemotherapies.
