Efficacy and Safety of Apatinib for Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
There is no standard treatment strategy for recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients now, especially after the second-line treatment. Most of the patients have the bad ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score and prognosis. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery are usually unacceptable for them. Previous data showed that apatinib treatment significantly improved OS(overall survival) and PFS(progression-free survival) with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy. The study will observe the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A phase II, prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial.
