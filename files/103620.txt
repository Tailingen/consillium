UV Dosimetry Feedback in NMSC Patients
This study aims to characterize UV exposures among NMSC patients (those with a history of skin cancer) and to pilot an innovative behavioral intervention to decrease modifiable UV exposures. It will use UV dosimeters to objectively measure UV exposure and provide time and activity specific UV data on an individual level. These data will be used to develop a targeted and personalized behavioral feedback plan with counseling aimed at effective sun exposure behavior change
Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: UV Counseling
Identify Discrepancies of Self-Reported Sun Exposure and Actual Sun Exposure, Measured using individual dosimeters and comparing it to what participants state they believe their level of sun exposure is, Start of study to end of study, up to 3 months|Identify Discrepancies of Self-Reported Sun Exposure and Actual Sun Exposure, Compare specific sun exposure behaviors responsible for the level of exposure versus what could be done to lessen it, Start of study to end of study, up to 3 months
Behavioral Intervention and immediate follow-up, Participants will receive a personalized feedback plan and the success of the plan will be measured through individual dosimetry. We will track real time change in sun exposure based on repeat UV dosimetry., Start of study to end of study, up to 3 months|Long Term Follow Up - longitudinal change in sun exposure based on dosimetry, Track the longitudinal change in sun exposure comparing baseline UV dosimetry measurements to 3 month follow up dosimetry measurements to determine if the changes observed in outcome 3 are maintained., Start of study to end of study, up to 3 months
The study will focus on helping to prevent NMSC and its associated morbidity through learning when patients are unintentionally exposed to extreme UV radiation. It will then help to create manageable and realistic behavioral interventions to reduce exposure, while also educating patients of the dangers of abundant sun exposure.
