A Comparative Study Between ABP 501 and Humira® in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of multiple switches between Humira® and ABP 501 (new high concentration formulation) compared with continued use of Humira® in participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This multi-center study is composed of two periods: A lead-in period of treatment with Humira® followed by a randomized two parallel arm period.
Plaque Psoriasis
DRUG: Adalimumab|DRUG: ABP 501
Area Under the Curve From Time 0 Over the Dosing Interval (AUCtau) of ABP 501 (Switching Group) and Adalimumab (Continued-use Group), Participants analyzed according to actual treatment received., Week 28 pre-dose and 1hour, 1 day, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 11 days, and 14 days post Week 28 dose|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of ABP 501 (Switching Group) and Adalimumab (Continued-use Group), Participants analyzed according to treatment received., Week 28 pre-dose, 1h post Week 28 dose, 1 day post Week 28 dose, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 11 days, and 14 days post Week 28 dose
Time to Reach Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) of ABP 501 (Switching Group) and Adalimumab (Continued-use Group), Time to reach maximum serum concentration., Week 28 pre-dose, 1h post Week 28 dose, 1 day post Week 28 dose, 3 days, 4 days, 7 days, 11 days, and 14 days post Week 28 dose|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of ABP 501 (Switching Group) and Adalimumab (Continued-use Group), Pre-dose at Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 28|PASI Percent Improvement From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 30, The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.

Percent improvement from baseline was calculated as (value at baseline - value at post-baseline visit) × 100 / (value at baseline)., Baseline (Day 1) and Week 30|Number of Participants Achieving PASI 75 Response at Week 30, A PASI 75 response is a 75% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis., Baseline (Day 1) and Week 30|Number of Participants Achieving PASI 90 Response at Week 30, A PASI 90 response is a 90% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis., Baseline (Day 1) and Week 30|Number of Participants Achieving PASI 100 Response at Week 30, A PASI 100 response is a 100% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis., Baseline (Day 1) and Week 30|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), TEAEs are any event that occurred after the participant received study treatment. Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests that occurred after study treatment administration were recorded as TEAEs.

A serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant after first dose irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment(s) that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another medically important serious event., Baseline up to Week 32|Number of Participants Experiencing Events of Interest (EOI), An EOI is defined as a noteworthy event for a particular product or class of products that a sponsor may wish to monitor carefully. It could be serious or non-serious and could include events that might be potential precursors or prodromes for more serious medical conditions in susceptible individuals., Baseline up to Week 32|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) Expression Post Randomization, Anti-drug antibody samples were drawn prior to investigational product administration at dosing visits., Week 16, Week 20, Week 28, Week 30, and Week 32
