The Study of Quadruple Therapy Intranasal Insulin, Zinc, Gabapentin, Ice Cube Stimulation for Post COVID-19 Smell and Taste Dysfunctions
post covid-19 smell and taste dysfunction are common globally and affect the quality of life and also have phycological impact and anxiety, also affect on economy as the patients not able to do cooking or buy prepared foods and not eaten, also not able to enter the cooking room and prepare foods for themselves, also the risk of loss of smell the fire accidents because anosmia, many forms of smell dysfunction like anosmia ,hyposmia, and dysosmia ,Phantosmia , parosmia may occurred, the same taste disorders may has many forms like Dysgeusia, phantom taste perception, hypogeusia with dysgeusia. until now no definite treatments for post covid-19 smell and taste disorders , this study is novel study as quadruple therapy Intranasal Insulin, Zinc, Gabapentin, Ice Cube Stimulation may suspect having promising results

DRUG: Insulin aspart
evaluation of disturbances of smell and taste (Sniffin 'Sticks" test), The change in smell is based on the comparison of the results of the olfactory assessment after / before treatment obtained from a single method out of the three carried out:

Sniffin 'Stick Test Results: Threshold Test Score and Actual Identification Test Score.

TI score: sum of the individual scores of the threshold and identification measures (TI score varying from 0 to 32). It is used to classify patients in terms of normosmia, hyposmia and functional anosmia based on normative values of "Sniffin 'Sticks" (according to the age and sex of each subject) with the threshold at the tenth percentile of the database provided in the study published by Hummel and Kobal.

Self-assessment by patients using a digital scale of smell, from 0 (no smell) to 10 (normal smell), 4 month|evaluation of taste disorders, A device is used to present a pseudo-randomised series of taste solutions to the participant for identification, in order to establish taste thresholds.Change in taste threshold measures (sweet, salt, bitter, sour) between baseline and and post treatment is initiated is assessed with the assistance of a taste test device., 4 month|questionnaire for taste self assessment ( Dynachron-olfaction questionnaire), Self-assessment using the Dynachron-olfaction questionnaire:each question is used to assess the patient's feelings about his discomfort in the nose using a scale from 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (unbearable, 4 month
any clinical manifestations or adverse effects, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0", 4 month

The application of intranasal insulin in healthy humans has been linked to improve memory function and increased olfactory thresholds also enhance the olfactory performance and regenerate the olfactory epithelium which the corner stone mechanism at affection of smell and taste disorders. zinc orally has many functions and improve taste and influence the activity of carbonic anhydrase in saliva which is important in breaking down foods in our mouth . the application of small ice cube in the mouth for one minute may improve seat taste and lower temperature by 5 degrees. gabapentin working by altering or blocking abnormal electrical discharges arising from the peripheral damaged smell or taste organ
