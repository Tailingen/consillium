A Study Evaluating Chemotherapy With Fractionated Cisplatin/Gemcitabine Versus Carboplatin/Gemcitabine in the Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer With Impaired Renal Function.
This is a phase II/III, multicenter, randomized study which includes 420 patients on six years + 3 years follow up. 92 patients will be included during the phase II ; additional 328 patients will be included.

Patients with an advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with impaired renal function will be randomized in one of the two following chemotherapy arm:

* Fractionated Cisplatin + Gemcitabine.
* Carboplatin + Gemcitabine.

The main objective of the part II study will be to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a chemotherapy with a doublet platinum salt compound/Gemcitabine with fractionated Cisplatin or Carboplatin in this population.

The main objective of the part III study will be to compare the efficacy in terms of overall survival of a chemotherapy with a doublet platinum salt/Gemcitabine with fractionated Cisplatin or Carboplatin in this population.
Advanced Urothelial Cancer|Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Fractionated Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Phase II: Efficacy - Rate of non progression at the end of treatment (C6D21)., Progression is defined according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria V1.1., 5 years.|Phase III: Overall survival (in months)., Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death or last follow up news (censured data)., 9 years.|Phase II: Tolerance - Percentage of patients for whom at least one of the 3 defined tolerance criteria (see description) is observed., Defined tolerance criteria :

* Postponement of chemotherapy \> or = 2 weeks.
* Alteration of renal function.
* Need to decrease twice Gemcitabine dose on day 1 for : NCI CTC (National Cancer Institut Common Toxicity Criteria) grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity, hematologic toxicity., 5 years.
Phase II and III: Objective response., Objective response (ie complete or partial response) will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Tolerance according to NCI toxicity scale (version 4.0)., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Geriatric evaluation using questionnaires., The geriatric assessment will be evaluate using the following questionnaires: G8 (oncodage) , ADL (activity of daily living), CIRSG (cumulating illness rating scale geriatric) , MMS (mini-mental score), IADL (instrumental activities of daily living), GDS (geriatric depression scale), MNA (mini-nutritional assessment)., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Quality of life using the EORTC QLQ - C30 questionnaire (European Organization for research and treatment of Cancer - Quality of life questionnaire)., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Pharmacokinetics - Platin concentrations, At cycles 1 and 2 day 1 - 5 mn before the end of infusion, one hour after the end of infusion, 3 hours (arm A) or 4 hours (arm B) after the end of infusion.|Phase II and III: Pharmacogenetics, exploration of cytidine deaminase activity and study of its genetic polymorphisms., Prior to the initial dose on cycle 1 day 1.|Phase II and III: Progression free survival., Progression free survival will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., Phase II: 5 years ; phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Overall survival., Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from all causes combined., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.|Phase II and III: Time to treatment failure., Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation, whatever its cause., Phase II: 5 years ; Phase III: 9 years.
