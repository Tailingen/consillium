The PROGRAM-study: Awake Mapping Versus Asleep Mapping Versus No Mapping for Glioblastoma Resections
The study is designed as an international, multicenter prospective cohort study. Patients with presumed glioblastoma (GBM) in- or near eloquent areas on diagnostic MRI will be selected by neurosurgeons. Patients will be treated following one of three study arms: 1) a craniotomy where the resection boundaries for motor or language functions will be identified by the "awake" mapping technique (awake craniotomy, AC); 2) a craniotomy where the resection boundaries for motor functions will be identified by "asleep" mapping techniques (MEPs, SSEPs, continuous dynamic mapping); 3) a craniotomy where the resection boundaries will not be identified by any mapping technique ("no mapping group"). All patients will receive follow-up according to standard practice.
Glioblastoma
PROCEDURE: Awake mapping under local anesthesia|PROCEDURE: Asleep mapping under general anesthesia|PROCEDURE: Resection under general anesthesia without mapping
Neurological morbidity, NIHSS deterioration of 1 point or more as compared to baseline value., Between baseline and 6 weeks/3 months/6 months postoperatively|Extent of resection, Resection percentage as assessed by an independent neuroradiologist on MRI contrast images with volumetric analysis, Assessed within 72 hours on postoperative MRI scan
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time from diagnosis to disease progression (occurrence of a new tumour lesion with a volume greater than 0.175 cmÂ³, or an increase in residual tumour volume of more than 25%) or death, whichever comes first., Between surgery and 12 months postoperatively|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) defined as time from diagnosis to death from any cause., Between surgery and 12 months postoperatively|Onco-functional outcome, 2D coordinate based on extent of resection (or residual tumor volume) on the x-axis and NIHSS score on the y-axis, Between baseline and 6 weeks/3 months/6 months postoperatively|Frequency and severity of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Infections, intracerebral bleeding, epilepsy, aphasia, paresis/paralysis in arms or/and legs (this is not an exhaustive list)., Between surgery and 6 weeks postoperatively|Residual tumor volume, Postoperative tumor volume in mm3 as assessed by an independent neuroradiologist on MRI contrast images with volumetric analysis, Assessed within 72 hours on postoperative MRI scan|MRC deterioration (for motor gliomas), MRC deterioration of 1 point or more as compared to baseline value., Between baseline and 6 weeks/3 months/6 months postoperatively
