Study, Evaluating Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Immunogenicity and Safety Profiles of Rituximab Compared to MabThera® in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis
A randomised, double blind, parallel group, multicentre study to compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety of Rituximab (Mabscale LLC, Russia) versus MabThera® in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

RIT-1/01092021 is a double-blind randomized, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial comparing pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety of Rituximab (Mabscale LLC, Russia) and MabThera® in adult patients with moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis with insufficient response to treatment tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) inhibitors receiving background treatment with methotrexate. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety of Rituximab (Mabscale LLC, Russia) and MabThera®. The study will take place across approximately 30 study sites in Russia in order to randomize 208 patients. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody currently being developed by Mabscale LLC, as a proposed biosimilar to MabThera®, which is approved as treatment in case of insufficient response or toxicity to treatment tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) inhibitors receiving background treatment with methotrexate. This randomized equivalence study is designed to meet the regulatory requirement for approval of a biosimilar product.
