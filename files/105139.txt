Clinical Study of the Efficacy and Safety of BCD-178 and Perjeta® as Neoadjuvant Therapy of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of BCD-178 and Perjeta as neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Subjects with histologically confirmed diagnosis of HER2-positive invasive breast cancer (stage II-III, tumor size \> 2 cm), with no estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (BCD-178 group or Perjeta group) in a 1:1 ratio.
