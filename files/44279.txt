A Pilot Study to Assess the Clinical Utility of 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin) PET-CT for Detecting True-versus Pseudo-Progression of Brain Metastases on Immunotherapy
To learn if 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin) PET-CT scans can be used to better detect brain metastatic lesions in patients who are receiving immunotherapy.
Brain Metastases
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Pet Scan
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

* To assess the diagnosis accuracy of 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin) PET-CT in detecting true- versus pseudo-progression of brain metastatic lesions in patients on immunotherapy.

Accuracy is defined as the number of concordant cases between Axumin PET-CT and the gold standard truth divided by the total sample size.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess diagnosis accuracy of Axumin PET-CT in detecting true- versus pseudo-progression of brain metastatic lesions in patients on immunotherapy by additional accuracy measures including sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value.
* To evaluate the added clinical usefulness of Axumin PET-CT for imaging patients with metastatic brain lesion(s).
