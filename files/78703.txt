Use Lay Language. HA Score to Identify Myeloma Patients Who Could Benefit From HDACi Treatment
Panobinostat is a potent oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that alters gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms and inhibits protein degradation. It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have received ≥ 2 prior regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug.

A GEP-based histone acetylation score allowing identification of MM patients with a poor prognosis and who could benefit from HDACi treatment was recently reported(Moreaux et al. BJC. 2013).

Our hypothesis is that the histone acetylation score could be promising to identify MM patients who could benefit from treatment with HDACi and the development of personalized treatment.
