Endoscopic Resection for Small Rectal Neuroendocrine Tumors
According to clinical practice and relevant retrospective research data, both modified cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (mEMR-C) and endoscopic mucosal resection with a ligation device(ESMR-L) were reported to be effective for the treatment of small rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) . However, there is a lack of multicenter prospective studies to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of mEMR-C and mEMR-L. mEMR-C is the modified ESMR-L without submucosal injection.

histological complete resection, complete single-piece (en bloc) resection of the targeted lesion with horizontal and vertical free margins., within 14 days after procedure
success rate of operation, the proportion of patients whose tumors were successfully resected in each group, intraoperative|en bloc resection, complete single resection of the targeted lesion, irrespective of whether the basal and lateral tumor margins were infiltrated or undetermined, intraoperative|operation time, the time required to complete the procedure, was taken from the installation of the snare in the mEMR-C or the first submucosal injection in ESD to the end of complete resection of the targeted area or a failure or complication of the procedure which required discontinuation, intraoperative|complications, perforation or hemorrhage during or after operation, within 14 days after procedure|length of stay, calculated from the day of admission to day of discharge, within 14 days after procedure|hospitalization cost, represent the hospital's costs of being hospitalized, within 14 days after procedure|operation cost, the cost of mEMR-C or mEMR-L procedures, except the cost of other endoscopic procedures, within 14 days after procedure|histopathologic grade, NET grade 1, NET grade 2, NET grade 3, and NEC, within 14 days after procedure
We aimed to conduct a muticenter randomized controlled trial to compare mEMR-C with mEMR-L for the treatment of small rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in ten tertiary hospitals in China.
