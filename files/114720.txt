A Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Activity Study of NUC-7738 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours and Lymphoma
This is a Phase I/II, dose-escalation and expansion study of NUC-7738 administered by intravenous infusion as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

In Phase I, NUC-7738 monotherapy is evaluated across two administration schedules (weekly or fortnightly) in a dose-escalation design in patients with advanced solid tumours. The main objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of NUC-7738, in addition to establishing the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and dose administration schedule of NUC-7738 for further exploration in the Phase II part of the study.

In Phase II, the selected dose and designated dosing schedule will be further evaluated in dose-confirmation expansion cohorts enrolling a total of approximately 40 additional patients with advanced solid tumours. Based on emerging data, approximately 6 patients with cutaneous melanoma will be enrolled to these expansion cohorts and will receive NUC-7738 monotherapy. A further cohort will assess NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab in approximately 6-12 patients with cutaneous melanoma. Based on efficacy signals observed in the initial melanoma combination cohort, a further expansion cohort will be initiated to expand to a total of 40 patients to allow a powered analysis. In addition, 12 patients with lymphoma (with potential expansion to a total of 25 patients) may be enrolled to receive NUC-7738 monotherapy.

This is a Phase I/II, dose-escalation and expansion study of NUC-7738 administered by intravenous infusion as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

In Phase I, NUC-7738 monotherapy is evaluated across two administration schedules (weekly or fortnightly) in a dose-escalation design in patients with advanced solid tumours. The main objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of NUC-7738, in addition to establishing the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and dose administration schedule of NUC-7738 for further exploration in the Phase II part of the study.

In Phase II, the selected dose and designated dosing schedule will be further evaluated in dose-confirmation expansion cohorts enrolling a total of approximately 40 additional patients with advanced solid tumours. Based on emerging data, approximately 6 patients with cutaneous melanoma will be enrolled to these expansion cohorts and will receive NUC-7738 monotherapy. A further cohort will assess NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab in approximately 6-12 patients with cutaneous melanoma. Based on efficacy signals observed in the initial melanoma combination cohort, a further expansion cohort will be initiated to expand to a total of 40 patients to allow a powered analysis. In addition, 12 patients with lymphoma (with potential expansion to a total of 25 patients) may be enrolled to receive NUC-7738 monotherapy.
