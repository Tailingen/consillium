Liposomal Irinotecan in Combination With Oxaliplatin and S-1 Versus Gemcitabine Combined With Capecitabine as Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with liposomal irinotecan in combination with oxaliplatin, and S-1 compared with capecitabine combined with capecitabine in participants with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after radical surgery.

Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease recurrence or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). Disease recurrence is defined as evidence of disease recurrence demonstrated by imaging assessment with CT or MRI scan and/or pathological diagnosis indicated by biopsy., Approximately 3 years.
Overall survival (OS), Approximately 5 years.
