ONO-4538 Phase I Study in Patients With Solid Tumor
The objective of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4538 administered to Korean patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who are refractory or intolerant to standard therapy or for whom no appropriate treatment is available.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Recurrent Solid Tumors
DRUG: ONO-4538
PK Outcome: Cmax of ONO-4538, Cmax was the maximum serum concentration of ONO-4538 after the single administration., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase. Actual blood sampling points are pre-dose, 1hr, 3hr, 9hr, 25hr, 49hr, 73hr, 169hr, 337hr, and 504hr.|PK Outcome: Tmax of ONO-4538, Tmax was the time to reach the Cmax., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase. Actual blood sampling points are pre-dose, 1hr, 3hr, 9hr, 25hr, 49hr, 73hr, 169hr, 337hr, and 504hr.|AUC21day, AUC21day was the area under serum concentration-time curve of ONO-4538 from day 0 to day 21 (last measurement)., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase. Actual blood sampling points are pre-dose, 1hr, 3hr, 9hr, 25hr, 49hr, 73hr, 169hr, 337hr, and 504hr.|AUCinf, AUCinf was the area under serum concentration-time curve of ONO-4538 extrapolated to infinity., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase. Actual blood sampling points are pre-dose, 1hr, 3hr, 9hr, 25hr, 49hr, 73hr, 169hr, 337hr, and 504hr.|T1/2, T1/2 was the elimination half-life of serum concentration of ONO-4538., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase. Actual blood sampling points are pre-dose, 1hr, 3hr, 9hr, 25hr, 49hr, 73hr, 169hr, 337hr, and 504hr.
Safety Outcome: The Number of Subjects With Overall Adverse Events, Adverse Events (AEs) were analyzed based on treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as any event not present prior to initiation of investigational product that first appeared following exposure to investigational product or any event already present that worsened relative to the pre-treatment state following exposure to investigational product., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase.|Safety Outcome: The Number of Deaths, Number of subjects with TEAEs leading to death., 3 weeks: from the start of administration to the end of treatment phase.
The objective of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4538 administered to Korean patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who are refractory or intolerant to standard therapy or for whom no appropriate treatment is available.
