Quantitative MR Biomarkers for Sarcoma Treatment
To determine if MRI imaging can be used to accurately determine if a sarcoma is responding to the type of chemotherapy being used.
Soft Tissue Tumors
PROCEDURE: MRI Scan of soft tissue tumor
To determine if MRI imaging can accurately determine if a sarcoma (tumor)is responding to the type of chemotherapy being used., To image and evaluate the size of the soft tissue tumor prior to chemotherapy treatment., Baseline prior to chemo
MRI Scan, To evaluate the size of the soft tissue tumor after start of chemotherapy to determine if the chemo is having any notable effect on tumor prior to surgery., 3 weeks post start of chemo and end of chemo
The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI imaging can be used to accurately determine if a sarcoma is responding to the type of chemotherapy being used or if it is ineffective early on in the treatment; instead of finding this out 2-3 months later. If it is determined that MRI can accurately diagnose tumor response, medications can be switched early on potentially improv8ing the patients'chances of recovery.
