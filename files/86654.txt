Topical Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Eyelids
The investigators propose a prospective randomized control trial testing the hypothesis that routine topical antibiotic prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the rate of infection after eyelid surgery.
Antibiotic Side Effect|Eyelid; Wound|Eyelid Diseases|Surgical Wound Infection|Surgical Wound, Recent|Surgical Incision|Skin Cancer Face|Antibiotic Allergy|Surgical Site Infection
DRUG: Topical Antibiotic Product|DRUG: Topical Non-Antibiotic Ointment
Number of Participants With Surgical Site Infections, The rate of superficial incisional or deep incisional surgical site infection (SSI) of clean and clean-contaminated wounds., First Post-Operative Visit (~7-14 days)
Number of High Risk Participants With Surgical Site Infections, A secondary outcome is the rate of superficial or deep SSI in participants considered high risk for infection due to comorbidities such as smoking, exogenous immunosuppressive agent use, or medical conditions causing immunosuppression such as diabetes mellitus., First Post-Operative Visit (~7-14 days)|Number of Participants With Wound Dehiscence, A secondary outcome recording the rate of wound dehiscence after surgery., First Post-Operative Visit (~7-14 days)|Number of Participants With Allergic Contact Dermatitis, A secondary outcome recording the rate of allergic contact dermatitis due to post-operative ointment., First Post-Operative Visit (~7-14 days)
The use of prophylactic topical antibiotic therapy after eyelid surgery is widespread. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-related complications, and healthcare costs, the investigators wish to determine whether prophylactic post-operative antibiotic ointment is truly necessary. After all, existing dermatology literature currently recommends against the routine use of antibiotic ointment after various surgical procedures (e.g. Mohs surgery). The investigators aim to perform a prospective randomized control trial at the University of California, San Francisco. The investigators aim to recruit a total of 400 oculoplastics patients undergoing eyelid surgery or surgery involving peri-orbital incisions from 2017 through 2019.
