HPV Specific Immune Lymphocytes (HPV-CTLs) in the Treatment of HPV
The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV-infused autologous or allogenic HPV-CTLs.
Human Papilloma Virus
BIOLOGICAL: HPV-CTLs
Safety of HPV-CTLs in patients using CTCAE version 4.0 standard to evaluate the level of adverse events, Physiological parameter (measuring cytokine response, fever, symptoms), 6 months
Viral load response, The viral load response to the CTLs infusion will be assessed by HPV specific PCR of peripheral blood., 6 months|Treatment Responses, Disease status is defined by the biochemical markers (measuring HPV concentration and so on) to get the outcomes such as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD)., 1 year
Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 45). Around 50-80% of women are infected by HPV within their whole lives. The current treatment of HPV-positive mainly includes drug, cryotherapy, laser, microwave, surgery and so on. Some treatments are convenient, but easy to cause pain or infection and there is still a greater risk of recurrence after treatment.

Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral antigens has proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple infusions of HPV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes cells in patients.
