Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of Doxycycline Foam for the Prevention of EGFRI Skin Toxicity in Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of FDX104 Antibiotic Foam in the prevention of EGFRI skin toxicity in cancer patients receiving Cetuximab or Panitumumab.
Rash Due to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors
DRUG: FDX104 (4% Doxycycline)
To investigate the safety and tolerability of FDX104 in cancer patients receiving EGFRI, To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of FDX104 in terms of skin tolerability, adverse events, serious adverse events and vital signs in subjects with advanced cancer treated by EGFRI., 9 weeks
Reduction of skin toxicity by FDX104 in cancer patients treated with EGFRI, Reduction in numbers of papulo-pustular eruptions in the treatment side compared to the placebo treated side and reduction in erythema or edema areas in the treatment side compared to the placebo treated side estimated by the MESTT grading scale developed by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and by visual scale of rash severity (Scope A. scale), 9 weeks
This is a phase II multicenter, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Doxycycline Foam 4% for the prevention of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Skin Toxicity, to Subjects with Cancer Receiving Cetuximab or Panitumumab on a weekly or every 2 weeks basis.

The study consists of a screening visit, a treatment period where patients will be treated topically on the face twice daily for 5 weeks. A post-treatment follow up visit (4 weeks after end of treatment), will be performed only for subjects who have experienced unresolved possibly-related or related adverse events at the end of the treatment. Seven days after randomization and study drug initiation, subjects will start their EGFRI treatment.
