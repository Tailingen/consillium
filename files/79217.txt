UCLA Breast Cancer Survivor Health Promotion Research Study
Pilot randomized controlled parallel group behavior change comparative effectiveness trial involves 30 breast cancer survivors interested in losing excess body fat. Both interventions include dietary + exercise prescriptions that hold promise for reducing the survivors' risk of cancer recurrence. Both interventions are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans but the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)-based approach focuses on weight loss through calorie restriction and increased physical activity while the Highly Microbiota-Accessible Foods (HMAFs) approach is intended to be a low-numeracy version of a Mediterranean-style diet and increased physical activity. The DPP approach is considered to be a high-numeracy intervention because it requires that consumers keep track of all calories consumed and expended per day and to endeavor to maintain a calorie deficit each day during the active weight loss phase. For both conditions, the 12 to 13-week intervention includes 2 virtual home visits, 2 virtual group education sessions and 7 telephone or Zoom-based coaching sessions by well-trained intervenors. Assessments occur at baseline and six months, with systemic inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) being the primary outcome measure and visceral fat being a secondary outcome. Other prespecified secondary outcomes include gut microbiota alpha-1 diversity, insulin resistance, HDL-cholesterol, daily count of highly microbiota-accessible foods, waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, ratio of fecal Proteobacteria to short chain fatty acid-generating bacteria and health-related quality of life.

BEHAVIORAL: Diabetes Prevention Program-based lifestyle change intervention (DPP)|BEHAVIORAL: Highly Microbiota-Accessible Foods (HMAFs) intervention
High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (CRP), CRP is commonly used by researchers as a biomarker for systemic inflammation., Change from baseline to 6 months follow-up
Visceral fat as assessed by DXA, Visceral fat is also known as intra-abdominal fat. It is located inside the peritoneal cavity, packed in between internal organs and torso. It is the most metabolically active adipose tissue and positively associated with systemic inflammation., Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Shannon index of alpha diversity of fecal microbial species, Fecal DNA from the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA will be amplified, sequenced and filtered for quality before statistical analysis. The Shannon index measures both gene richness and evenness., Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Number of highly microbiota-accessible foods consumed per day, From participants' 24-hour diet recalls - The daily sum of different carbohydrate-rich food sources minimally processed and unaccompanied by pro-inflammatory components, especially saturated fat and added sugar., Change from baseline to six months follow-up
Insulin resistance, Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is a recognized measure of insulin resistance, calculated from fasting glucose and fasting insulin values, Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Waist circumference, Waist circumference is measured via non-stretchable measuring tape around the waist at a midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest, upon breath exhalation., Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Body mass index (BMI), Height measured via wall-mounted stadiometer and weight measured via calibrated digital scale will be used to compute BMI ((kg/(m x m)), Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Systolic blood pressure (mm), Regularly calibrated digital sphygmomanometer will be used to assess the participant's resting systolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury, Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Ratio of abundance of fecal Proteobacteria to fecal short chain fatty acid-generating bacteria, Fecal DNA from the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA will be amplified, sequenced and filtered for quality before statistical analysis. The ratio of fecal Proteobacterial abundance to the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-generating fecal microbes is expected to be reduced in healthier guts., Change from baseline to six months follow-up|Health-related quality of life, RAND Short Form-20 (SF-20) is recognized instrument for assessing participants' health-related quality of life. Minimum score = 0; maximum score = 100. Higher scores represent higher quality of life., Change from baseline to six months follow-up|HDL-cholesterol, Fasting serum HDL-cholesterol concentration expected to reflect the experimental differences in dietary patterns. Serum triglycerides will be generated as part of a standard lipid panel., Change from baseline to six months follow-up
Background. The human gut microbiota influences obesity status and inflammation, two major risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer recurrence. Whether an exercise and dietary intervention designed to optimize gut microbiota composition might reduce risk for breast cancer recurrence is unknown. To improve the gut microbiota composition, the investigators propose teaching postmenopausal breast cancer survivors to allocate about 20% of their daily calorie intake to consuming a daily count of six fiber-rich, minimally processed, plant-based food choices that comply with federal MyPlate.gov diet recommendations. Preliminary data suggest that the investigators' Highly-Microbiota-Accessible Foods (HMAFs) approach will yield cardiometabolic outcomes equal to or better than those achieved by the traditional Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) calorie restriction approach at 6 months follow-up. Because breast cancer recurrence risk covaries with cardiometabolic risks, the lower cardiometabolic risk of the HMAFs approach should be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence.

Hypotheses. The greater diversity of fiber-rich, minimally processed plant foods consumed in the HMAFs condition relative to the DPP condition will result in greater changes in HMAFs participants compared to DPP participants from baseline to 6 months follow-up in the following measures: (primary hypothesis) reduce high sensitivity C-reactive protein, (secondary hypotheses) reduce visceral body fat and increase alpha-1 diversity of gut microbes and increase health-related quality of life.

To test these hypotheses, the research objectives include the following specific aims: 1) Recruit a diverse sample of 30 overweight or obese postmenopausal survivors with stage I, II and IIIa breast cancer; randomly allocate them to two lifestyle change intervention conditions, 2) Obtain baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments of: low grade systemic inflammation, body composition including visceral fat estimation, cardiorespiratory fitness, inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers, fecal samples, and quality of life, 3) Conduct two parallel, three-month behavior change interventions, contrasting the 6-count HMAFs approach with the traditional DPP calorie restriction approach , and 4) Use results to design a ramped-up randomized factorial trial.

If hypotheses are confirmed, the low-numeracy HMAFs approach may, for low-income survivors, be a practical alternative to traditional high-numeracy calorie restriction approaches to reducing risk of breast cancer recurrence.
