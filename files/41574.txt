Capitalizing on a Teachable Moment to Promote Smoking Cessation
The purpose of this study is to develop and test a self-help smoking cessation treatment for patients receiving a lung cancer screening computed tomography (CT) scan.
Smoking Cessation
BEHAVIORAL: Self-Help (SHI)|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care (UC)
Study 1 - Completion of Formative Evaluation, Complete formative research to adapt and refine the existing Stop Smoking for Good booklets., Up to 12 months|Study 2 - Rate of Seven-Day Abstinence, Up to 9 months, Seven-day abstinence will be assessed at each follow-up, allowing for calculation of point-prevalence abstinence rates. For this pilot, we will not bioverify self-reported abstinence.
Rate of Intervention Demand, Demand will be estimated by noting accrual rates into the study., Up to 9 months|Degree of Practicality, Practicality encompasses the degree to which investigators are able to carry out all the piloted elements of the planned randomized control trial (RCT) successfully and efficiently (i.e., recruitment, screening, randomization, and follow-up)., Up to 9 months
Conduct Formative Research (Months 1 - 4): Identification of emergent themes and responses to existing booklets.

Adapt and Refine Booklets (Months 5 - 8): Advanced drafts of booklets.

Final Reactions to Draft Booklets (Months 9 - 12): Series of smoking cessation booklets for spiral computed tomography (CT) patients.
