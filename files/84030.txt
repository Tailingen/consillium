Multicenter Study of Safety and Efficacy of PET-adapted Treatment With Nivolumab, Bendamustine, Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine (Nivo-BeGEV) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody highly effective in patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. A PET-adapted regimen of nivolumab combined with salvage therapy was shown to induce high response rates and favorable progression-free survival as a bridge to autologous stem cell transplantation, allowing to omit salvage chemotherapy in a substantial proportion of r\\r cHL patients. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of PET-adapted treatment of nivolumab at the 3 mg/kg in combination with Bendamustine, Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine (Nivo-BeGEV) in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma.
