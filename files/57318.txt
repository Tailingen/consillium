Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for Mediastinal Re-staging of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
The aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic values of EBUS-TBNA in the mediastinal re-staging after induction treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Primary objective:

1. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the accuracy of EBUS-TBNA in the detection of mediastinal metastasis in mediastinal re-staging after induction treatment.

Secondary objectives:

1. To compare the diagnostic values of EBUS-TBNA and integrated PET/CT in mediastinal re-staging
2. To evaluate the changes of ultrasonographic features of mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy
3. To determine procedure related complications
