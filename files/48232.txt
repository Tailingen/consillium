Phase I/II Study of SY-1425 (Tamibarotene) in Combination With Azacitidine and Venetoclax for Patients With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
To learn if adding venetoclax to the chemotherapy combination of tamibarotene and azacitidine is more effective than tamibarotene and azacitidine alone in treating higher-risk CMM
Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Tamibarotene|DRUG: Venetoclax
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* Cohort 1: Characterize the safety and toleratbility of the combination of azacitidine and tamibarotene in newly diagnosed CMML.
* Cohort 2 and 3: Characterize the safety and tolerability of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in relapsed higher risk CMML.

Secondary Objectives:

* Cohort 1: Characterize the preliminary clinical activity of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine defined by complete response (CR) rate, following MDS/MPN IWG response criteria (Appendix 1),
* Cohort 2: Characterize the safety and tolerability of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in relapsed higher risk CMML.
* Cohort 3: Characterize the clinical activity of tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax by overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed higher risk CMML.
* To characterize additional clinical activity outcomes such as duration of response, leukemia-free survival (LFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).
* To evaluate differences in response and efficacy outcomes by MDS/MPN IWG response criteria based on RARA expression levels and positivity.
* To correlate response with disease subtype and genomic profile
* To evaluate changes in clonal composition and VAF of identified mutations with therapy.
