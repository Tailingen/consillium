Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Administered Intravenously in Patients With Metastatic, Refractory Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously either alone or in combination with Irinotecan in colorectal carcinoma patients who are refractory to or intolerant to standard therapy.
Colorectal Carcinoma|CRC
BIOLOGICAL: JX-594|DRUG: Irinotecan
Determine Radiographic Response Rate of Patients Enrolled in the Phase 2a Portion of the Study, Percentage of participants who showed overall response during their participation in the study. Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (mRECIST) and assessed by tri-phasic contrast enhanced CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of intratumoral enhancing area; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of enhancing area; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Scans Every 8 weeks until radiographic progression was confirmed by the site.
This was a Phase 1/2a, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC)
