The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate, toxicity, progression free survival and quality of life of chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
Recurrent Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel/ oxaliplatin
overall response rate, 2 years
progression free survival, 2 years|toxicity, 2 years|quality of life, 2 years
Recent therapeutic developments, such as the introduction of new cytotoxic agents (taxanes, platinum, liposomal anthracyclines, etc) have resulted in constant improvements in treatment efficacy and consequently in recurrent or metastatic outcome. This single arm, multicenter phase II study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free survival of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with recurrence or metastatic breast cancer.
