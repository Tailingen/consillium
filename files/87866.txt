Pharmacokinetic and Safety Study of Nab®-Paclitaxel (ABI-007) Plus Gemcitabine in Subjects With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Who Have Cholestatic Hyperbilirubinemia
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of nab®-paclitaxel (ABI-007) plus gemcitabine in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer who have cholestatic hyperbilirubinemia secondary to bile duct obstruction.
Pancreatic Neoplasms|Cholestasis
DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose which is defined as the highest dose which induced a dose limiting toxicity in 0 or 1 out of 6 subjects during their first cycle of treatment., Up to 20 months|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in plasma, Days 1 and 3|Pharmacokinetics - AUC, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, Days 1 and 3|Pharmacokinetics - T1/2, Terminal half-life (T1/2), Days 1 and 3|Pharmacokinetics - Vss, Apparent volume of distribution at the steady state, Days 1 and 3|Pharmacokinetics - CL, Apparent total body clearance, Days 1 and 3
Tumor response, Objective tumor response based on computed tomography (CT)/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version) 1.1 guidelines per Investigator assessment, Up to 28 months|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival according to RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines per investigator assessment, Up to 28 months|Overall survival, Number of participants who are alive or dead, Up to 28 months|Adverse Events, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and serious adverse events. TEAE are defined as any event that begins or worsens in grade after the start of Investigational Product through 28 days after the last does of Investigational Product., Up to 28 months|Gemcitabine PK profile, Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of gemcitabine, Up to 28 months
There are 2 treatment cohorts in this study based on the predose total bilirubin levels on Cycle 1 Day 1 (Cohort 1 \> 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal \[ULN\] to 3 x ULN bilirubin and Cohort 2 \> 3 x ULN to 5 x ULN). Enrollment of subjects into Cohort 2 will only proceed after a review of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for all subjects in Cohort 1 has been completed by the Safety Monitoring Committee. The study is following a 3+3 dose escalation scheme within each dose level cohort group. A total of 3 subjects will initially be enrolled to the starting dose level in each cohort. The dose of the study regimen in each cohort will be escalated (or reduced) according to tolerability.
