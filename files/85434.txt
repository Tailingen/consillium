Randomized Pre-surgical Window-of-Opportunity Trial of TTI-101 in Patients With Stage II-IV Resectable HPV-negative Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
To learn if TTI-101 can reduce the growth of HPV-negative squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck when given before standard of care surgery.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: Control Group|DRUG: TTI-101
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Objectives:

Primary:

â€¢ To determine the change in pY-STAT3 H-score in tumor tissue in post-treatment resection specimens versus pre-treatment biopsy specimens.

Secondary:

* To determine the safety and tolerability of pre-surgery TTI-101 in patients with Stage II-IV HPV-negative HNSCC who are planned for definitive local surgery with or without radiation.
* To determine the individual pre/post treatment changes in pY-STAT3 H-scores in epithelial and stromal tumor cells.
* To determine the pathologic response rate to pre-surgery TTI-101.
* To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to pre-surgery TTI-101 using RECIST v1.1 criteria.
* To determine the disease free, disease specific and overall survival (DFS, DSS, OS) after pre-surgery TTI-101 treatment and SOC surgery.

Exploratory:

* To evaluate the effects of pre-surgery TTI-101 on circulating and tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, and on the intratumoral expression of PD-1 along with other immune related molecules.
* To compare outcome measures (response rate and survival) in control versus TTI-101-treated patients.
* To determine the association of immunologic changes with treatment response.
* To determine the association of pharmacokinetic (PK) measures with treatment response.
