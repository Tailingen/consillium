Radiosurgery With or Without Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Radiosurgery may be able to deliver x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known if radiosurgery is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating brain metastases.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients who have brain metastases.
Metastatic Cancer
RADIATION: radiation therapy|PROCEDURE: surgery|RADIATION: WBRT
Overall survival (OS), Up to 6 months
Time to CNS failure, Up to 4 years|Change in QOL between SRS and SRS + WBRT treatment groups using the FACT-BR questionnaire, From baseline to up to 3 months|Change in the duration of functional independence using the Barthel ADL Index score, From baseline to up to 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the overall survival of patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases treated with radiosurgery with or without whole brain radiotherapy.
* Compare the time to CNS failure (brain) in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the quality of life, duration of functional independence, and long-term neurocognitive status in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the post-treatment toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (60 and over vs under 60), extracranial disease (controlled for more than 3 months vs controlled for 3 months or less), and number of brain metastases (1 vs more than 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo radiosurgery.
* Arm II: Patients undergo radiosurgery. Within 14 days, patients then undergo whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, the beginning of each treatment, at week 6, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 12, every 3 months for 9 months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients (240 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
