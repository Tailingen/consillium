A Study of Belzutifan (MK-6482) in Combination With Lenvatinib Versus Cabozantinib for Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-6482-011)
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of belzutifan + lenvatinib versus cabozantinib in participants with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell component after prior therapy.

The primary hypothesis is that belzutifan + lenvatinib is superior to cabozantinib in terms of progression-free survival or overall survival.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Belzutifan|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Cabozantinib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review will be presented., Up to approximately 34 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 44 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review will be presented., Up to approximately 44 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 44 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 44 months
