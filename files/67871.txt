This study uses a literature review, qualitative (focus groups) and quantitative methods (discrete-choice experiment, DCE) to determine renal cell carcinoma (RCC) participants and oncologists' preferences. In this clinical trial, the study team will develop a survey consisting of comparisons of hypothetical treatment profiles (scenarios). Scenarios are presented to participants, and each participant chooses the most preferable.
