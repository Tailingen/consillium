A Phase I/II Study of IXO With Bevacizumab in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Triplets of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil(FU)/leucovorin (LV) are associated with high response rates and long survival as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, is better tolerated and shows better response rates than 5-FU/LV in metastatic colorectal cancer. A phase I dose-escalation study established dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II doses (RPIID) of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. This phase I /II study is to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), phase II recommended dose (RD) of IXO and bevacizumab combination and safety at the RD in an expanded cohort.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: IXO regimen + bevacizumab
Phase I: Assess the MTD and RD for phase II of IXO and bevacizumab combination given every 3 weeks in 1st line patients with mCRC, 3-week cycle, continuous monitoring of AE|Phase II: Using the RD established in phase I, assess efficacy of the IXO with bevacizumab combination as measured by progression-free survival, 3-week cycle, continuous monitoring of AE
Response rates and duration of response, every 2 cycles - 6 weeks|Overall survival, continuous|Qualitative and quantitative toxicity, continuous
