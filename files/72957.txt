Sorafenib and Bortezomib Treatment for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a single-arm Phase I/II study of sorafenib and bortezomib with dose optimization in initial patients. The initial patients on the dose-finding portion of this study will be enrolled through a single institution. Following establishment of the Phase II dose the study will open enrollment throughout the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) Oncology Research Consortium.

The purpose of this study is to develop the combination of bortezomib (which is proven to be clinically active in patients with multiple myeloma) with sorafenib (a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis). This regimen will be developed in a schedule that is convenient for patients, and that is as minimally toxic to patients as possible.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, The percentage of patients who experience an objective benefit from treatment, determined by the treating physician after reviewing key laboratory values from blood and urine., 24 months
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib with weekly bortezomib, as measured by objective response rate and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

Secondary Objective:

To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of sorafenib with weekly bortezomib in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
