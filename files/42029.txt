Efficacy and Safety of Oral Treatment With BIBF 1120 ES in Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
The overall purpose of this phase II trial was to evaluate the efficacy of 250 mg BIBF 1120 twice daily (BID) versus 150 mg BIBF 1120 BID in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In addition, safety data for the two different dosages were collected and analysed.
