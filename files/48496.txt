A Study of Subcutaneous Daratumumab Regimens in Combination With Bispecific T Cell Redirection Antibodies for the Treatment of Participants With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to identify recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) for each treatment combination (between daratumumab plus talquetamab and teclistamab plus daratumumab with or without pomalidomide) and to characterize the safety of each RP2D for selected treatment combinations.

Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The dose limiting toxicities are based on drug related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: hematological or non-hematological toxicity of grade 3 or higher., Up to 52 Weeks|Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity by Severity, The dose limiting toxicities are based on drug related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: hematological or non-hematological toxicity of grade 3 or higher., Up to 52 Weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, and suspects transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product., Up to 48 Weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events and SAEs by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, and suspects transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product., Up to 48 Weeks

Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by osteolytic lesions, increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Overall rationale of study is that daratumumab in combination with talquetamab or teclistamab with or without pomalidomide may lead to enhanced clinical responses in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma through multiple mechanisms of action. Daratumumab is human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody (IgG1k) that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope on cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Talquetamab and teclistamab are bispecific T cell redirection antibodies. Talquetamab binds to cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) receptor complex on T cells and to G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5-member D (GPRC5D), a 7-transmembrane receptor protein on plasma cells and teclistamab binds to human and cynomolgus-CD3 and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Purpose of study is to evaluate safety of daratumumab in combination with talquetamab and teclistamab with or without pomalidomide, and to evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of each combination. Study consists of a screening period, treatment period (Part 1: dose escalation and Part 2: dose expansion), a Post-treatment Follow-up Period (after the last dose of study drug and will continue for up to 16 weeks for each subject), and a Long-term Extension Period. The study will end when one of the following occurs: 1) the study drug has received marketing authorization and, if regionally applicable, government reimbursement is available; 2) a long-term extension rollover study has commenced for participants who are still benefiting from study treatment as determined by their investigator; or 3) all participants have discontinued study treatment. Total duration of study is approximately 5 years and 6 months. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points. Participants safety will be monitored throughout study by Study Evaluation Team (SET). SET consists of members of sponsor's study team and participating investigators.
