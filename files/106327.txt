ELVN-001 for the Treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia With and Without T315I Mutation in Japanese Participants
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and determine the recommended dose for further clinical evaluation of ELVN-001 in Japanese patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia with and without T315I mutations in patients who has failed, or the patient is intolerant to, or not a candidate for, at least 2 prior TKIs.
CML (Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia)|Chronic Phase CML
DRUG: ELVN-001
Part 1: Incidence of dose limiting toxicities, DLTs will be used to support that the recommended doses for expansion are \</= MTD, 28 days|Part 1: Incidence of adverse events (AEs), Adverse events will be used to support that the recommended doses for expansion are likely to be tolerable, Up to 28 days|Part 1: Incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be used to support that the recommended doses for expansion are likely to be tolerable, Up to 28 days|Part 1: Incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, Clinically significant ECG abnormalities will be used to support that the recommended doses for expansion are likely to be tolerable, Up to 28 days|Part 2: Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events will be used to support that the dose(s) evaluated in exploration is tolerable, Up to 3 years|Part 2: Incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, Clinically significant ECG abnormalities will be used to support that the dose(s) evaluated in exploration is tolerable, Up to 3 years|Part 2: Incidence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, Clinically significant ECG abnormalities will be used to support that the recommended dose(s) evaluated in exploration is tolerable, Up to 3 years
Area under the curve, PK parameter based on measurement of drug concentration in blood over time, 6 months|Maximum concentration, PK parameter based on measurement of drug concentration in blood, 6 months|Time of maximum concentration, PK parameter which is the time at which the highest concentration of drug in the blood is measured, 6 months|Minimum concentration, PK parameter based on the measurement of the drug concentration that is at the lowest level once steady state has been achieved., 6 months|Molecular response (MR), Measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of BCR-ABL transcript levels, Up to 3 years|Duration of Molecular Response, Time from first molecular response (as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of BCR-ABL transcript levels) to loss of response or discontinuation of study drug, Up to 3 years|Complete Hematologic Response (CHR), The proportion of patients who achieve a CHR who are not in CHR at baseline, Up to 3 years
This first-in-human trial with ELVN-001 is a dose escalation study with the primary purpose to identify the recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs) of single agent ELVN-001 in chronic phase CML with or without T315I mutations. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of ELVN-001 will be assessed together with an evaluation of changes in BCR-ABL1 transcript. An understanding of the safety profile, PK and preliminary evidence of anti-CML activity will be used to inform future development of ELVN-001 in adults with CML. By virtue of its predicted pharmacological profile ELVN-001 has the potential to be tolerable and achieve a deep molecular response in patients with CML with or without T315I mutations who have failed, or are intolerant to, or not a candidate for, at least 2 prior TKIs.
