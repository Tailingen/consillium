According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA), the estimate for Brazil, 2016-2017 biennium, points to the occurrence of about 600,000 new cases of cancer, and breast cancer (58000) in women will be the most frequent. One study revealed that only 12% of women undergoing chemotherapy in CM who participated in a physical exercise program had to readjusted the dose of the medications, while 34% of those who received the conventional treatment needed to readjust the Treatment doses, with neuropathy being one of the most present adverse effects that influenced this adjustment. In this sense, the conduct to keep the patient at rest during the treatment seems to potentiate her side effects, and sedentarism is another factor detrimental to the patient's health.
