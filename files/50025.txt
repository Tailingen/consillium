A Prospective Multicenter Phase 2 Study of the Chemotherapy-Free Combination of the Intravenous Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) Inhibitor Copanlisib in Combination With Obinutuzumab in Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and a High Tumor Burden
The Alternative-C Trial is a prospective, multicenter Phase 2 Study to evaluate the efficacy of the chemotherapy-free combination of copanlisib and obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and a high tumor burden. Additionally, the combination should be evaluated in terms of secondary efficacy endpoints, treatment compliance, safety and patient-reported symptoms. The study Population includes Patients \> 18 years of age with histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma grade 1, 2 or 3A with Ann Arbor Stage III/IV or stage II not suitable for radiotherapy and in need of therapy.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Copanlisib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
One-year progression-free survival (PFS) probability from study registration, The rate of patients achieving a progression free survival of more than one year after registration (one-year PFS rate) will serve as early readout for efficacy., 1 year
