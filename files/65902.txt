Phase III Study of CPX-351 Versus 7+3 in Patients 60-75 Years Old With Untreated High Risk (Secondary) Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To confirm the efficacy of CPX-351 compared to 7+3 as first line therapy in elderly patients (60-75 yrs) with high risk (secondary) Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall survival.
High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: CPX-351|DRUG: 7+3 (cytarabine and daunorubicin)
Overall Survival, Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization to death from any cause, subjects not known to have died by the last follow-up were censored on the date they were last known to be alive., From the date of randomization to death from any cause
Proportion of Subjects With a Response, Complete Remission (CR), Post Induction|Event-free Survival, All randomized subjects were assessed for event-free survival (EFS). EFS was defined as the time from study randomization to the date of induction treatment failure (persistent disease), relapse from CR or CRi or death from any cause, whichever came first. Subjects alive and not known to have any of these events were censored on thee date they were last examined on study., From the date of randomization to the date that persistent disease was documented or the date of relapse after CR or death, whichever came first|Remission Duration, Only subjects achieving CR or CRi were assessed for remission duration., From the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse or death from any cause|Rate of Achieving Morphologic Leukemia-free State, All randomized subjects with at least 1 evaluable postrandomization bone marrow assessment performed on or after Day 14 after the last induction were assessed for MLFS., Day 14|Proportion of Subjects Receiving a Stem Cell Transplant, The number and percentage of subjects transferred for HSCT after induction treatment was recorded., Post Induction
To confirm the efficacy of CPX-351 compared to 7+3 as first line therapy in elderly patients (60-75 yrs) with high risk (secondary) Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall survival.
