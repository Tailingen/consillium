A Study of Radiation Therapy After Surgery in People With Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study will test whether limiting standard photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to exclude the oral tongue surgical site can decrease the risk of side effects caused by oral radiation. The researchers will also find out if this approach affects the rate of disease coming back after treatment (recurrence), and will measure participants' quality of life by having them complete questionnaires.
Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)|OTHER: Life questionnaire's
Rate of Acute Grade â‰¥3 Oral Mucositis, This is defined by CTCAE v 5.0 criteria, within 120 days of radiation completion
Cumulative Incidence of Local Failure, will be defined as any local failure in the oral tongue/FOM/BOT that is subsequently proven by biopsy during protocol-mandated follow-up. Competing risks will be distant or regional failure without local failure or death without progression. This will be calculated from the start of radiation., 2 years
