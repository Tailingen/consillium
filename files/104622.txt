Fluid Balance During Surgery for Ovarian Cancer
Extensive tumour debulking challenges both surgeon and anaesthesiologist but promotes survival in late-stage ovarian cancer patients. Little is known about the intraoperative fluid balance and its impact on morbidity and mortality.

PROCEDURE: Cytoreductive surgery
fluid balance, intraoperative fluid balance is determined by the difference between fluid intake and outtake, at the end of surgery
mechanical ventilation, Duration of mechanical ventilation, starting from endotracheal intubation until extubation, at the timepoint of extubation|mortality, long-term mortality after surgery, 5 years
