Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of IBI346#CIBI346Y001#
An open label, single-arm clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IBI346 infusion in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: IBI346
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), 21 days post IBI346 administration|Incidence and severity of adverse events: Proportion of subjects with treatment-related adverse events assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, 2 years post IBI346 administration|Presence or absence of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL), Baseline up to 15 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients with a best response of either complete response, stringent complete response, very good partial response or partial response, assessed using modified International Myeloma Working Group response criteria（2016）, 3 months post IBI346 administration|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from the date of initial response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria (2016)., 2 years post IBI346 administration|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of initial administration of IBI346 to date of first disease progression according to IMWG criteria (2016), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years post IBI346 administration|Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the date of the initial administration of IBI346 to the date of the subject's death., 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 cells -Maximum CAR level in blood (Cmax), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 cells -Time to peak CAR level in blood (Tmax), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 cells - Area under the curve of the CAR level in blood (AUC), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 antibody- Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 antibody- Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 antibody- clearance (CL), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Pharmacokinetics parameters of IBI346 antibody- half-life (t1/2), 2 years post IBI346 administration|Positive rate of human anti-P329G CAR antibody, 2 years post IBI346 administration|Positive rate of anti-drug antibody (ADA) of P329G BCMA antibody, 2 years post IBI346 administration
