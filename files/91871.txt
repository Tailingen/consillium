An Algorithm for Intra-operative Goal-directed Haemodynamic Management in Non-cardiac Surgery
A systematic literature search a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm was created. The hypothesis of this study was that the goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm is feasible and can improve clinical outcome.

hospital length of stay, The perioperative hospital length of stay is assessed., a period of 60 days
need for ventilator therapy, The perioperative need for ventilator therapy is assessed., a period of 60 days|monetary reimbursement for prolonged hospital stay, The monetary reimbursement for prolonged hospital stay is assessed to evaluate the impact on financial consequences., a period of 60 days
After a systematic literature search a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm was created. The algorithm was adapted to international standards and consensus was reached through a modified Delphi method at international meetings. The feasibility of using the algorithm for intraoperative haemodynamic management was tested and the resultant clinical data analyzed retrospectively for several types of surgery with the hypothesis that the goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm is feasible in the clinical setting and can improve clinical outcome.
