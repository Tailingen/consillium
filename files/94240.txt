Although there are no standard second-line treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma, some studies have showed that irinotecan, fluorouracil may be effective in treating patients with metastatic esophageal carcinoma after failure of first-line treatment. Since irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor. Giving more than one drug may be more effective. In this phase Ⅱ trial, the investigator would like to observe the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI(Irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin ) as second-line treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma.
