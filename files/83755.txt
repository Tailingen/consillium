Senl-h19 CAR-T Cell Injection in the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study is an open, dose-escalating clinical study, taking patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia as the test subjects, including mouse-derived CAR-T treatment failure or relapse, or for any reason cannot bridge the transplant r/r B-ALL.
B-ALL
BIOLOGICAL: Senl-h19 CAR-T
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CD7 CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Remission Rate, Remission Rate including complete remission(CR)、CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)、No remission(NR), 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of Senl h19 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion
Main research objectives:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Senl-h19 CAR-T in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia Secondary research purpose To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of Senl-h19 CAR-T in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
