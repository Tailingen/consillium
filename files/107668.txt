Haploidentical NK Cells After Pemetrexed in Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This phase 1 trial investigate safety and maximum tolerated dose of natural killer (NK) cells derived from haploidentical family donors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Pemetrexed and donor-derived NK cell infusion
maximum tolerated dose of donor NK cells, determine the dose of NK cells that can be given within dose-limiting toxicities, 6 weeks
Eligible patients receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously (Day 1). On Day 8, patients receive donor-derived NK cells via a central venous catheter.

The NK cell dose is as follows;

Level 1: 1.25 X 109 cells Level 2: 2.50 X 109 cells Level 3: 5.00 X 109 cells

Three patients each will be treated on each dose level.

Two weeks prior to donor NK cell administration to patients, HLA-haploidentical family member of the patients undergo leukapheresis after G-CSF injections to collect hematopoietic stem cells.

These donor cells are then taken to the laboratory, where they were differentiated into NK cells ex vivo over approximately over 2-week period.
