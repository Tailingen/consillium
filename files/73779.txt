The Combination of Camrelizumab and Apatinib as Second-line Therapy for Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma
This is an single arm, open-label, phase II trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of using the combination of Camrelizumab with apatinib as second-line therapy for advanced PDAC.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib
ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Through study completion, an average of 2 years.
PFS, Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression of disease or death from any cause, Through study completion, an average of 2 years.|OS, Overall survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years.|DoR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Through study completion, an average of 2 years.|DCR, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 2 years.|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) in the treatment of Camrelizumab in combination with apatinib, Number of participants with adverse events occurring up to 30 days after the last administration are evaluated and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 years.
PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the heavy chain is immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the light chain is immunoglobulin κ (IgK). Camrelizumab specifically binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand (PD-L1), allowing T cells to recover against tumor immune responses.

Response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response，disease control rate, drugs related side effects were recorded and analyzed, to assess the combination treatment could or couldn't benefit the patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
