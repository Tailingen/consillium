Supervised Versus Non-supervised Exercise on Adherence and Functional Outcomes in Colorectal Patients
Investigation into prehabilitation by increasing the supervision of exercise in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer and comparing with patients involved in a rehabilitation group receiving exercise after surgery.
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: Prehabilitation Plus
Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Change in functional walking capacity will be assessed throughout the study according to the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six-minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk; encouragement and feedback are given according to published guidelines., up to 8 weeks after surgery
The aims of this research project are the following:

To determine to what extent a structured multimodal prehabilitation regimen, which includes aerobic and resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation and psychological coping strategies, initiated before surgery, and continued while in hospital and after surgery, optimizes the recovery of functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for cancer.

To understand which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to prehabilitation interventions and predict change in later outcome measures.
