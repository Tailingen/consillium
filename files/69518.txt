The Impact of Thymosin α-1 on the Efficacy of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Immunotherpay Consolidation for Locally Advanced NSCLC
This prospective phase II randomized study is to determine the impact of thymosin alpha-1 on the concurrent chemoradiotherpay followed by immunotherapy consolidation in patients with locally advanced NSCLC by assessing the survival outcomes, treatment responses and toxicities.

This prospective phase II randomized study is to determine the impact of thymosin alpha-1 on the concurrent chemoradiotherpay followed by immunotherapy consolidation in patients with locally advanced NSCLC by assessing the survival outcomes, treatment responses and toxicities.

Patients with locally advanced NSCLC who will receive concurrent radiochemotherapy followed by immunotherapy consolidation will be randomly divided into two groups (concurrent Tα1 treatment group and control group \[in which Tα1 will not be used\]), and the overall survivals, progression-free survivals (PFS), completion rate of immunotherapy consolidation, toxicities/adverse effects, and peripheral blood immune biomarkers will be compared between these two groups.
