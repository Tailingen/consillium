Convertases and Pancreatic Cancer: Cohort of Patients Treated for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This is a prospective, single-centre, observational study. The analysis of samples of pancreatic tumours and/or metastases taken during biopsy or surgery will lead to the determination of the level of expression of convertases in patients with pancreatic cancer and could be used as an additional prognostic means reinforcing those currently used.
Pancreas Cancer
OTHER: Blood sample
Correlation coefficients between level of expression of various convertases on the tumor and immune infiltrate, The level of expression of convertase proteins and their substrates (VEGF-C, IGF-1) will be determined on tumor samples at inclusion (healthy tissues, primary cancers and metastases), using qRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA, FACs and/or immunofluorescence as methodology and will be correlated with the following immune parameters, determined by immunofluorescence (including but not limited to): CD8, CD4, NK,Tregs, Macrophages

The analysis will assess the correlation between the expression of various convertases on the tumor and immune parameters using Pearson's correlation coefficient for normally distributed variables, or Spearman's correlation coefficient for non-normally distributed variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1: a value closer to 1 indicates a strong positive association, a value closer to -1 indicates a strong negative association, and a value closer to 0 indicates no association., Inclusion, Day 1
Correlation coefficients between level of expression of various convertases determined at plasma level and immune infiltrate, The level of expression of convertase proteins will be determined at plasma level at inclusion, using qRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA, FACs and/or immunofluorescence as methodology and will be correlated with the following immune parameters, determined by immunofluorescence (including but not limited to): CD8, CD4, NK,Tregs, Macrophages.

After checking the inclusion criteria and signing the consent form, patients will be pre-selected for the study.

A tumour sample (primary tumour or metastasis) will be taken either during a biopsy or during pancreatic or metastasis surgery.

A blood sample will be taken on the same day as the tumour sample. The inclusion visit will be carried out by the investigating physician and will correspond to the visit when the results of the biopsy or surgery are reported.

Inclusion of the patient will be possible if the tumour sample has been taken, is available, contributory and malignant (diagnosis or confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma) and if the blood sample has been taken and is available.

The patient will be considered to have failed pre-selection if

* the tumour sample has not been taken or is not available, or
* the tumour sample/histological result is non-contributory, or
* the histological result is benign, or
* the blood sample was not taken or is not available, or
* the patient refuses to continue the study, or
* the patient has withdrawn consent, or
* any other reason preventing inclusion of the patient. Included patients will be treated and followed as usual, with standard radiological follow-up.

For two years after inclusion, the tumour status (first progression) and vital status of the patient (alive, dead or lost to follow-up at the date of the visit) will be collected.
