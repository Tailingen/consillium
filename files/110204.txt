Comparing the Diagnostic Role of PET/MRI and of PET/CT Among Patients With Gastric Cancer
The results of PET/MRI and PET/CT in each recruited gastric cancer patients will be compared.
Gastric Cancer Stage
DEVICE: PET/MRI|DEVICE: PET/CT
The results of the PET/MRI and PET/CT examination, Two experienced radiologists independently assess the TNM staging of gastric cancer using preoperative PET/MRI and PET/CT images, 3 days
Histopathological diagnosis, including definitely T stage in Tx, number of regional lymph node metastasis,result of histologic subtypes of carcinoma,result of other cytological examination., 5 days|Results of CT/Endoscopic ultrasound(EUS) image, Experienced radiologists assess definitely T stage in Tx, number of regional lymph node metastasis,with or without distant metastasis., 3 days|Numerical values of Standard uptake value(SUV), Standard uptake value(SUV) is defined as the ratio of the image derived radioactivity concentration and the whole body concentration of the injected radioactivity., 3 days|Apparent Diffusion Coefficient(ADC), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient(ADC) will be measured using a curved Placement of region of interest(ROI) to include the high signal and be read out on ADC maps by Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI or DW-MRI) analysis software., 3 days|The expression level of Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2(HER2), Acquire from pathology results, 5 days|The expression level of Receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGFR), Acquire from pathology results, 5 days|Follow-up data, results of conventional imaging examination and tumor biomarkers examination., at lest 6 months
A prospective comparison of PET/MRI and PET/CT for gastric cancer will be performed,to evaluate the value of PET/MRI in predicting the preoperative staging and resectability of gastric cancer and investigate the role of PET/MRI in gastric cancer diagnosis.The evaluation parameters are the diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancer staging( including the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
