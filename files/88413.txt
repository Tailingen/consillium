Phase II of High-dose Therapy in Elderly Patients With Relapsed Aggressive NHL or Resistant to First Line Therapy
A phase II prospective, non-randomized study. The study aim is to evaluate the feasibility and activity of high-dose therapy with stem cell in elderly patients with aggressive lymphoma relapsed FIT or resistant to first line therapy.
