Phase II RAINSPOT: Zolbetuximab-Paclitaxel-Ramucirumab for CLDN18.2 Positive Gastro-esophageal Cancer
This study examines whether adding the drug Zolbetuximab to an existing treatment (Paclitaxel and Ramucirumab) can improve patients' survival. The goal is to see if this combination works better for patients whose tumours contain a specific protein (CLDN18.2). The results will be compared to past patient data from those who only received the standard treatment.

Zolbetuximab (Vyloy) is a cancer medicine that is used to treat adults with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer of the stomach or the transition between the stomach and esophagus). Zolbetuximab will be administered via an intravenous infusion in combination with Paclitaxel and Ramucirumab (Cyramza) (two other cancer drugs that are the standard treatment for this condition). Treatment will take place at regular intervals in the hospital. In addition to treatment,patients will undergo a tumour biopsy. While the biopsy procedure may cause some discomfort or pain, it will only be performed if medically justifiable. Patients participation in the study will continue as long as they receive treatment and the disease does not worsen. The overall duration of the study, for all patients, will span several years.

DRUG: zolbetuximab|OTHER: Retrospective cohort, no intervention
OS (overall survival), The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of Zolbetuximab plus Paclitaxel-Ramucirumab on survival in CLDN18.2 positive patients that were previously treated in first line but unexposed to Zolbetuximab or other anti CLDN18.2 targeted therapy., From enrollment to the last FU visit of the patient (2 years)
PFS (progression free survival), PFS, which is defined as the time from the date of signature of informed consent until the date of radiological PD (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is earliest. Patients unprogressed at time of discontinuation for other causes, starting a subsequent line of treatment will be censored for progression at the start of this subsequent treatment., From enrollment till last FU visit of patient (2 years). Data will be reported at the final study report (max 3 years from study start).]|Safety analysis, Safety analysis. Frequency and severity of treatment emergent AEs, SAEs, irAEs.
