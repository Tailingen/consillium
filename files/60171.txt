Relacorilant in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in Advanced, Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian-Tube Cancer
This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate efficacy and safety of intermittent dosing of relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Neoplasms
DRUG: Relacorilant 150 mg once daily (QD)|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2|DRUG: Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To evaluate PFS as the time from enrollment until first documented progressive disease (PD) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as determined by the Investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Date of first dose until PD or death, up to 18 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the proportion of patients with measurable disease at Baseline who attain complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST version 1.1., Date of first dose until PD or death, up to 18 months|Duration of Response (DOR), To evaluate DOR as the time from the first CR or PR to first documented PD or death, whichever comes first., Time of first objective response until PD or death, up to 18 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), To evaluate clinical benefit rate as the proportion of patients who attain CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) at Week 24 as per RECIST version 1.1., Week 24|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the probability of OS survival at 6, 12, and 18 months., Date of first dose up to 6, 12, and 18 months|Number of patients with one or more adverse events, Date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose
Study treatment will be comprised of relacorilant, combined with nab-paclitaxel, and bevacizumab and will begin on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). Each patient will receive relacorilant 150 mg administered orally under fed conditions, once daily for 3 consecutive days on the day before, the day of, and the day after nab-paclitaxel infusion, in combination with nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m\^2 intravenous \[IV\]) administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV once every 2 weeks \[Q2W\]) will be administered on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients will receive study treatment until they reach progressive disease, experience unmanageable toxicity, or until other discontinuation criteria are met. Patients will be monitored for treatment efficacy, safety, and tolerability.
