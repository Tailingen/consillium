A Study of Raludotatug Deruxtecan in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors (REJOICE-PanTumor01)
This pan-tumor trial is designed as a signal-seeking trial to assess efficacy and safety of raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd) monotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with various cadherin-6 (CDH6) expression levels, including gynecological cancers (endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, and non-high-grade serous ovarian cancer) and genitourinary cancers (urothelial cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma \[ccRCC\]).
Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: Raludotatug deruxtecan
Objective Response Rate as Assessed by the Investigator (All Cohorts Except ccRCC), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., Baseline up to 32 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by the Investigator (ccRCC Cohort Only), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as proportion of participants who achieved a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (maintained for ≥5 weeks) according to RECIST version 1.1., Baseline up to 32 months|Number of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) (All Cohorts), Baseline up to 32 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval from the start date of trial intervention to the date of radiographic disease progression according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Baseline up to 32 months|Duration of Response (DoR) as Assessed by the Investigator, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed to the date of the first documentation of radiographic disease progression according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to 32 months|Time to Response (TTR) as Assessed by the Investigator, Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the start date of trial intervention to the date of the first documentation of response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed. TTR will be calculated for confirmed responders only., Baseline up to 32 months|Objective Response Rate as Assessed by the Investigator (ccRCC Cohort Only), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., Baseline up to 32 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by the Investigator (All Cohorts Except ccRCC Cohort), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as proportion of participants who achieved a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (maintained for ≥5 weeks) according to RECIST version 1.1., Baseline up to 32 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of R-DXd, Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1 predose and end of infusion (EOI), 3 hours (hr), and 5 hr postdose; Cycle 1 Days 8, 15, and 22; Cycle 2 Day 1 predose and EOI postdose; Cycle 4 (and every 2 cycles thereafter) predose, up to 32 months (each cycle is 21 days)|The Number of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive At Any Time and Who Have a Treatment-emergent ADA, Baseline up to 32 months
This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R-DXd in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with various CDH6 expression levels. Solid tumor types will include gynecological cancers (endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, and non-high-grade serous ovarian cancer) and genitourinary cancers (urothelial cancer and ccRCC).

For all cohorts except ccRCC, the primary endpoint will be objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1. For the ccRCC cohort, the primary endpoint will be disease control rate (DCR) by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1. All cohorts will also have the assessment of safety and tolerability as another primary objective.
