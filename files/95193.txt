Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations Therapy as First Line for Inoperable Lung Cancer Via IT
This trial is designed to investigate the safety, response rates and survival outcomes of patients with inoperable lung cancer by infusion of CTLA4, PD1 and PDL1 antibodies combination with chemodrug or/and bevacizumab through intra-tumor (IT).
Lung Cancer|Inoperable Disease
DRUG: ipilimumab+pembrolizumab or ipilimumab+durvalumab, idarubicin, bevacizumab
Safety of IT delivery of drugs combination treatment, Safety will be assessed by recording all types of advise effects upon and after the treatment., 5 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the first date of study treatment until documented disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For patients who remain alive without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment., 5 years|Disease control rate, Disease control rate will be defined as objective response rate + steady disease rate., 5 years|Duration of remission (DOR), DOR will be defined as the duration of the cancer remission., 5 years
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the enrollment to death from any cause. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact (or last date known to be alive). Follow-up for OS will occur every 12 weeks (Â±1 month) until death or withdrawal of consent from the study., 5 years
Antibodies against CTLA4, PD1 and PDL1 are representative drugs for the check-points inhibitory agents, and their clinical indications have been approved in various types of tumors, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and late recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, et al. Those drugs are regularly systemically administrated by vein infusion, however, local delivery of those drugs via interventional radiology technique including trans-artery or intra-tumor injection may increase the local drug concentration of the tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions. CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab has been widely effectively using to combine with PD1 or PDL1 antibody and this study is to combine ipilimumab and PD1 antibody or PDL1 antibody, so called double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy, as first line for inoperable lung cancer via intra-tumor admistration. To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the safety, efficacy and survival benefit of the double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy for cancer patients as first line via intra-tumor delivery.

This phase II clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and survival benefit of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab or durvalumab combination with or without chemodrug or bevacizumab as first line therapy on patients with inoperable lung cancer, including PFS, ORR, DCR, and median survival time.
