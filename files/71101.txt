CART-19 for Multiple Myeloma
The primary goals: determine the safety, tolerability and engraftment potential of CART-19 T cells in patients undergoing salvage ASCT after early relapse following first ASCT. CART-19 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR(zeta):41BB administered by intravenous infusion using a single infusion of 1-5x108 CART19-transduced T cells on day +2 after autologous stem cell infusion following high-dose melphalan.
