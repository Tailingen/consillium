Neo-MASCT Immunotherapy for Advanced NSCLC.
Neoantigen （Neo）is a new targets for immune cells，that the DC neoantigen immunotherapy was more effective in triggering specific T-cell responses. Neo-MASCT using the DC vaccine and neoantigen T cells .Dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood，and be loaded with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly re-infused.

The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of Neo-MASCT in patients with advanced NSCLC.
NSCLC Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: Neo-MASCT
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, The incidence of treatment-related adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03, 1 to 2 years
Clinical response of treatment according to RESIST v1.1 criteria, Objective Response Rate (ORR), 1 to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) based on RESIST v1.1 criteria., Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., 1 to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) based on RESIST v1.1 criteria., The length of time from enrollment until the time of progression of disease, From enrollment to progression of disease. Estimated about 6 months|Overall Survival (OS) based on RESIST v1.1 criteria., The length of time from enrollment until the time to death, From enrollment to death of patients|Elispot report, The relationship between clinical efficacy and antigen specific immune response, 1 to 2 years
This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples, and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase.

20 failed standard treatment patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC will be recruited .
