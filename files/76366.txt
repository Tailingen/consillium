[18F]FAPI PET/CT in Suspicious Focal Liver Lesions Without FDG Avidity
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease that belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) family located in fbroblast membranes. FAP is overexpressed in the cancer-associated fbroblasts (CAFs) of 90% of epithelial carcinomas, including primary and metastatic liver cancer. We aim to conduct a prospective study to investigate the diagnostic perfoemance of 18F-FAPI PET/CT in evaluating suspicious liver mass without FDG avidity.

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease that belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) family located in fbroblast membranes. FAP is overexpressed in the cancer-associated fbroblasts (CAFs) of 90% of epithelial carcinomas, including primary and metastatic liver cancer. Therefore, FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals can be considered a promising approach for visualizing CAFs. CAFs are crucial components of the tumor stroma, promote the growth of cancer cells, and are associated with poor prognosis. Currently, 18F-labelled fbroblast activation protein inhibitor 18F-FAPI has shown promising diagnostic value in many types of tumors, especially those in which are not avid for 18F-FDF , and several studies have demonstrated that 18F-FAPI PET/CT is superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting liver cancer and has lower tracer uptake in normal liver tissue. We aim to conduct a prospective study to investigate the diagnostic performance of 18F-FAPI PET/CT in evaluating suspicious liver mass without FDG avidity.
