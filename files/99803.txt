CMP-001 for Relapsed and Refractory Lymphoma
This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase I/II trial designed to find a CMP-001 dose that, in combination with pembrolizumab, has optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity for patients with relapsed and refractory lymphomas.
Lymphoma
DRUG: CMP-001|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose limiting toxicities using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, To examine the toxicity related to the therapy by measuring the number of treatment related adverse events in patients, From the start of treatment up to two years|Objective response rate with statistical analysis based on the EffTox method, The primary statistical analysis is based on the EffTox method of Thall and Cook (Thall and Cook 2004 \[1\], Thall, et al 2014 \[2\]). An adaptive escalation schema is used to find a dose with optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity. The design has a minimum sample size of 3 patients and a maximum of 39., From the start of treatment up to two years
This is a single center, open-label, combined Phase I/II clinical study of intratumoral administration of CMP-001 and intravenous administration of pembrolizumab in selected participants with lymphoma. The key study objective is to find a CMP-001 dose that in combination with pembrolizumab has optimal clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Dose-finding will be performed with an adaptive clinical trial design. Secondary study objectives include characterization of safety, pharmacodynamics, and assessment of anti-lymphoma activity.
