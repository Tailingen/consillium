Cold Dissection Versus Electrocautery Dissection in Endoscopic Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy and Immediate Implant-Based Reconstruction: A Randomized Controlled Trial
The purpose of this study is to analyze whether cold dissection can decrease the rate of ischemia necrosis and other complications and then increase the aesthetic outcomes compared to electrocautery. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether cold dissection can decrease the rate of ischemia necrosis and other complications and then increase the aesthetic outcomes compared to electrocautery.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Cold dissection|PROCEDURE: Electrocautery Dissection
Necrosis complications within one month post operation, Necrosis complications included nipple-areolar complex (NAC) and skin flap necrosis. NAC/skin flap necrosis could present as minor superficial epidermolysis requiring local wound care only, or full-thickness necrosis with any exposure of acellular dermal matrix, muscle, implant, or with full-thickness eschar that required surgical reoperation of debridement and repair., Within one month post operation
Necrotic complications within 1 year post operation, Within 1 year post operation|Surgical-site infection rate(SSI), the incidence of surgical-site infection will be compared between two groups, within one year post operation|The incidence of postoperative complications, the incidence of seroma, hematoma, blister, implant capsular contracture, and implant loss will be compared between two groups, within one year post operation|Cosmetic outcomes evaluated by 5-point Likert Scale, Evaluated by patients and five surgeons. In this scale, breast fullness; nipple-areola complex, shape, and contour; scar appearance, size, and fullness; and overall breast appearance will be assessed., Evaluated pre-operation, at the first month, at 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.|Patient-reported outcomes (as measured using the BREAST-Q score), The modules included Satisfaction with Breasts, Psychosocial Wellbeing, Sexual Wellbeing, and Physical Wellbeing Chest, Surgeon, Medical Staff, Office Staff., Evaluated pre-operation, at the first month, at 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.|Postoperative pain, Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale(VAS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain., Evaluated at the first day, second day, third day and the first week, second week.|Total operation time, Defined as the time calculated from the skin incision to the end of wound closure, Immediate post operation|Intraoperative estimated blood loss, Blood loss (ml) during operation was compared between groups, Immediate post operation|Drain volume, Total drain volume(ml) within three days post operation, within three days post operation|Duration of hospital stay post operation, Duration of hospital stay post operation(d) will be compared between two group., Within 2 weeks of operation.|Weight of the excised gland, Mean mastectomy weight of patients will be compared between two groups., Immediate post operation|Size of implant, Size of implant will be compared between two groups., Immediate post operation
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the world. Although breast-conserving surgery is a viable option for patients, mastectomy remains the choice of treatment. Despite oncologic and surgical safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy(NSM) with immediate breast reconstruction(IBR) were amply demonstrated, a number of acute and late complications can occur. Surgical technique may play a role in the postoperative outcomes of mastectomy skin flap.Previous studies suggest that cold dissection with scissors or scalpel, may lead to decreasing blood loss and rates of skin necrosis, compared to electrocautery. A retrospective study by Troy Ng demonstrated that the use of cold dissection is likely to decrease the rate of partial-thickness necrosis (13.0%→33.3%, p=0.01) and full-thickness necrosis (1.3%→12.8%, p=0.02). The purpose of this study is to analyze whether cold dissection can decrease the rate of ischemia necrosis and other complications and then increase the aesthetic outcomes compared to electrocautery.
