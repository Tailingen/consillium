Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that adaptive radiotherapy (ART) in head and neck cancer patients are comparable to historical controls in head and neck patients undergoing standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) without ART.

Number of patients with locoregional recurrence-free interval, This is assessed by imaging studies and/or physical exams at follow- up visits. This will include a diagnostic FDG PET/CT scan. CT and/or MRI of the primary site and neck will also be recommended. Patients will be classified as locoregional recurrence-free as long as there is no evidence of locoregional recurrence of disease by clinical evaluation, CT, MRI, and/or PET-CT according to the standard of care. For patients achieving complete response of disease, no further imaging study is necessary., 2 years
