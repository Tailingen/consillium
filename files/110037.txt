Early Salpingectomy (Tubectomy) With Delayed Oophorectomy in BRCA1/2 Gene Mutation Carriers
The purpose of this study is to determine whether an innovative preventive strategy, consisting of early salpingectomy upon completion of childbearing with delayed oophorectomy beyond current guideline age, improves menopause-related quality of life without significantly increasing ovarian cancer incidence in comparison to current standard salpingo-oophorectomy in female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
