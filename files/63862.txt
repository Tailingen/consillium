Phase I/II Study of SY-5007, a RET Inhibitor, in Patients With RET-altered Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SY-5007 administered orally to participants with advanced solid tumors, including RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC or RET-mutated MTC or other RET-altered advanced solid tumor.

The study consists of 2 parts:

Part 1: Dose-escalation and dose-expansion in patients with RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC or RET-mutated MTC or other RET-altered advanced solid tumor. Dose-escalation study phase is designed to determine the DLTs (Dose-limiting toxicity) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SY-5007. Dose-expansion study phase is designed to evaluate the antitumor activity (ORR, DCR and DoR) of SY-5007 in patients.

Part 2: Phase II study to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of SY-5007. Patients with advanced RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC will be enrolled in this phase. SY-5007 will be administered orally 160mg twice daily in a 28-day cycle. This phase is designed to determine the antitumor activity (ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS and OS), safety, and PK of SY-5007.
