A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Effect of the GEN1053 Antibody on Malignant Solid Tumors as Monotherapy
The drug that will be investigated in the study is GEN1053. GEN1053 is an antibody designed to (re)activate and increase antitumor immunity.

Since this is the first study of GEN1053 in humans, the main purpose is to evaluate safety. Besides safety, the study will determine the recommended GEN1053 dose to be tested in a larger group of participants and assess preliminary clinical activity of GEN1053.

GEN1053 will be studied in a broad group of cancer patients, having different kinds of solid tumors. All participants will get GEN1053. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 tests increasing doses of GEN1053 ("escalation"), followed by Part 2 which tests the recommended phase 2 dose GEN1053 dose from Part 1 ("expansion").

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The occurrence of any of the following toxicities, assessed as related to trial treatment, were considered DLTs: All Grade 5 events, Grade 4 anaphylaxis, infusion-related reactions and neutropenia for ≥7 days, Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, Grade 4 anemia, Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or bilirubin elevation/Grade 3 that did not recover to ≤Grade 1 within 14 days, AST or ALT elevations ≥Grade 2 with concomitant bilirubin \>2.0×upper limit of normal with no signs of cholestasis, any Grade 4 immune-related adverse event (irAE), Grade 3 irAEs that did not improve to ≤Grade 1 within 7 days (with exceptions), Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Grade 3 CRS not resolved to ≤Grade 2 within 48 hrs following adequate intervention, any other ≥Grade 3 nonhematological adverse event (AE) during the first GEN1053 treatment cycle (with exceptions), cycle=3 weeks., Day 1 up to Day 21|Number of Participants With At Least One Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE was therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal safety laboratory parameter finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A TEAE was defined as an AE occurring or worsening after first dose. A summary of all Serious Adverse Events and Other Adverse Events (nonserious) regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported Adverse Events' Section., Up to approximately 1.5 years
Clearance (CL) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Volume of Distribution (Vz) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Maximum (Peak) Concentration (Cmax) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Time to Maximum (Peak) Concentration (Tmax) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Predose Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Measurement (AUClast) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|AUC From Time Zero Over the Dosing Interval (AUCtau) of GEN1053, Venous blood samples were collected for analyzing concentrations of GEN1053., Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycles were 3 weeks)|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to GEN1053, Venous blood samples were drawn for analysis of ADAs in serum samples., Cycle 1 Day 1 through end of safety follow up (60 days after last dose [cycles were 3 weeks]), up to approximately 1.5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the number of participants with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) (ie, "responders"), as per local review and according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as all of the following: disappearance of all target and non-target tumor lesions, and reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm) in all pathological target and non-target lymph nodes, and normalization of tumor marker level (if applicable). PR was defined as ≥30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Data are presented for the number of participants with ORR., Up to approximately 1.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the number of participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR was defined as all of the following: disappearance of all target and non-target tumor lesions, and reduction in short axis to \<10 mm in all pathological target and non-target lymph nodes, and normalization of tumor marker level (if applicable). PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters (nadir) while on study. Data are presented for the number of participants with DCR., Up to approximately 1.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first PD or death due to any cause in participants whose confirmed BOR was CR or PR., Up to approximately 1.5 years
The trial is a First in Human open-label, multicenter, multinational safety trial in participants with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) metastatic or advanced malignant solid tumors for whom there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, evaluating the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of GEN1053.

The trial will be conducted as follows:

* The Dose Escalation part (Part 1) will explore the safety of escalating doses of GEN1053 as monotherapy (phase 1)
* The Expansion part (Part 2) is planned to provide additional safety and initial antitumor activity information of the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GEN1053 monotherapy in selected tumor indications, as well as more detailed data related to the mode of action (MoA).
