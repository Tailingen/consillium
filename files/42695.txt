Indocyanine Green and Portal Pressure in Viral and Alcoholic Cirrhotic Patients With Hepatocarcinoma
The aim of the investigators' study is to elucidate the relationship between a functional liver test (e.g., ICG) and the PREOPERATIVE value of portal hypertension in the patients with impaired liver function from alcoholic and non-alcoholic aetiologies. Alcoholic and viral cirrhosis present important differences in terms of cellular mechanisms responsible for the disease progression with a distinct and unique gene expression pattern that regulates the type of inflammatory response. These differences probably influence the hepatic functional reserve and the onset of portal hypertension at a comparable clinical and biological level of derangement and the investigators may expect significant differences in the recovery from hepatectomy.

The investigators' hypothesis is that at a comparable ICGR-15 rate non-viral cirrhotic liver presents higher portal pressure values and the investigators also argue that alcoholic cirrhotic patients would tolerate a larger hepatic resection than would viral cirrhotic do.
