Study of BKM120 in Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
This study is to evaluate disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of BKM120 administered as therapy for patient with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Head Neck Cancer Squamous Cell Metastatic|Head Neck Cancer Squamous Cell Recurrent
DRUG: BKM120
Disease control rate at 8 weeks, The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of randomized patients achieving a best overall response of PR or CR or SD, defined by RECIST criteria (version 1.1), relative to the total number of patients in the considered analysis population (ITT)., Eight weeks after administration of the drug
Overall response rate (ORR), Overall objective response rate (ORR) is the best response rate stipulated as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (target lesion and tumor response defined according to RECIST guideline version 1.1) and identified as percentage of the confirmed patients., Every 8 weeks from date of first treatment until date of last treatment up to 24 months|Toxicity profile, From C1D1 to 1 months after the last dose adminitration

Overall safety profile verified as relevance of adverse events and laboratory abnormality in the study and grades granted based on (USA National Cancer Center) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events such as the type, frequency and severity (CTCAE), v4.0., Every 4 weeks from date of first treatment until date of last treatment up to 24 months|Overall survival, From C1D1 to death, Every 8 weeks from date of first treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed approximately up to 24 months|Progression-free survival, From C1D1 until confirmed disease progression or death, Every 8 weeks from date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed approximately up to 24 months|Quality of life assessment, Quality of life assessment will be performed using FACT-HN\& questionnaire

FACT-H\&N questionnaire includes physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and head \& neck cancer subscale (HNCS).

Patients will be evaluation on baseline, day 1 of every cycle (4 weeks), and end of treatment., Every 4 weeks from date of first treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed approximately up to 24 months|Time to progression (TTP), From C1D1 until confirmed disease progression., Every 8 weeks from date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression, assessed approximately up to 24 months
One promising approach to the treatment of cancer is inhibition or modulating the crucial signal transduction pathway of PI3K-Akt-mTOR. Several PI3K inhibitors are being tested in the clinical trials for cancer treatment but not for the head and neck cancer yet. BKM120 is a specific Pan-class I PI3K inhibitor. We suggest multicenter single arm phase II study to determine anti-tumor effects of BKM120 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who failed to prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.
