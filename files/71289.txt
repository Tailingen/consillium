Text -Based Depression Screening Among Cancer Survivors
Depression is common among cancer survivors, but current screening methods are not always effective. To help improve depression screening for cancer survivors, this study will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60 participants. The goal is to evaluate whether a text message-based approach to depression screening is feasible, acceptable, and potentially more effective than the current standard of care.

Study Feasibility, \>/= 1 response to a text message, 2 weeks after randomization
Acceptability, acceptability will be rated on a likert scale form 0-5 with higher scores representing greater acceptability, 2 weeks|Depression screening, completion of PHQ-2 (Y/N), 2 weeks|PHQ-2 score, The PHQ-2 is a validated 2-item measure of depression screening that is widely used among patients with cancer. The PHQ-2 score ranges from 0 to 6. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms; a PHQ-2 score of ≥ 3 is considered a positive screening., 2 weeks|PHQ-9 score, Participants who screen positive for elevated depressive symptoms on the PHQ-2 (i.e, \> 3) will complete the PHQ-9, a validated 9-item measure of depression. The PHQ-9 has high sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals with depressive symptoms, particularly among cancer survivors. The PHQ-9 score ranges from 0 to 27; higher scores represent more severe depressive symptoms. A PHQ-9 score of ≥ 8 indicates clinically significant elevated depressive symptoms among patients with cancer., 2 weeks
This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a text message-based depression screening approach for cancer survivors. A total of 60 adult cancer survivors will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either the text message intervention or the usual care depression screening. The intervention involves sending text messages one week before scheduled oncology appointments, inviting participants to complete a depression screening using the PHQ-2, followed by the PHQ-9 for those who screen positive.

The study will assess the feasibility of implementing text message-based screenings, participant acceptability, and compare the efficacy of this method to traditional in-person depression screenings during clinical visits. The primary outcome is feasibility, measured by the proportion of participants completing the screening via text, while secondary outcomes will include acceptability (assessed through participant surveys) and preliminary efficacy (measured by screening completion rates and depression detection).

Eligible participants will be English-speaking cancer survivors aged 18 or older with an upcoming oncology appointment at the Hollings Cancer Center or associated clinics. The study aims to improve current depression screening methods and address challenges such as logistical and system-level barriers in screening cancer survivors for depression.
