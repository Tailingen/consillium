Study to Assess the Blood Levels and Safety of Olaparib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours and Normal or Impaired Kidney Function
This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the PK of olaparib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function; Part B will allow eligible study patients continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.
Solid Tumours
