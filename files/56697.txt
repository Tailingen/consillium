A Clinical Trial to Evaluate a Melanoma Helper Peptide Vaccine Plus Dabrafenib and Trametinib
This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a helper peptide vaccine with BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor therapy. This study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide vaccine and BRAF inhibitors/MEK inhibitors on the immune system. We will monitor these effects by performing tests in the laboratory on participants' blood and tumor samples.
