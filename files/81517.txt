Pathologic Complete Response Rate, The Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate is defined as the number of pathologic complete responders among all patients evaluable for response, including evaluable patients who did not proceed to surgery. A pCR is defined as the absence of any residual abnormality detected in a pathological specimen., Between days 57 and 98 after preoperative chemotherapy
Overall Survival, Measured from date of first protocol treatment until date of death., Every 3 months (±1 month) following documented progression, up to 5 years or death, whichever comes first.|Overall Survival Probability at 6 and 12 Months, The probability of overall survival at 6 months and 12 months from date of first protocol treatment until date of death., up to 1 year|Sphincter Preservation Rate, The percentage of patients who had Low Anterior Resection during surgery.., Between days 57 and 98 after preoperative chemotherapy.|Disease-Free Survival, Patients without evidence of progression will be followed every 3 months (±1 month) from date of last dose of study drug during Years 1-2, every 6 months during Years 3-4, and annually thereafter or until disease progression, estimated 5 years.|Disease Free Survival Probability at 6 and 12 Months, The probability of disease free survival at 6 and 12 months after initiating protocol treatment., Up to 1 year|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Serious or Non-Serious Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety., Adverse events and serious adverse events (AEs and SAEs) were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Technology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0. Specific AE and SAE terms are provided in the Adverse Event module., weekly for 6 weeks pre-op then every 2 weeks post-op, approximately 36 weeks
