A Study to Treat Small Cell Lung Cancer With a Combination of Cisplatin, Pemetrexed, and Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of pemetrexed, cisplatin and radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer|Carcinoma, Small Cell|SCLC
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: radiation
Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose, every cycle|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants having either a Complete or Partial response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., baseline to measured progressive disease
Phase 1: Best Overall Response, Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to measured response|Phase 2: Complete Response Rate, Complete Response Rate was defined as the proportion of participants having a Complete Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions., baseline to measured response time|Phase 2: Time to Progressive Disease, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., baseline to measured progressive disease|Phase 2: Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., time of response to progressive disease|Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival was the duration from enrollment to death. For patients who were alive, overall survival was censored at the last contact., baseline to date of death from any cause
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of pemetrexed, cisplatin and radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer.
