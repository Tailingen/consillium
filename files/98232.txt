Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) With Treosulfan, VP-16 and Cyclophosphamid for Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
The present study is a multicenter, prospective phase II-study investigating the combination of treosulfan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide as conditioning regimen for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are not eligible for a TBI-containing regimen.

PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Evaluation of engraftment at day +28 and non-relapse mortality at day +100 and at 1 year after SCT, 1 year after SCT
*Incidence of aGvHD on day +100/ cGvHD at 1 and 2 yrs after SCT/ relapse at 2 yrs after SCT *Toxicity *Disease-free survival at 2 yrs after SCT *overall survival at 2 yrs. after SCT, 2 years after transplantation
