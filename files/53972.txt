Preoperative Biliary Drainage in Resectable Pancreatic or Periampullary Cancer
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that preoperative biliary drainage using self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) does not negatively impact overall surgical outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancer.
