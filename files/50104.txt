FIRST-NEC (GFPC 01-2022) - Combination of Durvalumab With Etoposide and Platinum
The primary objective is to determine the efficacy (Progression-Free Rate at 12 months) of durvalumab combined with etoposide and platinum (either cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced LCNEC confirmed by centralized expert-pathologist review
Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung
DRUG: Durvalumab with etoposide and Carboplatin/Cisplatin
the efficacy (Progression-Free Rate at 12 months) of durvalumab combined with etoposide and platinum (either cisplatin or carboplatin) for the 1st-line treatment of patients with advanced LCNEC confirmed by centralized expert-pathologist review., The Progression-Free Rate at 12 months (12M-PFR) will be defined as the percentage of patients with a LCNEC confirmed by centralized expert-pathologist review and presenting a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR) or a stable disease (SD) 12 months after the date of treatment start, as per the independent central radiological review committee, 12 months
12-week Objective Response Rate (ORR), proportion of patients with a LCNEC confirmed by centralized expert-pathologist review with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 12 weeks after the date of treatment start, 12 weeks|12-week Disease Control Rate, proportion of patients with a LCNEC confirmed by centralized expert-pathologist review with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD), 12 weeks after the date of treatment start, 12 weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of first documented disease progression (reviewed centrally) or the date of death from any cause. Patients without event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment., From date of the first study treatment administration until the date of first documented radiological progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 63 months|Overall Survival, time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death from any cause. Patients still alive at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time they are known to be alive, from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 63 months|Safety profile : description of treatment-emergent Adverse Events, All adverse events (AE), all serious adverse events, all immune mediated AE and all Adverse Events of Special Interest will be described using the NCI-CTC version 5.0, 27 months and 90 days
Treatment effectiveness of the experimental combination compared to an external control arm, PFS and OS will be compared between experimental arm (durvalumab with platinum-etoposide) and an external control arm from the ESME-AMLC real-world database. This comparison will be performed through combined statistical approach using the emulation of a target trial associated with appropriate statistical adjustment techniques to control for confounding biases and thereby reach causal inference capability. The emulation process will consist of outlining key elements of this target trial protocol and then applying them to the ESME data., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 63 months|Histopathological diagnosis concordance rate, The proportion of patients with a histopathological diagnosis confirmed by central review will be described. The proportion of patients with a histopathological diagnosis confirmed by central review will be described., Through central histopathological completion, an average of 6 weeks|12-week Objective Response Rate as a predictive and prognostic factors, The 12W-ORR will be studied as predictive (12M-PFR and ORR) and prognostic factors (OS) of efficacy, 12 weeks|Overall Survival in the whole study population, Overall study as usually published in other studies (in which the diagnosis is not confirmed)., From the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 63 months|PD-L1 expression as a predictive and prognostic biomarker, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs), will be studied as predictive (12M-PFR and ORR) and prognostic factors (OS) of efficacy., From the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 63 months|Retinoblastoma-1-gene (Rb1) mutation as a predictive and prognostic biomarker, Retinoblastoma-1-gene (Rb1) mutation will be studied as predictive (12M-PFR and ORR) and prognostic factors (OS) of efficacy., From the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 63 months
Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) of the lung are lung tumors (2%) included with small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) in the subgroup of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors of high-grade malignancy. Histopathological diagnosis of LCNEC is difficult, with a confirmation rate of only 70-80% after centralized expert-pathologist review. The prognosis of advanced LCNECs is poor, with overall survival (OS) of 8-10 months.

The platinum-based regimen is the current recommended first-line treatment for advanced LCNECs in analogy with that given for SCLCs. The previous pivotal GFPC 03-02 trial demonstrated the efficacy of first-line platinum-etoposide in advanced LCNECs with a median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), OS and 1-year PFS of 5 months, 7.7 months and 15% respectively.

The GFPC 03-2017 trial has recently reported that 75% of the tumor samples of LCNEC express programmed cell death protein-ligand-1 (PD-L1) in immune infiltrating tumor cells (ICs), and PD-L1 expression on ICs has been previously correlated with clinical efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

Numerous retrospective studies have also suggested ICI efficacy against LCNECs with significantly prolonged OS observed in ICI-treated LCNEC patients.

Recently, the prospective NIPINEC study results demonstrated second-line nivolumab-ipilimumab efficacy against LCNECs. Moreover, at ESMO 2022, the NICE-NEC prospective phase II study on LCNECs of digestive origin found an impressive efficacy of first-line triplet platinum-etoposide-ICI with a median OS of 13,9 months, and 44 % of long survivor patients (OS\>18 months).

Finally, the CASPIAN trial demonstrated the superiority of the combination of durvalumab with platinum-etoposide compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with SCLCs, with an acceptable toxicity profile.

Therefore, within the network of GFPC centers, the investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase II study with an external control arm (ESME database), that aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of durvalumab with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with an advanced LCNECs.
