HyperArc Registry Study
The HyperArc registry is designed to collect data from which the efficacy of the HyperArc procedure can be assessed and compared to alternative treatments.

A significant percentage of newly diagnosed cancer patients will develop brain metastases. For many of these patients, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is recommended as a primary treatment option. Concerns about complexity, patient safety, cost, and human resources can make SRS challenging. HyperArc radiotherapy addresses these challenges by introducing key technology and workflow elements to streamline multi-leaf collimator-based, non-coplanar SRS. HyperArc is designed to deliver SRS treatments from the TrueBeam linear accelerator platform. The HyperArc registry is designed to collect data from which the efficacy of the HyperArc procedure can be assessed and compared to alternative treatments.
