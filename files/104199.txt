Accelerating Lung Cancer Diagnosis Through Liquid Biopsy
This study will assess the utility of liquid biopsy to accelerate the time to treatment for patients with newly diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer, compared to the conventional diagnostic pathway of molecular testing of tumour tissue after imaging and biopsy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Liquid Biopsy
Time to treatment, The time to treatment decision (TLB) in the study cohort by liquid (TL) and tissue biopsy (TB) is measured from the date of referral to the earliest date of receiving a liquid or tissue biopsy report indicating actionable genomic aberrations, or TLB = min (TL, TB). The time to treatment decision using tissue biopsy alone (TB) will be collected in a chart-review comparison cohort (patients referred in the previous 12 months that meet the eligibility criteria). The time to treatment decision by liquid biopsy (TLB) vs by tissue biopsy alone (TB) will be compared., Up to 18 Months
Time to treatment - non-smoker subgroup, Measure the time to treatment, using the same parameters as the primary outcome measure, in a subgroup of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC with a smoking history of â‰¤15 pack years., Up to 18 Months|Turnaround time, Calculate the time (in days) from the date of request for testing to the report date for both liquid biopsy and tissue biopsy., Up to 18 Months|Concordance between liquid and tissue, Count the number of actionable targets identified by liquid biopsy and by tissue biopsy, by patient, that were in agreement., Up to 18 Months|Costs of upfront use of liquid biopsy vs standard tissue profiling, A cost-effectiveness model will be developed comparing the initial use of liquid biopsy versus the current standard of tissue biopsy and profiling., Up to 24 Months
