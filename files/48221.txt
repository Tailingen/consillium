The change in the anxiety assessment scale (STAI-State) for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy doing mild exercises and stretches, The STAI-State (Greek version) will be used to assess anxiety levels in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, before and after a brief exercise intervention. At baseline (Time = 0 minutes), participants complete the STAI-State scale. They then engage in a 15-minute mild exercise and stretching program tailored to their physical condition. In some cases, particularly among younger participants, the session may be conducted in small groups of up to 2 individuals. Immediately post-intervention (approximately 20 minutes from baseline), participants complete the STAI-State scale again., Baseline|The change in the anxiety assessment scale (STAI-State) for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy doing mild exercises and stretches, The STAI-State (Greek version) will be used to assess anxiety levels in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, before and after a brief exercise intervention.
