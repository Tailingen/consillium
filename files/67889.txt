Cabazitaxel and Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose, and dose limiting toxicities of cabazitaxel administered as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks in combination with oral daily abiraterone acetate and prednisone in participants with metastatic Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
* To estimate the anti-tumor activity of cabazitaxel in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in terms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate.

Secondary Objectives:

* To characterize the safety profile of the combination
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of cabazitaxel and abiraterone in the proposed combination and dosing schedule
* To assess preliminary antitumor activity of the combination in terms of progression-free survival, PSA progression free survival and objective response rate, and overall survival

Phase 1: Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Cabazitaxel in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate, MTD was defined as highest dose level of cabazitaxel in combination with abiraterone acetate at which no more than 1 participant experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLT). DLT was defined as any of the following events related to study treatment: 1) Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological related adverse event with exception of Grade 3 fever without documented infection; Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in the absence of effective maximal therapy; and Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction in the absence of required premedication. 2) Hematological toxicity: Febrile neutropenia (fever of unknown origin ≥38.5°C with neutropenia Grade 3 or 4); Neutropenia Grade 4 lasting \>7 days; Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 or Grade 3 complicated by hemorrhage. 3) Re-treatment delay of more than 2 weeks due to delayed recovery from a toxicity related to study treatment to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 (except for alopecia). Grades were based on National Cancer Institute CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03., Up to Cycle 2 of Phase 1 (up to 42 days)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as ≥50% decrease from baseline in serum PSA levels, confirmed at least 3 weeks later. Increases of any magnitude during the first 12 weeks were ignored in determining PSA response. PSA was to be measured at baseline, every 3 weeks, throughout study period, until progression. PSA progression was defined as: -An increase of 25% above the nadir (at least 2 ng/mL), confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart, in participants who have achieved a ≥50% decline of PSA. -An increase in PSA by 25 % above the baseline level (at least 2 ng/mL), confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart, in participants who have not achieved a ≥50% decline of PSA., Baseline, every 3 weeks up to PSA progression (maximum duration: 603 days)
Phase 2: Objective Progression Free Survival (PFS), Objective PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of enrollment and the first occurrence of any of the events:

1) Radiological tumor progression (assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] version 1.1) was defined as at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non target-lesions. in case of progressive disease (PD) diagnosed only on non target bone lesions on bone scan, PD was to be considered only in case of appearance of at least 2 new lesions on bone scan confirmed 6 weeks later by another bone scan, and at least the appearance of 2 new additional lesions. 2) Death due to any cause.

Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., From baseline until radiological tumor or disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to Month 5|Phase 2: PSA Progression Free Survival, Prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival was defined as the time interval between the date of treatment start and the date of either first documented PSA progression or death due to any cause, whichever was earlier. PSA was to be measured at baseline, every 3 weeks, throughout study period, until progression. PSA progression was defined as: -An increase of 25% above the nadir (at least 2 ng/mL), confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart, in participants who have achieved a ≥50% decline of PSA. -An increase in PSA by 25 % above the baseline level (at least 2 ng/mL), confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart, in participants who have not achieved a ≥50% decline of PSA.

Analysis was performed by Kaplan Meire method., Baseline, every 3 weeks up to PSA progression (maximum duration: 603 days)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response was defined as having complete response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) assessed by RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions; normalization of tumor marker level and all lymph nodes size was \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters)., Baseline, every 12 weeks there after until disease progression (maximum duration: 603 days)|Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of treatment start to the date of death due to any cause. In absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the earlier of the last date the participant was known to be alive and the study cut-off date. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., From baseline up to death or study cut-off (maximum duration: 603 days)|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Cabazitaxel : Maximum Plasma Concentration Observed (Cmax), 5 minutes before cabazitaxel infusion; at end of cabazitaxel infusion; 0.25 hours post-cabazitaxel infusion; any time between 1 to 4 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, between 48 to 96 hours post cabazitaxel infusion on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Cabazitaxel : Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), Area under the concentration-time curve calculated using the following equation: AUC = Plasma clearance (CL)/dose, 5 minutes before cabazitaxel infusion; at end of cabazitaxel infusion; 0.25 hours post-cabazitaxel infusion; any time between 1 to 4 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, between 48 to 96 hours post cabazitaxel infusion on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Cabazitaxel : Terminal Half-life (t 1/2z), 5 minutes before cabazitaxel infusion; at end of cabazitaxel infusion; 0.25 hours post-cabazitaxel infusion; any time between 1 to 4 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, between 48 to 96 hours post cabazitaxel infusion on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Cabazitaxel : Total Plasma Clearance (CL), 5 minutes before cabazitaxel infusion; at end of cabazitaxel infusion; 0.25 hours post-cabazitaxel infusion; any time between 1 to 4 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, between 48 to 96 hours post cabazitaxel infusion on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Cabazitaxel : Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss), 5 minutes before cabazitaxel infusion; at end of cabazitaxel infusion; 0.25 hours post-cabazitaxel infusion; any time between 1 to 4 hours, between 6 to 24 hours, between 48 to 96 hours post cabazitaxel infusion on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Abiraterone : Maximum Plasma Concentration Observed (Cmax), 0 hour (before abiraterone administration); 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post abiraterone administration on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Abiraterone : First Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax), 0 hour (before abiraterone administration); 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post abiraterone administration on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Abiraterone : Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC 0-24), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated using the trapezoidal method from time zero to 24 hours corresponding to abiraterone acetate dosing interval., 0 hour (before abiraterone administration); 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post abiraterone administration on Day 1-Cycle 1|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetic of Abiraterone : Concentration Observed Just Before Treatment Administration During Repeated Dosing at Steady State (Ctrough ss), Pre abiraterone dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1
