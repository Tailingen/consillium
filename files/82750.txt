Cilengitide Imaging Trial in Glioblastoma
The main purpose of this clinical trial is to find out if cilengitide has an effect on brain tumor cells but also particularly on the blood vessels supplying the tumor with nutrient and oxygen in patients newly diagnosed with non-resectable (inoperable) glioblastoma.

In addition, this clinical trial will investigate if the addition of cilengitide in combination with standard treatment prolongs life in patients with non-resectable glioblastoma. Similarly, the duration of response of the cancer to this treatment and the side effects of the therapy will be analyzed. Furthermore, additional data on how the body deals with this substance will be collected (this is called pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis). In this clinical trial the investigators would also like to learn more about the disease and the response to the experimental medication by measuring certain "markers".

This imaging trial will investigate the biological effects of cilengitide monotherapy on the tumor microvascular function and tumor viability in a homogenous non-pretreated subject population with newly diagnosed Gliobastoma (GBM). The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the effect that cilengitide may have on certain markers of cancer in your tumor and/or blood and to learn if there are any disease-related markers that could help in predicting how subjects respond to the administration of cilengitide.

The investigators anticipate that approximately 30 subjects will participate in this clinical trial. The clinical trial will be conducted in approximately 4 medical centers in the following countries: Germany, Poland, and Switzerland. The investigators anticipate the clinical trial will last until the end of 2013. Your participation in the trial may last up to 86 weeks.
