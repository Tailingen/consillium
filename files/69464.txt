Study of SC-003 Alone and in Combination With ABBV-181 in Subjects With Platinum-Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer
This is a Phase 1a/1b study of SC-003 as a single agent and in combination with ABBV-181 in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. SC-003 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a monoclonal antibody linked to a potent chemotherapy. ABBV-181 is a humanized, recombinant, mAb that binds to cell surface expressed programmed cell death 1 (PD-1).

Phase 1a is a dose escalation study in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed ovarian cancer that are platinum-resistant or refractory. Phase 1b is an expansion study where patients will be enrolled and treated at recommended dose and schedule based on the Phase 1a.
