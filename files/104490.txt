Ibrutinib in Preventing Acute Leukemia in Patients After Reduced-Intensity Conditioning and Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in preventing acute leukemia in patients after reduced-intensity conditioning and stem cell transplant. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Number of Participants With Relapsed Leukemia, Relapsed leukemia is defined as \> 5% leukemic blasts detected in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Participants were also be considered to have relapsed leukemia if they receive any active treatment for progressive leukemia after allogeneic HCT, even if they have \< 5% leukemic blasts. Withdrawal of immunosuppression alone is not considered an active treatment for progressive disease., Up to 18 months
Number of Participants With Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) (Any Grade), Acute GVHD grades II-IV and III-IV was evaluated according to the following criteria.

Stage of Acute GvHD was assessed as follows.

* Stage 1: Skin: rash \< 25% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 2 to 3 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>500 mL/day or upper-gut symptoms with positive histology
* Stage 2: Skin: rash 25 to 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 3 to 6 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>1000 mL/day.
* Stage 3: Skin: rash \> 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 6 to 15 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 1500 mL/day.
* Stage 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma with bulla formation. Liver: bilirubin \> 15 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 2500 mL/day or severe abdominal pain with or without ileus

Grade of Acute GvHD was determined as follows.

* Grade 1: Stage 1-2 Skin + No Liver stage + No Gut stage
* Grade 2: Stage 3 Skin OR Stage 1 Liver or Stage 1 Gut
* Grade 3: No Skin stage + Stage 2 to 3 Liver Stage 2 to 4 Gut
* Grade 4: Stage 4 Skin + or Stage 2 to 3 Liver + No Gut stage, At 180 days|Number of Participants With Chronic GVHD, Assessment of chronic GvHD was performed using the 2015 NIH consensus criteria., At 18 months|Number of Participants Negative for Detectable Minimal Residual Disease, Detectable minimal residual disease was assessed using high-throughput sequencing (ClonoSEQ) and high-sensitivity flow cytometry. Minimal residual disease was considered present if \> 1 x 10\^-6 leukemic clones are detected by ClonoSEQ, or if any aberrant blasts matching the original leukemic immunophenotype are detected by high-sensitivity flow cytometry., day +90, day +180, 1 year, 1.5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To reduce the incidence of relapse at 18 months after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis from a historical baseline of 45% to 25%, using ibrutinib maintenance therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To study the incidence and severity of post-transplant complications in subjects receiving ibrutinib maintenance after allogeneic HCT.

II. To study the incidence of infectious complications in subjects receiving maintenance ibrutinib after allogeneic HCT.

III. To study the impact of ibrutinib maintenance on minimal residual disease after RIC and allogeneic HCT.

IV. To study the impact of maintenance ibrutinib on immune reconstitution and alloreactivity after allogeneic HCT, specifically on Th1/ Th2 polarization, T follicular cell number, T and B cell repertoire, serum immunoglobulin levels, and alloantibody formation.

OUTLINE:

Beginning 60-90 days after allogeneic HCT, patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 18 months post-transplant in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
