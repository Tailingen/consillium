Conventional With Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Pain Reduction and Quality of Life in Spinal Metastases
A randomized, multicentre, phase III study comparing conventional radiotherapy (1x8Gy) with stereotactic radiotherapy (1x20Gy) for pain reduction and quality of life in spinal metastases.
Spinal Metastases
RADIATION: conventional radiotherapy|RADIATION: stereotactic radiotherapy
Pain reduction measured by the Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, Pain is self-reported and measured by the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, At six weeks since baseline
Comparison of time to pain response, Pain is self-reported and measured by the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, pain response is calculated from the date of randomization at day 0-14, week 4, 6, and month 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12|Duration of pain relief, Pain is self-reported and measured by the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, Pain relief is calculated from the date of randomization at day 0-14, week 4, 6, and month 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12|Quality of life, EORTC QOL-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires, Quality of life is calculated from the date of randomization at day 0, 7, 14, week 4, 6, and month 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12|Toxicity measured by CTCAE 4.0 questionnaire, Toxicity measuredCTCAE 4.0 questionnaire, up to months 12
Study population: patients with painful spinal metastases from solid tumors without spinal cord compression or cord instability.

Objective: This study will test the hypothesis that stereotactic radiotherapy gives a better and longer lasting reduction of pain, local control and therewith a better quality of life. This in order to optimize and to individualize the treatment options for the patient.

Study design: Complaints due to pain will be analysed using the validated Dutch Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and side-effects will be recorded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). In addition to this the quality of life will be analysed using the EORTC QOL-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires. For analysis of cost-effectiveness the EQ-5D will be used.
