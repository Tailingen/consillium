Chemotherapy, Total-Body Irradiation, Rituximab, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving rituximab before transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy together with rituximab and donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
