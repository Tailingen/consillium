Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100, with the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the scales. The total scale score is the averaged value of scores of subscales, which means for each subscale and the total scale, the allowed ranges are 0-100. Higher scores on the PedsQL questionnaire for these subscales indicate consistent improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQol)., Month 3, M6, M12, M24, M60|Effects of CTL019 Therapy on Patient Reported Outcomes as Measured by EQ-5D Questionnaire, Results from the EQ-5D questionnaire is for number of participants who achieved CR or CRi at month 60. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain \& discomfort, anxiety \& depression. Respondents are asked to choose the statement in each dimension that best describes their health status on the day surveyed. Their responses are coded as a number (1, 2, or 3) that corresponds to the respective level of severity: 1 indicates no problems, 2 some problems, and 3 severe problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The scores are then normalized to a value from 0-100 where higher scores = better HRQOL \& fewer problems or symptoms., Month 60|Develop a Score Utilizing Clinical and Biomarker Data and Assess Its Ability for Early Prediction of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Derivation of a score to predict cytokine release syndrome.

This was a initially a one cohort, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of CTL019 in pediatric patients with r/r B-cell ALL. This main cohort completed enrollment. Two new cohorts were added via an amendment, Cohort 1 for high risk B-cell ALL patients at first relapse, and Cohort 2 for feasibility and safety of CTL019 in high risk B-cell ALL in patients that relapsed \<6 months post allo-HSCT. Due to lack of recruitment, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 halted recruitment. This decision was not related to any safety issue.

The study had the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation \& Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary Follow-up (if applicable) and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 5 years from CTL019 cell infusion.

Efficacy analyses were performed only on the Main Cohort (n=79) who were infused with tisagenlecleucel. However, the data on disposition and demographics presented in this section includes all patients enrolled to the study (98) and all infused patients (80) (Main Cohort + Cohort 1). No patients were enrolled in Cohort 2.
