Estrogen, Diet, Genetics and Endometrial Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see how people's diets, other aspects of their lifestyles, and their individual genetic makeup affect their chances of getting endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus).

This survey will enroll several hundred women who have or have had endometrial cancer and several hundred who do not. We will compare these two groups of women to see what factors may lead to endometrial cancer.

To investigate the role of weight, diet, and individual genetic susceptibility to endometrial cancer, 3 years
The secondary aim of this study is to obtain epidemiologic data on papillary serous and clear cell histologic types of endometrial cancer., 3 years
We will conduct a population-based case-control study in six counties of New Jersey. Cases will be women with newly-diagnosed endometrial or ovarian cancer. Controls will be matched by 5-year age groups and selected by random digit dialing (for those under 65), from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) files (for those 65 and over), or from neighborhood sampling. Controls will not have had a hysterectomy.

There will be 400 cases with endometrioid tumors, 60 with serous tumors or clear cell tumors, 300 with ovarian cancer, and 400 controls. In addition, there will be a small group of black women included from MSKCC.

We will interview participants about known and potential risk factors for endometrial and ovarian cancer and obtain information on diet. We will obtain DNA for genetic analysis from buccal specimens collected using a mouthwash rinse method. We will use logistic regression to determine odds ratios for disease with various exposures. For endometrial cancer, we will examine the association of risk with genotypes in strata defined by body mass index and dietary fat consumption.
