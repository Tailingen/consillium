GW572016 With Docetaxel and Trastuzumab for the Treatment Of Untreated ErbB2 Over-Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study was designed to be two-part study (Phase I/Phase II). Part I was designed to find the optimal (best) doses of GW572016, docetaxel, and trastuzumab when given together. Part II was designed to evaluate the tumor response rate (shrinkage or lack of growth) in patients receiving all three drugs compared to patients receiving only docetaxel and trastuzumab.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: lapatinib, docetaxel, trastuzumab
Phase I: Optimal doses and toleration of the three drugs administered together., 3 weeks|Phase II: The primary efficacy endpoint is objective tumour response rate as measured by radiological imaging, photography, and/or physical examination performed every other cycle and recorded according to RECIST criteria., 3 weeks
Phase I and II Tumor response rate; Time to tumor response; Length of response; Time to progression of cancer; Overall survival., 6 weeks|PK endpoints: Cmin and Cmax; Concentrations of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and albumin., 6 weeks|Safety and tolerability endpoints will consist of evaluation of AEs and changes from baseline in laboratory values., 6 weeks|Relevant biomarkers, including ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, AKT, and potentially other biomarkers downstream from the ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors, will be determined from tumour tissue., 6 weeks|Serum concentrations of ErbB1 and ErbB2 ECD will be correlated to tumour response., 6 weeks
Phase II part was cancelled before it started. Participants were only enrolled in the phase I part and NOT the phase II part.
