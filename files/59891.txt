Pilot Study of Somatostatin Receptor Imaging in Nasopharyngeal Cancer
Hypothesis: To estimate the proportion of locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer patients which show high somatostatin receptor density (SUVmax \>10) on Ga-68 DOTATATE imaging.

Galium-68 DOTATATE: PET imaging will be performed with a PET/CT scanner. Galium-68 DOTATATE will be injected intravenously. Scanning will be performed approximately 60 minutes after the injection.

The standardized uptake value (SUV) will be used in the interpretation of the Ga-68 DOTATATE scans. The values gathered will be used as an estimate of the somatostatin receptor density. A patient will be considered to have an overall high somatostatin receptor density if the average SUVmax of all the representative lesions is more than 10.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Number of NPC patients with high somatostatin receptor density, High somatostatin receptor density is when average maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of all the representative lesions is more than 10 on Ga-68 DOTATATE imaging, 60 minutes
