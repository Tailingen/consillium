Selective Intra-arterial Injection of PRRT in Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients With Liver Metastases
This is a safety study to determine the phase 1 starting dose of \[90\]Yttrium-DOTATOC when it is administered intravenously for patients with neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to the liver.

\[90\]Yttrium-DOTATOC is a radioactive drug used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). In other studies, 90Y-DOTATOC has been administered through a vein (IV) to target somatostatin receptor positive tumor tissue. The DOTATOC identifies the tumor through the somatostatin receptor and links to it, attaching the radioactive molecule 90Yttrium to the malignant cell.

This study expands the initial work to examine if administering the drug 90Y-DOTATOC directly to the liver is safe for patients with neuroendocrine tumors whose disease has spread to their tumor. We don't know how of the 90Y-DOTATOC is safe to administer. We want to learn what the maximum safe dose is and what the side effects are related to that dose.
