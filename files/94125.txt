A Study of Pembrolizumab With or Without Chemotherapy in Combination With Additional Treatments for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01G/KEYMAKER U01)
Researchers are investigating new treatments for untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common form of lung cancer and lung cancer that has spread beyond surgical removal. Standard treatments include immunotherapy, such as pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of adding other treatments, including the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3-directed antibody-drug conjugate (HER3-DXd) patritumab deruxtecan, to pembrolizumab, with or without chemotherapy. The primary goals are to assess safety and efficacy of the treatments.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as a confirmed complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)., Up to ~ 5 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events are any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant's participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant's participation in the research., Up to ~ 5 years|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs, Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant's participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant's participation in the research., Up to ~ 2 years
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~ 5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~ 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~ 5 years
