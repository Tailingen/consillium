TAILORx Tissue Bank
This is an exploratory, translational, non-interventional and multi-centre biobank. The aim of the development of such a biobank is to identify potential biomarkers that are indicative of disease relapse.
Breast Cancer
Disease relapse, endocrine and/or chemotherapy resistance prognosis, A biobank, TMAs and full face sections, will allow for the identification of candidate/novel biomarkers prognostic for disease relapse and predictive for endocrine and/or chemotherapy resistance, For duration of follow up, expected 10 years
Signature/biomarkers, Validation of emerging signature/biomarkers, For the duration of follow up, expected 10 years
The primary objective is to develop a biobank, tissue microarrays (TMAs) and full face sections, which will be used to identify candidate/ novel biomarkers prognostic for disease relapse and predictive for endocrine and/or chemotherapy resistance.

The secondary objectives are:

* To validate emerging signatures/biomarkers identified.
* To develop new assays for the breast cancer clinic.
