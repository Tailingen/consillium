Cognitive Dysfunction and Inflammation in Depression: Experimental Inhibition Via Infliximab
This study is a mechanistic randomized controlled trial that investigates whether inhibition of tumor necrosis factor signaling via intravenous infusion of infliximab improves psychomotor speed and executive functioning in depressed individuals who exhibit an inflammatory phenotype.
Depressive Disorder, Major|Inflammation
DRUG: Infliximab|OTHER: Placebo
Psychomotor Speed (TestMyBrain: Simple Reaction Time), Faster within-person psychomotor speed (i.e. median response time), Repeated measures over two weeks|Executive Function (TestMyBrain: Choice Reaction Time), Better within-person executive function performance (i.e. accuracy-adjusted response speed), Repeated measures over two weeks
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-item; range 0-54), Reduced depressive symptoms severity, Week 2|Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (17-item; range 0-68), Reduced anhedonia, Week 2|Concentrations of circulating C reactive protein, Reduced circulating C reactive protein, Week 1
In this mechanistic RCT, depressed adults who exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype (C reactive protein â‰¥3mg/L) will be randomized on a 1:1 allocation to receive a TNF inhibitor (infliximab) or placebo. Over a two-week follow-up, participants will remotely complete brief, daily assessments of depressive symptoms and psychomotor speed/executive functioning using a mobile-based platform (TestMyBrain) in addition to in-person clinician-rated assessment of depressive symptom severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), anhedonia (Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale), and more comprehensive computerized batteries assessing cognitive function (TestMyBrain). Blood will be drawn at baseline and week 1 to assess immune biomarkers (C reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor- alpha and its soluble receptors). Specifically, the study will determine whether randomization to infliximab is associated with improvement in psychomotor speed and executive function.
