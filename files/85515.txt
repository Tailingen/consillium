Impact of Family-Centered Empowerment on Caregivers of Children with Cancer: a Quasi-Experimental Study Protocol
The purpose of this trial is to understand the impact of a family empowerment-based intervention program on family caregivers' readiness to care and ability to care. It aims to elucidate whether a health education intervention program based on the Family Empowerment Model improves family caregivers' readiness for care and ability to care.

Participants will receive a health education program based on the family empowerment model and will complete questionnaires three days prior to admission, during hospitalization, and three days prior to discharge.This study is a non-pharmacological intervention and will not involve any changes in treatment or chemotherapy regimens.

Preparedness for caregiving, The Caregiver Preparation Scale was used to assess parents' preparedness to care for their children.This scale consists of eight items: preparedness for physical needs, emotional needs, service planning, caregiving stress, comfort care, coping with and managing emergencies, accessing medical information resources and help, and overall caregiving preparedness. A Likert five-point scale was used, with scores ranging from zero to four, indicating "not at all prepared" to "fully prepared," and higher scores reflecting better preparedness for caregiving., Completed by the patient's family caregiver, the study participant, within three days of the patient's admission to the hospital, three days after admission to three days prior to discharge, and three days before discharge|Caring capacity, The Family Caregiver Task Inventory (FCTI) was used to measure and evaluate family caregivers' caregiving abilities. The FCTI is a self-assessment scale that includes five dimensions: adapting to the role of a caregiver (five items), adapting to and assisting in caregiving (five items), dealing with personal emotions (five items), adjusting to the needs of personal life and caregiving (five items), and evaluating family and social resources (five items). It consists of a total of 25 items. The FCTI uses a three-point Likert scale, with zero indicating "no difficulty," one indicating "some difficulty," and two indicating "great difficulty." Higher scores represent greater difficulty and poorer caregiving capacity., Completed by the patient's family caregiver, the study participant, within three days of the patient's admission to the hospital, three days after admission to three days prior to discharge, and three days before discharge
Depression Anxiety Stress, The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) evaluates depression, anxiety, and stress levels in family caregivers. It contains 21 items across three dimensions: depression, anxiety, and stress. The depression subscale includes items 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 21; the anxiety subscale includes items 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, and 20; and the stress subscale includes items 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 18. A Likert four-point scale was used, with scores ranging from zero ("did not apply at all") to three ("applied most or all of the time"). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress., Completed by the patient's family caregiver, the study participant, within three days of the patient's admission to the hospital, three days after admission to three days prior to discharge, and three days before discharge|Self-efficacy, The General Self-Efficacy Scale assesses the self-efficacy of family caregivers. It contains 10 items within one dimension and is scored on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from one ("not at all true") to four ("exactly true"), with a total score of 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate better general self-efficacy., Completed by the patient's family caregiver, the study participant, within three days of the patient's admission to the hospital, three days after admission to three days prior to discharge, and three days before discharge
