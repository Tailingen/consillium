Temsirolimus and Pemetrexed for Recurrent or Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of temsirolimus and pemetrexed, as well as the response rate. The starting dose (Dose Level 1) and schedule of pemetrexed will be 500 mg/m\^2 given every 3 weeks and the starting dose (Dose Level 1) for temsirolimus will be 15 mg given weekly for 3 weeks, to complete 1 cycle. In subsequent cohorts, dose will be escalated or de-escalated. Enrollment to each cohort is based on toxicity experienced at that dose level.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Temsirolimus
Phase I Only: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Pemetrexed That Could be Administered Weekly in Combination With Temsirolimus, The starting dose and schedule of pemetrexed will be 500 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks and the starting dose for temsirolimus will be 15 mg given weekly for 3 weeks, to complete 1 cycle. In subsequent cohorts, dose will be escalated or de-escalated. Enrollment to each cohort is based on toxicity experienced at that dose level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Six patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose to ensure that no more than 2 DLTs occur at the MTD. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached., Completion of first cycle by all enrolled patients in Phase I portion of study|Phase I Only: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Temsirolimus That Could be Administered Weekly in Combination With Pemetrexed, The starting dose and schedule of pemetrexed will be 500 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks and the starting dose for temsirolimus will be 15 mg given weekly for 3 weeks, to complete 1 cycle.

* Any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity with the exception of anemia.
* Any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity related to study therapy (except alopecia).
* Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis or esophagitis.
* Treatment delay of temsirolimus for more than 14 consecutive days due to study-related toxicity.
* Treatment delay of pemetrexed therapy for more than 14 consecutive days because of study-related toxicity., Completion of first cycle (approximately 21 days)|Phase I and Phase II: Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response), * Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.
* Complete response (CR)-disappearance of all target lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial response (PR)-at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD, 2 years|Phase I Only: Phospho-Akt Levels in Circulating Mononuclear Cells, Cycle 1 Day 1, one hour post completion of initial temsirolimus dose, and Cycle 1 Day 8|Phase I Only: Phospho-S6 Levels in Circulating Mononuclear Cells, Cycle 1 Day 1, one hour post completion of initial temsirolimus dose, and Cycle 1 Day 8
Phase 2 Only: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression., 2 years from completion of treatment|Phase 2 Only: Survival Rate, 1 year after start of treatment|Phase 2 Only: Phospho-Akt Levels in Circulating Mononuclear Cells, Cycle 1 Day 1, one hour post completion of initial temsirolimus dose, and Cycle 1 Day 8|Phase 2 Only: Phospho-S6 Levels in Circulating Mononuclear Cells Before and After Treatment, Cycle 1 Day 1, one hour post completion of initial temsirolimus dose, and Cycle 1 Day 8
