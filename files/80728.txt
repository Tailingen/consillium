Dose-Finding Study of Cabozantinib (XL184) in Japanese Subjects With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomic (PGX) and preliminary efficacy following daily oral doses of cabozantinib (XL184) in Japanese patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Also, the effect of XL184 in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with various activating mutations will be evaluated at the recommended Phase 2 dose.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose, To establish the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (or dose range as appropriate) of XL184 when administered orally on a once daily schedule in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors., Assessed in the clinic on Days 1 through 29
Safety and tolerability of XL184, Safety and tolerability of multiple doses of XL184 administered orally on a daily basis. Assessed from informed consent until at least 30 days after discontinuation., From study start to October 2014|Plasma Pharmacokinetics, Assess plasma pharmacokinetics of daily oral administration of XL184 from Treatment Day 1 to Day 29., Assessed in the clinic from Day 1 through Day 29|Tumor response (preliminary anti-tumor activity), Assess tumor response after repeated administration of XL184 from screening until discontinuation. Assessed as best overall response by cohort by radiological response defined by RECIST criteria., Study start to October 2014
