Study of the Safety and Tolerability of PG545 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This first-in-human study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of PG545 and to evaluate its safety in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In addition the study will explore whether PG545 exposure results in changes to chemicals produced by the body that are associated with cancer growth and spread.
