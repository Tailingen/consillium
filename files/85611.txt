A Trial of GFH018 and Toripalimab in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III NSCLC Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III NSCLC
This is a phase II trial assessing the efficacy and safety of GFH018 and Toripalimab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
NSCLC, Stage III

Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients with objective response (OR).

OR was determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). OR is defined as the best overall response (Complete Response (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; no new lesions) or Partial Response (â‰¥decrease in the sum of the largest diameters of target lesions; no new lesions)) across all assessment points from enrollment to termination of trial treatment. Radiological tumour assessment was performed using CT scans., From the date of enrolment of the first patient up to 28 months , which is also16 months after the enrolment of the last patient
