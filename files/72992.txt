OPTImal PALliative Anti-epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer -
The present study will investigate the feasibility and clinical value of using circulating tumor DNA as selection for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Retrospective concordance analysis, Retrospective comparison of tumor mutation and plasma mutation analysis at baseline, By end of study, expected after 3 years|Disease control rate, Rate of disease control, 1 year|OS, Overall survival rate, 3 years|Resistance mutations, Rate of Ectoderm mutations at time of progression, At time of progression, data analysis expected after 3 years|Lead time, Calcualted lead time between radiologically detected progression and molecular biologically detected ( by Ectoderm and other resistance mutations) in the ctDNA., At time of progression, data analysis expected after 3 years
The primary aim of this prospective study is to investigate if cfDNA in plasma is feasible and reliable for selection of mCRC patients who will benefit of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy

Secondary, to analyze developments in mutational status as reflected by cfDNA in plasma during therapy and at time of progression
