Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) in Metastatic Melanoma Patients Who Failed Immunotherapy
Altering the Gut Microbiota of Melanoma Patients Who Failed Immunotherapy Using Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) From Responding Patients.

FMT includes both colonoscopy and stool capsules.
Melanoma Stage Iv|Unresectable Stage III Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)
Incidence of FMT-related Adverse Events, Number of patients with adverse events that emerged post FMT, 4 years|Proper implant engraftment, Comparing of the patients' gut bacterial composition pre and post-FMT and in relation to their donors. Bacterial composition will be quantified by the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in the stool, 4 years
Changes in composition of immune cell population, Changes in the relative abundance of different immune cell population (such as the proportion of CD8+ T cells) pre and post-FMT., 4 years|Changes in activity of immune cells, Changes in levels of proteins that represent immune activity against cancer (such as measurements of blood interferon gamma levels), pre and post FMT, 4 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients with objective responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients, according to imaging studies (RECIST 1.1) and iRECIST., 4 years
This is a phase I single-center study of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in melanoma patients who failed at least one line of PD-1 blockade.

Eligible patients must have a disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to FMT.

Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation including imaging, tumor biopsy, blood samples and stool studies to confirm suitability for the study.

Eligible patients will undergo FMT. The FMT includes a colonoscopy followed by stool capsules.

Patients will undergo repeated evaluations including follow-up blood, stool and radiological testings.

The study will be conducted over a 24-week period.
