Values outside of the standard reference range are considered abnormalities. Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result will be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment, a medical intervention, or a change in concomitant therapy; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment., Baseline, Cycle 1, and at each subsequent cycle (1 cycle is 28 days) or at every other cycle starting from Cycle 3 (Cohort X only), up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment|Number of Participants with Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities in Urinalysis Tests by Highest Grade According to NCI-CTCAE v4.0, Laboratory parameters for urinalysis will be measured and compared with a standard reference range. Values outside of the standard reference range are considered abnormalities. Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result will be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: is accompanied by clinical symptoms; results in a change in study treatment, a medical intervention, or a change in concomitant therapy; or is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment., Baseline, Cycle 3, and at every other cycle (1 cycle is 28 days) up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment
