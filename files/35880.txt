Patient Bother From Injection Site Burning and/or Stinging, Questionnaire responses recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which has a range of 0-100 mm, assessed approximately 15 minutes post-injection, 15 minutes
Discomfort From Injection, Questionnaire responses recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which has a range of 0-100 mm, assessed approximately 15 minutes post-injection, 15 minutes
GnRH is given as an injection. Injections of GnRH can be uncomfortable, causing a feeling of burning or stinging. The uncomfortable feeling may be caused by differences in the types of GnRH and the site of the injection (under the skin of the abdomen, or into the muscle of the buttock or thigh).
