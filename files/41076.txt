PROCEDURE: Specimen Collection
To distribute human biospecimens for clinical research, By using the biological samples from CU-Med Biobank, translational studies can be done., 99 years|To discover the pathological mechanism of different acute and chronic diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart disease, dementia & diabetes, The relationship between different genome/proteome/bacteriome/virome and various diseases can be revealed, thus leading to a better prognostic and diagnostic outcome., 99 years
CU-Med Biobank will collect and store high-quality specimens from cancer-related or other diseases. All samples are linked to annotated clinical data from approved consented protocols. This system provides researchers with high- quality biological samples and comprehensive clinical, pathological including molecular/genetic information for their research. This standardized CU-Med Biobank is a pivotal bridge to improve the translation of basic research into clinical applications. These findings will contribute to improve prevention, enhance diagnosis, develop new treatment and eventual cure of diseases.
