Perioperative Music Therapy Plus Oxycodone in Perioperative Management of Lung Surgery
To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of Perioperative Music Therapy Plus Oxycodone in pain management after thoracic surgery, patients will be randomly assigned into two groups. The experimental group will receive perioperative music therapy and the control group will not. We will record and contrast the postoperative oxycodone usage to evaluate the effect of music therapy in relieving the pain. We will also use visual analogue scale, questionnaire and EEG to evaluate patients' anxiety and depression.
