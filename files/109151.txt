Circulating Tumor Cells and mpMRI for Non-invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer(CMNDPC)
This trial is a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic study. This study aims to evaluation the early diagnostic ability of circulating tumor cells plus multimodal MRI for prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: prostate cancer diagnosis
Positive predictive value of CTCs counts for prostate cancer, Evaluation the diagnostic ability of CTCs counts in caner and non-cancer. All patients were confirmed by pathology., 12 weeks
Correlation between CTCs counts and PIRADS score, Diagnostic value of CTCs, 12 weeks|combined PIRADS score for cancer and non-cancer, Diagnostic value of CTCs, 12 weeks
This trial is a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic study. This study aims to evaluation the early diagnostic ability of circulating tumor cells plus multimodal MRI for prostate cancer.

We will enroll 808 men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer due to higher level PSA（\>4ng/ml）or other examination abnormal. All the participants will receive prostate biopsy，the circulating tumor cells（CTCs）will be detected before biopsy.

This study will evaluate the diagnostic ability of CTCs+MRI and CTCs+MRI+PSA，including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy and receiver operating curves（ROC）.
