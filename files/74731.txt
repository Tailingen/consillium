PM8002 in Combination With Paclitaxel Compared With Chemotherapy as Second-line Treatment in Small Cell Lung Cancer
PM8002 is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and VEGF. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM8002 in combination with Paclitaxel as second-line treatment for SCLC
SCLC
DRUG: PM8002|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Topotecan
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis are censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by evaluated by investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on assessments by investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR as assessed by investigators based on RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the sum rate of CR, PR and Stable Disease (SD), as determined by investigators based on RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|Time to response (TTR), Time to response(TTR) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PR or CR assssed by investigator based on RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|Duration of response (DOR), DoR is defined as the time period from the date of initial CR or PR until the date of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|6 month PFS rate, PFS rate corresponding to the 6th month of the progression-free survival curve, Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|12 month PFS rate, PFS rate corresponding to the 12th month of the progression-free survival curve, Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|12 month OS rate, OS rate corresponding to the 12th month of the overall survival curve, Up to approximately 32 months from first patient in|Incidence and severity of Adverse Event (AE) according to CTCAE 5.0, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of ADA to PM8002, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Health related quality of life (HRQoL), Differences in the scores of health-related quality of life (HRQol), Up to 30 days after last treatment
This multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM8002 in combination with Paclitaxel versus Investigator's Choice (Topotecan or Paclitaxel) as second-line treatment for subjects with SCLC.
