A Dose Finding Study To Evaluate Safety, Drug Interaction, Tumor Markers Of Axitinib In Combination With MK-3475 In Adult Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Renal Cell Cancer
Despite substantial improvements of patients outcome in advanced RCC, durable and complete response is uncommon. The majority of patients eventually develop resistance and exhibit disease progression. Combining a PD-1 inhibitor, which has shown single-agent efficacy with axitinib may provide additional clinical benefit compared to axitinib alone.
