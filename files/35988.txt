Virtual Reality-Based Exercise in Cancer Patients
The aim of the present study is to evaluate an innovative virtual reality-based balance training intervention for improving clinically relevant motor performances (balance and gait) in cancer patients.

The investigators hypothesize that the virtual reality-based balance training intervention will improve balance and gait performances in cancer patients compared to a control group receiving usual care only.
Distorted; Balance|Motor Deficit
OTHER: Balance Training
Postural Balance, Postural Balance during quiet standing for 30 seconds will be assessed using validated wearable sensor technologies (BalanSens™), after 4 weeks
Gait performance, Gait performance will be measured using validated wearable sensor technology (LEGSys™), 4 weeks
