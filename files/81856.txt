Photoacoustic Endoscopy in Endometrial Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether a new technology called intrauterine photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE) can be used to evaluate the inner lining of the uterus.
Endometrial Cancer|Benign Neoplasm of Body of Uterus
DEVICE: Photoacoustic endoprobe|PROCEDURE: Photoacoustic endoscopy
Feasibility of using the device to image endometrial cancer, Feasibility of using this novel device to image endometrial cancer is our primary objective. The frequency of success in obtaining images, overall and per group, will be presented and binomial success rates with 95% confidence interval estimates will be calculated. Besides the overall success rates, graphical and tabular summaries of the feasibility across patient demographic and clinical characteristics will be created., 12 months or less
The investigators will evaluate whether this technology can be used and also try to obtain photoacoustic images and functional data (oxygen contents, blood vessel characteristics, etc) of the uterine lining to assess its appearance in women with and without cancer of the endometrium. Currently, it is difficult for physicians to know whether or not tumors of the endometrium have invaded and spread to other organs without performing an extended surgery called a staging operation (removal of the lymph nodes or glands that drain the uterus to assess under the microscope whether or not the cancer has spread). Our long term goal is to use this new photoacoustic (PA) technology to improve detection of occult metastatic disease. Occult disease is defined as tumor which cannot be seen without the use of imaging techniques. and possibly avoid the need of extended operations. All of this could result in better care for patients with endometrial cancer and other gynecologic problems.
