Olaparib and Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer and DNA Damage Repair Genes Alterations
Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and germline mutation in BRCA have benefit of therapy with PARP inhibitors. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that PDL-1 inhibitors synergize therapeutically with PARP inhibitors in tumours with homologous repair deficiency.

Our hypothesis is that those patients with alterations in DNA damage repair genes (somatic and germline BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D and other functional DDR genes) and who have benefit from platinum based therapy in first line might obtain an increased therapeutic effect with the combination of olaparib and durvalumab.

This is an open-label, single-arm, multicentric phase II clinical trial of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with alterations in DDR genes, who have had benefit with platinum-based chemotherapy in first line setting. The primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of this combination in terms of ORR.

Patients will be eligible for the study based on alterations in a panel of specific DDR genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D and other DDR genes, as determined by a local assay according to local practice or by the central laboratory (if local assay is not available).

DRUG: olaparib+durvalumab
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the percentage of patients with an investigator-assessed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline through the end of the study (up 42 months)
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from initial date of study treatment to the date of objective disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Baseline through the end of the study (up 42 months)|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the initial date of the study treatment to the date of death (due to any cause), with patients alive or lost to follow-up at the analysis data cut-off date censored at their last contact date., 42 months|Duration of response (DoR), DoR defined as time from first objective response to disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death (due to any cause).
