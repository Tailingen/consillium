A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer and Normal or Reduced Hepatic Function
This open-label, parallel group study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and normal or reduced hepatic function. Patients will receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
