MR Guided Focused Ultrasound vs Radiotherapy for Palliative Pain Tx in Bone Metastases
This is a prospective, single-center, randomized study directly comparing outcomes after MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR HIFU) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatment of painful bone metastases.
Bone Metastases
PROCEDURE: MR- High intensity focused ultrasound|RADIATION: External beam radiotherapy
Number of participants that achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Complete response (CR): Complete response is defined as a pain score of zero at the treated site with no concomitant increase in analgesic intake (stable or reducing analgesics in daily oral morphine equivalents). Partial Response (PR): Partial response is to be defined as any of the following: Pain reduction of 2 or more points at the treated site on a 0-10 scale without analgesic increase; or analgesic dose reduction of 25% or more in daily morphine equivalent from baseline without an increase in pain., 14 days after treatment
Patient-reported pain scores - Pain Diary, Patient reported pain scores will be based on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (from 0 to 10) 0 = no pain and 10= worst pain. Assessed using the patient pain diary from treatment day to 1 month after completion treatment., 1 month|Patient-reported pain scores - BPI (Brief Pain Inventory), The BPI measures pain interference on seven 0-10 integer subscales, as well as the mean of the seven subscales., on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Physician-reported adverse events, Assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0; we will report the number of pathologic fractures at the site of treatment, on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Patient-reported quality of life - EORTC QLQ-BM22, During follow up, patient will received quality of life questionnaire on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment., on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Patient-reported quality of life - EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, During follow up, patient will received quality of life questionnaire on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment., on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Patient-reported quality of life - EQ-5D-5L, During follow up, patient will received quality of life questionnaire on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment., on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Patient-reported quality of life - PGIC, During follow up, patient will received quality of life questionnaire on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment. Patient Global Impression of Change scale has a single question with a 7 point likert scale about overall improvement after treatment assessing change in pain, from "Much Better" to "Much Worse", on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months|Local tumor control, Assessed using CT and/or MRI imaging at three and/or six months after completion of treatment, 3 and 6 months after completion of treatment|Anxiety and depression scores, Assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This measures anxiety and depression separately on seven four-point (0-3) subscales, giving total scores from 0-21 for both constructs., on baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, and at 3 and 6 months
The primary purpose of this study is to see if MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) treats bone pain faster than the standard radiation therapy (External beam radiation therapy: EBRT) and to evaluate the patient's pain experience 14 days after completion of the treatment. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the outcomes of the pain, side effects, and quality of life and survival in the first 6 months after treatment.
