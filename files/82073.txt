5 years overall survival, 5 years
5 years disease-free survival, 5 years|10 years overall survival, 10 years|10 years disease-free survival, 10 years
The investigators will analyzed proteomes of paired normal brain tissues and GBM, sequenced transcriptomes, perform whole exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal brain tissue, primary GBM carcinoma, and its synchronous matched metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of GBM characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
