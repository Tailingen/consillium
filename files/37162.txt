A Study of TQ-B3525 Tablets in Subjects With PIK3CA and/or PIK3R1/2 Gene-altered Recurrent/Metastatic Advanced Gynecologic Tumors
This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQ-B3525 in subjects with recurrent / metastatic advanced endometrial cancer, cervical cancer and ovarian cancer with PIK3CA and / or PIK3R1 / 2 gene-altered (mutation or amplification). Endometrial cancer, cervical cancer and ovarian cancer are divided into three cohorts, each cohort administrated TQ-B3525 tablet orally once a day.
Advanced Endometrial Cancer, Cervical Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: TQ-B3525 tablet
Overall response rate (ORR) assessed by Independent Review Committee, Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on IRC., up to 48 weeks
Overall response rate (ORR) assessed by Investigator, Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) assessed by investigator., up to 48 weeks|Disease control rate（DCR）, Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)., up to 48 weeks|Duration of disease remission (DOR), The time from the first evaluation of the subject as CR or PR to the first evaluation of the subject as PD or death (whichever occurs first)., up to 48 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of the first of the following events, objective disease progression or death due to any cause., up to 48 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause. Survival time was censored at the date of last contact for patients who were still alive or lost to follow-up., up to 72 weeks|DOR rate (≥ 6 months) (percentage of subjects with disease remission duration ≥ 6 months), The percentage of subjects achieving CR or PR was recorded for the first time to 6 months after the first time of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) was recorded., up to 48 weeks
