LIVELUNG - Impact of CGA in Patients Diagnosed With Localized NSCLC Treated With SBRT
Older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) often die from other causes than lung cancer due to age-related comorbidities. This national randomized study will include 130 patients throughout 5 Danish cancer centres and investigate if a comprehensive geriatric intervention (CGA) when added upfront to SBRT for patients with localized NSCLC will have an impact on quality of life (QoL), overall survival, physical functionality and unplanned hospital admissions.

If an upfront CGA improves patients' general health status, this study could lead to implementation of a CGA in standard clinical practice as well as further research on older patients receiving radiotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy|Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
OTHER: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Questionnaire with 5 dimensions each with 5 (1-5) levels representing the health status of the patient and the patients self-rated health status on a scale from 0-100 (EQ VAS). The score of the 5 dimensions can be converted into a single index value 0-1 with higher values indicating poorer health status., 12 months
Overall Survival (OS), The time from treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence, 12 months|Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Questionnaire with 5 dimensions each with 5 (1-5) levels representing the health status of the patient and the patients self-rated health status on a scale from 0-100 (EQ VAS). The score of the 5 dimensions can be converted into a single index value 0-1 with higher values indicating poorer health status., 3 months|Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Questionnaire with 5 dimensions each with 5 (1-5) levels representing the health status of the patient and the patients self-rated health status on a scale from 0-100 (EQ VAS). The score of the 5 dimensions can be converted into a single index value 0-1 with higher values indicating poorer health status., 6 months|Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Questionnaire with 5 dimensions each with 5 (1-5) levels representing the health status of the patient and the patients self-rated health status on a scale from 0-100 (EQ VAS). The score of the 5 dimensions can be converted into a single index value 0-1 with higher values indicating poorer health status., 9 months|Hand-grip strength, Hand-grip strength measured in kilo using a JAMAR hand dynamometer, 12 months|Timed-up-and-go (TUG), TUG consists of timing (seconds) a patient getting up from a chair from the sitting to the bipedal position, walking three meters, turning, returning, and sitting on the chair again, 12 months|Chair-stand-test (CST), The CST involves recording the number of "stands" from a chair a person can complete in 30 seconds, 12 months|Unplanned Admissions, Time to first unplanned admission, 12 months
