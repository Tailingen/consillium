Lapatinib and Circulating Tumor Cells in Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy of lapatinib in eradicating chemo- resistant tumour cells circulating in the blood of patients with breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lapatinib
Efficacy of lapatinib by quantitative analysis of circulating tumour cells in the blood.The efficacy will be measured before, during and after the completion of treatment, 2 months
Correlation of the levels of CTCs with the PFS of the patients, 1 year|Assessment of the safety of lapatinib administration in this patient population., During treatment
Breast cancer is considered a systemic disease since early tumour cell dissemination may occur even in patients with small tumours; several investigators using immunocytochemistry or real time PCR (RT-PCR) have shown that cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells could be identified in the bone marrow aspirates or the peripheral blood of otherwise metastases-free patients with stage I and II breast cancer. The clinical importance of the immunocytochemical detection of occult tumour cells in the bone marrow has been confirmed in many prospective studies to represent an independent predictive and prognostic factor for distant relapse and reduced survival.

Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have persistent detection of tumour cells in the peripheral blood (â‰¥5 cells/7.5 ml) despite at least one line of chemotherapy will receive lapatinib for a minimum of one month unless disease progression occurs at an earlier time point.
