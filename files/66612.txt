Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (Z-CTLs) for Relapsed or Refractory Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
A single-center, open-label pilot study to determine the safety, tolerance and engraftment potential of zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes in subjects with PD-L1+ positive non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Observe and determine the potential adverse events related to the escalating dose infusion of Z-CTLs such as high fever,jaundice, kidney failure and so on., 8 weeks
Number of Z-CTLs in peripheral blood samples after infusion, Detect Z-CTLs in peripheral blood samples after infusion by flow cytometry every week, 8 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), the ratio of patients diagnosed as partial remission (PR) to complete remission (CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), the duration from baseline to PD (audited and confirmed by independent imaging), or to the day of any death event, 2 years|Time to tumor progression (TTP), the duration from baseline to disease starts to get worse or spreads to other parts of the body, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), the time period from the 1st day of treatment to the day of death for any reason. For patients who are still alive at the data analysis day, OS data is subject to the last confirmed time of survival patients, 2 years
The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and feasibility of Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes(Z-CTLs) in patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC. Z-CTLs therapy is a novel immunotherapy under investigation in which patients have their T-cells (a type of white blood cell) collected and modified in the laboratory, before they are given back to the patient. The T-cells are modified to transform the intracellular signal domain of PD-1 and CTLA-4 to immune activation stimulus signal and transform T cells to a new kind of cancer-killer cells: zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Z-CTls).
