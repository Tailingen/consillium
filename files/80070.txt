Oncolytic Adenovirus Coding for TNFa and IL2 (TILT-123) With Pembrolizumab or Pembrolizumab (Phase 1a and 2) and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (Phase 1b) as Treatment for Ovarian Cancer.
This is an open-label, phase 1/2, dose-escalation, multicenter and multinational trial evaluating the safety of oncolytic adenovirus TILT-123 in combination with Pembrolizumab, or Pembrolizumab and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in patients with platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer.

This is an open-label, phase 1/2, dose-escalation, multicenter and multinational trial evaluating the safety of oncolytic adenovirus TILT-123 in combination with Pembrolizumab, or Pembrolizumab and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in patients with platinum resistant or refractory ovarian cancer. TILT-123 is an oncolytic adenovirus coding for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and interleukin 2 (IL-2). Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody binding program cell death 1 (PD-1). Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy and a pegylated liposomal form of the anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor, doxorubicin.
