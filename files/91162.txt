A Companion Diagnostic Study to Develop Circulating Exosomes as Predictive Biomarkers for the Response to Immunotherapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma
Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and clinical trials showning better response in unselected patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). At the moment, no clear biomarker exists to accurately predict anti-PD1/PDL1 RCC responsiveness. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the utility of circulating exosomes as companion diagnostic biomarker for predicting response to immunotherapy in patients with RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
OTHER: Other: Blood and Urine Collection
The correlation between the circulating exosomes levels and the tumor responsiveness, The Measurement： The concentration of ciruculating exosomes and the expression level of exosomal RNA.

The Measurement Tool:

RT-PCR，WB and Elisa, 3 years
