Dual-Energy CT on Plan Quality, Dose-delivery Accuracy, and Simulated Outcomes of Patients Treated With Proton or Photon Therapy
The aim of this protocol is to refine the accuracy of proton beam therapy (PT) by the use of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), in conjunction with novel iterative image reconstruction algorithms, to more precisely determine the tissue properties through which the proton beam path travels.
