Study to Evaluate the Efficacy/Safety of IPI-549 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma (MARIO-275)
The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of IPI-549 in combination with nivolumab when compared to nivolumab monotherapy in advanced urothelial cancer patients.

DRUG: IPI-549 (eganelisib)|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Placebos
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECISTv1.1, ORR is defined as best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as measured by RECIST v1.1.

RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. CR= Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \<10 mm in short axis. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., First dosing date to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months
Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to first objective response \[complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)\] in patients with CR or PR., First dosing date to date of first objective response, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first objective response (CR or PR) to documented disease progression in patients with CR or PR., Date of first objective response to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to documented disease progression or death due to any cause., First dosing to date to confirmed disease progression or death, assessed up to 48 months|Changes from baseline in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), If TSH result is abnormal, subsequent testing of Free T3 and free T4 required., Pre-treatment (within 7 days of first dose) to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Changes from baseline in electrocardiograms (ECGs), ECGs assess heart problems by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart as it contracts. The components that will be assessed during the ECG are P wave, QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave., Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Changes from baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance, ECOG performance status describes the level of impact that disease has on the patient's daily living abilities. Scale ranges from 0 (Fully active and able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction) to 5 (Dead)., Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Population Pharmacokinetics (PK) of IPI-549-01, IPI-549 blood concentrations in ng/mL., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 hours following administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Nivolumab, Nivolumab blood concentrations will be assayed in ug/mL., Pre-infusion and within 2 minutes of end of infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 4; Pre-infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, and every 4 cycles starting at Cycle 5 (each cycle is 28 days)|Changes from baseline in pulse rate, Pulse rate as measured in beats per minute (bpm), Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Changes from baseline in temperature, Temperature as measured in celsius., Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Changes from baseline in respiration rate, Respiration rate as measured in breaths per minute., Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|Changes from baseline in blood pressure, Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as measured in mmHg., Screening to date of confirmed disease progression, assessed up to 24 months
Study IPI-549-02 is a multi-national, prospective, randomized, active-control Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPI 549 administered in combination with nivolumab compared to nivolumab monotherapy.

The study will enroll approximately 160 checkpoint-naÃ¯ve, advanced urothelial cancer patients who have progressed or recurred following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous (IV) nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in combination with oral (PO) IPI 549 40 mg once daily (QD) or IV nivolumab 480 mg Q4W in combination with placebo PO QD.

Eligible patients who have confirmed progression of disease during treatment with nivolumab monotherapy may crossover to the combination treatment arm.
