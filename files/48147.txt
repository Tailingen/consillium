Study on Savolitinib Combined With Osimertinib in Treatment of Advanced NSCLC With MET Amplification
This study will look at how effective the study drug(Savolitinib combined with Osimertinib) versus Pemetrexed combined with platinum in treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with MET amplification after failure of the first-line EGFR inhibitor therapy.

This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open, phase III clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Savolitinib combined with Osimertinib in treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with MET amplification after failure of EGFR inhibitor therapy.
