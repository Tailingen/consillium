Study of Cetuximab With Concomitant-boost Radiotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)
This study is conducted in Japanese newly diagnosed locally advanced SCCHN patients in order to assess tolerability and feasibility of Cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy (RT) regimen (the study treatment) and its safety profile (i.e. AEs: adverse events). In addition, efficacy (i.e. anti-tumor effect) of the study treatment is also evaluated.
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Cetuximab
Completion Rate, Number of subjects who complete ≥70% of Cetuximab planned dose administration in terms of relative dose intensity of Cetuximab and full dose of RT ≤2 weeks over planned schedule in terms of RT duration ≤8 weeks, divided by the the number of subjects in the ITT/Safety population, time from first administration of cetuximab to last administration of cetuximab or RT (whichever is later), ≤ 9 weeks
Best Response Rate, Number of subjects experiencing a Complete Response (complete disappearance of measurable and evaluable disease without new lesions) or Partial Response (\>=50% decrease of the sum of the product diameters of measurable disease, evaluable disease not worsening or progressing, no new lesions) at 8 weeks post radiotherapy (confirmed by repeat assessment at week 12) based on imaging according to modified World Health Organisation criteria as assessed independently by the Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee, divided by the number of subjects in the ITT/safety population, best response was determined at week 8 post radiotherapy, for subjects with complete or partial response a confirmation in week 12 post radiotherapy was required|Safety - Number of Patients Experiencing Any Adverse Event, Please refer to Adverse Events section for further details, time from first dose up to 60 days after last dose of study treatment, ≤18 weeks|Safety - Number of Patients Experiencing Any Grade 4 Adverse Event, Severity was assessed according to the toxicity criteria defined in the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0, where grade 1 denoted mild, grade 2 moderate, grade 3 severe, and grade 4 lifethreatening or disabling. In the case of adverse events not contained within the NCI-CTCAE, the investigator was responsible for assessing the severity of the AE (grades 1 to 4) based on the jeopardy to the subject's health and well-being, and the ability of the subject to function during the event., time from first dose up to 60 days after last dose of study treatment, ≤18 weeks|Safety - Number of Patients Experiencing Any Grade 3 or 4 Skin Reaction, Skin reactions were considered as adverse events of special interest and were evaluated in a special AE category composed of specific MedDRA preferred terms. Severity was assessed according to criteria defined in the NCI-CTCAE, Version 3.0, where grade 1 is mild, grade 2 moderate, grade 3 severe, and grade 4 lifethreatening or disabling., time from first dose up to 60 days after last dose of study treatment, ≤18 weeks|Safety - Number of Patients Experiencing Any Grade 3 or 4 Infusion Related Reaction, Infusion related reactions were considered as adverse events of special interest and were evaluated in a special AE category composed of specific MedDRA preferred terms. Severity was assessed according to criteria defined in the NCI-CTCAE, Version 3.0, where grade 1 is mild, grade 2 moderate, grade 3 severe, and grade 4 lifethreatening or disabling., time from first dose up to 60 days after last dose of study treatment, ≤18 weeks
