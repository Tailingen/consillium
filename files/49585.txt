Ca:Mg Ratio and Cognitive Function
Between 2000 and 2015, mortality due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) increased by 123%. No drugs have yet been approved to stop or slow the progression of AD. A delay of five years in the expression of AD would reduce the incidence rate by half. Thus, it is critical to develop novel prevention strategies to delay the onset of this common disease.

As an ancillary study conducted within a precision-based randomized trial (R01CA149633; PI, Dai \& Yu\]"), the investigators reduced Ca:Mg ratios to 2.3 through 3-month personalized Mg supplementation among those who consumed high Ca:Mg ratio diet, but otherwise in good general health. The investigators test the hypothesis that actively reducing the Ca:Mg ratio among those aged \>65 years who consume high Ca:Mg ratio diets improves cognitive function compared to the placebo arm. The investigators further conduct molecular epidemiologic studies to understand the molecular mechanisms.
