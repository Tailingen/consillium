A Clinical Trial of TQB2934 for Injection in Multiple Myeloma Subjects
TQB2934 is an anti-CD3(Early T Cell Marker)×BCMA (B cell maturation antigen) double-specific antibody，and the isoform is IgG1 (Native Immunoglobulin G1), which at one end binds to the CD3 receptor on the surface of T cells ,and the other end binds to BCMA(B cell maturation antigen) to recruit T cells around BCMA-positive cells, which can activate T cells .Active T cells release granzyme and perforin to kill BCMA-positive target cells.TQB2934 for injection is planned for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.
