Efficacy and Safety of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in RRMM Patients With Renal Insufficiency
The primary purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy and to generate PK and biomarker data for the combination of Pomalidomide and low-dose Dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with moderate or severe renal impairment.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone
Evaluate efficacy of the combination of pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function, Overall response rate determined by Myeloma responses determined by modified IMWG criteria, Approximately 2 years
Assessment of renal response according to the criteria defined by Dimopoulos and Ludwig (Dimopoulos, 2009; Dimopoulos, 2010 b,c; Ludwig, 2010)., Assessment of renal response according to the criteria defined by Ludwig and Dimopoulos, Approximately 2 years|Time to Myeloma response, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Time to renal response, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Duration of response, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Time to progression, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Overall Survival, Evaluated according to the CTCAE grading, Approximately 2 years|Adverse events (AEs) assessment (type, frequency, seriousness, severity, relationship to pomalidomide and/or dexamethasone and outcomes) including second primary malignancy (SPM)., Pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function (moderate to severe renal impairment)., Approximately 2 years
The study will consist of a Screening phase within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1. Subjects once enrolled will enter the Treatment phase, in which patients will be treated until progression, or study discontinuation due to other reasons. Subjects will enter the long term Follow-up phase of the study where data will be collected every 3 months for up to 5 years on Secondary primary malignancies, survival, subsequent anti myeloma treatments and date of progression. Subjects will be recruited into one of 3 cohorts depending on the severity of their renal impairment.
