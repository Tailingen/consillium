Radiopaque Hydrogel Spacer in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer
An early feasibility study to evaluate feasibility, radiotherapy benefits and safety when using TraceIT tissue spacer to create space between pancreas and duodenum in patients with localized Pancreatic Cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: TraceIT Tissue Spacer implantation
Safety Endpoint, Number of subjects with TraceIT procedure-related event which resulted in a delay in initiation for RT (radio-therapy)., 2-6 week assessment post-procedure
Radio-Therapy Benefits of TraceIT, Number of subjects who were able to maintain safe duodenal dose constraints. RT benefits were assessed via comparison of pre- and post-TraceIT administration RT plans with consideration of the following: ability to maintain safe duodenal dose constraints, percent/volume of gross tumor volume/planning target volume (GTV/PTV) receiving prescription dose and overall duodenal dose/dose distribution., 2-6 week assessment|Feasibility of TraceIT, Number of subjects who achieved Technical Success (the ability to place TraceIT and create space between the duodenum and head of pancreas (HOP)., 2-6 week assessment post-procedure|TraceIT Persistence (at 6-months Post-treatment), Characteristics of TraceIT persistence and migration were measured at 2 to 6 weeks and 6 months following injection. Persistence was measured at the 2 to 6 week and 6 month follow-ups by assessing whether a cohesive mass of water density fluid was present in the periduodenal space following the last radio therapy appointment. Migration of the TraceIT post Radiation was measured by CT scan taken at 2-6 weeks follow-up., 2-6 weeks and 6 month post procedure|Theoretical Dose Escalation From Post-TraceIT Treatment Plan, Maximum dose to the GTV while maintaining duodenal dose constraints, 2-6 week assessment Post-procedure|Incidence of Acute (Within 3 Months) and Late (>3 Months) Duodenal Toxicity Summarized by CTCAE Grade and Timing, Number of subject with Duodenal AE summarized by CTCAE grade and timing, 18 months post procedure|Incidence of Resection Following the Completion of Radiation Therapy (RT), Number of subjects with resection following the completion of radiation therapy (RT). Within 2-6 weeks after completion of therapy, subjects were restaged to determine whether they may progress for surgery (resection)., 2-6 weeks post procedure|Progression Free and Overall Survival, Progression-free survival is the interval between the start of induction chemotherapy (prior to Radiation Therapy) to the earliest treatment failure onset date, or death, in months. Overall survival is the interval between the start of induction chemotherapy (prior to radiation therapy) to death in month., 18 months post procedure|Changes From Baseline at the Final RT Appointment, 3 Month, 6 Month, 12 Month and 18 Month in EORTC QoL (QLQ-C30), The EORTC QOL QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire used to assess patient-reported symptoms and outcomes during cancer treatment. The survey contains 28 questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much') and 2 questions on a 7-point numerical scale (1 = 'Very poor' to 7 = 'Excellent').Questions are grouped into 15 categories containing 1 to 5 different questions per category. All scores were transformed to a 0-100 scale following instructions in the scoring manual. Raw scores calculated as the average of component items are then standardized using linear transformation to a score ranging from 0-100. Higher score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL. A high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., Changes in baseline at the Final RT appointment, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month and 18 month
Comparability of Visualization of the Fiducial Marker and TraceIT Hydrogel, Scores for the visualization of the fiducial marker and TraceIT hydrogel., 2-5 weeks assessment post procedure|TraceIT Stability and Space Measurements, The stability of TraceIT was measured as the minimum distance from the fiducial marker to TraceIT gel. Space measurements were taken before and after TraceIT was injected, which measured the preduodenal space using the axial view along the head of the HOP., Pre-TraceIT and Post-TraceIT procedure, up to 2-6 weeks follow-up post radiation therapy|Changes From Baseline Final RT Appointment, 3 Months, 6 Months, 12 Months, and 18 Months in QLQ-PAN26, The QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire is a survey designed to assess patient-reported symptoms of patients undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer. All of the scales and single item measures range in score from 0-100. A high score for the symptom scales and/or single items represents a high level of symptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for the functional scales represents a high level of functioning., Changes from baseline final RT appointment, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months in QLQ-PAN26
