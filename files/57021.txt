Pilot Prehabilitation Intervention in Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in Canada and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Patients diagnosed at earlier (non-metastatic) stages are potential candidates for surgical tumor removal. However, they often present with poor nutritional status and physical function adding to the major catabolic stress imposed by surgery that negatively impacts recovery and survival after surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential benefits of a prehabilitation program that includes a combined nutritional supplement (whey protein, leucine, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids) with exercise and relaxation techniques for 4 weeks before surgery and continued for 8 weeks after surgery on functional pre- and postoperative outcomes, versus standard hospital care (control). Investigators will study whether the prehabilitation program improves physical performance, muscle mass and quality of life in patients undergoing lung cancer resection. The specific objective of this pilot study is to test feasibility and adherence to intervention, and generate pilot data to inform the design of a larger trial.

RATIONALE: The preoperative period is an opportune time to actively engage and empower patients in improving their functional, nutritional and mental status in anticipation of the surgical stress. Considering that lung cancer patients often present with poor nutritional status and physical function prior to surgery providing a nutritional supplement to increase protein, leucine, vitamin D and omega-3 FA intake with a structured exercise program and relaxation techniques should improve muscle mass, strength and physical performance.

MAIN OBJECTIVE: to test the effect of a multimodal prehabilitation intervention (MM) combining a mixed-nutrient supplement with structured exercise training against standard of care (SOC), on functional pre- and postoperative outcomes in surgical patients with lung cancer, in an open-label RCT.

The present is a pilot study aiming to generate feasibility data (recruitment rate, compliance, attrition) and preliminary outcome data to support a larger trial.

STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, randomized, controlled trial of two parallel arms: multimodal intervention (MM) and standard of care (SOC). After baseline assessment, patients will be randomized to either group in a 1:2 SOC:MM ratio using a computer-generated randomization scheme by block of four, with stratification by sex and functional capacity (\< or \> 400 m on the 6MWT). Consecutive adult patients scheduled for elective video-assisted thoracic surgery or open thoracotomy surgery of NSCLC stages I, II or IIIa, will be approached following their first appointment with their surgeon at the MUHC-Montreal General Hospital.

INTERVENTION: The EXP arm will ingest a multi-nutrient supplement consisting of whey protein + leucine and fish oil + vitamin D, perform structured exercise and relaxation techniques for 4 weeks prior to surgery and 8 weeks after surgery. Control group will received standard hospital care and education on benefits of physical activity and healthy diet. Outcome assessment will be performed at baseline, preoperative, 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively.

OUTCOMES: Primary: feasibility; Secondary: physical function, muscle strength, volume and density, body composition, quality of life, length of stay and post-operative complications; Other: dietary intake, physical activity, clinical markers.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: This is a pilot study designed to generate data on feasibility and compliance to the intervention and study tests; it is not powered for identifying statistical differences in the main outcomes. The investigators will recruit 36 participants on a 1:2 ratio (12 SOC: 24 MM).
