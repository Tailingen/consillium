Sirolimus for Injection (Albumin-bound) in Combination With Endocrine Therapy for HR+/HER2- Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Who Have Failed Standard Therapy
This study is a multicenter, open, non-randomized phase II clinical trial consisting of a safety introduction phase followed by a single-arm phase 2 phase. This phase II trial enrolled patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had failed aromatase inhibitor (AI)/fulvestrant ± CDK4/6i. Pts failing prior AI ± CDK4/6i received nab-Sirolimus + fulvestrant, while those failing fulvestrant ± CDK4/6i received nab-Sirolimus + AI.
