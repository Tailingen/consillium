Early Intervention for Impairments Identified During Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Patients With Bladder Cancer
A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a set of tests used to evaluate a patient's medical, social, and functional status, and can identify impairments in these domains that may not be noticed otherwise. Prior studies have shown that a CGA can accurately predict which patients are more likely to have serious side effects from cancer treatment. However, it is unknown whether interventions can be done to address the impairments found during a CGA in order to reduce the risk of these side effects. This pilot study will test the feasibility of targeted interventions for deficits identified during a CGA in patients 65 years or older with bladder cancer that have not yet started treatment.

OTHER: Targeted Interventions for Impairments Identified During Geriatric Assessment
Patient interest in impairment-directed interventions, To establish patient interest in referral for interventions based on impairments found during geriatric assessment within an outpatient genitourinary oncology clinic. Success will be at least 75% of patients accepting referral for indicated interventions., 1 year
This study will enroll patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer that have not yet started systemic cancer treatment. The participants will complete a CGA and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures at baseline. Based on any impairments found during the CGA, participants will be referred to specialists to help address these difficulties. Participants will complete the CGA and PRO measures again at 3 months and 1 year after the initial assessment. The goal of this study is to see if patients with advanced bladder cancer are interested in referrals to specialists to address their impairments, and whether participants attend those appointments.
