GLAD-AML - Glasdegib (Pf-04449913) With Two Standard Decitabine Regimens for Older Patients With Poor-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This multi-center, randomized phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the complete remission (including complete remission with incomplete count recovery) rates of glasdegib in combination with either decitabine on a 5-day or 10-day schedule in patients with newly-diagnosed poor-risk AML who either refuse or are ineligible for intensive therapy.
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA
DRUG: Glasdegib|DRUG: Decitabine
CR/CRi, The complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) combined rate will be defined by the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) AML response criteria., Up to 2 years
OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to date of death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|EFS, Event-free survival (EFS) will be monitored up to 2 years., Up to 2 years|RFS, Relapse-free survival (RFS) will be monitored up to 2 years., Up to 2 years|Time to CR/CRi, The time to complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) will be collected as a secondary outcome., Up to 2 years|Duration of CR/CRi, The duration of complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) will be collected as a secondary outcome., Up to 2 years|Bone Marrow Mutational Clearance, Bone marrow mutational clearance of frequently-mutated genes in AML (e.g. NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, RUNX1, TET2, IDH1/2) via next-generation DNA sequencing will be monitored up to 2 years., Up to 2 years
The primary objective of this multi-center, randomized phase 2 study is to determine the response rates, complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.

There are two secondary objectives for this study. The first secondary objective is to evaluate the toxicity and safety profiles of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML. The other secondary objective is to determine the event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, bone marrow mutational clearance, and remission clonality of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.
