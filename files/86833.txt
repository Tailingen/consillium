A Study to Assess Overall Survival and Treatment Patterns for Advanced Liver Cancer Participants Who Received Nivolumab Therapy
A study to describe real-world treatment patterns and overall survival in advanced liver cancer participants who received second or third line nivolumab therapy
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Treatment patterns, Nivolumab second and third lines of therapy will be described including prior lines of therapy, duration of nivolumab therapy and time from aHCC diagnosis date to first nivolumab treatment, From aHCC diagnosis date to first nivolumab treatment (Up to 7.75 years)|Overall Survival, The initial second or third line nivolumab therapy date will be used as the start date for the OS analysis. Occurrence of death will be considered as event and the duration for event will be calculated as time from 2L or 3L nivolumab therapy date to death date. Patients who survived will be censored and their duration period will be the time between the initial 2L or 3L nivolumab therapy date and the last date of their post-period follow up, From start date of 2L and 3L nivolumab therapy to the date of death (Up to 7.75 years)
The central aims of this study are descriptive and designed to describe the patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival in advanced liver cancer participants who received second or third line nivolumab therapy in the real-world setting.
