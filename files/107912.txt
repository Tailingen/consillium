Identification of Novel High Quality Methylated DNA Markers in Renal Tumors: Whole Methylome Discovery, Tissue Validation, and Feasibility Testing in Blood and Urine, the INQUIRE Study
This study is being done to collect blood, tissue and urine samples to identify a novel high quality methylated DNA marker in patients with renal tumors.

OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Identify novel methylated DNA markers in tissue for malignant renal and urothelial tumors, Assessed by the number of markers identified using unbiased whole methylome sequencing (RRBS). Top candidates will be validated in independent tissue. Potential markers will have relatively low background and a false discovery rate 20%., Baseline (at enrollment)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. In tissue, to discover and validate DNA methylation markers (MDMs) for detection of malignant renal and urothelial tumors.

II. In blood, to assess the accuracy of candidate MDMs from above for detection of malignant renal and urothelial tumors.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Participants may undergo blood, urine, and tissue sample collection on study. Participants' medical records are also reviewed.
