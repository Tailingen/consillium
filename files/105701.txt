European Trial of Free Light Chain Removal by Extended Haemodialysis in Cast Nephropathy
Hypothesis: Free light chain removal haemodialysis will increase the rate of renal recovery in patients with cast nephropathy, severe renal failure and de novo multiple myeloma.

This study will randomise patients with multiple myeloma and severe renal failure to treatment to remove free light chains by haemodialysis or not.
Multiple Myeloma|Cast Nephropathy|Kidney Failure
DEVICE: FLC removal HD (Gambro HCO 1100)|PROCEDURE: Standard dialysis on a high flux ployflux dialyser
Independence of haemodialysis at 3 months from enrollment (eGFR > 15mls/min/1.73m2 at 2 weeks after last dialysis session), 3 months from enrollment
Efficiency of extended HD with respect to reduced sFLC concentrations; duration of HD before renal recovery; multiple myeloma response to chemotherapy and suitability for stem cell transplantation; mortality over 24 months observation period, 24 months
The EUropean trial of free LIght chain removal by exTEnded haemodialysis in cast nephropathy (EuLITE) trial is a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open label clinical trial to investigate the clinical benefit of FLC removal haemodialysis in patients with cast nephropathy, dialysis dependent renal failure and de novo multiple myeloma. Recruitment commenced in May 2008, in total 90 patients will be recruited. Participants will be randomised, centrally, upon enrolment, to either trial chemotherapy and FLC removal haemodialysis or trial chemotherapy and standard high flux haemodialysis. Trial chemotherapy is a modified PAD regime, consisting of bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone. FLC removal haemodialysis is undertaken using two Gambro HCO 1100 dialysers in series, over an intensive treatment schedule. The primary outcome for the study is independence of dialysis at 3 months. Secondary outcomes are: duration of dialysis, reduction in serum FLC concentrations; myeloma response and survival.
