The first 5 items were scored on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS ranging from 0=none to 10=very severe. Quantitative morning stiffness was scored on a 10cm VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The 2 scores for qualitative and quantitative morning stiffness were averaged, and the total BASDAI score was the average of the 5 scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity and an improvement of 50% from baseline is considered clinically meaningful.
