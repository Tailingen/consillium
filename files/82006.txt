Hypofractionated Radiosurgery for Localised Prostate Cancer (HYPOSTAT-II)
Hypofractionated radiosurgery has been investigated in a few trials and appears to be safe and feasible.

Investigators initiated this multicenter phase II prospective trial to analyse feasibility (toxicity) of hypofractionated radiosurgery with 5 fractions in patients with localised prostate cancer under the hypothesis that the ratio of patients with late toxicity â‰¥ grade 2 after 3 years amounts 4.1% and is significant lower than 12.3% and 8.7% currently.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiosurgery
Late toxicity measured with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-(RTOG)-Score, 3, 6-9, 12-15 months and thereafter annually for 4 years after radiotherapy
Acute toxicity analysed by Adverse Event (AE)- and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)-reports., 4-6 weeks after radiotherapy; 3, 6-9, 12-15 months after radiotherapy thereafter annually for 4 years after radiotherapy|Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), At the time of inclusion; 4-6 weeks after radiotherapy; 3, 6-9, 12-15 months after radiotherapy thereafter annually for 4 years after radiotherapy|International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), At the time of inclusion; 4-6 weeks after radiotherapy; 3, 6-9, 12-15 months after radiotherapy thereafter annually for 4 years after radiotherapy|EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30, At the time of inclusion; 12-15 months after radiotherapy thereafter annually for 4 years after radiotherapy
Experimental radiosurgery of prostate with 5 fractions each with 7,00 Gy (total application rate of 35,00 Gy).

Planned visits are: Baseline, visits at every radiation day and eight follow ups (4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter after last day of radiation).
