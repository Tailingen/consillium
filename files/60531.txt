68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT for Early Assessment of Response to Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Resectable NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT in early evaluation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy response in resectable NSCLC.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT
Major Pathological Response (MPR), Defined as the incidence rate in postoperative pathology where the percentage of surviving tumor cells in the tumor bed is â‰¤ 10%, regardless of the presence or absence of live tumor cells in the lymph nodes., MPR will be assessed within 3 weeks after surgery
It is challenging to noninvasively early evaluate the immunotherapy response of cancer. The study will evaluate the application value of 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT in the early evaluation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy response in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Potential participants will be assessed for inclusion, including the verification of clinical stage and eligibility. Eligible patients with clinically stage IB-IIIA NSCLC will be received standardized neoadjuvant immunotherapy (every 3 weeks for 3 cycles). Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC will be received pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed, and lung squamous cell carcinoma patients will be received pembrolizumab plus platinum-paclitaxel. 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT imaging will be performed at baseline and before cycle 3. Pathological response of the primary (MPR vs. Non-MPR), imaging response (iPR vs. Non-iPR; MR vs. MD), and 68Ga-grazytracer PET/CT imaging (Positive vs. Negative) will be given special attention.
