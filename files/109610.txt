Community Activation for Prevention (CAPs): A Study of Community Gardening
The investigators previous studies show that community gardening is associated with reduction of key health behaviors for cancer prevention in diverse populations. Community gardeners eat more fruits and vegetables per day, are more physically active, and are more likely to avoid age-associated increase in body mass index (BMI). The effect is partially explained by the finding that gardeners are more socially involved, and feel more social support than non-gardeners.

The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine whether community gardening improves cancer-preventive behaviors among a multi-ethnic, low-income adult population and elucidate the pathways that shape cancer-preventive behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that the observed behavioral differences are due to the effect of gardening as an intervention rather than self-selection by gardeners.

BEHAVIORAL: Community Garden Intervention
Change in fruit and vegetable intake from baseline at 20 weeks and 52 weeks, 9 24-hour diet recalls will be collected randomly, Measurements will occur during weeks 1-2 (3 random recalls) and week 20 (3 random recalls) and week 48 (3 random recalls)|Change in sedentary time from baseline at 20 weeks and 48 weeks, Accelerometers will be adhered to thigh and collect data for 7 days, 3 measurements over one year, T1 (week 1), T2 (week 20), T3 (week 52)|Change in fiber Intake from baseline at 20 weeks and 52 weeks, 9 24-hour diet recalls will be collected randomly, Measurements will occur during weeks 1-2 (3 random recalls) and week 20 (3 random recalls) and week 48 (3 random recalls)|Change in Healthy Eating Index (HEI) from baseline at 20 weeks and 52 weeks, 9 24-hour diet recalls will be collected randomly, Measurements will occur during weeks 1-2 (3 random recalls) and week 20 (3 random recalls) and week 48 (3 random recalls)|Change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from baseline to 20 weeks, Accelerometers will be adhered to thigh and collect data for 7 days, 3 measurements over one year, T1 (week 1), T2 (week 20), T3 (week 52)|Change in waist circumference from baseline to 20 weeks and 52 weeks, Measurement of waist circumference (cm), 3 measurements over one year, T1 (week 1), T2 (week 20), T3 (week 52)|Change in weight (kg) from baseline to 20 weeks and 52 weeks, Objective measurement of weight will be collected, 3 measurements over one year, T1 (week 1), T2 (week 20), T3 (week 52)
