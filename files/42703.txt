Trial Comparing Prone and Supine Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) After Breast-conserving Surgery in Patients With Large Breast Volume at High Risk for Skin Toxicity and Fibrosis
84 patients with a cup size C or more will be randomized to receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy in supine or prone position.
Breast Carcinoma

acute moist desquamation, weekly during radiotherapy and 1 month after radiotherapy
Acute skin toxicity other than moist desquamation, weekly during radiotherapy and 1 month after radiotherapy|Late skin toxicity, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after radiotherapy|skin and lung fibrosis assessed with computed tomography, before radiotherapy and 1 month and 1 year after radiotherapy|Quality of life, at 1 year and 2 years after radiotherpay|dose-volume parameters, of planning|time of treatment delivery, daily during radiotherapy|single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with skin toxicity and breast fibrosis, 1 blood sample before radiotherapy
84 patients with a cup size C or more will be randomized to receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy in supine or prone position.
