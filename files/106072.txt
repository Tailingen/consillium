Wide Field OCT + AI for Positive Margin Rates in Breast Conservation Surgery.
This is a multi-center, randomized, two-arm study designed to measure the effectiveness of the SELENE system in reducing the number of unaddressed positive margins in breast lumpectomy procedures when used in addition to standard intraoperative margin assessment.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Selene
The occurrence of at least one unaddressed positive margin for a subject., Within-subject comparison of the occurrence of subjects with at least one positive margin., Pathology report finalization date, usually 3-7 days post-surgery
The number of unaddressed positive margins per subject., The average number of unaddressed positive margins per subject., Pathology report finalization date, usually 3-7 days post-surgery|False Positive Shaves Per Subject, The number of false-positive shaves per subject with use of SELENE., Pathology report finalization date, usually 3-7 days post-surgery|Margin-level effectiveness (National Guidelines), Margin-level effectiveness of SELENE based on recorded clinical decisions with "ground truth" determined based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), and the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASRO) Guidelines (device arm Part B only- all margins), Pathology report finalization date, usually 3-7 days post-surgery|Margin-level effectiveness (Histopathology), Margin-level effectiveness of SELENE based on recorded clinical decisions with "ground truth" determined based on histopathological presence of disease at 2 mm or less based on visible tissue depth using OCT (device arm Part B only- all margins), Pathology report finalization date, usually 3-7 days post-surgery
Safety Outcome - Adverse Events, Assessed by recording all adverse events for the duration of the study and then analyzing by seriousness, severity, and device/SELENE procedure-relatedness., Throughout study duration|Safety Outcome - Patient Reported Outcome, Pre- and Post-operative satisfaction with breasts using the Satisfaction with Breasts subscale score of the BCT module of the patient-reported outcomes measurement instrument BREAST-Q., Prior to index surgical visit and between 4-12 weeks post-surgical date
