Safety and Effectiveness of Novel Nitroglycerin Based Catheter Lock Solution
The objective of this Phase I/II pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a non- antibiotic chelator based lock solution that contains nitroglycerin in combination with sodium citrate and ethanol (NiCE lock solution) for prevention of central line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

* The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and estimate the rate of adverse events associated with the NiCE lock solution.
* The second primary objective is to estimate the rate of CLABSI in patients receiving the NiCE lock solution.

DRUG: Nitroglycerin-citrate-ethanol (NiCE)
Number of Participants With Drug-Related Hypotension, Drug-related hypotension is defined as a significant drop in measured blood pressure (BP) that exceeds the normal BP variability of a patient by 30%, that is associated with clinical signs and symptoms (dizziness and syncope) and is unexplained by factors other than the lock solution (such as other antihypertensive drugs, sepsis, bleeding). BP variability will be based on the standard deviation (SD) of a patient's blood pressure measured in the 3 days preceding participation in this trial and will be calculated at the time of trial entry., From date of randomization until date of first Drug-Related Hypotension within 10 minutes of each flush, assessed up to 60 days
Incidence of Catheter-Associated Infections, Catheter-Associated Infections will be measured by microbiological culture defined as either Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) as defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), particularly in neutropenic patients, or Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), particularly in non-neutropenic patients, 60 Days
