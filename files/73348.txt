Oral AHR Antagonist in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With PD-1 Resistant Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer
This is a phase 1b study in adult patients diagnosed with resistant or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) designed to assess the safety and tolerability of IK-175 in combination with nivolumab. Disease response, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and response biomarkers will also be assessed.
