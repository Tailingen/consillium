Clinical Evaluation of BCDx for Monitoring of Recurrence in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
BCDx is a urine-based multi-omic assay for early cancer recurrence detection in patients with a history of bladder cancer. This prospective, blinded study evaluates its efficacy in detecting recurrent NMIBC, offering a noninvasive monitoring solution.
Bladder Cancer
Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of BCDx (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such by the gold standard), Participants' urine samples will be collected before cystoscopy and analyzed using the BCDx test within 6 months to establish its overall performance characteristics.
BCDx is a urine-based multi-omic/multiplex molecular assay offers a promising solution for detecting cancer recurrence. It is intended for use as a noninvasive method for monitoring for tumor recurrence in conjunction with cystoscopy inpatients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer. This is a, multicenter, prospective, blinded study to evaluate the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of a novel multi-omics test for the detection of recurrent NMIBC in patients with a history of bladder cancer undergoing surveillance.
