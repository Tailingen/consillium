SpaceOAR System Pivotal Study
Evaluate the safety of the SpaceOAR System when the hydrogel is injected between the rectum and prostate in men undergoing radiation therapy (IG-IMRT)
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: SpaceOAR System
Number of Subjects Achieving a Reduction of 25% or Greater in Percent Volume of the Rectum Receiving at Least 70 Gy Measured From CT Scans Acquired Pre and Post SpaceOAR Hydrogel Injection, Measurements calculated and documented by the Core Lab. Measurements performed with the Core Lab blinded to subject identification. Results based on the Core Lab computation are considered as primary., 3 months post index procedure|Percentage of Subjects Experiencing Grade 1 or Greater Rectal or Procedure Adverse Events Post Index Procedure, The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of Grade 1 or greater rectal adverse events or procedure adverse events in the 6 months following the Index Procedure. The numbers reflect the percent of subjects in each arm/group that experienced grade 1 or greater rectal or procedure adverse events post index procedure., 6 months post index procedure
Percentage of Subjects Experiencing Grade 2 or Greater Rectal or Procedure Adverse Events in the 6 Months Following the Index Procedure, The numbers reflect the percent of subjects in each arm/group that experienced grade 2 or greater rectal or procedure adverse events post index procedure., 6 months post index procedure|Change From Baseline in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Score Following Index Procedure, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive survey instrument designed to assesses the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprises four domains. Scores for each domain (urinary, sexual, bowel, hormonal) range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating improved quality of life. Scores are reported as mean change from baseline at each time point., 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 15 months|Percentage of Subjects Requiring at Least One Medication Change for Mitigation of Rectal or Urinary Symptoms or for Procedure-related Events in the 6 Months Following the Index Procedure, The numbers reflect the percent of subjects in each arm/group that required at least one medication change to treat rectal or urinary symptoms in the 6 months post index procedure., 6 months post procedure|Number of SpaceOAR Subjects Experiencing a Procedure-Related Adverse Event (AE) Prior to Initiation of Radiation Therapy, An event was classified as a Procedure AE if it occurred during during and immediately after the Index Procedure or was deemed to be associated with the Index Procedure by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Per protocol subjects were to begin intensity modulated radiation therapy within 21 days following fiducial marker and/or SpaceOAR placement., 21 days post index procedure, prior to initiation of radiation therapy|Number of Subjects Experiencing a Delay in Radiation Therapy Associated With a Procedure or Device-Related Adverse Event, All subjects begin Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) within 21 days following index procedure (Fiducial Marker Placement with or without SpaceOAR Hydrogel Injection)., 21 days post index procedure
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the SpaceOAR System when the hydrogel is injected between the rectum and prostate in men undergoing radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) and to evaluate whether use of the SpaceOAR hydrogel results in a reduction of radiation exposure to the anterior rectum.
