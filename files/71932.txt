Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide, Celecoxib, and Fenofibrate in Relapsed or Progressive Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Thalidomide, celecoxib, and fenofibrate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Celecoxib also may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with thalidomide, celecoxib, and fenofibrate may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving etoposide and cyclophosphamide together with thalidomide, celecoxib, and fenofibrate works in treating young patients with relapsed or progressive cancer.

Therapy Completion Rate, Proportion of patients alive at 27 weeks without progressive disease (PD) and having tolerated therapy. As appropriate for tumor type and location, gadolinium-enhanced MRI and other imaging modalites were used to assess response. Progressive disease was defined as \>/=25% increase in product of diameters, development of new areas of disease, or disease-attributable clinical deterioration or death, progressive disease. For patients with leukemia PD was defined as \>/=25% or \>/=5,000 cells/mm3 increase in number of circulating cells, development of extramedullary disease, or other clinical evidence of progression., 27 weeks
27-Week Progression-Free Survival, 27-week progression-free survival is the probability of patients remaining alive and progression-free at 27-weeks from study entry estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. As appropriate for tumor type and location, gadolinium-enhanced MRI and other imaging modalites were used to assess response. Progressive disease was defined as \>/=25% increase in product of diameters, development of new areas of disease, or disease-attributable clinical deterioration or death, progressive disease. For patients with leukemia PD was defined as \>/=25% or \>/=5,000 cells/mm3 increase in number of circulating cells, development of extramedullary disease, or other clinical evidence of progression., Assessed every 9 weeks on treatment and annually until death or initiation of new therapy, up to 27 weeks.|27-Week Overall Survival, 27-week overall survival is the probability of patients remaining alive at 27-weeks from study entry estimated using with Kaplan-Meier methods., Assessed every 9 weeks on treatment and annually until death or initiation of new therapy, up to 27 weeks.|Best Response, As appropriate for tumor type and location, gadolinium-enhanced MRI and other imaging modalites were used to assess response. Best response was regarded as best response at any single assessment. Response was defined as follows: complete resolution of all demonstrable tumor, complete response (CR); \>/=50% decrease in the product of the 2 maximum perpendicular diameters relative to the baseline evaluation, partial response (PR); \<50% decrease and \<25% increase in product of diameters, stable disease (SD); and \>/=25% increase in product of diameters, development of new areas of disease, or disease-attributable clinical deterioration or death, progressive disease (PD). For patients with leukemia PD was defined as \>/=25% or \>/=5,000 cells/mm3 increase in number of circulating cells, development of extramedullary disease, or other clinical evidence of progression., Assessed at study entry, every 9 weeks on treatment and at treatment discontinuation, up to 27 weeks.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the activity of etoposide, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, celecoxib, and fenofibrate, in terms of prolonging the time to disease progression, in young patients with relapsed or progressive cancer.

Secondary

* Determine, preliminarily, the biologic activity of this regimen, in terms of tumor response and overall survival, in these patients.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Evaluate different radiographic techniques as markers of tumor response in these patients.
* Evaluate the predictive ability of in vitro correlative studies as markers of tumor response.

STATISTICAL DESIGN: Patients were classified into one of 8 strata according to diagnosis: leukemia/lymphoma, bone tumors, neuroblastoma, high grade glial tumors, low grade glial tumors, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/PNET, and miscellaneous. A two-stage design for each disease stratum was planned. The accrual goal at the end of the two-stage design was 20 subjects for each stratum. A stopping rule was applied after the accrual of the first 10 eligible subjects enrolled in each disease stratum. If 1 or more patients in the first 10 evaluable patients were alive and progression-free at 27 weeks and have tolerated therapy then accrual to stage two would proceed. Among 20 patients within a stratum, if 3 or more patients met primary endpoint then regimen would be considered successful. The probability of concluding the treatment is feasible is 0.95 if true success rate is 30% and 0.07 if true succes rate is 5%. Overall accrual target was 80-160 patients.
