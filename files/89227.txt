MRI Parenchymal Enhancement: A New Marker of Breast Cancer Risk
The purpose of this study is to learn about how a woman's health history influences what a normal breast looks like on an MRI. The investigators also want to learn about how the amount of different natural hormones a woman has affects how the breast looks on an MRI. The investigator's hope is that this will help to find women at a high-risk of breast cancer.
Cancer Free Women
BEHAVIORAL: questionnaire
breast cancer risk factors and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE)., A comparison of the distribution of breast cancer risk factors in women with low and high levels of BPE. The relationship between risk factors and categories of BPE (minimal/mild/moderate/marked) will be determined using ordinal logistic regression., 1 year
relationship between BPE and serum hormone levels at the time of MRI, Determine the relationship between serum hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A4) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) at the time of MRI and degree of BPE in healthy high-risk postmenopausal women. The association between circulating serum hormone levels and BPE will be determined using linear regression., 1 year
