Dosimetric Limitation of Pelvic Bone and Peritoneal Space in Rectal Cancer Patients During Chemoradiotherapy
This project first retrospectively analyzes the intestinal dose indicators related to the concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy of rectal cancer and gastrointestinal toxicity, and the pelvic dose indicators related to hematological toxicity, and then prospectively conducts radiotherapy based on the dose indicators most closely related to toxicity. The dose is limited when the plan is made to reduce the gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity of rectal cancer with concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
