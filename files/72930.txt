SOX as Salvage Treatment in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOX regimen (S-1 plus oxaliplatin) as salvage treatment in patients with relapsed or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: S-1 plus oxaliplatin
Median progression-free survival, 1 year
Overall response rate, 6 weeks|Median overall survival, 1.5 year
The treatment option in patients with platinum-resistant relapsed or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is limited. Previous studies showed that both S-1 and oxaliplatin were effective in head and neck cancer. Moreover, SOX (S-1 plus oxaliplatin) was proved to be tolerable in advanced stage gastric cancer. Therefore, we aim to evaluate this regimen in salvage setting of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
