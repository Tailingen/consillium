Endocrine Outcome of Surgery for Pituitary Adenoma
Prospective and randomized compare between microsurgical and endoscopic transsphenoidal MRI assisted resection of pituitary adenomas.
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic resection|PROCEDURE: Microsurgical resection
endocrine function, Testing of pituitary function with insulin-hypoglycemic test, results will be dichotomized as satisfactory or not satisfactory. Satisfactory outcome is defined, if pituitary function improves or is stable, if compared to preoperative testing., 1 year after surgery
Extent of resection, Volumetric analysis of tumor volume before the surgery, intraoperatively and 3 months after surgery will be performed. Gross total resection is defined as no tumor present in gadolinium enhanced T1 sequences, tumor volume before the surgery, 3 months after surgery|Quality of Life, EQ-5D, EQ-5D will be evaluated before surgery, after the surgery in 3 months and after 1 year., 3 months and 1 year after surgery
The main aim of the study is to compare microsurgical and endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery and to determine endocrine outcome. Secondary extent of resection and quality of life will be evaluated.
