Oxford Ovarian Cancer Predict Chemotherapy Response 01
The purpose of the study is to understand why there are differences between individuals in the way they respond to paclitaxel chemotherapy.
Ovarian Cancer
Correlation between βIII tubulin expression and Mitotic Index (MI) following single agent paclitaxel treatment, Correlation between βIII tubulin expression and Mitotic Index (MI) before and after single agent paclitaxel treatment to determine whether overexpression of βIII tubulin is associated with Paclitaxel resistance, Before and 24-hours after paclitaxel treatment
Correlation between mitotic index and the magnitude of CA125 response, Correlation between mitotic index and the magnitude of CA125 response will be analysed to investigate whether post-paclitaxel mitotic index is a determinant of clinical response in ovarian cancer, three weeks after paclitaxel treatment
While paclitaxel is very effective in killing cancer cells in a proportion of patients, some patients don't respond to this treatment. As with any chemotherapy, paclitaxel is associated with unpleasant side effects. We are doing this study to try and understand what is happening in cancer cells in different individuals after paclitaxel treatment that make them respond differently to the same treatment. We hope that this study will enable us to develop a method to identify women who are suitable for this form of treatment. We also want to understand why some cancer cells don't get killed with paclitaxel. This information will help us to select treatment to suit an individual patient, and thus improve the outcome of treatment and avoid giving treatment that will not benefit the patient.
