Lifestyle-modifying Interventions in Low-risk MDS Patients
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired clonal stem cell diseases characterized by hematopoietic cell dysplasia, cytopenia, and the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. In addition to clonal changes in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells itself, growing evidence suggests that inflammatory and metabolic changes in the bone marrow microenvironment play an important role in disease development and maintenance of the malignant clone. The positive impact of dietary interventions (e.g. fasting) and physical activity on inflammation and metabolic parameters could be shown in various benign inflammatory disease entities (e.g. atherosclerosis, chronic renal insufficiency, cystic fibrosis etc.).

The aim of this study is to describe the hematological, metabolic, inflammatory, and microbiological changes after combined lifestyle-modifying interventions (outpatient physiotherapy and fasting mimicking diet (FMD) in patients with low-risk MDS.
