A Study of BL-B01D1 Combined With Lenvatinib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is a clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of BL-B01D1 combined with lenvatinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: BL-B01D1|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of CR and PR in the treatment and control groups divided by the number of that group in the full analysis set (FAS)., Up to approximately 24 months|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of BL-B01D1., Up to approximately 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by BICR is defined as the time between the date subjects are randomized and the first observation of disease progression (based on BICR's image-based assessment) or death., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) : Percentage of all randomized subjects who rated the best overall response (BOR) as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and disease stabilization (SD) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the period from the date when tumor response is first recorded to the date when objective tumor progression is first recorded or the date of death., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-B01D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-B01D1., Up to approximately 24 months
