Organoids From Metastases of Prostate Cancer
The aim of the study is the development of the organoid culture technique from metastases from patients with advanced form of prostate cancer. Once the technique is set up, the organoid will serve to test several antitumor molecules.
Prostatic Neoplasm
OTHER: extended biopsy
Success rate of establishment of the organoid culture, The success rate is defined by the rate of successful cell culture. A Cell culture is successful when organoids grow from dividing cells, 15 days
Drugs testing on organoid for cell viability, Viable cell count in different cells culture conditions using Cell titer Glo and viable cell count using typan blue, 20 days|Cell Apoptosis Molecular and cellular mechanisms of drugs responses, Apoptosis biomarkers analysis in microscopy. Caspase 3 will be assess using microspcopy ., 20 days|Cell proliferation Molecular and cellular on mechanisms of drugs responses, Proliferative biomarkers analysis in microscopy. Ki67 will be assess using microspcopy ., 20 days
