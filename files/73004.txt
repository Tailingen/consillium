Elderly CAncer Patient
The management of older patients with cancer has become a major public health concern in Western countries because of the aging of the population and steady increase in cancer incidence with advancing age. Cancer treatment of aged patients is complex due to comorbidities, polypharmacy and functional status. The heterogeneity of the older population in terms of comorbidities and functional status may explain the difficulty in establishing management recommendations.

Study hypothesis is that a geriatric consultation using Geriatric Assessment (GA) can evaluate patient's resource and strengths, in order to help oncologist to define the most effective treatment. The GA developed by geriatricians and recommended by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG), is a multidimensional assessment of general health status; comorbidities; functional status; nutritional, cognitive, psychological, and social parameters; and medications. The GA uses validated geriatric scales to produce an inventory of problems, which can then serve to develop an individualized geriatric intervention plan; it may be an important step in selecting elderly patients for cancer screening and treatment.

The objectives are:

* To assess the role of GA for decision making process for older patients with cancer
* To identify geriatric and oncologic factors associated with overall survival, treatment feasibility, toxicities, morbidities
* To develop and/or validate screening tests for frailty in geriatric oncology
* To develop and validate frailty classifications

Method: The ELCAPA (ELderly CAncer PAtient) survey is a French multicentric prospective study that includes all patients age 70 years or older who has a diagnosis of solid cancer or hematologic malignancies in French hospitals
