Sintilimab Combined With Anlotinib for Perioperative Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Based on MRD Evaluation
To study the efficacy of sintilimab combined with anlotinib for perioperative non-small cell lung cancer. To explore the clearance effect of sintilimab combined with anlotinib for postoperative adjuvant therapy based on evaluating minimal residual disease.

DRUG: sintilimab combined with anlotinib|DRUG: sintilimab monotherapy
Major pathologic response (MPR), Residual tumor cells of the surgical specimens were ≤10% based on pathological evaluation., 2 months
Complete pathologic response (CPR), Residual tumor cells of the surgical specimens were 0% based on pathological evaluation., 2 months|Event free survival (EFS), Time from randomization to any of the following: disease progression; new primary NSCLC; death from any cause, 16 months|Overall survival (OS), Radiographic assessments were performed when enrolled and every 8 weeks until disease progression after chemotherapy according to RECIST version 1.1. After PD, collect the survival information every 16 weeks until death or withdrawal of study consent., 32 months
Patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a high postoperative recurrence rate. Perioperative treatment, which can improve the resection rate and clear the minimal residual disease, is the main mean of preventing recurrence, including preoperative neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant therapies. In recent years, immunotherapy can significantly improve the pathological remission rate and prolong the survival as a perioperative treatment. In addition to single-agent or combined chemotherapy, the exploration of immunotherapy with other therapeutic strategies is still lacking.

In 2018, we originally designed sintilimab combined with anlotinib in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

This clinical study plans to: ① apply the "de-chemotherapy" model to the perioperative phase of early NSCLC, ② explore sintilimab combined with anlotinib in preoperative neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant therapies, ③ explore clearance effect of sintilimab combined with anlotinib for postoperative adjuvant therapy based on evaluating minimal residual disease (MRD), in order to improve the efficacy of perioperative NSCLC and prolong survival.
