AXIOS Stent With Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the AXIOS Stent with Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic transenteric drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts.
Pancreatic Pseudocyst(s)
DEVICE: AXIOS Stent with Electrocautery Enhanced Delivery System
Safety/Adverse Event Outcome Measure 1, Freedom from access site-related bleeding requiring transfusion, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal|Safety/Adverse Event Outcome Measure 2, Freedom from access site-related infection requiring intravenous or intramuscular antibiotics and/or extended hospitalization, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal|Safety/Adverse Event Outcome Measure 3, Freedom from surgery for access-site related perforation, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal|Safety/Adverse Event Outcome 4, Freedom from stent migration/dislodgement into the pseudocyst or enteral lumen, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal|Safety/Adverse Event Outcome Measure 5, Freedom from tissue injury, defined as ulceration at site of stent implant as observed to persist through 1-week post-stent removal, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal|Safety/Adverse Event Outcome Measure 6, Freedom from serious adverse event associated with the AXIOS stent and/or (index) implant procedure, Index procedure through 1-week post-stent removal
Stent Retention Outcome Measure, Stent Retention: The stent must remain in place for up to 60 days, 30 or 60 days post-procedure|Lumen Patency Outcome Measure, Lumen Patency: The stent lumen must be patent at 30 days and/or 60 days of implantation., 30 and/or 60 days post-procedure|Technical Success Outcome Measure 1, Technical success: Successful placement of the AXIOS stent using the Electrocautery Enhanced AXIOS Delivery System, Index Procedure|Clinical Success Outcome Measure, Clinical success: At least a 50% decrease in pseudocyst size at 30 days or 60 days, 30 or 60 days post-procedure|Technical Success Outcome Measure 2, Technical Success: Successful removal of AXIOS stent using standard endoscopic snare or forceps, 30 or 60 Day Post-procedure
