This trial investigates the effectiveness of transoral head and neck surgery (TOS) for locally advanced, but transorally resectable oropharyngeal cancer followed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy versus primary radiochemotherapy (definitive chemoradiotherapy, CRTX). Both treatments are internationally accepted standards. The choice of the treatment strategy depends on the preference of the responsible attending physician and on the country of residence. Internationally, mostly definitive chemoradiotherapy is regarded as the standard of care for oropharyngeal cancer. In Germany, however, transoral surgical resection is also well established and commonly practiced. The key question therefore is whether one of the two therapies is more effective than the other in clinical daily routine under the given conditions of our health care system and with a realistic, non-ideal patient cohort. For this reason, a comparative effectiveness research (CER) concept will be applied in this setting. The aim of this trial is primarily to show a superiority of the surgical approach in terms of local and locoregional control and secondarily to compare functional outcome and quality of life.
