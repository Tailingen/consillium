Sequential PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor and LENvatinib in TLCT and Refractory Hepatoblastoma After Chemotherapy
This is a single arm, open-label trial studying the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor (e.g.pembrolizumab, Sintilimab,Duvarizumab，Camrelizumab )and lenvatinib given at the recommended dose in pediatric and young adolescent patients((5 year-old\<age\<14 year-old) with TLCT or refractory hepatoblastoma after chemotherapy.

DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor
Objective response rate (complete response/partial response), Determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. A responder is defined as a patient who achieves a best response of partial response or complete response on the study. Response rates will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patients who are responders, and confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wilson score interval method., up to 1 year|dynamic α-fetoprotein response (AFP-R), The AFP-R was measured as the difference between maximum and final pre-liver transplant/resection AFP level, if surgery is not possible, the final level of AFP would be measured as the AFP at 6 month., up to 6 months for unresectable.
Incidence and severity of study treatment-related adverse events measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5, oxicities will be defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5., up to 12 months|Health outcomes as assessed by the PROMIS® Pediatric Scale v1.0 Global Health 7+2 scores at baseline, prior to start of each cycle, and last trial visit, Each question will be rated from the following: Excellent (5) to Poor (1), Never (5) to Always (1), or Never (1) to Almost Always (5), up to 12 months
Transitional liver cell tumors exhibit an unusual phenotype with respect to clinical presentation, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and treatment response. These apparently novel, unusual, and aggressive tumors occurring in older children and adolescents may form a transition in the putative developmental pathway of hepatocarcinogenesis, and usually refractory, resistant to chemotherapy.

The sPLENTY-pc is a perspective cohort study, investigating the efficiency of sequential combined usage of PD-1 Inhibitor (e.g.pembrolizumab, Sintilimab,Camrelizumab ) or PD-L1 inhibitor (Duvarizumab) plus lenvatinib given at the recommended dose in pediatric \>5 year-old and young adult patients\<14 yo with TLCT or refractory hepatoblastoma after chemotherapy.
