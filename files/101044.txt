A Trial of Radial EBUS Versus VBN for the Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions
Peripheral pulmonary lesions are of growing importance in respiratory field. Early detection of lung cancer, tuberculosis and other diseases often needs a bronchoscopic investigation with different types of navigation. Current randomized clinical study is intended to compare three different modalities of navigation in bronchial tree - virtual bronchoscopy (VBN), radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and combination of both techniques.
Lung Cancer|Tuberculosis|Pneumonia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Virtual bronchoscopy navigation|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: radial EBUS
Diagnostic Efficacy of navigational bronchoscopy in each study arm, Incidence of final diagnoses confirmed by navigational bronchoscopy for each study arm, At the end of study enrollment
Efficacy of each endoscopic biopsy modality in confirmation of final diagnosis, Incidence of final diagnoses confirmed by navigational bronchoscopy for bronchoalveolar lavage, brush and transbronchial lung biopsy separately, At the end of study enrollment
Safety profile of each study arm, Incidence of complications reported at each study arm procedures, At the end of study enrollment
Current randomized clinical study is intended to compare three different modalities of navigation in bronchial tree - virtual bronchoscopy, radial EBUS and combination of both techniques. Around 300 patients with incidentally detected peripheral pulmonary lesions will be enrolled in 9 centers among Russia. All patients after obtaining an informed consent will be randomized in 1:1:1 fashion to three study groups depending on type of navigation technique used. All patients will undergone navigational bronchoscopy with rEBUS (group A), VBN (group B) and rEBUS+VBN (group C), data on diagnostic efficacy and safety of each modality of navigation will be analyzed.
