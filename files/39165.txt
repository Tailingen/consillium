CRi was defined as all CR criteria (bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L (1000/μL); platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L \[100 000/μL\]), except for residual neutropenia (\< 1.0 x 109/L \[1000/μL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100 x 109/L \[100 000/μL\])., From first dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose, or end of study, whichever was earlier; median (min, max) duration was 0.79 (0.79, 0.79) months.|Morphological Leukemia-free State (MLFS), MLFS was measured according to the 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria (Döhner et al, 2017). MLFS was defined as bone marrow blasts \< 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required., From first dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose, or end of study, whichever was earlier; median (min, max) duration was 0.79 (0.79, 0.79) months.|Partial Remission (PR), PR was measured according to the 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria (Döhner et al, 2017). PR was defined as all hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5 to 25%; and decrease of pre-treatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., From first dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose, or end of study, whichever was earlier; median (min, max) duration was 0.79 (0.79, 0.79) months.|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR was calculated for participants who achieved overall response (CRMRD-, CR, CRi, PR or MLFS). DoR was defined as time from the first observation indicating an objective response to the subsequent date of disease progression or death, whichever is earlier., From first dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose, or end of study, whichever was earlier; median (min, max) duration was 0.79 (0.79, 0.79) months.|Plasma Concentration of AMG 330, Pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 71 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=77 days), pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 50 of Cycles 2+ (Cycle 2+=57 days); end of infusion,0.5,2,4 and 8hrs post-infusion on Days 78 and 57 of Cycle 1 and 2 infusion-free periods respectively|Half-life of AMG 330, Pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 71 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=77 days), pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 50 of Cycles 2+ (Cycle 2+=57 days); end of infusion,0.5,2,4 and 8hrs post-infusion on Days 78 and 57 of Cycle 1 and 2 infusion-free periods respectively|Steady State Concentration of AMG 330, Pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 71 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=77 days), pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 50 of Cycles 2+ (Cycle 2+=57 days); end of infusion,0.5,2,4 and 8hrs post-infusion on Days 78 and 57 of Cycle 1 and 2 infusion-free periods respectively|Volume of Distribution of AMG 330, Pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 71 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=77 days), pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 50 of Cycles 2+ (Cycle 2+=57 days); end of infusion,0.5,2,4 and 8hrs post-infusion on Days 78 and 57 of Cycle 1 and 2 infusion-free periods respectively|Clearance of AMG 330, Pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 71 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=77 days), pre-dose, 6hrs post-dose Day 1 to 50 of Cycles 2+ (Cycle 2+=57 days); end of infusion,0.5,2,4 and 8hrs post-infusion on Days 78 and 57 of Cycle 1 and 2 infusion-free periods respectively|Number of Participants With Anti-AMG 330 Antibody Formation, From first dose of study treatment until 30 days after last dose, or end of study, whichever was earlier; median (min, max) duration was 0.79 (0.79, 0.79) months.
This study will assess the safety and tolerability of AMG 330 in combination with pembrolizumab and whether pembrolizumab will enhance the anti-AML activity of AMG 330. Both cohort 1 and 2 will include AMG 330 and pembrolizumab with the difference being the initiation date for pembrolizumab treatment.
