Multiparametric MRI for Prostate Cancer Localization and Characterization: New Methods
The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of several new MRI techniques (MR elastography, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadofosveset, and oscillating gradient diffusion) to determine the location, size, and grade of prostate carcinoma. Thirty patients with biopsy proven carcinoma awaiting prostatectomy will be included in the study. Ex-vivo MRI will also be conducted on the prostate specimen to obtain high resolution imaging correlates to both in-vivo MRI and whole mount prostatectomy specimens. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of these three techniques will increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: MRI with gadofosveset and MR elastography
Correlation coefficient, Correlation coefficient between the expected location and grade of prostate cancer as determined by each new MRI method compared with whole mount histological specimen using a 5 mm grid for spatial reference., This outcome measure will be assessed approximately 4 weeks following prostatectomy (an average of 8 weeks from time of enrolment).|Receiver operator characteristic curve for the prediction of prostate cancer for each new MRI method, This outcome measure will be assessed approximately 4 weeks following prostatectomy (an average of 8 weeks from time of enrolment).
