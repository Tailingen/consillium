Efficacy and Safety of Canakinumab for the Treatment of Anemia in LR-MDS Patients
Hematologic improvement of erythrocytes after 6 months of canakinumab treatment.
Anemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Canakinumab Injection
HI-E after 6 months of treatment, Erythroid response rate (HI-E) of canakinumab, 6 months
HI-E response duration, Duration of erythroid response rate will be measured up to loss of response or reaching end of study (after max. 3 years of treatment), up to three years|Number of (serious) adverse events, The safety profile of canakinumab will be described by collecting AE (adverse event) and SAE (serious adverse event) information up to the start of new treatment or reaching end of study (after max. 3 years of treatment). Special consideration will be laid on events that lead to treatment discontinuation., up to three years|Disease progression, Proportion of disease progression (after reaching PD at any time during the trial after primary end-point visit), after 24 weeks|Impact of canakinumab on quality of life by using the validated Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS), QoL assessment using the QUALMS questionnaire up to end of treatment:

38-item assessment tool for patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) QUALMS scores ranged from 24 to 99, with higher scores for better outcome, From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 36 months|Impact of canakinumab on quality of life by using the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), QoL assessment using the EORTC-C30 questionnaire up to end of treatment:

To assess patient-reported quality of life during canakinumab treatment: 30 questions assessing the quality of life of oncology patients across 10 subscales will be analyzed. All subscales have a score range from 0 to 100 points.

Function subscales: a higher score represents a higher quality of life. Symptoms subscales: higher score represents higher level of symptoms/problems, i.e., represents lower quality of life, From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 36 months
To study the erythroid response rate (HI-E) of canakinumab in patients with IPSS-R very low, low, or intermediate risk MDS or MDS/MPN after 6 months of treatment.
