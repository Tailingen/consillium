A Study of Furmonertinib Combined With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of NSCLC With Leptomeningeal Metastasis
Leptomeningeal metastasis is a fatal complication of advanced lung cancer. There is no standard treatment for leptomeningeal metastasis after third-generation EGFR-TKIs. The Furmonertinib prototype persists longer in brain tissue, and its metabolites can also penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Ommaya cystlateral ventricle chemotherapy can quickly control the progression of intracranial lesions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the LM progression-free survival (LM-PFS) of Furmonertinib combined with lateral ventricular chemotherapy in the treatment of leptomeningeal metastatic NSCLC after third-generation EGFR-TKIs resistance.
NSCLC
DRUG: Furmonertinib
LM-PFS（progression-free survival）, assessments, based on neuroimaging RANO-LM, Up to 2 years|LM-ORR（Objective response rate）, assessments, based on neuroimaging RANO-LM, Up to 2 years
LM-OS, defined as time from LM diagnosis to death due to any cause or last follow-up, Up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Occurrence and severity of AEs by NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to 2 years|PFS, Proportion of patients progression-free by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years
At present, there is still a lack of prospective, randomized clinical trials on the treatment of LM, most of which are small sample studies, retrospective analysis and clinical experience, with low level of evidence and limited clinical guidance. Improving the clinical outcome of patients with LM has become an urgent problem to be solved in clinical treatment. Our previous team has reported for the first time that Furmonertinib combined with lateral ventricular chemotherapy can not only effectively improve the neurological symptoms caused by LM, but also prolong the survival time of patients with limited and controllable side effects, which provides a new treatment approach for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC accompanied by LM. Therefore, based on the structural and pharmacological differences between the three generations of EGFR-TKIs, combined with Ommaya lateral ventricle chemotherapy can rapidly control the progression of intracranial lesions, The aim of this study is to explore whether double dose of Furmonertinib combined with Ommya intracapsular ventricle chemotherapy can provide survival benefits for advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC with leptomeningeal metastasis after third-generation EGFR-Tkis.
