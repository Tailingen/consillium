A Study of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, dose, immunogenicity and early clinical activity of GRT-C901 and GRT-R902, a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine, in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab, in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, and metastatic urothelial cancer.

Tumors harboring non-synonymous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations can present peptides containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of HLA on the tumor cell surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens capable of generating T-cell responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Sensitive detection of these mutations allows for the identification of neoantigens unique to each patient's tumor to be included in a personalized cancer vaccine that targets these neoantigens. This vaccine regimen uses two vaccine vectors as a heterologous prime/boost approach (GRT-C901 first followed by GRT-R902) to stimulate an immune response. This study will explore the safety and early clinical activity of this patient-specific immunotherapy intended to induce T-cell responses specific for neoantigens.
