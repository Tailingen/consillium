Efficacy of Ropivacaine (With Epinephrine) in BABA Endoscopic and Robotic Thyroidectomy
To assess the pain relief and the hemodynamic stability of ropivacaine with epinephrine in BABA endoscopic and robotic thyroidectomy.
Thyroid Neoplasm|Goiter
DRUG: Ropivacaine with epinephrine injection|OTHER: Placebo
NRS Pain Scores for the First 12 Hours, The numerical rating scale is utilized to assess the postoperative pain change for the first 12 hours according to location.

Range: 0(minimal pain, better outcome) \~ 10(maximum pain, worse outcome)

Unlike the general NRS pain score as reported in the "post-operative 48 hour" result which deals with post-operative discomfort in general, this outcome measures the pain score of the specific location in which flap dissection had taken place., Postoperative 12 hours
Maximum of Measured Systolic Blood Pressures, The maximal systolic blood pressure is monitored during surgery., participants were followed for the duration of the operation, an average of approximately 2.5 hours|Maximum of Measured Diastolic Blood Pressures, The maximal diastolic blood pressure is monitored during surgery., participants were followed for the duration of the operation, an average of approximately 2.5 hours|Maximum of Measured Heart Rates, The maximal heart rate is monitored during surgery., participants were followed for the duration of the operation, an average of approximately 2.5 hours|Blood Loss Amount, The blood loss amount is estimated at the end of surgery., participants were followed for the duration of the operation, an average of approximately 2.5 hours|Operation Time, The amount of time taken from start to the end of surgery, participants were followed for the duration of the operation, an average of approximately 2.5 hours|NRS Change, Change in NRS score a with time The numerical rating scale is utilized to assess the postoperative pain change for the first 12 hours according to location.

Range: 0(minimal pain, better outcome) \~ 10(maximum pain, worse outcome), 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 hours post operation|Pain Killer Dose, Change in pain killer usage with time, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 hours post operation
Diluted ropivacaine with epinephrine is injected into the subcutaneous space to relieve pain and reduce bleeding during procedures. The synergistic effect of ropivacaine with epinephrine can contribute to patients' welfare, such as relieving pain and structuring the hemodynamic stability.
