A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Preliminary Clinical Activity of RO7673396 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (RAS) Mutation(s)
This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO7673396 in participants with advanced solid tumors harboring RAS mutation(s). This study consists of two stages: Stage 1 (Dose Escalation) and Stage 2 (Dose Expansion). Stage 1 will define the recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs) of RO7673396. Stage 2 will evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of the RDE(s) defined in Stage 1 and of other doses of interest for future development in selected solid tumor indications.
