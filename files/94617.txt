Effects of Prehabilitation and Early Mobilization for Patients Undergoing Pancreas Surgery.
Open upper gastrointestinal surgery includes surgery in the upper abdomen such as ventricular, duodenal, pancreatic and biliary tract surgery. After upper abdominal surgery there is a risk of gastrointestinal and cardiopulmonary complications. There is currently insufficient knowledge about the effect of prehabilitation and extra early postoperative mobilization in upper pancreatic surgery.

This study's aim is to evaluate the effect of prehabilitation and extra early mobilization.

The study includes two substudies:

1. A prospective cohort of 75 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery after a prehabilitation program will be compared to 75 historical controls. Primary outcome is postoperative complications.
2. A randomized controlled trial based on 72 patients undergoing pancreatic studying the effect of extra early rehabilitation. The intervention group will be mobilized to bedside, standing or sitting in armchair \<6 hours after surgery, ie 3-4 hours after arrival at the Postoperative Department (PIVA). The control group will be mobilized according to routine i.e. the morning after surgery. Primary outcome is PaO2.
