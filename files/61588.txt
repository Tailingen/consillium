Study of Dasatinib in Children and Adolescents With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia
The purpose of this clinical research study was to establish a recommended phase 2 once daily (QD) dose of dasatinib and to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug for relapsed or refractory (resistant to previous treatment) leukemia in children and adolescents. The side effects that this oral investigational drug may have in children, and the levels of the drug in the blood, will be studied at different doses.

The purpose of this clinical research study was to establish a recommended phase 2 once daily (QD) dose of dasatinib and to assess the efficacy of the investigational drug for relapsed or refractory (resistant to previous treatment) leukemia in children and adolescents. The side effects that this oral investigational drug may have in children, and the levels of the drug in the blood, will be studied at different doses.
