Single-port versus multi-port robotic surgery for rectal cancer
Rectal Cancer Patients|Robotic Surgical Procedures
PROCEDURE: Single-port robotic total mesorectal excision|PROCEDURE: Multi-port robotic total mesorectal excision
Incidence of perioperative complications, Perioperative complications will be described using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTACAE) v. 4.03 criteria. Complications will refer to any medical occurrence directly attributed to the surgical procedure during and within the first 30 days., Intraoperative and postoperative 30 days|Number of participants with conversion procedures, The number of patients converted from robotic to open or laparoscopic surgery, Date of surgery (Day 1)
Pain scores, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores for patients on postoperative days 1-3, Postoperative days 1-3|Quality of specimen, As proposed and published by Quirke et al（Macroscopic evaluation of rectal cancer resection specimen: clinical significance of the pathologist in quality control. J Clin Oncol. 2002 Apr 1;20(7):1729-34.）, Date of surgery (Day 1)|Total length of incisions, Total length of all abdominal incisions (measured in millimeters)., Date of surgery (Day 1)
This study is a phase 2a clinical trial based on the IDEAL framework, which aims to evaluate the safety and short-term clinical efficacy of single-port robotic total mesorectal excision by comparing it with multi-port robotic total mesorectal excision. The primary endpoint is short-term clinical efficacy, including intraoperative complications, blood loss, conversion rate, operation time, postoperative complications within 30 days, time to first flatus after surgery, and postoperative hospital stay. Secondary endpoints include incision length, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for postoperative pain on days 1-3, completeness of mesorectal excision grading, positive circumferential resection margin rate, positive distal resection margin rate, and the number of harvested lymph nodes.
