A Study of AND019 in Women With ER Positive HER2 Negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a first in human dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of AND019 in postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \[HER2\]-negative) breast cancer.
Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: AND019 PO QD
Number of participants with adverse events by severity, according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, Number of participants with adverse events, From baseline to 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (up to 25 months)|PK study of AND019, Plasma concentration of AND019 over time, At predefined timepoints at Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 of Cycle 1, and Day 1 of each cycle starting from Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
Determine the RP2D, To observe the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose MTD to determine RP2D., From baseline to up to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Percentage of Participants with Objective Response, ORR is defined as a complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions â‰¥4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Baseline and every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 until Week 24, and then every 12 weeks until end of study treatment (up to 24 months) (each cycle is 28 days)|Clinical Benefit Rate, CBR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving either of the following: confirmed complete response or partial response (as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1); or the first occurrence of progressive disease after 24 weeks of study treatment., Baseline and every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 until Week 24 (each cycle is 28 days)|Duration of Response, DoR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving either of the following: confirmed complete response or partial response., From the first occurrence of a documented objective response until first observation of disease progression or death from any cause on study, whichever occurs first (up to 24 months)
Progression free survival, PFS is defined as the time from treatment start date until objective tumor progression (PD) or death whichever comes first, From treatment start date until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|PD study of AND019 in blood samples, Change from baseline in therapy resistant markers by liquid biopsy, At predefined timepoints at baseline, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, and End of Treatment (up to 2 years) (each cycle is 28 days).|PD study of AND019 in tissue samples, Change from baseline in therapy resistant markers by tissue biopsy, At predefined timepoints at baseline and between Cycle 2 Day 1 to Cycle 3 Day 28 (each cycle is 28 days)
