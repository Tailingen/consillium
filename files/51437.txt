Motor-cognitive Training Effects on Cognition in Breast Cancer Survivors: the BRAINonFIT Study (BRAINonFIT).
The goal of this interventional study is to assess the effects of either physical exercise program or combined with cognitive training (dual motor and cognitive training program) on breast cancer survivors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Analyze the effectiveness of a supervised dual-task training program or a physical exercise program on the executive functions of the participants.
* Evaluate the impact of both interventions on physical function, emotional aspects, and important biomarkers related to muscle-brain crosstalk.

Participants will perform a 20-week supervised and controlled program, three times a week, along with weekly calorie and step challenges.

Researchers will compare the dual-task training group, with the physical exercise group, and with a control group, which will perform the guideline recommendations of physical activity (non-supervised) to see how these intervention approaches can impact cognitive functions, physical functions, emotional aspects, and biomarkers related to muscle-brain crosstalk.

Assessments will take place at three-time points: at baseline, after the intervention (20 weeks post-baseline) and after a 12-week follow-up period (32 weeks post-baseline).
