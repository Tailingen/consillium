National Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer, Germany
Registry of the national Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer (nNGM), linking data on molecular diagnostics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 23 specialized cancer centres and more than 400 general hospitals and oncological practices in Germany

Within the national Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer (nNGM), comprehensive molecular diagnostics and treatment recommendations are provided by 23 certified cancer centres according to standardized procedures for patients with non-resectable NSCLC. More than 400 network partners across Germany (including hospitals and oncological practices) report data on subsequent treatment and outcomes to the nNGM registry. Clinical outcomes are continuously evaluated through analysis of data collected in a decentralized registry. The nNGM registry records the patient journey and course of the disease from first histologically confirmed diagnosis to death or loss to follow-up and comprises detailed data on demographic and clinical characteristics, molecular diagnostics (including comprehensive biomarker testing results), treatments (targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, best supportive care) and outcomes (overall survival, response, disease progression, time to next treatment). Patients have been actively involved throughout all stages of the design and running of the network and its registry.
