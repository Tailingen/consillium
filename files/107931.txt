Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients With CD30-positive Nonlymphomatous Malignancies
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with CD30-positive nonlymphomatous malignancies.
Acute Lymphoid Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Anemia, Refractory, With Excess of Blasts|Solid Tumors
DRUG: brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: brentuximab vedotin
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator, Percentage of participants who achieved a best response of complete response/remission (CR), CR without hematologic recovery (CRi; leukemia only), or partial remission (PR) per the applicable response criteria. Response criteria for solid tumors (by radiographic tumor imaging) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009); response criteria for leukemia (by peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate or biopsy) per International Working Group (Cheson 2003)., Up to approximately 3 years
Complete Remission (CR) Rate by Investigator, Percentage of participants who achieved a best response of CR per the applicable response criteria. Response criteria for solid tumors (by radiographic tumor imaging) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009); response criteria for leukemia (by peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate or biopsy) per International Working Group (Cheson 2003)., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Objective Response by Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Duration of objective response (CR \[+CRi; leukemia\] + PR), defined as time of initial response until disease progression or death. Response criteria for solid tumors (by radiographic tumor imaging) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009); response criteria for leukemia (by peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate or biopsy) per International Working Group (Cheson 2003)., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Complete Response by Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Duration of CR, defined as time of initial response until disease progression or death. Response criteria for solid tumors (by radiographic tumor imaging) per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009); response criteria for leukemia (by peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate or biopsy) per International Working Group (Cheson 2003)., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-Free Survival by Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Progression-free survival, defined as time from start of study treatment to disease progression per investigator or death due to any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Adverse Events by Severity, Seriousness, and Relationship to Treatment, Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE, defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose on Study SGN35-013). Serious adverse events are reported from the time of informed consent. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 4.03) were used to assess severity (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life-threatening/disabling, 5=fatal). Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category are counted once within the category., Up to approximately 3 years|Laboratory Abnormalities >/= Grade 3, Counts of study participants with post-baseline laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or greater per NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Participants with multiple occurrences of a laboratory abnormality within a category are counted once in that category, Up to approximately 3 years|Brentuximab Vedotin Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Concentration at End of Infusion (Ceoi), Up to approximately 3 years|Brentuximab Vedotin Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Trough Concentration (Ctrough), Up to approximately 3 years|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Brentuximab Vedotin Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE), Up to approximately 3 years|Brentuximab Vedotin Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE) Trough Concentration (Ctrough), Up to approximately 3 years|Incidence of Anti-therapeutic Antibodies (ATA), Counts of participants with post-baseline anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies. Persistently positive is defined as confirmed ATA in more than 2 post-baseline samples and transiently positive is defined as confirmed ATA in 1 or 2 post-baseline samples., Up to approximately 3 years
