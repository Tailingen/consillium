Feasibility and Cost Analysis of PBSC Mobilization Using Pegfilgrastim in Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Pegfilgrastim in the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), defined as cell yield ≥ 3 x 10e6 CD34+/kg and to assess the costs related to Pegfilgrastim use in the mobilization of autologous PBSCs. Also to determine the side effects of Pegfilgrastim in the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood stem cells.
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
Efficacy of Pegfilgrastim in the Mobilization of Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSCs), Defined as Cell Yield ≥ 3 x 10e6 CD34+/kg, Outcome was not reported. The study was terminated for lack of enrollment. Data collection was terminated. No data analysis was performed., 2 years
Assess the Per-patient Costs Related to Pegfilgrastim Use in the Mobilization of Autologous PBSCs in 16 Study Participants., Costs will be divided into three categories: 1. Pre-pheresis preparation (cost of Pegfilgrastim, laboratory testing, drug administration, providers, line placement); 2. Pheresis procedure (costs related to # collections and total hours on apheresis machine, microbiological testing, provider, CD34 analysis and related labs, cryopreservation/storage and complications); 3. Post-pheresis processing (cost of stem cell thawing, microbiological testing, CD34 analysis and related labs, providers, administration)., At each stage of pheresis for each enrolled subject for a maximum of 2 years.
