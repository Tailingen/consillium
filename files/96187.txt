A Clinical Trial of Buparlisib and Ibrutinib in Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of buparlisib and ibrutinib will lead to better treatment results in patients with relapsed or refractory Follicular lymphoma, (FL) Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The investigators are using buparlisib and ibrutinib because both drugs seem to block different proteins that allow cancer cells to keep growing. Blocking these proteins may help by making the cancer cells undergo cell death, which will stop uncontrolled tumor growth.
Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Buparlisib|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), In the Phase I part the standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used and all disease subtypes will be combined. If none of the initial cohort of 3 has a DLT the dose level will be escalated. If one has a DLT that dose level will be expanded with 3 more patients. Dose escalation will stop if 2 or more DLTs are seen at a dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which at most 1 of the 6 patients treated at that level has a DLT. Three dose levels plus a "-1" dose level are planned for this study., 1 year
