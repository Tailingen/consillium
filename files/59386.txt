High Dose Chemotherapy With Amifostine and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for High Risk Relapsed Pediatric Solid Tumors and Brain Tumors
This is a study of amifostine to determine how effective it is in the reduction of infection in a high dose chemotherapy regimen with autologous stem cell rescue in children with high risk, relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors.

Incidence of Bacteriemia in a High Dose Busulfan, Melphalan and Thiotepa Chemotherapy Regimen With Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Rescue in Patients With High Risk and Relapsed or Refractory Pediatric Solid Tumors, 3 months
Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) permits chemotherapy dose-escalation to exploit the steep dose-response of solid tumors to alkylating agents. Although ASCT regimens have activity in some high risk pediatric solid tumors, non-hematological regimen-related morbidity and mortality are major barriers to additional dose escalation. We hypothesized that the chemoprotectant amifostine (EthyolÂ®) would reduce the toxicity of ASCT without compromising anti-tumor efficacy. This is a study of amifostine at 1125 mg/m2 to determine the efficacy of it's chemoprotection in the reduction of bacteremia in a high dose busulfan, melphalan and thiotepa chemotherapy regimen with autologous stem cell rescue in children with high risk, relapsed or refractory pediatric solid tumors.
