ZACtima FASlodex Trial in Postmenopausal Advance Breast Cancer Patients Instead of ZACtima FASlodex Trial
The primary objective is to assess the event-free survival defined as the time from randomisation to progression, death without progression, loss to follow up, whichever occurred first..

DRUG: ZD6474 (Vandetanib at the dose of 100 mg)|DRUG: Placebo to match ZD6474 (Vandetanib at the dose of 100 mg)|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: ZD6474 (Vandetanib at the dose of 300 mg)|DRUG: Placebo to match ZD6474 (Vandetanib at the dose of 300 mg)
Event Free Survival, Success rate (patients without progression and still on treatment at 24 weeks, Restaging (RECIST) is carried out at screening and every 3 months during the study until 1 year and than every 6 months until objective disease progression.
Time-To-Progression, Progression-Free Survival, Objective Tumor Response Rate (CR+PR), Disease Control Rate (CR+PR+SD) and Duration of Response (DOR), Restaging (RECIST) is carried out at screening and every 3 months during the study until 1 year and than every 6 months until objective disease progression.|Overall Survival, Assessments for survival must be made at the 60 day follow-up visit and then every 3 months, unless the patient withdraws consent.|Incidence and Type of Adverse Events (AEs), Clinically Significant Laboratory or Vital Sign Abnormalities and Electrocardiographic (ECG) Changes, Continuous assessment of safety.
end-point Efficacy: event-free survival (EFS)
