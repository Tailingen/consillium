GammaTile and Stupp in Newly Diagnosed GBM
In summary, standard of care postoperative chemoradiation for patients with newly diagnosed GBM does not routinely provide durable local control or prolonged overall survival. As discussed above it seems unlikely that patient outcomes will be significantly improved with radiation dose escalation given at the time of the EBRT boost. However, as most failures are local, improving LC could potentially improve the OS of patients. To do this, we propose a shift in the traditional radiation paradigm. This study will assess the feasibility and tolerability of adding GT radiation therapy as an upfront boost at the time of maximum safe resection, along with the backbone of the current standard of care approach, concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide +/- TTF, for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. GT, a novel brain brachytherapy device utilizing Cs-131 embedded in bioresorbable collagen tiles, offers a more sophisticated carrier and a shorter half-life radioisotope, Cs-131. Use of this device allows for radiation initiation at an earlier time point and a more rapid dose delivery and possibly more effective tumor control particularly for rapidly proliferating tumors such as GBM. Two prospective studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of re-irradiation with GT in patients with recurrent GBM. The overarching goal of this single-arm, open label phase 4 study is to determine the feasibility and tolerability of treating patients with GammaTile in combination with the Stupp Protocol and how to proceed with testing this treatment in a future, larger, randomized clinical study. The aims of the study are to demonstrate that the use of GammaTile at the time of surgery is well tolerated and does not delay the start of the Stupp protocol. Efficacy outcomes (e.g., LC, OS, PFS) will also be described.

This study seeks to explore if GT, given its unique radiobiological and physical characteristics, may permit safe dose escalation and intensification and thereby provide a benefit to newly diagnosed GBM patients in terms of OS and LC when incorporated into the framework of the Stupp protocol. In this study, GT is utilized as an upfront boost at the time of maximum safe resection and dosimetrically integrated into what is otherwise standard of care therapy.

Patients in this study will receive doses from two different forms of radiation treatment, initially from Cs-131 BT with GT and subsequently from fractionated EBRT. In order to ensure both patient safety and adequacy of treatment, we have chosen to stipulate and evaluate the coverage of the tumor volumes and OARs using the doses combined from both these treatments. The intention is that with this methodology the doses received by the target volumes and relevant OARs from the implanted Cs-131 will be accounted for during EBRT treatment planning. This dose combination, accomplished using radiobiological modeling, is frequently undertaken in breast, prostate, and gynecological malignancies. To provide oversight and planning feedback, the first three patients enrolled at each site will undergo review by the Clinical Oversight Committee (COC) at two points for each patient, once after the GT implant, and before starting EBRT treatment.
