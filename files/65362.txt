Residual Disease Driven Strategy for CARCIK (CD19) in Adults/Pediatric BCP-ALL
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the activity and the safety of a therapeutic strategy that allows a second CARCIK-CD19 cells infusion, driven by the status of disease from one month after the first infusion, in adult and pediatric patients with r/r BCP- ALL.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
GENETIC: PTG-CARCIK-CD19
To evaluate the overall response rate: change from baseline at day 28 after the first CARCIK-CD19 infusion, At baseline and at Day 28 after infusion: lymphoblasts \< 5% at morphological evaluation of bone marrow aspirate, Baseline and day 28|To evaluate the overall response rate: change from baseline at day 28 after the first CARCIK-CD19 infusion, At baseline and at Day 28 after infusion: lymphoblasts \< 5% at flow cytometry bone marrow evaluation, Baseline and day 28|To evaluate the overall response rate: change from baseline at day 28 after the first CARCIK-CD19 infusion, At baseline and at Day 28 after infusion: molecular evaluation of disease positivity \<0.01%, Baseline and day 28|To evaluate the duration of response of patients treated with CARCIK - CD19 cells.
