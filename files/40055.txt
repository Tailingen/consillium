The Effect of Post-voiding Reisdual Urine on Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Recurrence and Progression
Although transurethral resection is the main treatment option for stage Ta and T1 disease, relapse is frequently detected. Tumor number, tumor size, T stage, presence of in situ carcinoma and tumor grade are risk factors for recurrence. The relationship between post voiding residual urine volume and bladder tumor recurrence and progression has not been clearly established. The investigators aimed to examine the effect of high post voiding residual urine volume on recurrence and progression based on the hypothesis that tumor cells circulating in the bladder may increase with excess residual urine.

Although transurethral resection is the main treatment option for stage Ta and T1 disease, relapse is frequently detected. Tumor number, tumor size, T stage, presence of in situ carcinoma and tumor grade are risk factors for recurrence. The relationship between post voiding residual urine volume and bladder tumor recurrence and progression has not been clearly established. Participants who underwent transurethral resection for bladder tumor will be included in the study. The investigators aimed to examine the effect of high post voiding residual urine volume on recurrence and progression based on the hypothesis that tumor cells circulating in the bladder may increase with excess residual urine.
