This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety profile, and the overall response rate (ORR) of CAR-T cells in these patients. Secondary objectives include assessing marrow remission rates and minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance at various time points (2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year) in patients with bone marrow involvement, as well as evaluating the changes in multiple sites of involvement through PET-CT or PET-MRI before and one year after CAR-T therapy. The study will also track event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years post-treatment.
