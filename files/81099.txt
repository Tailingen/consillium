This is a randomized, double-blind,controlled, parallel study that will be conducted on patients with oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy with gastrointestinal cancer.

This study will be done on 93 patients with gastrointestinal cancer (colon or gastric or pancreatic) cancer on standard FOLFOX-4 regimen who will divided into 3 groups:

Group 1: 31 Patients who will receive standard chemotherapy plus duloxetine 30 mg/day for 12 cycles (up to 6 months).

Group 2: 31 Patients who will receive standard chemotherapy plus gabapentin 300 mg/day for 12 cycles (up to 6 months).

Group 3: 31 Patients who will receive standard chemotherapy plus lacosamide 50 mg/day for 12 cycles (up to 6 months).
