A Phase 1, Dose Finding Study of CC-90002 in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers
CC-90002-ST -001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation clinical study in subjects with advanced, refractory solid and hematologic cancers.

CC-90002-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation, first in human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90002, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, in subjects with advanced, refractory solid and hematologic cancers.

The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A dose escalation phase will explore escalating dose cohorts of the study drug CC-90002.

Part B dose escalation will explore escalating doses of CC-90002 in combination with rituximab in subjects with CD20-positive NHL.
