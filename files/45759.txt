Low Dose Versus Usual Dose Dexamethasone for Symptom Control in Children Undergoing Cranial or Craniospinal Radiation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of low dose dexamethasone versus high dose dexamethasone in the treatment of radiation induced vomiting.
Vomiting|Headache
DRUG: High dose dexamethasone|DRUG: Low dose dexamethasone
Effectiveness of dexamethasone on vomiting, The primary outcome will be the evaluation of effectiveness of dexamethasone on vomiting after 24-48 hours (after 2-4 doses of treatment). Vomiting is defined as either retching or vomiting and will be counted in events. The frequency of emetic episodes/day will be documented in the daily diary. The effectiveness of dexamethasone will be counted in number of episodes and evaluated on day 2 (48 hours after first dose)., 24-48 hours after first dose of dexamethasone
Headaches, Parent/patients are asked to document the worst headache of the day prior to bedtime daily on a visual analogue scale using the 6-face "happy face" scale ranging from 0 (no headache) to 5 (extreme headache)., 0-48 hours after first dose of dexamethasone|Adverse events and side effects, These will be described with numbers, type and frequencies for the duration of the subjects participation in the study., Duration of participation in study|Quality of life, Parent/patient will complete a quality of life assessment within 14 days prior to starting radiation (including first day of radiation) and within 14 days post completion of radiation (including last day of radiation)., Baseline and at end of participation in study
Dexamethasone is an effective medication to ameliorate radiation induced headache and vomiting. In our Toronto experience dexamethasone in low doses (1 mg/m2/day) is sufficient in treating these symptoms. However this experience is not shared from many neuro-oncology centers of excellence that more commonly use 5 mg/m2/day according to the results of the trans-Canadian survey. A prospective multicenter trial evaluating the effectiveness of dexamethasone in different dose regimens in symptomatic children while undergoing CNS radiation will elucidate the appropriate dose.
