A Study of Linifanib (ABT-869) in Combination With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Japanese Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of linifanib, and identify tolerable dose of linifanib (ABT-869) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in Japanese subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Secondary objective is to obtain a preliminary efficacy of anti-tumor activity in the subjects as first-line treatment.
