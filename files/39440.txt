Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety Effects Following Coadministration of Carbamazepine or Itraconazole With Radiprodil in Healthy Adults
This is a Phase 1, open-label, 2-part study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of oral carbamazepine or oral itraconazole on the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of radiprodil in healthy adult participants. In addition, the safety and tolerability of radiprodil given together with oral carbamazepine or itraconazole will be assessed.

This is an open label study conducted in healthy adult volunteers. The study will be conducted in 2 parallel parts. A total of 36 participants will be enrolled in the study (N=18 per Part).

Part A: will enrol 18 participants to receive multiple oral doses of the radiprodil in the range of 7.5mg to 30mg with oral carbamazepine.

Part B: will enrol 18 participants to receive multiple oral doses of radiprodil in the range of 7.5mg to 15mg with oral itraconazole.
