Biological-guided Metronomic Chemotherapy as Maintenance Strategy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Based upon biological behavior, those mCRC patients who respond well (SD, PR or CR according to RECIST Criteria) after 16-18 weeks of standard doublet chemotherapy as induction may enrolled into this study, randomly divided into capecitabine metronomic group or standard dosage group. The duration of disease control after randomization(PFS2) and progression free survival from enrollment (PFS1) are primary endpoints. Meanwhile, the overall survival, safety and quality of life are secondary endpoints. Exploratory markers involving angiogenesis (serum VEGF, PDGF, Tie-1 and Tie2, etc) and immune function (CD clusters, serum tumor mutation burden(TMB), etc), are conducted via liquid biopsy.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival 1 (PFS1), from enrollment to progression, 10 months|Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2), from randomization to progression, 4 months
Overall Survival (OS), from signing informed consent to death, 20 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, drug related toxicity from signing informed consent to death, 20 months|Number of participants with quality of life (QoL) as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, QoL from signing informed consent to death, 20 months
This study is try to evaluate the effect of capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy as maintenance treatment, which compare to capecitabine conventional chemotherapy, who have responded to 16-18 months first-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The maintenance treatments are continued until disease progression or severe toxicity. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy is non-inferior to capecitabine conventional chemotherapy. Furthermore, exploratory markers involving angiogenesis (serum VEGF, PDGF, Tie-1 and Tie2, etc) and immune function (CD clusters, serum tumor mutation burden(TMB), etc), are conducted via liquid biopsy.
