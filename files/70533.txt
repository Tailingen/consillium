The Addition of Metformin to Definitive Radiotherapy in Patients With Stage III NSCLC
Study the effect of metformin when added to definitive locoregional radiotherapy on locoregional control and relapse rate in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving sequential chemoradiotherapy. Try to identify subsets of patients who derive maximum benefit of adding metformin to radiotherapy using innovative biomarkers.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Metformin|OTHER: No metformin
Loco regional progression-free survival rate, (LPFS), 1 year after start of treatment
Overall survival, (OS), time until death; assessed up to 60 months after treatment start|Progression-free survival, (PFS), earliest date of disease progression (local or distant), assessed up to 24 months after treatment start
The administration of oral metformin during radiotherapy is thought to decrease the hypoxic fraction of tumour cells, improving radiosensitivity and promoting apoptosis, resulting in better outcome. This hypothesis will be evaluated in a trial with randomized design. All patients willing to participate will receive definitive radiotherapy, either in combination with metformin (arm C) or without metformin (arm B). Patients who refuse to participate in the randomized part can be included in the observational arm of the study (arm A). In addition, the validated biomarker of tumour hypoxia (18F-HX4 PET/CT scintigraphy (18F-flortanidazole positron emission computed tomography) and biomarkers of resistance, apoptosis and glucose metabolism will be evaluated for their potential predictive value.
