Emergency Curative Resection of Colorectal Cancer
The feasibility and efficacy of emergency curative resection of complicated colorectal cancer is still controversial. This prospective study aim is to assess surgical and oncologic outcomes after emergency compared to elective curative resection of colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer|Oncologic Complications and Emergencies
PROCEDURE: Curative resection of colorectal cancer
Adequate oncologic resection, Negative resection margins + adequate lymphadenectomy ( Lymph Nodes retrieved \> 12), histopathological assessment of surgical specimens within 2 weeks postoperative|early postoperative mortality after curative resection of colorectal cancer, early death due to cause related to surgery, within 90 days after surgery|early postoperative morbidity after curative resection of colorectal cancer, surgery-related complications, within 90 days after surgery
Tumor recurrence, either local or distant, By the end of the 3 years follow up period|Disease free survival, % of patients survived without recurrence, By the end of the 3 years follow up period|Overall survival, % of all patients survived either with or without recurrence, By the end of the 3 years follow up period
60 consecutive patients presented with complicated colorectal cancer managed by emergency surgery were included and compared to another 155 consecutive patients admitted during the same period with uncomplicated colorectal cancer managed by elective surgery. Both groups were compared regarding curative resection rate, early postoperative mortality and morbidity, 3-years tumor recurrence and survival rates.
