Study of Erlotinib (Tarceva®) in Combination With OSI-906 in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Activating Mutations of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Gene
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of Erlotinib (Tarceva®) in combination with OSI-906 in Patients with Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Activating Mutations of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Gene who are Chemonaive.
NSCLC|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: OSI-906|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival of OSI-906 in combination with Erlotinib or Erlotinib plus placebo, Time from randomization to disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 15 months
Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization until the documented date of death., 33 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease based on RECIST version 1.1 criteria., 33 months|Best Overall Response Rate, 33 months|Duration of Response (CR/PR), Time from the date of the first documented response (CR/PR) to documented progression or death due to underlying cancer.

Defined for patients whose best overall response was CR or PR., 33 months|Safety assessed through evaluation of adverse events, laboratory, physical examination, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, 33 months
Based on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee, OSI-906 and matching placebo are no longer being administered as of 01 March 2013.

This is a multi-center, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study. Patients will be stratified according to the following 2 parameters: (1) EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 deletion versus exon 21 single point mutation); and (2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs. 1).
