Observational Study of Docetaxel Exposure in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients
In this observational study, blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing will be collected from subjects with metastatic prostate cancer during their treatment with docetaxel. Plasma levels of docetaxel will be determined, and the subjects docetaxel exposure levels, determined as an area under the curve (AUC), will be retrospectively correlated with reports of toxicity, tumor response, quality of life, time to disease progression and overall survival to provide guidance on what the appropriate target range for docetaxel exposure should be for metastatic prostate cancer subjects receiving docetaxel therapy for their disease.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|OTHER: Blood draws
Variability of docetaxel exposure, Blood will be drawn during the first six cycles of docetaxel therapy to determine the variability of docetaxel exposure., Up to 6 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Docetaxel treatment related toxicities, Determine the relationship between docetaxel plasma concentrations (i.e. exposure level) and the incidence of docetaxel related toxicities for identification of an optimal target docetaxel exposure range., Up to 7 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy
Frequency of growth factor usage, Determine relationship (if any) between growth factor usage and docetaxel exposure levels., Up to 7 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Number of days hospitalized for treatment of docetaxel related toxicities, Determine relationship (if any) between number of day hospitalized due to treatment related toxicities and docetaxel exposure levels., Up to 7 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression, Determine relationship (if any) between the time to PSA progression and docetaxel exposure levels obtained during the first 6 cycles of treatment., Up to 24 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Tumor response as determined by imaging, Determine relationship (if any) between the tumor response as determined by imaging and docetaxel exposure levels obtained during the first 6 cycles of treatment., Up to 7 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Changes in quality of life, Determine relationship between changes in the quality of life (as measured using the FACT-P Questionnaire) and docetaxel exposure levels obtained during the first 6 cycles of treatment., Up to 6 months after the initiation of docetaxel therapy|Overall survival, Determine relationship between overall survival and docetaxel exposure levels obtained during the first 6 cycles of treatment., Up to 24 months after the initiation of docatexel therapy
