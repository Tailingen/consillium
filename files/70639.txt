Camrelizumab Combined With SRT/WBRT and Chemotherapy in Patients With Brain Metastases of Driven Gene-negative NSCLC
This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study. Target population is patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab + carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed /paclitaxel / albumin paclitaxel ± SRT/WBRT with placebo + carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed /paclitaxel / albumin paclitaxel ± SRT/WBRT. Camrelizumab is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.

DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Albumin paclitaxel
Intracranial Progression-Free Survival(iPFS), Intracranial Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression in brain metastasis disease or death from any cause or switch therapy, up to 24 month
Intracranial Objective Response Rate (iORR), iORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response(PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) in brain lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, up to 24 month|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a CR or a PR., up to 24 month|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., up to 24 month|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., up to 24 month|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until PD or death, up to 24 month|Quality of Life (QoL), Evaluate according to the quality of life score V3.0，higher scores mean a better outcome., up to 24 month|Adverse events (AEs)/ Serious adverse event (SAE), All adverse event/Serious adverse event that occurred during the study period according to CTCAE v 5.0, up to 24 month|Simple Mental State Scale of Intelligence (MMSE), Assessment of cognitive function based on the MMSE ,the values from 0 to 30, higher scores mean a better outcome., up to 24 month|Revised Hopkins Vocabulary Learning Test Scale (HVLT-R), Assessment of cognitive function based on the HVLT-R，higher scores mean a better outcome., up to 24 month
Detailed Description:

In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept study treatment. Paticipant was confirmed without EGFR activating mutation or ALK fusion and received no prior systemic therapy. Patients would receive Camrelizumab/placebo in combination with chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles，non-squamous subject followed by Camrelizumab/placebo + pemetrexed as maintenance treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, squamous subject followed by Camrelizumab/placebo as maintenance treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, Camrelizumab/placebo for a maximum of 2 years.
