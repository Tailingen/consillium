Experiences of stigma (perception and internalization of negative appraisal and devaluation from others) are pervasive for lung cancer patients. Previous work has shown associations between lung cancer stigma and detriments in clinically relevant outcomes such as depression, lower quality of life, and reduced engagement in cancer care.

The investigators previously developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Lung Cancer Stigma (ACT-LCS) as a patient-focused intervention to reduce the self-blame, guilt and inhibited disclosure associated with lung cancer stigma. ACT-LCS is based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a cognitive-behavioral treatment that promotes psychological flexibility through acceptance and valued direction.

This is a feasibility study examining the feasibility and acceptability of ACT-LCS.
