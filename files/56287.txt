Donor Natural Killer Cells After Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer
RATIONALE: Giving an infusion of natural killer cells from a donor after a donor stem cell transplant may help kill any remaining cancer cells after the transplant.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of donor natural killer cells when given after a donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with advanced cancer.

BIOLOGICAL: donor natural killer cell infusion
Safety, Safety will be evaluation in terms of transplantation outcomes as well as side effects of donor NK cell infusion, 15 days to 1 year after transplantation
Clinical efficacy of donor NK cell infusion, in terms of tumor response, response duration, and survival, achievement of CR of underlying disease, CR duration, 15 days to 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the safety of donor natural killer (NK) cell infusion after HLA-mismatched/haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a familial donor in patients with advanced malignant disorders.
* To determine the maximum number of donor NK cells that can be safely given to these patients.

Secondary

* To assess the clinical efficacy donor NK cell infusion, in terms of tumor response, response duration, and survival, in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant disorders.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

* Phase I: Patients receive an infusion of donor natural killer (NK) cells on days 18 and 21.
* Phase II: Patients receive an infusion of donor NK cells on days 14 and 21. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
