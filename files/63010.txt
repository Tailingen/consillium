A Study of the Safety and Tolerability of ABBV-467 in Adult Participants With Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Multiple Myeloma
This first-in-human study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-467 in adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
Multiple Myeloma (MM)|Cancer
DRUG: ABBV-467
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator will assess the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as being of reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug., Up to approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Change in Vital Signs, Change in vital signs like systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG), 12-lead resting ECGs will be recorded. Parameters include RR interval, PR interval, QT interval, and QRS duration., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Change in Cardiac Enzyme Levels, Change in cardiac enzyme levels will be recorded., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Incidence of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Test Results, Number of participants with incidence of abnormal clinical laboratory test results like hematology will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-467., Up to approximately Day 197|Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (t1/2), Terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2) of ABBV-467, Up to approximately Day 197|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUCt), AUC from time 0 to time of last measurable concentration of ABBV-467., Up to approximately Day 197|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC0-infinity), AUC from time 0 to infinity of ABBV-467., Up to approximately Day 197|Clearance of ABBV-467, Clearance of ABBV-467., Up to approximately Day 197
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR evaluated per adapted International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and defined as partial response (PR) + very good partial response (VGPR) + complete remission (CR) + stringent complete response (sCR)., Up to approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR evaluated per adapted International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria and is defined as minimal response (MR) + PR + VGPR + CR + sCR., Up to approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time between date of first response and the first occurrence of progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 24 months after first dose of study drug
This first-in-human study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-467 in adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
