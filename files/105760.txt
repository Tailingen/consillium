A Clinical Study to Explore the Safety and Efficacy of CT0991 in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
A Clinical Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of CT0991 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia(AML)
DRUG: CAR-T cells（ chimeric antigen receptor T cells）
Adverse Events (AE) after CT0991infusion, An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Dose-limiting toxicity （DLT）, The DLT is evaluated as the proportion of patients who experienced adverse events related to CT0991 that meet the criteria for DLT events after the first infusion., Up to 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion|MTD and/or dose range, Evaluate Dose limited toxicity and recommended dosage range after CT0991 infusion, Up to 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion
Complete response (CR), and complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), Performed according to the Technical Guidelines for Clinical Development of New Drugs for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and ELN 2022 Criteria for AML defined of Achieve CR and CRi., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|complete response with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), Morphologic leukemia-free status (MLFS) and partial response (PR), Performed according to the Technical Guidelines for Clinical Development of New Drugs for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and ELN 2022 Criteria for AML defined of Achieve CRh, MLFS and PR., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Duration of response (DOR), Participants achieving CR/CRi/CRh will be included in the analysis set for DOR. DOR is defined as the time from the date of confirmed response until the date of disease relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from the date of receiving the infusion to the date of treatment failure (failure to achieve CR/CRh/CRi/MLFS/PR after both efficacy assessments), or relapse (hematologic relapse or extramedullary relapse after CR/CRh/CRi), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. When an EFS event was "Ineffective Therapy", the primary analysis of EFS was performed on a 1-day basis (ie, time to treatment received as the event). For a more comprehensive assessment, sensitivity analyses could be performed using the actual date of treatment failure, end of treatment, or start of next-line anti-leukemia therapy as the end of EFS for treatment failure, respectively., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of receiving the infusion to the date of death from any cause., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Rate, tested in all participants who achieved CR/CRh/CRi. MRD negativity was defined as abnormal cells detected by the MFC method accounting for \< 0.1% of CD45-positive cells (at least 500,000 CD45-positive cells detected)., 12 months after CT0991 infusion|Test Copy number of CAR, Evaluate cellular pharmacokinetics of CT0991, 12 months after CT0991 infusion
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cellular pharmacokinetics of CT0991 in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. It is planned to enroll 9-24 participants in this trial.
