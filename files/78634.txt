ORR is determined by radiological tests and investigator assessment. ORR for unresectable/recurrent ALK+IMT participants will be the achievement of a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as atleast 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions. Per International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (IPNHL) response criteria, CR is defined as disappearance of all residual disease and tumor lesions; PR is defined as 50% decrease in sum of product of greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of lymphoma cells., Every 2 months until complete response is achieved (Up to 36 months)

The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. A SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 2 years)|Overall Acceptability and Palatability as Assessed by Acceptability and Palatability Questionnaire Score, Acceptability is defined as the overall ability of the participant to use the medicine as intended. Acceptability and palatability (taste and smell) will be assessed using a 5-point facial hedonic scale, where 1 indicates 'bad', and 5 indicates 'good'., Days 1 and 8 (Cycle 1)|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the initial assessment of CR response until subsequent disease progression or relapse. Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions and per IPNHL, response criteria CR is defined as disappearance of all residual disease and tumor lesions. Disease progression as per RECIST 1.1, is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Disease progression as per IPNHL response criteria, is defined as development of new morphologic evidence of disease in bone marrow., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to 36 months)|Phase 2: Time to Response, Time from the start of treatment with brigatinib to the first objective tumor response observed for participants who achieved a CR or PR. Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as atleast 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions. Per IPNHL response criteria, CR is defined as disappearance of all residual disease and tumor lesions; PR is defined as 50% decrease in sum of product of greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of lymphoma cells., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to 36 months)|Phase 2: Disease Control Rate in Unresectable/ Recurrent ALK+ IMT Participants, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who are confirmed to have achieved CR or PR or have a best overall response of stable disease (SD). Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as atleast 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to 36 months)|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Unresectable/ Recurrent ALK+ IMT Participants, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of PD per RECIST v1.1, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to 36 months)|Phase 2: Event-free Survival in Relapsed/ Refractory ALK+ ALCL Participants, EFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to any treatment failure including disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason (eg, disease progression, toxicity, patient preference, initiation of new treatment without documented progression, or death). Participants without any treatment failure events will be censored at last known alive date before data cutoff date., From the first dose of study drug up to disease progression or death (Up to 36 months)|Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival in months is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death due to any cause. Participants without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last known to be alive., Up to 36 months
The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested to treat people who have Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumors or other solid tumours.

The study will enroll approximately 61 patients. Participants will be assigned to the following arm group to receive brigatinib:

* Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Brigatinib Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2 (based on safety and tolerability)
* Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Unresectable/ Recurrent ALK+ IMT
* Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Relapsed/ Refractory ALK+ ALCL

All participants will be administered brigatinib orally once daily in 28-day Cycles. Participants will receive fixed doses of brigatinib based on weight ranges. The starting doses in Phase 1 (Dose Level 1) are expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in pediatric participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving the recommended clinical dose of 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily. One additional dose level (Dose Level 2) is planned in Phase 1 if the initial dose level is tolerated. This subsequent dose level is expected to provide systemic exposures of brigatinib in pediatric participants comparable to those achieved in adults receiving 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 240 mg once daily (the highest acceptably tolerated dose in adults). In Phase 2, brigatinib will be administered at the RP2D determined during Phase 1.

This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be contacted by telephone OR a final visit after receiving their last dose of brigatinib for a follow-up assessment.
