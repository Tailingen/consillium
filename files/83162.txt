Study of MLN4924, a Novel Inhibitor of Nedd8 Activating Enzyme, in Adult Patients With Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of MLN4924 in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma. The patient population will consist of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphoma (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is permitted) or multiple myeloma that is relapsed and/or refractory after at least 2 prior standard chemotherapeutic regimens and for which no curative option exists.

Patients in the expansion cohort, Schedule E, must specifically have Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL-GCB subtype, DLBCL-non-GCB subtype, or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Patients with multiple myeloma will no longer be evaluated as a part of this study.
