Mediastinal Staging of Lung Cancer With EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA
The purpose of this study is to find a role of EUS-B-FNA in the mediastinal staging of potentially operable lung cancer. The investigators perform EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA on potentially operable lung cancer patients. The investigators perform EBUS(+/- TBNA) and EUS-B (ultrasonographic examination through the esophagus) on all subjects. EUS-B-FNA will be performed on inaccessible nodes or difficult nodes to be sampled by EBUS-TBNA. Additional diagnostic values of EUS-B-FNA as compared to EBUS-TBNA alone will be estimated.
