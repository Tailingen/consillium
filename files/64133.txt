A Phase III Study of NK105 in Patients With Breast Cancer
To verify the non-inferiority of NK105, a paclitaxel-incorporating micellar nanoparticle, to paclitaxel in terms of the progression-free survival in patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Nos Metastatic Recurrent
DRUG: NK105|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the period from the day of randomization until the first observation of lesion progression or death from any cause. Disease progression is defined as PD according to RECIST Ver. 1.1.

Assessment period was from the day of randomisation until the first observation of lesion progression or death, Baseline, every 6 weeks of study treatment period, and end of study,
Overall Survival, OS is defined as the period from the day of randomization until the day of death from any cause.

Assessment period was from the day of randomisation until the first observation of lesion progression or death, Baseline, every 6 weeks of study treatment period, and end of study.|Overall Response Rate, ORR is the proportion of patients who are assessed as complete response or partial response as the best overall response among evaluable patients, according to RECIST Ver.1.1.

Assessment period was from the day of randomisation until the first observation of lesion progression or death, Baseline, every 6 weeks of study treatment period, and end of study.
This study is a randomized, open-label, multi-national phase III study.
