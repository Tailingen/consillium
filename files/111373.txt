Safety and Efficacy of Targeted IL-13 Rα2 or B7-H3 UCAR-T for Advanced Glioma
The goal of this clinical trial is to estimate the safety, tolerance and initial efficacy of target IL-13Rα2 or B7-H3 UCAR-T cell injection in the treatment of patients with advanced glioma, as well as the pharmacokinetic characteristics of its metabolites after single and multiple administrations and the biomarkers related to efficacy, safety and drug metabolism.

Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor size decreases to the expected value and can continue to meet the expected minimum time limit。, Up to 5 years or complete the follow-up of the last enrolled patient, whichever comes first.
Progression-Free Survival, The time from enrolling into the trial to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause。, Up to 5 years or complete the follow-up of the last enrolled patient, whichever comes first.
