Low Stable Pressure Pneumoperitoneum in Colorectal Surgery (CROSS STUDY)
The objective of this prospective, international cohort is to incorporate the low stable pressure (using Airseal Insufflator) approach and its associated parameters into the early rehabilitation program after colorectal surgery so as to shorten hospitalization up to the ambulatory care and reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption.

To assess the impact of the stable low-pressure approach (using Airseal Insufflator) and its associated parameters into the the early rehabilitation program after colorectal surgery on length of stay., Evaluate the Length of hospital stay after colorectal surgery., From the surgery to the end of the hospitalization (max 30 days)
The impact of stable low pressure on the postoperative pain after colorectal surgery, Pain is evaluated (Visual Analgesic Scale (Vas scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (hurst worst)), At 24 hours after the end of the surgery|The impact of stable low pressure on the opioid consumption after colorectal surgery, Evaluate the impact on the opioid consumption after colorectal surgery;, From the surgery to the end of the hospitalization (max 30 days)|The impact of the different mini-invasive approaches on the feasibility and benefit of low stable pressure, Evaluate the impact of robotic, laparoscopic +/- microsurgical instrument, 3D laparoscopic vision surgery, From the surgery to the end of the hospitalization (max 30 days)|The Post-operative Surgical and Medical morbidity, Post operative Surgical and Medical morbidity according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, From the surgery to the end of the hospitalization (max 30 days)|The impact of the anesthetic management on the feasibility and benefit of low stable pressure, Evaluate the impact of drugs, deep neuromuscular blockade, ventilation characteristics, intraoperative nociception monitoring, patient positioning, pre-stretching of the abdominal wall, and individual patient factors, From the surgery to the end of the hospitalization (max 30 days)|The Surgical and Medical morbidity at 30 days, Surgical and Medical morbidity at 30 days according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, At 30 days after the end of the surgery
Laparoscopy is currently the gold standard for the vast majority of abdominal surgeries, and especially for colectomy for cancer or benign diseases. There are many data showing the benefits of the laparoscopic approach to colectomy in terms of morbidity, post-operative pain and analgesic consumption, length of hospital stay, cosmetic results, and improved patient satisfaction. In 2002, consensus European guidelines recommended insufflating at the lowest pressure that still provides sufficient exposure. Considering these results, low-pressure laparoscopy is one of the alternatives that have been developed to do away with the complications of the pneumoperitoneum while retaining its advantages.

However, other factors may influence the outcomes of the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum such as the use of humidification and warming gaz, robotic or microsurgical instrumentation, neuromuscular blockade, patient positioning, pre-stretching of the abdominal wall, ventilation-induced changes, and probably individual patient factors like obesity. These parameters could not be separately tested in randomized trial. We should consider all these parameters in a prospective international registry in order to optimize the benefit of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum in post-operative recovery.
