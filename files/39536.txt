Study of RAD001 and Bevacizumab in Recurrent Ovarian, Peritoneal, and Fallopian Tube Cancer
This study will investigate the efficacy as well as the safety of RAD001 in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer. RAD001 will be taken orally once daily and bevacizumab will be administered once every 14 days. The study will be conducted over a period of about 3 to 4 years.
