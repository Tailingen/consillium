Phase II Trial of Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Anti-PD-1 Antibody Toripalimab Combined With CCRT in NPC Patients
This is a randomized Phase II trial to study the effectiveness and toxicity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant PD-1 antibody Toripalimab combined with concurrent cisplatin chemoradiotherapy versus cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus placebo in treating patients with high risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin+Toripalimab|DRUG: Cisplatin+placebo
Progress-free survival (PFS), Defined from date of randomization to date of first documentation of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomisation to death., 2 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival (LRRFS), Defined as the time from the randomisation to documented locoregional recurrence or death due to any cause., 2 years or until the date of the last follow-up visit.|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), Defined as the time from randomisation to documented distant metastasis or death due to any cause., 2 years|Objective Response Rate （ORR）, An objective response is defined as either a confirmed CR or a PR, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)., After the completion of the neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody and chemoradiotherapy treatment|Incidence rate of adverse events (AEs), Analysis of adverse events (AEs) are based on treatment-related AEs (trAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), and all-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs. AEs are evaluated by investigators according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, 2 years|Correlation between the plasma EBV DNA level and PFS, The plasma EBV DNA level of the patients will be assessed., 2 years|Correlation between pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level and PFS, Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level is evaluated centrally by means of immunohistochemical testing., 2 years|Correlation between the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PFS, TILs are lymphoid cells (T cells) that infiltrate solid tumors (intra-tumoral TILs) and stroma (stromal TILs), which play important roles in the tumor microenvironment., 2 years|Change of QoL (quality of life), QoL scores were assessed by using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTCQLQ-C30) before neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody, before radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, at 3 months after radiotherapy, at 6 months after radiotherapy and 12 months after radiotherapy., 1 year|Number of subjects with major pathologic response (MPR), Major pathologic response rate (MPR) is defined as \> 90% decrease in viable tumor., 21-28 days
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China and Southeast Asia. For locoregionally advanced NPC, especially for the high risk NPC (plasma EBV DNA ≥ 1500 copies/ml), the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve the treatment outcomes of these patients, approximately 25% of locoregionally advanced NPCs still develop relapse and metastasis.

Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve survival and reduce treatment-related toxicity in NPC patients. Accumulating evidence shows that PD-1 antibody is effective for treating recurrent/metastastic NPC patients. This is a Phase II randomized trial to study the effectiveness and toxicity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant PD-1 antibody Toripalimab combined with CCRT versus CCRT plus placebo in treating patients with high risk NPC (Stage III-IVa, AJCC 8th and EBV DNA ≥ 1500 copies/ml).
