Evaluation of Bevacizumab in Combination With First-Line Chemotherapy in Patients Aged 75 Years of Older With Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (Prodige20)
To evaluate tolerance to and efficacy of bevacizumab in the treatment of MCRC in elderly patients, we propose a phase II randomised study comparing a chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm with a chemotherapy alone arm in the first-line treatment of MCRC in patients aged 75 years and older.

This study is destined to continue as a phase III trial if both arms meet the selection criteria to show or not the benefits of treatment with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy.
Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: LV5FU2 simplified, FOLFOX 4 simplified, FOLFIRI modified|DRUG: LV5FU2 simplified,FOLFOX 4 simplified, FOLFIRI modified, Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg/ 2 weeks
Initial examination, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic tomodensitometry or thoracic tomodensitometry and abdomino-pelvic MRI with identification and measurement of the target tumors according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors

)criteria., 21 days before the first course of treatment
Initial examination, Medical history, clinical examination (HR, arterial blood pressure

, temperature, weight, height, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status),

* measurement of body surface area, ECG
* completion of questionnaire by the patient (annexe 1),
* completion of geriatric questionnaire "team" (annexe 2)
* biological examination including:

  * full blood count-platelets
  * blood electrolyte panel, creatinemia
  * Albumin
  * ASAT, ALAT, PAL, GGT, total and conjugated bilirubin
  * CEA, CA 19.9, LDH markers
  * balanced INR for patients on AVK
  * Urinary dip with 24-hour proteinuria if \> 1+
* Measurement of creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft formula (in men: (140-age) x weight (kg)/0.814 x creatinemia (μmol), in women: (140-age) x weight (kg)/0.85 x creatinemia (μmol)),
* In the absence of a cardiological examination in the year before or in the case of a history of severe cardiovascular disease: consultation in cardiology., 14 days before inclusion
