ART: Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Investigation of Functional Imaging During chemoRadioTherapy
This is a single arm, single centre imaging study which will be offered to all consecutive, eligible patients receiving radical chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for anal cancer within Oxford University Hospitals.

Investigations

* Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI)
* Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI MRI)
* MRI scan designed to measure the T1 or produce T1-weighed images (T1 MRI)
* MRI scan designed to measure the T2\* or produce T2\*-weighed images (T2\* MRI)
* Perfusion computed tomography (pCT)
* Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT)

Study Design: Observational

Target Population: Patients undergoing radical CRT for anal cancer in Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust.

Duration on study: Patients should be on study for a maximum of 5 months.

Patient care post-trial: Follow up as per local standard.

No. of Study Site(s): Single Centre, United Kingdon (UK)

End of study: Last Patient, last assessment of response. Patients should be on study for a maximum of 5 months.
Anal Cancer
Changes on DW MRI during CRT in anal cancer., The number of patients with a change in ADC values of \<20% between pre-CRT DW MRI and repeat DW MRI following 8-10 fractions of CRT, Fraction 8-10 of CRT (Day 10-12) compared with prior to CRT (Day 1)
Changes on DCE MRI, Perfusion CT, T2* MRI, FDG PET, Changes on alternative functional imaging modalities following 8-10 fractions of CRT:

* DCE MRI - Change in amplitude and rate of gadolinium enhancement.
* Perfusion CT - Changes in perfusion maps represented by blood flow, blood volume, mean transition time and permeability surface area.
* T2\* MRI - Change in T2\* values in hypoxic regions (with or without oxygen)
* FDG PET - Change in tumour uptake (% change in SUVmax)., Fraction 8-10 of CRT (Day 10-12)|Correlation of findings on different functional images., Correlate size and position of regions of poor vascularity / hypoxia between different images at the same timepoint using volume, centre of mass and overlap comparisons., Both prior to CRT day 1 and fraction 8-10|Correlation of baseline functional images with outcome of CRT, Compare volumes of poor vascularity / hypoxia in baseline scans (as described above) with complete response rates 3 months after CRT., 3 months post CRT compared with prior to CRT (Day 1)|Correlation of the change in functional images over CRT with outcome of CRT, Change in volumes of poor vascularity / hypoxia in baseline scans (as described above) with complete response rates 3 months after CRT., 3 months post CRT
Evaluate the use of T1 mapping in anal cancer, Evaluate change in T1 value (with or without oxygen) and compare with other MRI images., Fraction 8-10 of CRT (Day 10-12)|Evaluate use of dynamic data acquired during FDG PET scan, Analyse baseline data from FDG PET scans at baseline and 8-10 fractions of CRT and compare to static scan results., Prior to CRT day 1 and Fraction 8-10 (Day 10-12)|To use PET SUV data in a radiotherapy in silico modelling exercise to determine if dose sparing of active pelvic bone marrow (PBM) is possible without compromising target coverage by radiation., Compare active PBM regions at baseline and Fraction 8-10 on FDG-PET scans to identify regions of RT induced suppression of active PBM Correlate suppressed active PBM regions with dose received and determine if radiotherapy re-planning could spare active regions without compromising target coverage or sparing of organs at risk (OARs)., Prior to CRT day 1, Fraction 8-10 (Day 10-12) and at end of CRT
