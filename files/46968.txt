Administration of GRASPA (Suspension of Erythrocytes Encapsulating L-asparaginase)in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
The interest in using L-asparaginase in pancreatic cancer arose from in vitro and in vivo studies data showing an anti-neoplastic effect on pancreatic tumor cell lines. Interestingly, these studies suggest an additional effect of L-asparaginase associated to gemcitabine.GRASPA is a suspension of red blood cells encapsulating L-asparaginase. The aim of this phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of GRASPA on locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic tumors, after therapy failure of first or second line chemotherapy using gemcitabine.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: GRASPA
Number of Patients With Dose-limiting Toxicities up to Week 4 After Treatment, Dose limiting toxicities were defined according to CTCAE v3.0 as follow:

Known toxicities related to asparaginase:

* Pancreatic grade 2, 3 or 4
* Allergic, Neurological, Hepatic, Coagulation grade 3 or 4 an any other toxicity of grade 4, 4 weeks
Number of Patients With Limiting Toxicities From Week 4 to Week 8 (End of Study), Limiting toxicities were defined according to CTCAE v3.0 as follow:

Known toxicities related to asparaginase:

* Pancreatic grade 2, 3 or 4
* Allergic, Neurological, Hepatic, Coagulation grade 3 or 4 Any other toxicity of grade 4, 8 weeks|Encapsulated L-asparaginase Pharmacokinetic Parameters Terminal Half-life, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were analyzed for encapsulated asparaginase concentration data using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3.

Free and total L-asparaginase activity was measured during the study and encapsulated asparaginase was defined as the difference between total asparaginase and plasmatic asparaginase., Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56|Encapsulated L-asparaginase Pharmacokinetic Parameters Cmax, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were analyzed for encapsulated asparaginase concentration data using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3.

Free and total L-asparaginase activity was measured during the study and encapsulated asparaginase was defined as the difference between total asparaginase and plasmatic asparaginase., Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56|Encapsulated L-asparaginase Pharmacokinetic Parameters Area Under the Curve to Infinity, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were analyzed for encapsulated asparaginase concentration data using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3.

Free and total L-asparaginase activity was measured during the study and encapsulated asparaginase was defined as the difference between total asparaginase and plasmatic asparaginase., Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56|Change of Asparagine Levels From Baseline (Pharmacodynamics), Duration of plasma asparagine depletion (less than or equal to 2 micromoles/Liter or deamination greater than 90% compared to baseline levels and serum concentrations of L-asparagine, L-aspartate, L-glutamine, and L-glutamate. For pharmacodynamic data, the administration date of the investigational treatment was considered as the reference date for duration calculation. All patients having received a single dose of studied drug GRASPA have been analyzed., Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56|Number of Patient Positive for Anti-L-asparaginase Antibodies, Titers of E. coli anti-asparaginase antibodies evaluated over time to assess immunogenicity, Day 0, 1, 28 and 56|Summary of CEA Level Over Time, Assess tumor response, evaluated by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tumor marker evolution, Day 0, 28, 56|Summary of CA 19.9 Over Time, Tumor response Evaluation by cancer antigen (CA)19.9 evolution over time, Day 0, 28 and 56
