Functional Electrical Stimulation in Irradiated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether functional electrical stimulation is effective in the treatment of dysphagia due to nasopharyngeal cancer post radiotherapy
Dysphagia
DEVICE: Functional electrical stimulation|BEHAVIORAL: Exercise home program
The Change From Baseline and Cut Point VFSS in Velocity of Displacement of Hyoid Bone at 1 to 3 Months, A parameter of the VFSS assessment was velocity of displacement of hyoid bone on 5mL thin barium sulfate bolus, which was defined as the displacement divided by the duration. The outcome measure time frame was based on VFSS assessment with the range between one to three months due to subjects received 1 to 3 times per week. We will provide the mean time frame, which is 2 months., Averaged 2 months
Questionnaire of Life Quality, 1 to 3 months
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients usually underwent radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy(CRT). There were some complications caused by RT, like dysphagia.

In recent studies, functional electrical stimulation (FES) was be used in neurologically dysphagia patients, and there were some positive effects with these studies. Hence, we decided applied FES to these NPC patients with dysphagia.
