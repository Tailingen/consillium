The Exploration of OX40 (CD134) Expression Levels in Sarcoma Specimens and Its Clinical Application in Prognosis Determination
This study aims to investigate the expression of OX40 (CD134) in sarcomas and its impact on prognosis, with the goal of identifying novel biomarkers for early resistance detection and optimizing treatment strategies for sarcoma patients. Sarcomas are a highly heterogeneous group of malignant tumors, for which current treatment options are often suboptimal in certain patients, and effective biomarkers to guide therapy are lacking. As a T-cell costimulatory receptor, OX40 plays a significant role in immune regulation across various solid tumors and holds promise as a potential therapeutic target.

Our research team has previously identified high OX40 expression in sarcomas through database analysis and validated the therapeutic efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates targeting OX40 in in vivo experiments using sarcoma cell lines in murine models. This study will evaluate the mRNA expression levels of OX40 in tumor tissues from sarcoma patients and assess OX40 protein expression using immunohistochemical staining. By integrating these findings with clinical and pathological data, the study will explore the potential of OX40 expression levels in tumor tissues as biomarkers for predicting treatment response and prognosis in primary bone tumors. The results aim to provide scientific evidence for the clinical application of OX40-targeted therapies and to propose novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival outcomes in sarcoma patients.
