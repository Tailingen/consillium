A Study of AG-636 in the Treatment of Subjects With Advanced Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of AG-636, an oral Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, in subjects with advanced lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: AG-636
The frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) associated with AG-636 administration during the first cycle (first 28 days) of treatment., Up to 28 days, on average
Characterize the Safety and Tolerability of AG-636 (number of treatment-related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events), As determined by the number of treatment-related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Up to 24 weeks, on average|Characterize the Pharmacodynamics of AG-636, Measured by changes from baseline in circulating upstream metabolites, Up to 24 weeks, on average|Pharmacokinetics of AG-636 in plasma, Determined by the plasma concentration versus time profile of AG-636, Up to 24 weeks, on average|Clinical activity of AG-636 in Lymphoma, Assessed by either the Lugano criteria for lymphoma or the 2011 International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL)/United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC)/ European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria for mycosis fungoides (MF)/SÃ©zary syndrome (SS), Up to 24 weeks, on average
The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-636 and characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when given by mouth to subjects with advanced lymphoma that is refractory to standard treatment. During the dose escalation part of the study successive cohorts of subjects will be treated with increasing doses of AG-636 in order to determine its maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Subsequently, in the dose expansion part of the study, additional subjects will be treated at the MTD in order to confirm that dose's safety, tolerability, PK and PD, and to provide an opportunity to detect anti-lymphoma activity. The dose expansion part of the study will support the selection of a dose for future clinical studies (a recommended Phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]).
