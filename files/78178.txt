Early Detection of Cardiac Damage With CMR in Women With Breast Cancer
With this study the investigators will assess early cardiac damage by means of Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) in newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and to investigate whether myocardial damage as measured with T1 / T2 Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) mapping and plasma hs-Troponin T is related to changes in GLS.
