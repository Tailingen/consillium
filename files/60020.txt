Investigating the Safety and Efficacy of Rituximab and Pembrolizumab in Relapsed/Refractory Waldenström's Macroglobulinaemia
This study is for patients who have previously been treated for Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM) and their disease has either not responded (known as refractory disease) or has returned (known as relapsed disease). Through this study, the researchers would like to find out whether treating these patients with drugs called rituximab and pembrolizumab is a safe and effective combination for this disease.

In this study, pembrolizumab and rituximab will be given together. In other studies pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective at treating diseases similar to WM. The researchers want to test whether giving pembrolizumab and rituximab together is safe and effective.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Rituximab
Percentage of Patients Achieving at Least a Major Response Rate at 24 Weeks Post Commencing Treatment, The primary outcome is the percentage of patients achieving at least a major response rate at 24 weeks post commencing treatment. A major response rate is defined as a greater than 50% reduction in paraprotein measurement - this is in line with international recognised response criteria for the disease under investigation. In this single arm study all patients receiving treatment were considered applicable for endpoint analysis. There is no comparison as there is only one arm., 24 weeks
Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab and Rituximab as Assessed by the Frequency of Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, According to CTCAE v5.0, As assessed by the number and grade of serious and non-serious adverse events, graded according to CTCAE v5.0, until 5 months post last IMP administration|Complete Response Rate at 24 Weeks Post Commencing Treatment, 24 weeks|Very Good Partial Response Rate at 24 Weeks Post Commencing Treatment, 24 weeks|Time to Maximal Response as Determined by the Time of Registration to the Maximal Disease Response, Assessed at 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 1 year after commencing treatment|Time to Next Treatment, as determined by the time from registration to the next line of therapy, Assessed once per year after completing treatment (average of 1 year)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 1 and 2 Years, 1 and 2 years post commencing treatment|Overall Survival (OS) at 1 and 2 Years, 1 and 2 years post commencing treatment|Quality of Life - Change in Quality of Life (QoL) at 24 Weeks Post Commencing Treatment as Assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, Change in quality of life (QoL) at 24 weeks post commencing treatment as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Daily activities and thoughts/feelings experienced by the patient over the week preceding questionnaire completion are graded on a scale from '1-not at all' to '4-very much'. Also rating of overall health and quality of life from '1-very poor' to '7-excellent', 24 weeks
