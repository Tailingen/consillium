A Study to Identify Markers in Blood and Tissue of HPV Clearance
This is a research study looking at gene characteristics in blood and Pap smear samples in hopes of identifying markers that will predict if the HPV infection is present or not.
HPV Infections
Because infection with high-risk human papillomavirus is a necessary cause of cervical cancer, HPV testing has many potential uses in cervical cancer screening. Unfortunately, like cytology, it suffers from a lack of specificity when used for population-based screening. Given that HPV testing detects more cases of CIN3+ than cytology and that it would probably be more practical in developing regions, finding a biomarker that would increase specificity has been the goal for much research on HPV and cervical cancer. The goal of this study is to explore potential predictors of viral clearance, specifically RNA levels of candidate genes in cervical swabs and host genetic polymorphisms, in the context of genotype-specific infection data.
