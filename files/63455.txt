A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate Paclitaxel Conjugated CXC Receptor 4 Antagonist (MB1707) in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 0.3 mg/kg MB1707 in patients with advanced cancers.

Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) as characterized by type, frequency, severity (NCI CTCAE Version 5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy, Treatment-emergent AEs through 14 days after last protocol therapy will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 14.0 (or higher) System Organ Class and preferred term. The incidences and percentages of participants experiencing each AE preferred term will be summarized with descriptive statistics. AEs will also be summarized by NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0, by grade and by causality (attribution to study treatment)., 14 days|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Determine Maximum observed MB1707 concentration from the time of dosing (0 h) to the time of the last quantifiable MB1707 concentration following dose administration, 2 days|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Determine Time of maximum observed MB1707 concentrations (post-dose), 2 days|Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t), Determine Area under the MB1707 concentration-time curve from the time of dosing (0 h) to the time of the last quantifiable concentration following dose administration, 2 days|Area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCâˆž), Determine Area under the MB1707 concentration-time curve from the time of dosing (0 h), extrapolated to infinity, 2 days|Half-life in plasma (t1/2), Determine Apparent terminal phase half-life of MB1707, 2 days|Total body clearance (CL), Determine total body clearance MB1707, 2 days|Volume of distribution (VZ), Determine Volume of distribution based on the terminal Phase of MB1707, 2 days
MB1707, paclitaxel (PTX) conjugated CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) peptide antagonist, a peptide-drug conjugate (PDC), for the treatment of cancer. MB1707 is a potent CXCR4 antagonist which inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by blocking the stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1, a.k.a. CXCL12)/CXCR4 signaling pathway. MB1707 contains a conjugated drug, paclitaxel. By specific binding to CXCR4 overexpressed by the tumor cells, MB1707 has a built-in targeted delivery mechanism.

The study will evaluate the PK and safety of a single intravenous (IV) dose of 0.3 mg/kg MB1707 in patients with advanced cancers.

Up to 6 patients will be enrolled.

Patients will be treated with a single intravenous (IV) dose of MB1707 over 3 hours on Day 1 only.

Patients will be pre-medicated with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine), a corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone), and a H2 receptor antagonist (e.g., famotidine), within 30 to 60 minutes prior to infusion at doses per institutional guidelines.

Patients will be observed for 60 minutes after Cycle 1 dose administration.

Patients will complete a 14-day Safety Follow-up Visit following the single dose.
