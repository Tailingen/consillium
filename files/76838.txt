Safety, Tolerability and Performance of SmartMatrix Dermal Replacement Scaffold
SmartMatrix™ is a single layer dermal replacement scaffold for full thickness skin replacement. The scaffold consists of a porous matrix of cross-linked human fibrin plus alginate that has been designed and optimised to facilitate wound closure and healing through cellular ingress and rapid growth of new blood vessels.

This proof of concept study will involve patients with surgical wounds resulting from the excision of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma SCC).
