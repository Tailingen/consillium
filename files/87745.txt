MS Versus NICE for Colorectal Lesions
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to compare a recently-developed endoscopic classification with an established one for colorectal lesions in a randomised trial between 2013 and 2015.
Colorectal Neoplasms|Colorectal Polyp
OTHER: Modified Sano's classification|OTHER: NICE classification
Accuracy measures in comparison to the final histopathology in regards to polyps' subtype (neoplastic versus non-neoplastic), Comparison of NICE or MS with the final histopathology in regards to polyps' subtype (i.e. non-neoplastic = Hyperplastic Polyp (HP) and neoplastic = Sessile Serrated Adenoma/Polyp (SSA/P), Adenomatous Polyp (AP), Traditional Serrated Adenoma (TSA), superficial cancer and invasive cancer), After two weeks of the colonoscopy|Accuracy measures in comparison to the final histopathology in regards to polyps' invasiveness, Comparison of NICE or MS with the final histopathology in regards to invasiveness (SSA/P, AP, TSA or superficial cancer versus invasive cancer), After two weeks of the colonoscopy|Accuracy measures in comparison to the final histopathology in regards to polyps' subtype (SSA/P versus non-SSA/P), Comparison of MS with the final histopathology in regards to SSA/P (SSA/P versus non-SSA/P), After two weeks of the colonoscopy
Accuracy in regards to negative predictive value of diminutive distal colorectal polyps, Comparison of NICE or MS with the final histopathology in regards to \<5 mm distal to the sigmoid polyps (NPV for HPs - according to the PIVI guidelines), After two weeks of the colonoscopy|Agreement in predicting post-colonoscopy surveillance interval with final histopathology, Comparison of NICE or MS with the final histopathology in regards to prediction of surveillance interval (according to the PIVI guidelines), Immediately after the colonoscopy (endoscopic) and 2 weeks after (histopathology)
OBJECTIVE: Current practice requires histopathological assessment to confirm diagnosis for colorectal lesions detected at colonoscopy. Advances in endoscopic imaging contribute for real-time diagnosis which, apart from being cost and time-saving, also guides decision-making and reduces risks. Our study aimed to compare a recently-developed endoscopic classification with an established one.

DESIGN: The modified Sano's classification (MS) was compared to the Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) International Colorectal Endoscopic classification (NICE) in a randomised trial between 2013 and 2015. An experimented endoscopist classified each polyp, what was compared to histopathology.
