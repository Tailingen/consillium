Glutaminase Inhibition and Chemoradiation in Advanced Cervical Cancer
Advanced cervical cancer patients treated with standard of care (SOC) chemoradiation plus glutaminase inhibition with telaglenastat (CB-839) will have increased progression-free survival (PFS) compared to historical rates for patients receiving SOC chemoradiation alone.
Advanced Cervical Carcinoma|Cervical Cancer|Cervix Cancer|Cancer of the Cervix
DRUG: Telaglenastat|RADIATION: Radiation treatment|DRUG: Cisplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS) - experimental arm only, * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of telaglenastat to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease: New foci of abnormal FDG uptake not present on the pretreatment FDG-PET study, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 24 months and 9 weeks)
Acute toxicity as measured by number of acute adverse events experienced by participant - experimental arm only, * Toxicity evaluation will report events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAE)
* Acute toxicity is defined as any toxicity occurring within 90 days from first receiving study radiotherapy or death, whatever event is observed first., From start of chemoradiation treatment through 90 days|Late toxicity as measured by number of late adverse events experienced by participant - experimental arm only, * Toxicity evaluation will report events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAE)
* Late toxicities include any toxicity that is determined possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment, within 24 months after completion of treatment., From day 91 through 24 months after completion of chemoradiation|Overall survival (OS), -OS is defined as the days from the start of Telaglenastat treatment to the date of death, censored at the last follow-up otherwise., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 24 months and 9 weeks)
