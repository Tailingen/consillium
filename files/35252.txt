A Study to Assess BMS-986458 Alone and in Combination With Anti-lymphoma Agents in Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, drug levels, and preliminary biological and clinical activity of BMS-986458, a bifunctional cereblon-dependent ligand-directed degrader (LDD) of BCL6 (BCL6 LDD), as a single agent and in combination with anti-lymphoma agents in participants with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
