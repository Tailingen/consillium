Investigation of a New Trial Drug (FE200486) in Prostate Cancer Patients
The purpose of this trial was to find an optimal dose for a new trial drug - degarelix (FE200486) - in the treatment of prostate cancer. Furthermore the safety of the drug was studied. Patients participating were treated with FE200486 on one occasion. Thereafter they came in for visits following a specific schedule until blood samples showed that there was no further effect.

Time From Dosing Until Testosterone Levels >0.5 ng/mL, Intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This outcome measure is based on one testosterone value \>0.5 ng/mL at Day 28 onwards., 3 months
Number of Participants With Testosterone Level ≤0.5 ng/mL for at Least 28 Days, The table shows the number of participants with testosterone level ≤0.5 ng/mL for at least 28 days., Two - six months|Number of Participants With Testosterone Level ≤0.5 ng/mL for at Least 84 Days, The table shows the number of participants with testosterone level ≤0.5 ng/mL for at least 84 days., 3 months|Time to Testosterone Castration (Testosterone ≤0.5 ng/mL), Time to testosterone castration was calculated as the number of days from dosing to the first scheduled visit when testosterone was less than 0.5 ng/mL., 3 months|Time to 50% Reduction in Prostate-specific Antigen Levels, The time to 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline was defined as the number of days from dosing to the first visit where a 50% reduction in PSA level was reached., 3 months|Time to 90% Reduction in Prostate-specific Antigen Levels, The time to 90% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline was defined as the number of days from dosing to the first visit where a 90% reduction in PSA level was reached., 3 months|Evaluation of Liver Function Tests, The figures presents the number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and bilirubin levels plus the number of participants who had ALT increases \>3x ULN and ALT increases \>3x ULN with concurrently increased bilirubin \>1.5 ULN., 3 months|Participants With Markedly Abnormal Change in Vital Signs and Body Weight, Vital signs and body weight included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight at the end of trial as compared to baseline. The table presents the number of participants in each group with normal baseline and markedly abnormal value post-baseline., 3 months
Degarelix was not FDA regulated at the time of the trial. After completion of the trial degarelix has been approved by the FDA and is thus an FDA regulated intervention.
