A Study of Intravenous Aflibercept With Docetaxel in Chinese Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

* To confirm the dose of aflibercept in western studies by assessing the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in combination with docetaxel given intravenously every 3 weeks in Chinese patients with solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the safety profile of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in combination with docetaxel
* To determine the pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept and docetaxel when administered in combination
* To make a preliminary assessment of antitumor effects of the combination of docetaxel plus aflibercept in patients with evaluable disease
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of IV aflibercept
* To measure endogenous free Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
Neoplasm Malignant
DRUG: Aflibercept (AVE0005)|DRUG: Docetaxel (XRP6976)
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), 3 weeks (cycle 1)
Global safety profile based on treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities, Up to 30 days after last administration within a maximum follow up of 18 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters of aflibercept, up to last aflibercept administration +90 days|Pharmacokinetic parameters of docetaxel, cycle 1|Tumor response rate as calculated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), up to a maximum follow-up of 18 months|Immunogenicity of Aflibercept, up to last aflibercept administration+90 days|Endogenous free VEGF, up to last aflibercept administration+30 days
The duration of screening, treatment, and follow-up are within 21 days, 3 weeks/cycle, and 90 days after the last aflibercept administration. Patients will be administered aflibercept in combination with docetaxel until when/if a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met such as progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal to continue.
