Effectiveness of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for Improving the Detection of csPCa in Lesions With PI-RADS Score 3
The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for improving the detection of csPCa in lesions with PI-RADS score 3. This study is a prospective, observational study, single-center research. After recruiting patients who are suspected prostate cancer with a mpMRI PI-RADS version2 score of 3 and willing to perform prostate biopsy to identify the diagnosis, 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI will be performed. Lesions will be reaccessed based on PET/MRI findings and compared with the pathological results.
