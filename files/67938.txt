AGEN1884 Plus AGEN2034 Combined With Cisplatin-Gemcitabine for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a phase II trial to evaluate the tolerability, efficacy, and immune outcomes of AGEN1884 plus AGEN2034 concurrent with cisplatin and gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant treatment of muscle-invasive, non-metastatic bladder cancer prior to radical cystectomy.
Urinary Bladder Neoplasms
DRUG: AGEN1884|DRUG: AGEN2034|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Pathologic Tumor Downstaging of >T2 to pT0, pT0 or pCR (defined as no residual tumor in bladder and lymph nodes on resected specimen). Surgery should be performed within 6 weeks after completing up to 4 cycles (last dose) of neoadjuvant therapy, but can be done up to 10 weeks after treatment ends to be evaluable. Otherwise this patient must be replaced for response evaluation., Completion of four 21 day cycles (approximately 10 weeks)
Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of AGEN1884 Plus AGEN2034 Plus Cisplatin and Gemcitabine, Evaluation of safety and tolerability of using Agen1884 plus AGEN2034 plus cisplating and gemcitabine chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer prior to radial cystectomy. Number of adverse events assessed between 3-5 using the National Cancer Institution Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0), Baseline to 90 days|Pathologic Downstaging to <T2 Rate, Number of subjects who achieved downstaging of the tumor at completion of the possible 4 chemotherapy cycles., Baseline to Completion of four 21 day cycles (approximately 10 weeks)|Completion of Surgery, Number of subjects that progressed from therapy to surgery, 90 days|Progression-free Survival at 1 Year, Number of subjects that survived to 1 year from study start without disease progression, 1 year
Correlate Immune Outcomes, To correlate clinical outcomes with immune and biologic endpoints and identify patient and tumor characteristics that can predict treatment responses, 2 years
We will begin with an initial safety run-in to establish the safety of the combination prior to expansion to the full planned phase II. The overall phase II will be an open-label, single arm study in two stages to evaluate the efficacy of the combination in pathologic downstaging of MIBC. Patients will receive four 21-day cycles of neoadjuvant therapy consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 in all 4 cycles and AGEN1884 in cycles 1 and 3. Patients will proceed to radical cystectomy within 10 weeks after the final dose of this therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic tumor downstaging will be assessed at the time of cystectomy.
