Safety and Efficacy of Pomalidomide, Bortezomib and Low-dose Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib and low dose dexamethasone to the combination of bortezomib and low dose dexamethasone in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also assess how safe the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib and low dose dexamethasone is compared to the combination of bortezomib and low dose dexamethasone.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Progression Free Survival by Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC), Progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated as the time between the randomization and progressive disease (PD) or death.

Progressive Disease is defined as an Increase of ≥ 25% from nadir in:

* Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL)g
* Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 hours)
* In patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, the absolute increase must be \> 100 mg/dL.
* Bone marrow plasma cell percentage, the absolute % must be ≥ 10%h
* Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. -Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder., From randomization to progressive disease or death during the IRAC assessment period, up to approximately 42 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause., From randomization to date of death, up to approximately 65 months|Overall Response Rate by Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC), The ORR together with the relative proportions in each response category (ie, stringent CR \[sCR\], CR, very good PR \[VGPR\], PR, SD, and PD) by treatment using the IMWG criteria will be examined.

Complete Response: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow

SCR: CR+ Normal FLC ratio and Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence

VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine Mprotein level \< 100 mg per 24 hours

PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hours

Progressive Disease: Please refer to Primary outcome measure for definition

SD: Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease, From randomization to progressive disease or death during the IRAC assessment period, up to approximately 42 months|Duration of Response by Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC), Duration of myeloma response is defined as the duration from the time when the IMWG response criteria are first met for sCR or CR or VGPR or PR until the first date the response criteria are met for PD or until the subject died from any cause, whichever occurs first.

Complete Response: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow

SCR: CR+ Normal FLC ratio and Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence

VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine Mprotein level \< 100 mg per 24 hours

PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hours

Progressive Disease: Please refer to Primary outcome measure for definition

SD: Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease, From randomization to progressive disease or death during the IRAC assessment period, up to approximately 42 months|Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose date of the study treatment and within 28 days after the last dose date., From first dose to 28 days after the last dose (up to approximately 44 months|Number of Participants With Grade 5 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose date of the study treatment and within 28 days after the last dose date., From first dose to 28 days after the last dose (up to approximately 44 months
