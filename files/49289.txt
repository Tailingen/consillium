A Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of AMG 386 and Sorafenib to Treat Advanced or Inoperable Hepatocellular Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether AMG 386, in combination with Sorafenib, is effective in the treatment of advanced or inoperable Hepatocellular cancer in subjects who have not received any prior systemic therapy except surgery or locoregional therapy.

Disease status and disease progression will be assessed every 8 weeks. Subjects will remain on treatment until: progressive disease by RECIST criteria; clinical progression; death or loss to follow-up; or withdrawal of informed consent.

The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 386 in combination with sorafenib as measured by the progression free survival (PFS) rate at 4 months in subjects with advanced or inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
