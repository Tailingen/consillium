Pharmacokinetic Study of Liposomal Vincristine in Patients With Malignant Melanoma & Hepatic Dysfunction
The purpose of this study is to see how vincristine, when placed in an oil droplet called a liposome (VSLI), is absorbed, distributed (moved around) and excreted from the the body (pharmacokinetics). This study will also assess the safety of VSLI and to see if VSLI will slow the growth or shrink tumors in patients with metastatic melanoma that has resulted in liver impairment, and who have relapsed after previous therapies.

T 1/2, The PK profiles of total plasma VCR following a single intravenous infusion at a target dose of 1.0 mg/m2 for approximately 1 hour every 2 weeks (one cycle) to three male and four female subjects with malignant melanoma and hepatic dysfunction secondary to metastases were measured., cycle 1 day 1|Clearance, The pharmacokinetic profile of VCR on Day 1 of Cycle 1 Cl is mL/h/m2, Day 1 of Cycle 1|Volume of Distribution, The PK profiles of total plasma VCR following a single intravenous infusion at a target dose of 1.0 mg/m2 for approximately 1 hour, cycle 1 day 1
OBJECTIVES:

Primary: To assess the pharmacokinetics of VSLI administered intravenously to patients with malignant melanoma and hepatic dysfunction secondary to metastases.

Secondary: To assess the safety and antitumor activity of VSLI in this population.
