Multicenter Trial Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Negative B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia of Young Adults
The purpose of this study is to prospectively validate the new risk model, based on minimal residual disease (MRD) response level and oncogenetic status by comparing historical results of GRAALL-2005 with those of GRAALL-2014 in an identical population of patients (Philadelphia chromosome negative, B lineage ALL, aged 18 to 59 years old).
