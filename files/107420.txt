Prospective Non-Interventional Study Comparing Osimertinib +/- Chemotherapy for EGFR-Mutated NSCLC Patients
The goal of the study is to collect data on patients treated outside of a clinical trial (in routine clinical practice) with standard of care osimertinib with or without chemotherapy in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to better understand the safety and effectiveness of these standard of care regimens.

DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Osimertinib + Chemotherapy
real-world Progression-Free Survival (rwPFS), Time from initiating therapy to progression or death without documented progression, From initiation of therapy to progression or death, up to 3 years
real-world Overall Survival (rwOS), Time from initial therapy to death from any cause., From initiation of therapy to death, up to 3 years|real-world time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD), Time from treatment initiation (osimertinib or osimertinib + chemotherapy) to discontinuation of osimertinib., From initiation of therapy to discontinuation of osimertinib, up to 3 years
This study tests the feasibility of using real-world data collection through the recruitment of well-characterized patients into a registry, spanning academic and community practice sites to determine patient outcomes in all-comers. The scientific community would further benefit from a greater understanding of the safety and effectiveness of newly approved therapies prescribed in routine clinical practice.

Non-interventional (observational) study with 250 participants per exposure group (maximum accrual up to 538 total participants) comparing outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, not being treated in a clinical trial but receiving standard of care osimertinib +/- chemotherapy.

The treating physician determines whether a patient will receive standard of care single agent osimertinib or osimertinib with chemotherapy and the planned treatment is recorded at registration.

Clinical/Imaging assessments will be per the treating physician.
