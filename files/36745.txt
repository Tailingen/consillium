PRO-CTCAE was a PRO measurement system developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in participants on cancer clinical trials. The PRO-CTCAE Item Library included 124 items representing 78 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE. PRO-CTCAE items were planned to evaluate the symptom attributes of frequency, severity, interference, amount, presence/absence. Each symptomatic AE was planned to be assessed by 1 to 3 attributes. Conditional branching logic was planned to be used with electronic data capture, thereby reducing respondent burden. The recall period was planned as the past 7 days and PRO-CTCAE responses were planned to score from 0 to 4 (or 0/1 for absent/present)., Up to approximately 2 years 90 days|Part B (Dose Expansion): Pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Peds-PRO-CTCAE), Proportion of participants reporting different levels of presence/magnitude/interference (as applicable) of diarrhea, rash, and fatigue over time based on peds-PRO-CTCAE was planned to be evaluated.

The pediatric module included 130 items representing 62 symptomatic toxicities and permitted self-reporting by children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years. In this study, 17 symptomatic toxicities were planned for selection. Thus, the total number of questions that participants would have answered ranged from 17 (assuming that no branching questions were triggered, ie, the participant answered '0' to the initial question for each symptom) to 42 items (assuming that all possible branching questions were triggered for every symptom posed to the participant)., Up to approximately 2 years 90 days|Part B (Dose Expansion): Patient Global Impression of Treatment Tolerability (PGI-TT), Proportion of participants reporting different levels of overall side-effect bother over time based on the PGI-TT was planned to be evaluated.

For adult participants only, the PGI-TT item was included to assess how a participant perceived the overall burden of treatment-related side effects of cancer treatment over the past 7 days. Participants were planned to be asked to choose the response that best described the level of burden by the side effect of their cancer treatment over the past week. The planned response options were:"not at all", "a little bit", "somewhat", "quite a bit", and "very much"., Up to approximately 2 years 90 days|Part B (Dose Expansion): European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Item List (IL)XX QL2 [2-item Global Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL)], Proportion of participants reporting different levels of quality of life/health over time based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item List (EORTC) ILXX QL2 items was planned to be evaluated.

EORTC QLQ-C30 was a 30-item self-administered questionnaire designed for all cancer types. Questions were grouped into 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), 2-item global HRQoL (QL2) scale, 5 single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), and 1 item on the financial impact of the disease. Participants were planned to answer QLQ-C30 questions in reference to how they had been over the past week. Final scores were planned to transform to range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated better functioning, better HRQoL, or greater level of symptoms., Up to approximately 2 years 90 days
Part A (Dose Escalation): Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), The safety and tolerability of sabestomig in participants with r/r cHL were assessed.

An AESI was an AE of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of a study intervention and may have required close monitoring and rapid communication to AstraZeneca by the Investigator.

The AESIs for sabestomig include events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy., From start of treatment [C1D1 (each cycle was 28 days)] up to 90 days post last dose (approximately 2 years 5 months)
This is a Phase I/II, open-label multi-center study will have sabestomig administered via intravenous infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 to adult/young adult patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r cHL). This study will have 2 parts: Phase 1 (Part A) Dose Escalation and Phase 2 (Part B) Dose Expansion.

Patients will be treated with study intervention for a maximum of 35 cycles, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or if other reasons to discontinue treatment occur.

The trial was intended to be Phase I/II trial (but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2). Hence, the study Phase was updated to Phase I.
