A Study of LY4101174 in Participants With Recurrent, Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug, LY4101174, is safe, tolerable and effective in participants with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study is conducted in two parts - phase Ia (dose-escalation, dose-optimization) and phase Ib (dose-expansion). The study will last up to approximately 4 years.

This is a Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label study in participants with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study is comprised of two phases: Dose Escalation and Dose Optimization (1a), and Dose expansion (1b). Phase 1a will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LY4101174 to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)/optimal dose. Phase 1b will evaluate efficacy and safety of LY4101174 at the RP2D/optimal dose in 7 expansion cohorts based on tumor type and/or treatment history.
