Ethnic/Racial Differences in Metabolism and DNA Adduct Formation
The study will investigate the role of 1,3-butadiene metabolic activation and deactivation in lung cancer risk among various ethnic/racial groups. This project will require urine samples from smokers and nonsmokers from the three ethnic/racial groups recruited by the Clinical and Biomarker Core for the analysis of 1,3-butadiene DNA adducts. Data on nicotine intake (urinary TNE) in these subjects as well as in 400 lung cancer cases and 400 controls from Project 1 will be also required for this project.
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Urine Sample
Butadiene-DNA adducts in different ethnic groups, Investigate ethnic differences in butadiene-DNA adducts in smokers belonging to different ethnic groups., Day 1 & 2|Butadiene-DNA adduct load in smokers with lung cancer, Investigate the association between butadiene-DNA adduct load and lung cancer development in smokers., Day 1 & 2|Polymorphisms of carnicogen metabolizing genes, Examine how polymorphisms of carcinogen metabolizing genes influence metabolic inactivation, DNA adduct formation/repair, and toxicity of butadiene-derived epoxides., Day 1 & 2
