Weekly Vinblastine for Chemotherapy Naive Children With Progressive Low Grade Glioma (PLGGs)
The overall objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of weekly Vinblastine in chemotherapy na√Øve patients with progressive or incompletely resected paediatric low grade glioma, to generate estimates of the response rate, progression-free survival, toxicity and quality of daily living among the population treated and determine biologic factors which will enable us to predict tumour behaviour.
Glioma
DRUG: Vinblastine Sulphate
The response rate to weekly vinblastine, 70 Weeks
The progression-free survival with Vinblastine, At one year, two years and three years|The quality of daily life during treatment, 26 Weeks|The correlation of biological features of LGG with tumour behaviour, 5 years|To determine the role of telomere maintenance in the prognosis and evolution of PLGG, 5 years
Unresectable low grade glioma (LGG) of childhood increasingly appears as a chronic condition for which multiple treatments may be required. While several studies have shown evidence of short term tumour control with chemotherapy, the progression-free survival at 5 years is unsatisfactory. In addition, several regimens currently used for this condition are associated with significant risks of side effect and long term toxicity.

We have piloted in a single arm study the feasibility and efficacy of Vinblastine for children with recurrent and refractory low grade glioma, who have failed at least one line of treatment (chemotherapy and/or irradiation). Preliminary results show promising activity with minimal toxicity.
