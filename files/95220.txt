The Association of Psychological Stress with the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer
This study aims to explore the relationship between psychological stress and the therapeutic response in breast cancer patients who have received standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Exposure: psychological stress status
Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, pCR is defined as the absence of viable tumor cells in both the tumor bed and lymph nodes. The pCR rate refers to the percentage of patients who achieve this complete response., 2 years
Quality of life, Quality of Life (QoL) is assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B, Version 4.0)., 2 years|peripheral stress biomarkers, The stress biomarkers, including cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), were measured to evaluate the association between peripheral stress biomarkers and the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy., 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume has decreased to a predetermined value and who can maintain that reduction for the minimum required duration., 2 years
Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women. Approximately 19% to 30% of patients with breast cancer achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy, while about 5% to 20% of patients experience disease progression. Increasing evidence suggests the significant role of psychological factors in influencing cancer treatment outcomes. Cancer patients often experience emotional distress, including fear of relapse, anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, which may persist for many years. Statistics indicate that the incidence of anxiety and depression among cancer patients is 49.69% and 54.90%, respectively, significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (anxiety: 18.37%, depression: 17.50%) in China. There are indications that emotional issues may be linked to cancer treatment, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between anxiety and depression and the effectiveness of standard neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.
