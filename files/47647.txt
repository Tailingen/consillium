Pilot Study of PLX3397 in Patients With Advanced Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of PLX3397 on male subjects with CRPC.

Secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of PLX3397 and the anti-tumor effects that PLX3397 has on the the subjects.

DRUG: PLX3397
Summary of High Circulating Tumor Cell Count Number In Men With Radiographically Progressive Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and High Circulating Tumor Cells, Effects of PLX3397 on CTC number in men with radiographically progressive CRPC and high CTC counts (â‰¥10 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood using CellSearch Assay)

CTC counts were to be evaluated at the following time points: Screening, Baseline, every 4 weeks after treatment initiation, and at Safety Follow-up.

Radiographic tumor evaluation were to be performed every 8 weeks. Progression at the first reassessment required a confirmatory scan at a minimum of 6 weeks later, and treatment with study medication was to continue until the progression had been confirmed., See measure description for time frame.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of PLX3397 on male subjects with CRPC.

Secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of PLX3397 and the anti-tumor effects that PLX3397 has on the the subjects.
