Study of IBI323 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI323(anti-LAG-3/PD-L1) or in combination with chemotherapy in participants with advanced malignancies. Another purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics,pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of IBI323
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: IBI323
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI323 \[Adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AE (TRAE), immune-related AEs (irAE), serious adverse event (SAE), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed by CTCAE v5.0\], 24 months
Investigator Assessments of Overall Response Rate(ORR), RECIST v1.1 will be used to determine ORR by investigator, 24 months|Disease Control Rate(DCR), RECIST v1.1 will be used to determine DCR by investigator, 24 months|PFS (progression-free survival), RECIST v1.1 will be used to determine PFS by investigator, 24 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), 24 months
