Cumulative CD54+ Cell Count, Descriptive summarization of the cumulative sum of CD54+ counts across infusions.

Cumulative CD54 upregulation = CD54 upregulation for infusion 1 + CD54 upregulation for infusion 2 + CD54 upregulation for infusion 3, Before and after culture with PAP-GM-CSF, on Day 3 (first infusion) and on approximately Days 17 and 31 (second and third infusion, respectively)|Cumulative CD54 Upregulation, The increase in surface CD54 on APCs, expressed as an upregulation ratio of the average number of molecules on post-culture versus pre-culture cells. Cumulative CD54 upregulation = CD54 upregulation ratio for infusion 1 + CD54 upregulation ratio for infusion 2 + CD54 upregulation ratio for infusion 3., Before and after culture with PAP-GM-CSF, on Day 3 (first infusion) and on approximately Days 17 and 31 (second and third infusion, respectively)|Cumulative Total Nucleated Cell (TNC) Count, Descriptive summarization of the cumulative sum of TNC counts across infusions, Before and after culture with PAP-GM-CSF, on Day 3 (first infusion) and on approximately Days 17 and 31 (second and third infusion, respectively)|Product Viability (Percentage), Product viability was measured as the percentage of live PBMC in final product for infusion 1, 2, and 3 as measured by a trypan blue assay and are reported for each final product for infusion 1, 2, and 3., Before and after culture with PAP-GM-CSF, on Day 3 (first infusion) and on approximately Days 17 and 31 (second and third infusion, respectively)
This was an open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center study. Study participants will underwent screening procedures to ensure that they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects underwent a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an infusion of sipuleucel-T. This process was be repeated at approximately 2-week intervals for a total of 3 infusions.

In Austria, The Netherlands, and France, a study completion visit occurred between 30 and 37 days post-final infusion, or between 30 and 37 days post-final leukapheresis for subjects not receiving at least 1 infusion. In the UK, a follow-up visit occurred 30 days after the subject's final infusion and a study completion visit occurred 6 months after the subject's final infusion.
