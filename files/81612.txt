CAR-T Cellular Therapy for B Cell Malignancies Involved in CNS
This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy involved in CNS. 20 patients were enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety. The secondary objective is to explore the efficacy.
Hematological Malignancy
OTHER: CAR-T cells
Adverse events that related to treatment, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 2 years
The response rate of CAR-T treatment in patients with relapse/refractory B cell malignancies involved in CNS that treated by CD19 CAR-T cells therapy, The response rate of BCMA CAR-T treatment will be recorded and assessed according to WHO criteria, 6 months
This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy involved in CNS. All together 20 patients were enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety including the complication of cytokine release syndrome, CRES, pancytopenia and infection. The secondary objective is to explore the efficacy. We will also detect CAR-T cell expansion dynamics in blood and cerebral fluid and compare the difference.
