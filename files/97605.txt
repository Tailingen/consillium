A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3811 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
TQB3811 tablet is a second-generation tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activity of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and also selectively inhibits the kinase activity of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that produce secondary drug-resistant mutations.
