Avastin/Temozolomide/Irinotecan for Unresectable/Multifocal Glioblastoma Multiforme
The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of Avastin in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan in terms of response rate. The secondary objectives are to describe the overall and progression-free survivals of unresectable patients treated with upfront Avastin, temozolomide and irinotecan and to assess the safety of Avastin, temozolomide and irinotecan in unresectable glioblastoma patients.

This is a phase II study with the combination of Avastin, temozolomide and irinotecan for unresectable or multifocal World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma patients. Patients will receive up to four cycles of Avastin, temozolomide and irinotecan. Approximately 41 subjects will take part in this study at Duke.

Response Rate, The percentage of participants with a complete or partial response as determined by a modification of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance on MR/CT of all enhancing tumor and mass effect, off all corticosteroids (or receiving only adrenal replacement doses) and accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. Partial Response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR/CT by bi-dimensional measurement, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. Per the criteria, confirmation of response was required. Response rate = CR+PR., 4 months
Incidence and Severity of Central Nervous System (CNS) Hemorrhage and Systemic Hemorrhage, Incidence and severity of CNS hemorrhage and systemic hemorrhage- The adverse events for this study were collected using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, and have been converted to CTCAE version 4.0 for entry into ClinicalTrials.gov., 4 months|Incidence of Grade ≥ 4 Hematologic and ≥ Grade 3 Non-hematologic Toxicities, Incidence of treatment-related, grade ≥ 4 hematologic and ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities- The adverse events for this study were collected using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, and have been converted to CTCAE version 4.0 for entry into ClinicalTrials.gov., 4 months|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time in months from the start of study treatment to the date of first progression according to RANO criteria, or to death due to any cause. Per RANO, progression is a ≥ 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions, worsening T2/FLAIR, any new lesion, or clinical deterioration. Patients alive who had not progressed as of the last follow-up had PFS censored at the last follow-up date. Median PFS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., 36 months|Median Overall Survival (OS), Time in months from the start of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause. Patients alive as of the last follow-up had OS censored at the last follow-up date. Median OS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., 36 months
