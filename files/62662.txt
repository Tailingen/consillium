A Study of Darbepoetin Alfa in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The primary objectives of the trial are to assess erythroid response to darbepoetin alfa, as determined by changes in hemoglobin and/or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence and to describe the safety profile of darbepoetin alfa in patients with MDS. The secondary objective is to assess bone marrow progenitor BFU-E growth before and after treatment with darbepoetin alfa.
