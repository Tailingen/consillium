Adjuvant 6 Cycles of Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide or 3 Cycles of Cyclophosphamide/Epirubicin/Fluorouracil Followed by 3 Cycles of Docetaxel Versus 4 Cycles of Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in Operable Breast Cancer (MASTER)
We aimed to evaluate the noninferiority of a short-term anthracycline-free chemotherapy (TC, six cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide) or a short-term anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CEF-T, three cycles of cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/fluorouracil followed by three cycles of docetaxel) to a standard anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy (EC-P, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by paclitaxel for twelve weeks) in operable breast cancer.

It was initiated as an adjuvant chemotherapy trial in 2010 to test noninferiority of an anthracycline-free short-term regimen (T75C600 x 6 \[TC\] once every 3 weeks) or a short-term regimen (C500E100F500 x 3 once every 3 weeks followed by T100 x 3 every 3 weeks \[CEF-T\]) compared with a standard long-term anthracycline-containing regimen (E90C600 x 4 once every 3 weeks followed by P80 x 12 once every week \[EC-P\]). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm after completing surgical excision of primary tumor. Trastuzumab was administered in combination with chemotherapy to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and sustained monotherapy as per the current guidelines.
