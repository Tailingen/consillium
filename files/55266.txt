Positron Emission Tomography(PET) in Lymphoma Assessment
This study examines the role of a diagnostic test called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning in patients with malignant lymphoma. The primary goal of this study is to find out how well PET scanning can detect malignant (cancerous) lymphoma, and how often this extra information will result in a change of stage of disease, or will result in a change in treatment management plans of patients with lymphoma.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: PET Scan
To determine:the frequency in which the FDG-PET scan result will change the clinical management of the patient, and to record the intervention instituted within 3 months of the PET scan 2)early relapse rates for PET positive, and PET negative patients., 24 months
To:1) describe & quantify potential changes in clinical practice caused by the adoption of FDG-PET scanning 2)correlate FDG-PET scan findings with disease characteristics, traditional standard response criteria, biopsy results, & early clinical outcome., 24 months
It is currently unknown whether modifying treatment based on FDG-PET results is appropriate. However, clinicians are increasingly using the FDG-PET result, where obtained, in deciding management. Consequently, it would be premature to mandate PET-based treatment modifications in this protocol. Patients will be treated with existing protocols at the discretion of their treating oncologists, based on available information. Oncologists will be surveyed as to whether FDG-PET scan results could have (or affect patient management, and the intervention will be recorded).
