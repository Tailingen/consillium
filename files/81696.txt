PhysioTouch for Treatment of Radiation Fibrosis
A quarter of a million women will develop breast cancer (BC) in this year alone. Many of these women will have side effects as a result of their breast cancer treatment. Radiation Fibrosis Syndrome (RFS) is a common complication from breast cancer treatment that progressively changes tissue and can cause decreased function, pain, and range of motion. The PhysioTouch is a hand held device that can be used to treat RFS and may improve the treatment of fibrotic tissue. This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy of using the PhysioTouch in addition to current standard of care for treatment of BC-related RFS.
