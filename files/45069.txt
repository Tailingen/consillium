EValuation of radIOLigand Treatment in mEn With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-I&T
This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of \[161Tb\]Tb -PSMA-I\&T in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Prostate Cancer|Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: [ 161 Tb]Tb PSMA I&T
Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which the incidence of DLT was less than 1/3 or 2/6., Dose escalation phase is expected to be completed 6 months from the time the first patient is recruited.|Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) measured using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, Safety of the combination will be measured by AEs and SAEs., Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment|Dose Limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as a toxicity that prevents further administration of the trial treatment at that dose level. Each cohort of 3 patients will be assessed for DLTs after 6 weeks from administration of cycle 1., Dose escalation phase is expected to be completed 6 months from the time the first patient is recruited.|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), After the MTD is established, additional patients will be treated at the MTD. Safety and efficacy data from the study will be used to define the RP2D., Up to 30 months from the time the first patient is recruited.
Absorbed radiation dose, Absorbed radiation dose will be determined using the SPECT/CT imaging after administration of the first dose of \[161Tb\]Tb-PSMA-I\&T, On Day 4 of Cycle 1 (each Cycle is 42 days)|50% Prostate-Specific Antigen Response Rate (PSA-RR), PSA will be assessed at baseline and every 3 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 during treatment, and every 6 weeks during follow-up. PSA response will be defined as a 50% or greater decrease in PSA from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result., Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment or until PSA progression|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time from registration to the first date of documented radiographic progression using conventional imaging or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Radiographic progression will be assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue and PCWG3 for bone lesions, Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment|PSA progression free survival (PSA-PFS), PSA progression is defined as a rise in PSA by more than 25% AND more than 2ng/mL above the nadir (lowest PSA point). This needs to be confirmed by a repeat PSA performed at least 3 weeks later. Early rises in PSA prior to 12 weeks will be disregarded in determining PSA progression., Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment or until PSA progression|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time to PSA progression, radiographic progression, or death due to any cause, Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment or until PSA progression|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of death due to any cause., Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment|Objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST1.1) in patients with measurable disease, Objective Response (OR) is only applicable for the subset of patients with measurable disease by RECIST1.1. OR is defined as a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) at any stage from time of commencement of protocol treatment to the time of subsequent systemic anti-cancer treatment. The ORR is calculated as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR., Through study completion, up until 12 months after the last patient commences treatment|Describe worst pain within 24 hours of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) completion, Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)., Pain will be assessed at baseline, then at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks|Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), HR-QoL will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. The endpoint is the trial outcome index (TOI) score from FACT-P, Through completion of 12 months after treatment commencement of last patient
This prospective, single-centre, single-arm phase I/II trial will assess the safety, efficacy and anti-tumour activity of \[161Tb\]Tb-PSMA-I\&T in patients with mCRPC.

This study aims to assess and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of \[161Tb\]Tb-PSMA-I\&T in patients with mCRPC.

42 men with mCRPC who have progressed with at least one line of taxane chemotherapy and at least one second-generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agent will be enrolled in this trial in two stages: dose escalation and a dose expansion phase over a period of 24 months.
