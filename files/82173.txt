The purpose of this study is to compare the results in older patients who have newly diagnosed or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and who are to either receive decitabine or patient's choice with the physician's advice of either cytarabine or supportive care medication.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Cytarabine or Supportive Care|DRUG: Dacogen (decitabine) only
Overall Survival in Patients 65 Years or Older Who Have Newly Diagnosed de Novo or Secondary AML., The interval from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or the last date the subject was known to be alive or 5 years whichever occurs first., The interval from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or the last date the subject was known to be alive or 5 years whichever occurs first.
Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) Plus Complete Remission With Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp), Morphologic CR plus CRp rate where Morphologic leukemia-free state defined as less that (\<) 5 percent (%) blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and a count of greater than or equal to (\>=) 200 nucleated cells (there should have been no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease) plus absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than (\>)1,000 per microliter (/mcL), platelet count of \>=100,000/mcL, and the participant must have been independent of transfusions for at least 1 week before each assessment. There was no duration requirement for confirmation of this designation and Morphologic CR without the requirement of platelet count \>=100,000/mcL., Post randomization when at least one post-baseline bone marrow assessment or peripheral blood count data available (up to 29.5 months)
