Tissue Collection Protocol for Gastroesophageal Cancers
This proposed collection of primary tumor cells lines will benefit esophageal cancer research within the University Health Network. This collection of gastro-esophageal tumor samples will be used to grow primary tumor cell lines, which will provide researchers with ready samples of various gastro-esophageal cancers. This will help to address the issue of access to these cell lines due to the limited number of patients with gastro-esophageal tumors, and high rates of contamination.

OTHER: Tissue Collection
Effectively culture, proliferate, and store primary gastro-esophageal cell lines in order to create a bank of primary esophageal / gastric cancers for research purposes, The primary objective of this study is to determine an effective way to culture, proliferate, and store primary gastro-esophageal cell lines in order to create a bank of primary esophageal / gastric cancers or GERD with/without Barrett's esophagus for research purposes, in addition we will be creating organoids., Ongoing
Samples will be collected during surgery, EGD, or other biopsy. The surgeon will resect a sample for the research coordinator and/or fellow who will collect the sample and take it back to the lab for processing. Samples collected will be in excess of standard samples that are sent for pathology. The surgeon will make sure that excess samples will not affect pathological diagnosis. In addition samples may be purchased from the National Cancer Institute's Cooperative Human Tissue Network.
