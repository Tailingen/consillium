Phase 1b/2 Study of the Combination of IMCgp100 With Durvalumab and/or Tremelimumab in Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma
This study was a mixed phase Ib/II, multi-center, open-label study of tebentafusp (IMCgp100) as a single agent, and in combination with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab, in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of tebentafusp (IMCgp100) in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736, programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] inhibitor), tremelimumab (CLTA-4 inhibitor), and the combination of durvalumab with tremelimumab compared to single-agent tebentafusp (IMCgp100) alone administered as an intravenous or subcutaneous. The study will enroll patients who have metastatic melanoma that is refractory to treatment with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor in the metastatic setting. This study will also evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of tebentafusp (IMCgp100) monotherapy in patients with advanced non-uveal melanoma who progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitors approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma; patients with BRAF mutations must be refractory to approved BRAF-based therapy.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Tebentafusp (IMCgp100)
Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Up to ~2 years
As of Amendment 9, a potential phase 2 portion of the study was to be opened after identification of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Arm 5 (tebentafusp sc monotherapy). However, the phase 2 portion of the study was never initiated.
