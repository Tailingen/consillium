A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of ONO-7746 in Adult Cancer Patients With Chemotherapy Induced Thrombocytopenia
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONO-7746 across multiple doses in patients with solid tumors and chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) scheduled to receive at least two cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy on Day 1 every 21 days at the same dosages and schedule in the study. The secondary objectives are to characterize the PK profiles of ONO-7746 and to explore the pharmacodynamic effect of ONO-7746 on CIT.
Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: ONO-7746
Safety and tolerability of ONO-7746 across ascending multiple doses using vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, ECOG performance status, CT/MRI, laboratory tests, up to four 21-day cycles (up to 84 days)
Characterization of PK profiles on ONO-7746 and exploration of the PD effect of ONO-7746, including changes in platelet counts and any potential effects on ECGs, up to four 21-day cycles (up to 84 days)
