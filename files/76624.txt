Impact of Preoperative Serum Albumin Level on Postoperative Outcomes in Chinese HCC Patients Treated With Surgery
This is an observational and retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of the preoperative serum albumin concentration on postoperative outcomes among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who received hepatectomy or liver transplantation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Postoperative complications, Complications following surgery that occurred during hospitalization. For the hepatectomy cohort of patients, postoperative complications included incision, urinary tract and abdominal infections, pleural fluid, ascites, post-hepatectomy hemorrhage bile leakage, post hepatectomy liver failure, renal insufficiency, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia and pulmonary embolism, etc. For the LT cohort of patients, postoperative complications included primary nonfunction, hemorrhage, hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis, bile leakage, acute kidney injury, deep wound infections and catheter-related infections., up to 2 weeks
Mortality, Death occurring during the postoperative hospital stay., up to 2 weeks
Days of hospital stay, The length of stay in hospital after surgery., up to 2 weeks|Days of ICU stay, The length of stay in ICU after surgery., up to 4 weeks
The impact of hypoalbuminemia on postoperative outcomes has been the subject of several investigations which agreed that hypoalbuminemia is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity after various types of surgical operations. Unfortunately, there are limited real-world data to establish the correlation between hypoalbuminemia and hepatectomy or liver transplantation postoperative complications in China. This study will evaluate the impact of the preoperative serum albumin concentration on postoperative outcomes among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who received hepatectomy or liver transplantation.
