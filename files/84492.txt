Study of TDXd, Chemotherapy, Pembrolizumab, and Trastuzumab in First-Line Metastatic HER2-Positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
This clinical trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the triplet combination of trastuzumab deruxtecan (ENHERTU, T-DXd, DS-8201a) plus a fluoropyrimidine plus pembrolizumab versus standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab plus pembrolizumab as first-line therapy in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive tumor PD-L1 CPS ≥1 gastric or GEJ cancer in the Main Cohort. An Exploratory Cohort will also be evaluated to assess the efficacy and safety of T-DXd plus a fluoropyrimidine versus SoC chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive tumor PD-L1 CPS \<1 gastric or GEJ cancer.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, From date of randomization to the date of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 59 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, From date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to 59 months
