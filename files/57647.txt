Nal-IRI/5-FU/LV Chemotherapy Combined with PD-L1 Inhibitor and Multi-target Anti-angiogenic Small Molecule±SBRT As Second-line Therapy in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients
This study is a single-arm, multi-center, multi-cohort, prospective clinical study initiated by the investigator.

The indication of this study is: patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have progressed after first-line chemotherapy. Eligible patients will be assigned to liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) (nal-IRI/5-FU/LV) combined with benmelstobart and anlotinib ± SBRT.

The total sample size for this study is expected to be 56 subjects.
Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: nal-IRI,5-fu,LV, benmelstobart, anlotinib
Objective effective rate (ORR), The overall response rate, including complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor shrinks to a certain amount and remains for a certain period of time., 28 days per cycle, with ≤6 cycles of treatment expected per patient
Disease control rate (DCR), Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk or stable and remain for a certain period of time, including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable (SD) cases., 28 days per cycle, with ≤6 cycles of treatment expected per patient|Median overall survival (mOS), Refers to the numerical value in which the survival time of all patients is arranged in the order from smallest to largest in clinical research, and is located in the middle position., 28 days per cycle, with ≤6 cycles of treatment expected per patient|Median progression-free survival (mPFS), Refers to the value in which all patients are sorted according to the length of progression-free survival time in clinical studies, and is located in the middle position., 28 days per cycle, with ≤6 cycles of treatment expected per patient
Exploring potential efficacy prediction biomarkers, Explore potential efficacy prediction biomarkers: including patients\&#39; tumor-related serological indicators, such as peripheral blood lymphocyte count, twelve cytokine tests (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-α, IL-12p70) and ctDNA detection. This type of index was collected once at the baseline of the patient, and again after every 2 cycles of treatment until the patient entered the maintenance phase or the disease progressed., 28 days per cycle, with ≤6 cycles of treatment expected per patient
For patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who failed first-line treatment, the screening and enrollment will be completed according to the enrollment and exclusion criteria described in the study protocol, and the informed consent form will be signed after full communication. After enrollment, patients will be treated with cohort A) or cohort B), and followed up regularly.
