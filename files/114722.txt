Gynecologic Cancer
construction of Biobank, Biobank including gynecolgic cancer samples, including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, vulva cancer, vaginal cancer, and others types, 3 years
Exploring the molecular mechanism based on biobank, Exploring the molecular mechanism of gynecological tumor pathogenesis based on biobank, 3 year|Drug sensitivity detection based on biobank, Exploring drug sensitivity detection in gynecological tumors based on biobank, 3 year
This project is the construction and maintenance of a gynecological tumor sample library. It is supported by the National Key Laboratory of Difficult, Severe, and Rare Diseases at Peking Union Medical College Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. This project will lay a clinical specimen foundation for exploring the molecular mechanisms of gynecological tumors in the future.
