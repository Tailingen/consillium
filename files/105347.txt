Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligo-Progression of Urothelial Cancer
To evaluate the benefit of SAbR for oligo-progressive metastatic urothelial cancer.
Urothelial Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiation
Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months, Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months in the patients for whom SAbR is added to the ICI after progression on ICI. PFS will be defined as the combination of progressive disease from SAbR start date and death from any cause., 6 months
The disease control rate, The disease control rate in patients for whom SAbR is added to ICI after progression on ICI. DCR will be assessed per RECIST 1.1 criteria and defined as the combination of: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD)., 6 months|The time to next-line systemic therapy, The time to initiation of next-line systemic therapy following the addition of SAbR to ICI after progression on ICI., 6 months|Overall survival of patients, The overall survival of patients since progression on ICI or at the study registration. Overall survival (OS) will be defined using the interval between enrollment and death from any cause., 6 months
Oligo-progressive urothelial cancer with limited disease burden and progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.
