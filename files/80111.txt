Hardwins - Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head & Neck (Surgery/RT)
This study is examining the effects of increasing the dose of radiation given to treat head and neck cancer. Radiation doses to the primary cancer are higher than usually given; lymph glands of the neck will also be treated at a lower dose. Surgery on the lymph glands my be necessary in the future. Radiation treatments given in small fractions twice a day allows a higher dose to be delivered than if the treatment was given once a day. This study will enroll patients at three sequential increasing dose levels. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled at each dose level.
