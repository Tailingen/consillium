The Feasibility and Safety of the TOETVA for Benign Thyroid Nodules
Thyroid surgery has been developed as a new technique for zero scar in surgery by applying transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy with sublingual approach. The new technique is locating the surgery which pierced through floor of mouth, cause severe tissue damage, high complication, and conversion rates to open surgery and surgical difficulties due to limitation of movement. Nevertheless, each report is still including small number of patients. Recently, the transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) has been proven feasible and safe in several overseas centers. Moreover, a successful TOETVA case was reported in local media in the late last year. Hence, this study is for evaluating the feasibility and safety of the TOETVA prospectively at a tertiary referral center in Hong Kong.

The following are the procedure of the study:

1. Recruit patients from the clinic.
2. Patients will receive treatment within 3 months
3. Patients will have different assessments like Ultrasonography assessment, Fine needle biopsy, Direct laryngoscopy, and Cosmectic scoring in Pre-operation, post-operation 2 week, post 1 month, post 3 month, post 6 month and post 12 month.
4. Patients will be monitoring by the same team after the study.
Thyroid Diseases
PROCEDURE: Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach
The complication rate after TOETVA in 12 months, To record any complication of surgery in every post-operation visit after 12 months. The record will be used for the calculation of complication rate., 12 months
The open conversion rate of TOETVA, To record any cases which need to apply open surgery necessary during the procedure of TOETVA, 12 months|The wound infection rate after TOETVA, To record the situation of wound infection after surgery, 12 months|The hematoma rate after TOETVA, To record the situation of hematoma after surgery, 12 months|The vocal cord palsy rate after TOETVA, To calculate the vocal cord situation after surgery within 12 months, 12 months|The hypoparathyroidism rate after TOETVA, To record the thyroid function from blood test in 12 months after surgery and calculate the rate of hypo-parathyroid function, 12 months|The pain score of patient after TOETVA, The pain scoring with 0-10 to assess the pain level of having TOETVA, 12 months|The satisfaction of patients after having TOETVA in 12 months, The satisfaction in 0-10 scoring after the surgery, 12 months
