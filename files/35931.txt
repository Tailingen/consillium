Whether it is More Appropriate to Spray Lugol's Solution From Cervical Esophagus to Esophagogastric Junction
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of spraying Lugol's solution from cervical esophagus to esophagogastric junction (downward) and from esophagogastric junction to cervical esophagus （upward）during chromoendoscopy.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: staining from cervical esophagus to esophagogastric junction|PROCEDURE: staining from esophagogastric junction to cervical esophagus
Image Quality, Image quality is blindly quantified by a 4-point scale from the endoscopists. A higher score representing higher image quality., intraoperative
Adverse events, Adverse events of the two groups., 24 hours|Dose, Usage of Lugol's solution in each group., intraoperative|Effectiveness, Detection rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma of the two groups., 1 month|Tolerance, The 4-point scale was used to assess the tolerance of endoscopist to the esophageal spasm caused by Lugol's solution which prevent endoscopy from passing. 1-4 means the resistance as intolerable, tolerable, mild, or non-existing., intraoperative
Chromoendoscopy using Lugol's solution is effective for the detection of early esophageal squamous neoplasia. However, there is no study to investigate the sequence of Lugol's staining during endoscopic procedure.

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of spraying Lugol's solution from cervical esophagus to esophagogastric junction (downward) and from esophagogastric junction to cervical esophagus （upward）during chromoendoscopy.
