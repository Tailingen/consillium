Rasburicase as a Uricolytic Therapy for Hyperuricemia in Patients With Leukemia or Lymphoma
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and the efficacy in patients with malignant lymphoma or acute leukemia who are repeatedly administered for SR29142 5 days in two dosage groups.

Secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SR29142 , to assess anti-SR29142 antibody production in patients with malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia, and to estimate the optimal dosage of SR29142 for Japanese patients from the results of efficacy and safety evaluations.
