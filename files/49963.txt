Pembrolizumab in Combination With Lenvatinib in Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma
The prognosis for unresectable and metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTCs) including cholangiocarcinoma is poor with first line gemcitabine and cisplatin offering a median overall survival of 11.7 months. There is no standard second- or third-line therapy for advanced BTC, and this represents an unmet medical need for novel therapies. The immune system plays a critical role in the development of Advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) and chronic inflammation is a common underlying risk factor for BTC. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in BTC may lead to an immune suppression via inadequate tumor antigen presentation and an impaired T cell-mediated immune response directed against tumor antigens. Lenvatinib significantly decreased the population of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and increased interferon-γ-producing cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T cells. Addition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors helps reverse VEGF-mediated immune suppression, restore T cell function, and promote T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising activity with manageable adverse events in various solid tumor types.

The investigators will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with advanced BTC who failed standard therapy in this phase II study.

Title: A Single Arm Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib in Patients with Advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma after Progression on Standard Systemic Therapy Study Description: The prognosis for unresectable and metastatic biliary tract cancers (BTCs) including cholangiocarcinoma is poor with first line gemcitabine and cisplatin offering a median overall survival of 11.7 months. There is no standard second- or third-line therapy for advanced BTC, and this represents an unmet medical need for novel therapies. The immune system plays a critical role in the development of Advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) and chronic inflammation is a common underlying risk factor for BTC. VEGF signaling in BTC may lead to an immune suppression via inadequate tumor antigen presentation and an impaired T cell-mediated immune response directed against tumor antigens. Lenvatinib significantly decreased the population of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages and increased interferon-γ-producing CD8+ T cells. Addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors helps reverse VEGF-mediated immune suppression, restore T cell function, and promote T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising activity with manageable adverse events in various solid tumor types.

The investigators will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with advanced BTC who failed standard therapy in this phase II study.

Objectives and Endpoints:

Primary Objective: Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST1.1) of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced BTC after progression on standard systemic therapies Secondary Objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib+pembrolizumab in this population; Determine the duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS); Determine the ORR, PFS and OS of subgroups stratified by molecular signatures (tumor mutation burden, PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) or FGFR mutation/fusion status) in a pre-planned post-hoc analysis; Define molecular correlates of response, including circulating biomarkers and tumor tissue biomarkers Study Population: The study will enroll 40 patients who have unresectable or metastatic, histologically-confirmed advanced BTC. Both male and female patients age of 18 years or older who have failed standard systemic therapy for advanced BTC with measurable disease, adequate bone marrow reserve and hepatic/renal function, and ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 could be eligible to participate in the study after completing the study enrollment screening tests and procedures.

Phase: II Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will be conducted at Jiahui International Cancer Center, Shanghai Jiahui International Hospital, in collaboration with Zhongshan Hospital.

Study treatment/Intervention: Each cycle is defined as 21 days treatment of Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis:

Pembrolizumab 200mg IV day 1 of every 21 day-cycles; Lenvatinib 20mg PO once daily for 21-day cycles Study Duration: 24-36 months Participant Duration: up to 24 months
