Serial PET MPI in Patients Undergoing Cancer Treatment
This study aims to evaluate the effects of cardiotoxic cancer therapies on myocardial blood flow (MBF) and perfusion in a prospective sample of VA patients.

Up to 60 patients who will be newly initiating chemotherapy are going to be prospectively evaluated using PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity by quantifying MBF and perfusion. Patients will be grouped into 3 categories:

1. Patients undergoing chemotherapy with anthracycline containing regimen.
2. Patients undergoing chemotherapy with VEGF inhibitor containing regimen.
3. Patients undergoing chemotherapy with immune check point inhibitor containing regimen.

Patients will undergo PET MPI at 3 different time points:

1. Baseline PET MPI within 1 month prior to initiation of the chemotherapy regimen.
2. PET MPI at the middle of the chemotherapy regimen.
3. PET MPI within 1 month following completion of the chemotherapy regimen.

For PET MPI, the investigators will evaluate for abnormalities such as new perfusion defects, decreases in stress myocardial blood flows and decreases in myocardial flow reserves.

All study patients will also be analyzed using the following tests:

1. Echocardiogram with strain analysis within +/- 1 week of each PET MPI
2. Serology - high sensitivity troponin, cardiac C-reactive protein (CRP), brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), fasting lipid panel, complete metabolic panel, and complete blood count within +/- 1 week of each PET MPI study.
3. 12-lead ECG with each PET MPI study.
