Disposable Powered Articulating Linear Cutter Stapler in Gastrointestinal Tissue Cutting and Anastomosis
To evaluate whether the anastomosis success rate of the main effectiveness evaluation indexes is not inferior to the similar products produced by Johnson \& Johnson when the Fengh Disposable Powered Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler Used for Gastrointestinal Tissue Cutting and Anastomosis
Gastrointestinal Neoplasm
DEVICE: Disposable Powered Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler|DEVICE: ECHELON Flex Powered Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutters
Number of Participants With Anastomosis Success, The transection and anastomosis of lung tissues are performed during the operation. The device is withdrawn after successful triggering. The cutting staple line is carefully checked for integrity, air leakage and bleeding. Anastomosis is considered as successful if all anastomotic rings are intact without leakage or bleeding, otherwise it is considered as failure. If necessary, the gas injection method is used to inspect whether there is bubble overflow at anastomotic stoma. If there is no bubble overflow, it is recorded as successful anastomosis; if there is obvious bubble overflow, it is recorded as anastomosis failure., During surgery
In this clinical trial, prospective, multi-center, stratified group randomization, incomplete blind setting, parallel positive control and non-inferiority test were used to evaluate the Disposable Powered Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler manufactured by Jiangsu Fengh Medical Co., Ltd. when used for gastrointestinal tissue cutting and anastomosis. To determine whether there is any difference in the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, device defects and other safety evaluation indicators compared with similar products produced by Johnson \& Johnson.
