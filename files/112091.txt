Surgical Window of Opportunity Study of Orally Administered BAY 2402234 in Recurrent Glioma
This study aims to look at how BAY 2402234 responds in body in patients with recurrent glioma.
Glioma|IDH Mutation
DRUG: BAY 2402234
Biological activity of BAY 2402234, The primary endpoint is to characterize the biological activity of BAY 2402234 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The tissue orotate:carbamoyl aspartate ratio will serve as the primary pharmacodynamic biomarker and will be characterized via LC-MS., 3 days up tp day of surgery
Adverse Event Monitoring, To monitor adverse events during treatment with BAY 2402234 and document them in accordance with the Common Technology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5., 28 days after the final administered dose of BAY 2402234
To characterize the biological activity of BAY 2402234 in recurrent glioma, IDH-mutant, Grade 3/4 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The tissue orotate:carbamoyl aspartate ratio will serve as the primary pharmacodynamic biomarker and will be characterized via LC-MS.
