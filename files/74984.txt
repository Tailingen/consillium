Chemoembolisation of Non Resectable, Non Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose of idarubicin for chemoembolization of non resectable non metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: idarubicin
Dose-limiting toxicity assessed according NCI CTC AE v3.0, Within the first month after chemoembolization
Objective responses according criteria of the European Association for the Study of the Liver and according RECIST criteria., 2 months|Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), 2 months|Pharmacokinetics parameters of idarubicin and idarubicinol, Within 72 hours after chemioembolization
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most of the patients are diagnosed at intermediate-advanced stage when the sole standard treatment is transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). In the literature, survival rates in TACE studies vary widely and finally, there is no suggestion for the best chemotherapeutic agent or the optimal treatment regimen.

We hypothesise that the use of idarubicin (the most cytotoxic drug on HCC cell lines) in DC Bead would enhance the efficacy of TACE. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose of idarubicin in DC Bead for chemoembolization of non resectable non metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
