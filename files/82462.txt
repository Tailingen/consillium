Zanzalintinib in Combination With Paclitaxel in Recurrent High Grade Uterine Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of zanzalintinib when given in combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent high-grade uterine cancer. Other objectives include overall safety and tolerability as well as rates of response.
Uterine Cancer|Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Zanzalintinib|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), Through completion of first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) of all enrolled patients (estimated to be 48 months and 3 weeks)
Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, From start of treatment through 30 days after last dose of zanzalinitinib (estimated to be 7 months)|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have a partial or complete response per RECIST criteria after 3 cycles of treatment with zanzalintinib plus paclitaxel., After 3 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 21 days - estimated to be 63 days)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to the first radiologically documented disease progression, or death, whichever comes first. The alive patients without radiologically documented disease progression are censored at the last follow-up., From start of treatment through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5.5 years)|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of treatment to death. The alive patients are censored at the last follow-up., From start of treatment through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5.5 years)
