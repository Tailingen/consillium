Palliative Care Intervention in Patients With Solid Tumors Participating in Phase I Clinical Trials
Patients enrolled in phase I clinical trials could potentially benefit from palliative care concurrently, yet limited evidence is available to support such a change in care. The primary purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a palliative care intervention (PCI) for patients participating in a phase I therapeutic clinical trial
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
OTHER: counseling intervention|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|OTHER: questionnaire administration|OTHER: educational intervention
Study accrual and retention, 8 weeks|Change in psychological distress assessed using Distress Thermometer, One-way repeated measure of Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for baseline scores and testing for within subjects change over time (4 weeks and 8 weeks) will be conducted to examine the PCI's impact on each of the outcome measures., Baseline to 8 weeks|Change in satisfaction with communication assessed using Satisfaction with Communication Tool, One-way repeated measure of ANCOVA, controlling for baseline scores and testing for within subjects change over time (4 weeks and 8 weeks) will be conducted to examine the PCI's impact on each of the outcome measures., Baseline to 8 weeks|Change in QOL using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Spirituality (FACT-Sp-12), Multivariate ANCOVAs (MANCOVAs) will be used at 4 and 8 weeks to examine the PCI's impact on QOL and symptom intensity and distress due to the multiple subscales in these two instruments., Baseline to 8 weeks|Change in symptom intensity and distress using Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS), MANCOVAs will be used at 4 and 8 weeks to examine the PCI's impact on QOL and symptom intensity and distress due to the multiple subscales in these two instruments., Baseline to 8 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Describe the feasibility of implementing a PCI for patients on phase I clinical trials (study accrual and retention).

II. Describe the initial impact of a PCI on key patient outcome measures (quality of life \[QOL\], psychological distress, satisfaction with communication, symptom intensity, symptom distress, and patient satisfaction) over time.

OUTLINE:

PCI PART I: Patients undergo comprehensive palliative care (PC) assessment based on baseline data and complete goals of care discussion.

PCI PART II: Following the first dose of phase I investigational treatment, patients meet with the interdisciplinary team (IDT), where PC recommendations are made. This is followed by two patient educational sessions that will cover QOL-related domains, including physical, social, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Supportive care referrals are made based on IDT recommendations.
