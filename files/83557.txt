A Study of HC006 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), Immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of HC006 in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. This study is a first-in-human (FIH) study of HC006 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

HC006, a novel therapeutic monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) and is designed to selectively deplete tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells (Tregs) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In mouse tumor models, HC006 has demonstrated excellent antitumor activity and safety profile. This first-in-human (FIH) study will be conducted in two parts. In the Dose-Escalation part, testing will be done on up to 31 subjects to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD). In the Dose-expansion part, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose of HC006 in the treatment of advanced solid tumor subjects without standard therapy.
