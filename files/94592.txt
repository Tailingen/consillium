Rates DMBT1 ( Glycoprotein) in Sputum of CF Patients With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
Rates of DMBT1 (Glycoprotein like) in Sputum of CF Patients with or without may be different according to their Pseudomonas Aeruginosa chronic colonization status. The aim of this study is to compare rates of DMBT1 (Glycoprotein like) in Sputum of CF patients with or without a Pseudomonas Aeruginosa chronic colonization.
Malignant Brain Tumor
measure glycoprotein-like DMBT1 by Elisa, DMBT1 in mg DMBT1 / mg of total protein measured by BCA (BiCinchoninic acid Assay) present in each sputum, at 1 months
measure MUC5B by Elisa, MUCB in mg / mg of total protein measured by BCA present in each sputum, at 1 months
Rates of DMBT1 (Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumor 1) will be compared between 2 groups of 30 CF patients : group 1 : with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa chronic colonization and group 2 30 CF patients without Pseudomonas Aeruginosa chronic colonization.
