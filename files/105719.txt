A Study of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab) in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Japanese Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Who Are Ineligible for High-dose Therapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab (16 mg/kg)|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) to analyze the safety of daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity During Cycle 1., Cycle 1, Day 1 to Day 28
Rate of Complete Response (CR) or Better, CR is Defined as the proportion of Participants achieving CR (including stringent complete response \[sCR\]) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 3.7 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR, Partial Response (PR), VGPR, and sCR according to the IMWG criteria, during or after study treatment., Approximately 3.7 years|Very good partial response (VGPR) or better (VGPR, CR, or sCR), VGPR is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or greater than or equal to (\>=) 90 pecent (%) reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level less than (\<) 100 milligram(mg)/24 hour (h)., Approximately 3.7 years|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin), The Cmin is the minimum observed analyte concentration., Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 12 (each cycle of 28 days), End of Treatment (within 30 days of the last dose), and Follow-Up (8 weeks after the last dose)|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), The Cmax is the maximum observed analyte concentration., Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 12 (each cycle of 28 days), End of Treatment (within 30 days of the last dose), and Follow-Up (8 weeks after the last dose)|Immunogenicity of daratumumab, Anti-daratumumab antibodies will be evaluated in serum samples collected for all the participants., Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 12 (each cycle of 28 days), End of Treatment (within 30 days of the last dose), and Follow-Up (8 weeks after the last dose)
