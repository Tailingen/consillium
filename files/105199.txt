Circulating Tumor DNA Detection in Surveillance of Surgical Lung Cancer Patients
Conduct a prospective study to confirm blood and urine ctDNA detection value in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.

Studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mutation status by blood and urine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, no prospective has been conducted for usage of ctDNA in postoperative surveillance of NSCLC patients.

We plan to compare tumor makers and radiographic approaches with blood and urine ctDNA in surveillance to assess the lead time of postoperative tumor relapse in stage â…¢A NSCLC patients. And evaluate the correlation between ctDNA level with tumor relapse or metastasis.
