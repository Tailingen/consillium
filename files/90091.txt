Effect of Rectal Misoprostol in Reducing Intra-operative Blood Loss During Myomectomy
A total of 200 women for elective abdominal myomectomy were randomly allocated into two groups.

100 women in experimental group were administered 400ug Misoprostol (2 tablets of ProsotecÂ®) through the rectal route prior to surgery and 100 were in control group, in which no drug was administered.
Blood Loss, Surgical|Uterine Myoma
DRUG: Misoprostol
Intraoperative blood loss, Intraoperative blood loss will be recorded by a trained doctor and calculated using visual scale for the abdominal sponges and chest swabs/gauzes used during surgery and blood collected in suction bottle., During the surgical procedure
After getting approval from hospital's ethical committee, patients eligible for the study were recruited in the study according to the selection criteria. Before surgery, after taking informed written consent, patient's detailed history including demographics, parity \& BMI was recorded. Uterine size was assessed by bimanual pelvic examination. Patients undergoing myomectomy were randomly divided into 2 groups using lottery method. In experimental group Misoprostol 400ug was administered per rectally prior to surgery. In control group, no drug was administered.

The surgical procedural elements, the surgeon or surgeons performing the procedure and the use of antibiotics as well as anesthetic agents was standardized to remove any bias. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded by a single trained doctor and calculated using visual scale for the abdominal sponges and chest swabs/gauzes used during surgery and blood collected in suction bottle.
