Number of Patients with Dose-limiting Toxicities, A DLT is defined as an AE that meets at least one of the criteria listed in protocol, according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for AE (CTCAE) version 5.0, and is considered by the investigator to be clinically relevant and attributed to the study treatment during the first 28 days after the first dose of study treatment., Baseline up to 28 Days|Incidence of Adverse Events, Number of patients with adverse events (AEs) according to severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug

An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of patients who experience at least one AE will be presented., Baseline up to Approximately 24 Months|Number of Patients with Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of patients with clinically significant change from baseline in laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (graded by CTCAE version 5.0) and timing., Baseline up to Approximately 24 Months|Number of Patients in Expansion Cohorts with Objective Responses, Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response for Patients in Expansion Cohorts, Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed per RECIST v1.1, to the time of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival for Patients in Expansion Cohorts, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the date of first documentation of objective tumor progression on or following study therapy per RECIST v1.1, or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival for Patients in Combination Dose Expansion Cohorts, Overall survival is defined as the date from start of the study treatment to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 48 months
Observed Plasma Concentration of NGM707 (Including Cmax), Will be measured on Day 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 3, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4 and each cycle thereafter., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Plasma NGM707, Area under the curve from time zero extrapolated to the last quantifiable dose of NGM707. Time zero extrapolated to the last quantifiable time point prior to the next dose. Will be measured on Day 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 3, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4 and each cycle thereafter., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Plasma Half-life (t1/2) of NGM707, Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half. Will be measured on Day 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1 and 3, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 4 and each cycle thereafter., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) Against NGM707, Incidence and titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against NGM707. Will be measured on Day 1 of each cycle., Baseline up to approximately 24 months
