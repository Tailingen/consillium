Open Dialogue About Complementary Alternative Medicine
The purpose of this phase III parallel-group randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of open dialogue about complementary alternative medicine integrated in conventional oncology care (ODC-COC). The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention group participating in an ODC-COC with a nurse specialist report better quality of life compared to patients in the control group receiving standard care alone.

Patients randomized to the intervention group will participate in a scheduled ODC-COC with a specialist nurse, who has completed the Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. This is a training program for health professionals in empowering individuals and communities to optimize health and well-being through evidence-based, sustainable and integrative approaches. The ODC-COC will be based on the fundamentals of person-centered care according to this program and include patient preferences and wishes, reliable information and counselling and advice about the potential risks and benefits of using complementary alternative medicine as an adjunct to conventional oncology care.

The dialogue lasts approximately 60 minutes and will take place as soon as possible and no later than two weeks after enrolment. The same nurse will conduct all dialogues. According to patient needs and wishes there may be a follow-up dialogue over the telephone or in the Oncology Outpatient Clinic. The potential second dialogue is estimated to last approximately 30 minutes.

Participants in the control group will receive standard information including reference to www.KABcancer.dk, which is a website presenting research on CAM, including information about its potential effects and outcomes.
