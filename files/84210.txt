The Modulatory Role of Internet MBCT on Extracellular Vesicles and Distress in Cancer Patients - Study Protocol
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), have been showing promising results in different health-related and psychosocial outcomes in the context of cancer. More recently, the possibility of delivering MBIs using technological tools and resources, such as internet and applications, has been receiving much attention, also accompanied by promising findings. However, few randomized controlled studies have been conducted and published to date. Moreover, few studies have addressed the long-term stability and trajectory of gains across time. Also, even though prior evidence had suggested that face-to-face MBIs might modulate several biological markers (e.g., pro-inflammatory gene expression and inflammatory signaling; telomere length), as far as we know, no previous study addressed the impact of online MBIs on biological indices, especially on extracellular vesicles (EVs).

As primary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of an internet-based MBCT intervention (vs. Treatment as Usual - TAU) on EVs (objective measure), as well as on psychological distress (subjective measure), considering a sample of distressed people with history of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer.

As secondary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of this same intervention on psychosocial outcomes, including quality of life, fear of cancer recurrence, emotion suppression, mindfulness, sleep quality, posttraumatic growth, health-related behaviours (physical activity; smoking habits), and perceived social support. The biological secondary outcomes studied will be: inflammatory response genes interleukins (ILs, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and c-reactive protein (CRP); telomerase activity; antigens related to cancer (cancer antigen - CA 15-3; prostate-specific antigen - PSA; carcinoembryonic antigen - CEA); other health-related markers (adrenocorticotropic hormone - ACTH; erythrocytes number; hemoglobin glycosylated).

The score for each subscale ranges between 0 and 21. In the current study, a total score will be computed by summing all items, with higher scores being indicative of higher self-reported psychological distress., T1- before intervention; T2 - 4 weeks after baseline; T3 - 8 weeks after baseline; T4 - 24 weeks after baseline; T5 - 52 weeks after baseline

It is composed of 26 items distributed in one general facet and four domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale with higher scores being indicative of better self-reported quality of life (scoring procedures are available here: https://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf)., T1 - Baseline; T3 - 8 weeks after baseline; T4 - 24 weeks after baseline; T5 - 52 weeks after baseline|Change on fear of cancer recurrence, Measured by a 7-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence - FCR-7 (PT version not yet available), a 7-item scale assessing fear of cancer recurrence in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (all the time).
