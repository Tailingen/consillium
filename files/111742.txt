Sutent + Taxol for Advanced Esophageal Cancer
Paclitaxel is known to be active as a single and combination agent in esophageal cancer, and has also been demonstrated to have anti-angiogenic properties in weekly dosing regimens. Sunitinib malate is an anti-angiogenic drug with the potential to improve responses when combined with chemotherapy, as demonstrated with other regimens in similar settings. We believe that the combination of paclitaxel and sunitinib malate offer great promise in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Sunitinib malate|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival Rate at 24 Weeks, To determine the rate of non-progressive disease at 24 weeks from the first dose of the combination of sunitinib malate and paclitaxel in advanced esophageal carcinoma, where progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, 24 weeks
Response Rate, To determine the response rate for the combination of sunitinib malate and paclitaxel in advanced esophageal carcinoma per RECIST criteria., 6 months|Overall Survival, To determine the one year overall survival rate for the combination of sunitinib malate and paclitaxel in advanced esophageal carcinoma, 12 months|Progression-Free Survival, To determine the time to progression for the combination of sunitinib malate and paclitaxel in advanced esophageal carcinoma per RECIST criteria., 12 months|Toxicity Profile, Determine the most frequent toxicities associated with the treatment regimen, per the CTCAE version 3 (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events) criteria., 16 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy will be administered in a 28-day treatment cycle. The 28 days of treatment with paclitaxel and sunitinib malate (plus the time required to recover if toxicity is encountered) is defined as a cycle.

* Paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8 and 15.
* Sunitinib malate 37.5 mg orally, daily.

After 4 cycles, paclitaxel will be discontinued and patients will continue on sunitinib malate until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or physician discretion.
