Concurrent Chemotherapy for Recurrent T3/T4 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT is effective in the treatment of locally stage T3/T4 recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients compared with IMRT alone.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: IMRT
Overall survival, From the beginning the IMRT to 3 year after the end of IMRT
Number of participants with severe acute toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v3.0, From the beginning of IMRT to 3 months after the end of IMRT|Number of participants with grade 4-5 late adverse events as assessed by RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema, From 3 months after the end of IMRT to 1 year after the end of IMRT
Locally T3/T4 recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be salvaged by intensity modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT), but local control is not good enough and late toxicities is usually severe The aim of this phase III randomized controlled study is to address the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin) with IMRT to improve local control and lower the occurrence of severe late toxicities compared with IMRT alone for locally T3/T4 recurrent NPC patients.
