This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical study. This clinical study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of the ZPR（Zanubrutinib, Polatuzumab vedotin and Rituximab）regimen in elderly patients with treatment-naive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Primary objective: use ORR to evaluate the efficacy of ZPR in treating elderly treatment-naive DLBCL patients

Secondary objective: Evaluate the safety of ZPR treatment for elderly treatment-naive DLBCL patients

The subjects received 6 cycles of ZPR regimen, one cycle every 21 days. Then Zanubrutinib alone will continue to be used until Zanubrutinib has been used for 1 year or disease progression or intolerable adverse effects, death, withdrawal of informed consent or study termination.
