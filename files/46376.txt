Descriptive Study of the Efficacy of Treatments for Blastic Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN)
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare disease characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior and a poor prognosis. It predominantly affects elderly males with an average age of 67 years at diagnosis and the affected organs are usually the skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes and the central nervous system. Patients with BPDCN have poor outcomes with median overall survival (OS) ranging in the largest series of patients from 8 to 12 months.

Patient care must be defined in this pathology. Despite 40%-90% complete remission (CR) rates after initial chemotherapy, relapses are almost inevitable.

The investigators have developed a national network to collect clinical and biological data of French patients diagnosed with BPDCN.
