R-DHAP vs POLA-R-DHAP Followed by Autologous Transplant as First Salvage Treatment in Patient With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
Prospective, multicenter, open label, phase II randomized clinical trial in DLBCL patients relapsed or refractory to first line R-chemo, aged 18-70 years and candidate to autologous transplant. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to received 4 cycles of R-DHAP or R-DHAP plus Polatuzumab Vedotin as induction treatment plus autologous transplant.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Refractory|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Recurrent
DRUG: R-DHAP|DRUG: Pola-R-DHAP
Progression free survival (PFS), Time between the randomization to first documentation of recurrence, progression or death from any cause, From treatment start up to 30 months (6 months treatment period and 24 months of follow-up)
Event-Free Survival (EFS), Time between the randomization to any treatment failure, including disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason (e.g., disease progression, toxicity, patient preference, initiation of a new treatment without documented progression) or death from any cause., From treatment start up to 30 months (6 months treatment period and 24 months of follow-up)|Complete response rate (CRR), CRR will be defined according to Response Criteria for NHL with PET (Lugano 2014). CRR will include only patients who achieved a CR and will be evaluated on assessed patients and on all treated patients, considering patients without a response assessment (due to any reason) as non-responders., From treatment start up to end of treatment evaluation (about 6 months)|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy (CR+PR)., From treatment start up to end of treatment evaluation (about 6 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Time between randomization to death from any cause., From treatment start up to 30 months (6 months treatment period and 24 months of follow-up)|Incidence and severity of AEs, Incidence and severity of AEs in R-DHAP vs POLA-R-DHAP according to latest CTCAE criteria during induction immunochemotherapy, From start to end of induction treatment evaluation (about 3 months)|Adequate stem cells mobilization, Adequate stem cells mobilization will be defined by the target cell harvesting of 3 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg, From beginning of 2nd cycle to end of induction treatment evaluation (about 2 months)|Autologous consolidation feasibility, Proportion of patients receiving autologous consolidation after POLA-R-DHAP vs R-DHAP, At time of end of treatment assessment (up to 6 months from treatment begin)
Prospective, multicenter, open label, phase II randomized clinical trial in DLBCL patients relapsed or refractory to first line R-chemo, aged 18-70 years and candidate to autologous transplant. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to received 4 cycles of R-DHAP or R-DHAP plus Polatuzumab Vedotin as induction treatment.

PET-CT scan performed after induction be centrally review for disease response. Responding patients (CR) after induction will be addressed to receive Autologous Stem Cells Transplantation (ASCT) consolidation as per local guidelines. Patients achieving PR can proceed with ASCT or with a 3rd-line treatment, according to the physician judgment. Patients in SD/PD will be diverted to salvage strategies.
