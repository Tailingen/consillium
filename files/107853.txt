A Study of CC-98633, BCMA-targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of CC-98633, BCMA-Targeted NEX-T Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells, in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part A) and dose-expansion (Part B). The dose-escalation part (Part A) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of CC-98633 to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose RP2D(s); and the dose-expansion part (Part B) of the study is to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of CC-98633 at the RP2D(s).
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: CC-98633
Adverse Events (AEs), incidence and severity of AEs. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE., From the time of informed consent and follow up to 2 years after infusion of CC-98633:
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects with a partial response (PR) or better by the IMWG criteria., Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Complete Response (CR) Rate, The proportion of subjects achieving stringent CR or CR., Up to 2 years after CC-99633 infusion|Duration of response (DOR), The time from first response (sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) to progressive disease (PD) or death., Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Time to response (TTR), Time from CC-98633 infusion to the first documentation of response (sCR, CR, VGPR or PR)., Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Time to complete response (TTCR), Time from CC-98633 infusion to the first documentation of sCR or CR, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Progression free survival (PFS), Time from CC-98633 infusion to the first documentation of PD, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Overall survival (OS), Time from CC-98633 infusion to death, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Pharmacokinetics - maximum serum concentration (Cmax), Maximum blood concentration, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Pharmacokinetics -time to peak serum concentration (tmax), Time to peak (maximum) blood concentration, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Area under curve (AUC), Area under the curve, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion|Very good partial response (VGPR) or better, Is define as proportion of subjects achieving sCR, CR, or VGPR, Up to 2 years after CC-98633 infusion
