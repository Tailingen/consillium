A Study of BBI608 Plus Weekly Paclitaxel to Treat Gastric and Gastro-Esophageal Junction Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, BBI608, in addition to paclitaxel chemotherapy or better to receive paclitaxel chemotherapy alone as second line treatment for gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer after prior first line platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Paclitaxel|OTHER: Placebo
Overall Survival, The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of orally administered BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel, in comparison to placebo plus weekly paclitaxel on the Overall Survival of patients with advanced histopathologically confirmed gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who failed treatment with one platinum/fluoropyrimidine containing regimen for unresectable or metastatic disease., 36 months
Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause which comes first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria(RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in anon-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 36 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 36 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR+SD) based on RECIST 1.1., 36 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, All patients who have received at least one dose of BBI608/Placebo will be included in the safety analysis. The number of patients who experienced at least one adverse event is reported., 36 months
The goal of this study is to determine if paclitaxel given together with BBI608 as second line therapy will prolong overall survival compared to paclitaxel alone.

Approximately 700 patients will be randomized with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

Patients must have failed first line therapy with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet.

BBI608/placebo will be administered daily, paclitaxel will be administered i.v. on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4 weekly cycle.
