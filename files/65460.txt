Routine Transcervical Thymectomy in MEN-1 Patients
A case series was built after review of available literature by searching four databases (PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Library) for observational studies or case reports on routine prophylactic TCT for MEN-1 and the development of thymic carcinoids.
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN-1)|Thymic Carcinoid
PROCEDURE: Routine thymectomy, which has been performed
Incidence of thyme carcinoid, Retrospective review of published studies, The timeframe will be from date of transcervical thymectomy until the date of documented diagnosis of diagnosis of thymic NET; progression of disease or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months.
Introduction and Importance Malignant thymic carcinoids are uncommon but important entities among patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). Current treatment guidelines advise the performance of a routine transcervical thymectomy (TCT) during parathyroidectomy, to prevent its development, although data on the yield of this prophylactic TCT is scarce. We aimed to revisit available literature to investigate and summarize the efficacy of routine TCT during neck exploration for parathyroidectomy, for the prevention of thymic carcinoid tumours among MEN-1 patients.
