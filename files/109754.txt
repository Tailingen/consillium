Computer Aided Detection of Polyps in Colonoscopy
The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of using a computer aided detection device, Skout, for real-time polyp detection in colonoscopy procedures with the indication of screening or surveillance. One of the reasons for the development of interval colorectal cancers is polyps missed during colonoscopy. Our hypothesis is that with the aid of Skout, the adenomas detected per colonoscopy will increase, and it is plausible to believe that this increase in detection could reduce the incidence of interval cancers.
Colorectal Polyp
DEVICE: Computer Aided Detection device
Adenomas per colonoscopy, The total number of adenomas detected divided by the total number of colonoscopies., At the end of the procedure, 1 day|Positive predictive value, The total number of adenomas and serrated lesions detected divided by the total number of extractions., At the end of the procedure, 1 day
Adenoma detection rate, The percentage of participants aged â‰¥50 years undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy who have one or more conventional adenomas detected., At the end of the procedure, 1 day|Sessile serrated lesions detected, The total number of polyps with histology or serrated adenoma, traditional serrated adenoma or serrated lesion with cytological dysplasia, excluding hyperplastic polyps., At the end of the procedure, 1 day|Colorectal cancer surveillance interval, The mean recommended timeframe for follow up colonoscopy., At the end of the procedure, 1 day
