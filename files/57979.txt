Study of Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin With Radiation Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This study will examine a sequence of treatments including pre-operative chemotherapy and radiation, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer.

This study will examine a sequence of treatments including pre-operative chemotherapy and radiation, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer. This research treatment will evaluate the combination of two chemotherapy agents, oxaliplatin and gemcitabine with radiation therapy. The researchers have already done studies using oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and radiation therapy together for pancreatic cancer. They want to build on the information they have from this previous research and do the research at multiple sites. They will use this study to determine how well people do who are treated with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiation therapy prior to having surgery for their pancreatic cancer. The researchers will also gather more information about what type of side effects occur with this treatment.
