Phase I/II Study of Pazopanib and Cyclophosphamide in Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The current trial shall clarify the potential of the multitarget antiangiogenic tyrosinkinase inhibitor GW 786034 (pazopanib) in combination with oral cyclophosphamide as salvage treatment in patients with recurrent, pretreated ovarian cancer.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Pazopanib
Determination of the optimal doses for pazopanib (phase I), 42 months|Overall response rate according to RECIST criteria / clinical benefit (stable disease or partial response or complete response) (phase II), 12 weeks after start of treatment
Time to progression (TTP) according to RECIST criteria, 7 years|Overall survival, 7 years|Evaluation of CA125 tumour response, 7 years|Number of patients with Adverse Events, 7 years|Assessment of quality of life over time as defined by EORTC-QLQ C 30 and Ovar 28 questionnaire, 7 years
This study is a prospective open-label, non-randomized multicenter phase I/II trial in order to determine overall response rate of patients with platinum-resistant or refractory recurrent, pretreated epithelial ovarian cancer.

In order to assure adequate toxicity assessment, a phase-I-trial is proponed. Phase II will be performed with MTD.
