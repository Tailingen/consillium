EUS RFA for Treatment of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
This is a single arm study in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The investigators propose to test the tolerability of chemotherapy plus endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) using the RF Electrode in patients receiving palliative second or third line therapy for unresectable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.
