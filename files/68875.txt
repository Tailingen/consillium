Fecal Continence Outcomes and Quality of Life After Excision of Sacrococcygeal Teratoma (Retrospective Study)
Sacrococcygeal teratoma is one of the most common tumors that occur in the neonatal period. It presents either as a mass protruding from the sacrococcygeal region or as a pelviabdominal mass according to the type. Surgical excision is the main treatment, most masses are benign, however some are malignant and require radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Complications may occur due to pressure resulting from the tumor growth in the fetal period, or due to damage to important near tissues during surgical excision. Postoperative complications may be urinary as neurogenic bladder, Lower gastrointestinal as constipation, soiling or incontinence. In this work we study the outcomes of fecal continence through a questionnaire and its effect on the quality of life of the affected children.
