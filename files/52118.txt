Phase II Study of Velcade, Decadron, and Doxil Followed by Cyclophosphamide in Multiple Myeloma
PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

* To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bortezomib, dexamethasone, with and without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide as a therapy for two different subsets of multiple myeloma patients:

  1. Patients post first line therapy
  2. Patients with relapsed/refractory disease who are bortezomib-naïve
* To evaluate the safety of the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone, with and without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide as therapy for patients with multiple myeloma.

SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

* To evaluate the role of the combination of bortezomib dexamethasone, with and without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide on the ability to collect \> 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in \< 7 collections (for both subsets of multiple myeloma patients).
* To evaluate the survival of patients who receive the combination of bortezomib dexamethasone, with and without DOXIL, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide (for both subsets of patients).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: cyclophoshamide|DRUG: filgrastim
Efficacy of Drug Combination as Therapy for Myeloma (Overall Response Rate), Myeloma response criteria developed by Bladé et al. was used to categorize response., Best response at any point during each respective study phase was collected - once after consolidation/prior to mobilization (approximately 6 cycles after start of treatment), and once after mobilization
Yield of CD34+ Stem Cells, This is the yield of CD34+ stem cells collection after high dose cyclophosphamide., Occurred after mobilization, and prior to Stem cell transplant; a 7 day limit was imposed on stem cell collection|Progression Free Survival, Response was assessed using IMWG guidelines, which for progressive disease are as follows:

Increase of \> 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following:

* Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 0.5 g/dL)\*
* Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 200 mg/24 h)
* Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels; the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase must be \> 10 mg/dL
* Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; the absolute percentage must be \> 10%
* Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
* Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder IF starting M protein component is \> 5g/dL, then absolute increase of 1g is sufficient for progression., Date of progression, assessed from start of trial to Final data cut off date (15 April 2011)
