Deciphering the Molecular Traits of Non-canonical Responders to Advance Personalized Therapy in Gastric Cancer
Retrospective-prospective observational study in which a novel whole-exome sequencing (WES) approach will be used in association with whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) to analyze two independent and equally sized cohorts of patients with mGC.
Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Progression-free survival PFS, PFS will be defined as the time from the start of first-line chemotherapy to disease progression or death, 5 years
Overall survival OS, OS will be defined as the time from the start of first-line chemotherapy to death (from any cause), 5 years
A workflow specifically designed for this project will be adopted, using clinical outcomes as a benchmark for comparative analyses, to generate a molecular classifier applicable to all patients affected by metastatic gastric cancer mGC and predict atypical tumor responses. Molecular features differently represented in exceptional responders and fast progressors will be monitored by liquid biopsy in patients included in cohort B, consisting of a validation set, leveraging a high-sensitivity technological level that allows to detect both genomic alterations and expression at the transcription level.

In addition, CSCs isolated from fast progressors will be studied with over 1,000 antitumor agents to discover vulnerabilities not currently known.
