Using Technology to Optimize Collaborative Care Management of Depression in Urban and Rural Cancer Centers, SCOPE
This study compares the effectiveness of technology-enhanced collaborative care management (t-CoCM) to usual collaborative care management (u-CoCM) in achieving fidelity to processes of care and reducing depression symptoms in patients currently receiving cancer treatment. CoCM is a population-based, integrated care approach, where care managers, who are clinicians (typically clinical social workers), deliver behavioral treatments, coordinate psychosocial care, monitor outcomes, and adjust treatment with the input of a psychiatric consultant. The use of t-CoCM may improve the treatment of depression and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I (t-CoCM): Patients use the t-CoCM digital app platform and clinic care managers use the t-CoCM web-based patient registry platform to support delivery of collaborative care. Patients complete surveys at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Some patients also participate in an interview or focus group about their user experience with the t-CoCM digital platform. Care managers also participate in interviews or focus groups regarding their experience with CoCM and the newly developed web-based platform.

ARM II (u-CoCM): Patients receive usual care and clinic care managers deliver usual CoCM. Patients complete surveys at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months.
