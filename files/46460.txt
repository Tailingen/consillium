A Study of AZD2936 Anti-TIGIT/Anti-PD-1 Bispecific Antibody in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
This is a Phase I/II study designed to evaluate if experimental anti-TIGIT/anti-PD-1 bispecific antibody rilvegostomig (AZD2936) is safe, tolerable and efficacious in participants with Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

Percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs) and immune mediated AEs (imAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), vital signs, and abnormal laboratory parameters, A DLT is a toxicity defined by the study protocol that occurs from the first dose of study intervention up to the end of the DLT evaluation period that is assessed as clearly unrelated to the primary disease or intercurrent illness., Part A, B, C, D and E: From the time of informed consent until 90 days after the last dose of rilvegostomig|Rate of rilvegostomig discontinuation due to toxicity, Percentage of participants with AEs leading to discontinuation of rilvegostomig, Part A, B, C, D and E: From first dose to the last dose of rilvegostomig (an average of 6 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, Part B, C, D and E: From first dose of rilvegostomig to progressive disease (PD) or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years)
ORR, Percentage of participants with a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1, Part A: From first dose of rilvegostomig to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years).|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of participants who have a best objective response of confirmed CR or PR or who have SD lasting for at least a certain time of period after start of treatment, Part A, B, C, E: From first dose of rilvegostomig to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years). Part D: From randomization to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years).|Duration of response (DoR), The time from first response according to RECIST v1.1 until progression or death in the absence of disease progression, Part A, B, C, D and E: From first dose of rilvegostomig to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years).|Durable response rate (DRR), The percentage of participants according to RECIST v1.1 with a confirmed CR or PR lasting 6 months or more, Part A, B, C, D and E: From first dose of rilvegostomig to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years).|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from first dose of study intervention until the date of objective disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression, Part B, C, E: From first dose of rilvegostomig to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years). Part D: From randomization to PD or death in the absence of disease progression (approximately 2 years).|Measure the receptor occupancy (RO) of TIGIT and PD-1 on peripheral blood, Evaluation of the target engagement of rilvegostomig in peripheral blood, Part A, B: From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B.|PK of rilvegostomig: Maximum plasma concentration of the study drug (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration of rilvegostomig, From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B, C, D and E.|PK of rilvegostomig: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B, C, D and E.|PK of rilvegostomig: Clearance, A pharmacokinetic measurement of the volume of plasma from which the study intervention is completely removed per unit time., From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B, C, D and E.|PK of rilvegostomig: Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), Terminal elimination half life, From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B, C, D and E.|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against rilvegostomig in serum, Immunogenicity of rilvegostomig, From first dose of study intervention, at predefined intervals throughout the administration of rilvegostomig (approximately 2 years). The predefined intervals for Part A will be different from Part B, C, D and E.
This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), open-label, multicenter, multi-part, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of rilvegostomig (AZD2936) in adult participants with stage III unresectable or stage IV NSCLC. The study includes 4 parts: Part A (dose escalation) and Parts B-E (dose expansion).
