Prospective Study Comparing EUS vs ERCP Stent Insertion for Malignant Biliary Obstruction
1. Purpose of the study

   -To compare stent patency and complication rate between endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided stent insertion and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) guided stent insertion for malignant biliary obstruction
2. Subjects of the study

   -Patients who have biliary obstruction owing to malignant tumors
3. Methods of the study

   * Prospective randomized controlled study
   * Patients were enrolled randomly in two groups, EUS guided stent insertion group or ERCP guided stent insertion group
   * Patients will get assigned procedure (EUS guided stent insertion or ERCP guided stent insertion)for decompression of malignant biliary obstruction
   * After the procedure, regular follow up, blood test,and imaging test will be done to check sufficient biliary decompression,stent patency and complications.
