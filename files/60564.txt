BA1106 is a human anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody. There are two parts in the study. Part A is dose escalation study, and Part B is dose expansion study. Part A will be conducted using BOIN dose escalation method at the dosing regimen of once every 3 weeks. In Part B, 1\~2 dose levels, dosing regimens (i.e. once every 2 weeks or once every 3 weeks), and 1\~4 selected indications will be chosen to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of BA1106.
