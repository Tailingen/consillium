A Safety and Efficacy Study of LGH447 in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
This study will assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of escalating doses of LGH447 monotherapy in AML and MDS and LGH447 in combination with midostaurin in AML.
AML and High Risk MDS
DRUG: LGH447|DRUG: LGH447 + midostaurin
Incidence rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of LGH447 monotherapy arm in patients with AML or MDS and of LGH447 + midostaurin in patients with AML, Frequency and characteristics of dose limiting toxicities, 28 days post study treatment
Number of participants with the type, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability of the LGH447 monotherapy arm in patients with AML or MDS and of the LGH447 + midostaurin treatment arm in patients with AML, Includes changes in hematology and blood chemistry values, assessments of physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), weekly to bi-weekly up to 1.5 years|PK parameters of the LGH447 monotherapy arm in patients with AML or MDS and of the LGH447 + midostaurin treatment arm in patients with AML, LGH447 and midostaurin plasma concentrations and basic PK parameters, days 1, 2, 15, 16, 29, 30, 44, 57, and approximately monthly through Cycle 3|Changes between pre- and post-treatment levels of pS6RP and p4EBP1 in bone marrow aspirates and p4EBP1 in peripheral blood of the LGH447 monotherapy arm in patients with AML or MDS and of the LGH447 + midostaurin treatment arm in patients with AML, Assess pharmacodynamic effects of LGH447, screening, days 1 and 29 up to 1.5 years|Anti-tumor activity in AML or high risk MDS associated wtih LGH447, To assess any preliminary anti-tumor activity in AML or high risk MDS associated with LGH447, Day 29 up to 1.5 years|Anti-tumor activity in AML or high risk MDS associated wtih LGH447 in combination with midostaurin, To assess any preliminary anti-tumor activity in AML or high risk MDS associated with LGH447 in combination with midostaurin, Day 29 up to 1.5 years
This study will assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of escalating doses of LGH447 monotherapy in AML and MDS and LGH447 in combination with midostaurin in AML.
