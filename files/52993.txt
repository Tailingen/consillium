To investigate the effect of Terelizumab (aka Tislelizumab) combined with XELOX in Neoadjuvant Therapy for gastrointestinal tumors.

To explore new biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of combined immunotherapy, and to establish a clinical efficacy prediction model by means of bioinformatics to prospectively judge the efficacy and guide the follow-up individualized and accurate treatment.
