Utilizing Continuous Glucose Monitoring to Characterize and Manage Hyperglycemia in Patients Initiating Alpelisib
This is a prospective, descriptive, single site, observational study in subjects receiving alpelisib for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The purpose of the study is to characterize the impact of alpelisib on glucose control in patients with breast cancer using continuous glucose monitoring to measure glucose levels throughout the day and night. Patients will follow a hyperglycemia prevention and management regimen aimed to diminish hyperglycemia known to occur in most oncology patients starting alpelisib.

All patients will wear an Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 system to obtain continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data (glucose measured every minute for 14 days). CGM will be placed at least 10 days prior to starting alpelisib and continue for at least 3 months while taking alpelisib.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Alpelisib|DEVICE: FreeStyle Libre 2 Continuous Glucose Monitor
Time to peak glucose level following the administration of alpelisib, Time (hr., min.) from taking alpelisib to the peak of the median glucose line of the standardize AGP/CGM report from day 21-28 after start of alpelisib. (calculated as- the average time to peak glucose on 7-day AGP profile minus avg time taking alpelisib). Primary outcome is time to peak glucose for all patients on alpelisib combined, Up to 28 days after start of alpelisib
