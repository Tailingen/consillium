BioXmark, Rectal Feasibility Trial
To test the feasibility and accuracy of BioXmark fiducial markers for image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) based rectal tumor boosting in 20 patients referred for long course chemo-radiotherapy of the locally advanced rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: BioXmark liquid fiducial markers|OTHER: Imaging|PROCEDURE: surgery or wait-and-see
Positional stability of BioXmark liquid fiducial markers during the treatment course, Positional stability / potential marker migration will be assessed by calculating marker pair distances., will be determined through the course of radiotherapy, an average of 5 weeks
Visibility/visual stability of BioXmark liquid fiducial markers during the treatment course, Visual stability will be evaluated by scoring visibility of the markers on CT, CBCT, EPI and MRI (T1, T2 and diffusion weighted images) by 2 independent observers using a subjective scoring system: 0 = not visible, 1 = barely visible, 2 = clearly visible., will be determined for the time interval between placement and the post-treatment MRI, an average of 12 weeks|Percentage of markers lost from injection to CT acquisition for RT planning, (1 - number of markers visible on the last CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) during treatment / number of visible markers at pCT) \* 100, will be determined for the time interval between placement and pretreatment radiotherapy planning CT, an average of 1 week|Percentage of markers lost from injection to CT acquisition for RT planning, (1 - number of markers visible on the last CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) during treatment / number of visible markers at pCT) \* 100, will be determined for the time intervals through the course of radiotherapy, an average of 5 weeks|Adverse events (AE) potentially associated with BioXmark, The safety of bioXmark liquid fiducials placement will be assessed by recording Adverse events (AE) potentially associated with BioXmark until rectal surgery, on average 11 weeks, or in case of omission of surgery, until 3 months after marker placement., until rectal surgery, on average 11 weeks, or in case of omission of surgery, until 3 months after marker placement.|Inter-observer variation in gross tumor volume (GTV) localization with and without markers, The concordance index (CI) of gross tumor volume (GTV) localization between observers on kV CBCT will be determined. The CI is the ratio of the intersection and the union of the two volumes., through the course of radiotherapy, an average of 5 weeks|Effect of BioXmark liquid fiducial markers on post-treatment MRI images, Potential BioXmark induced artefacts will be scored by 2 independent observers using a subjective scoring system:, at the moment of the post-treatment MRI, on average 6-8 weeks after chemo-radiation|Potential BioXmark induced alterations in the surgical specimen, The surgical specimens will be evaluated for signs of marker-induced alterations.

Potential BioXmark induced alteration in the surgical specimen will be scored by 2 independent observers using a subjective scoring system.In case the markers can't be located in the surgical specimen standard clinical evaluation of the specimen will take place. If the marker got lost during tissue processing potential inflammation/perforation will be scored as follows:A) 0 = no signs of extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials, 1 = limited extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials, 2 = severe extra inflammatory changes possibly related to the fiducials; B) 0 = no perforation of the rectal possibly related to fiducials, 1 = perforation of the rectal possibly related to the fiducials, on average 10-12 weeks after chemo-radiation
This study is a prospective non-randomized open label trial.

A total of 20 patients who will undergo neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy for rectal cancer will be included in this study upon informed consent.

During an extra sigmoidoscopy after enema preparation, 4 liquid marker spots will be placed 1 cm from the tumor; two in the in the cranial and two in the caudal direction of the tumor (4 markers in total per patient).

Participants will undergo standard treatment for their rectal cancer.

As part of standard patient set-up directly before each radiotherapy treatment, kilovoltage (KV) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be acquired. Treatment positioning will be based on the regular clinical decision protocols for treatment of rectal cancer and not on the markers. During treatment potential fiducial movement will be assessed using an externally positioned ultra-sound probe (this probe will be positioned against the abdominal or perineal skin of the patients depending on de position of the tumor/fiducials in the rectum). Moreover, for patients in this study 2 orthogonal kV images will be made immediately after each radiation using the electronic portal imaging (EPI) device.

As part of standard clinical practice an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the rectum will be made for response evaluation 6-8 weeks after the end of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy.

As part of standard clinical practice patients whose tumor has not responded completely will be operated on 8-12 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Patients with a complete response will be follow-upped according to the "wait-and-see" protocol.

Cone-beam CT and MR images which are obtained as routine practice during treatment of the participants will be compared with images of 20 non-participating patients treated at our institute in the same period.
