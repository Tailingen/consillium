Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy for Unresectable Hepatocelluar Carcinoma Who Failed to Systemic Therapy
There are limited treatment options for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who failed to the combination therapy with targeted agents plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) had shown potent antitumor effects in single-centered studies when was used as first-line therapy. However, HAIC was not used as second or third-line therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimens (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin)

The combination therapy of anti-angiogenic agents and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies had shown potent anti-tumor efficacy for unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the treatment options were limited when patients were failed the combination therapies. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) had shown potent anti-tumor efficacy with an acceptable safety profile as a first-line treatment for patients with intermediated-stage or advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAIC were used in the late-line setting, i.e., after the failure of combination therapy with anti-angiogenic agents and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.
