A Phase 2 Study of Tarceva for Untreated, Good Prognosis Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate Tarceva in a selected population of patients with untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are anticipated to have a relatively good (indolent) prognosis based on clinical criteria. It is anticipated that selection will enrich for tumor characteristic that are likely to be benefited by EGFR inhibitor treatment (survival greater than 90 days). The goal of this strategy is to provide a less toxic, oral treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC that will not interfere with patients receiving chemotherapy at some point in the future and may prolong the time to chemotherapy related progression.

Patients will remain on study until disease progresses, a decline in performance status, if patient cannot tolerate the side effects or develops symptoms requiring conventional chemotherapy.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib (Tarceva)
Survival Rate at 6-months Chemotherapy-progression-free (CP-free), Will determine if 6-month chemotherapy-progression-free (CP-free) survival rate (using RECIST) is significantly higher than the historically observed 31%. A one-sided binomial test at a 5% nominal significance was used., 6 months
Overall Survival, Estimated via a Kaplan-Meier curves. Survival will be counted from the first dose of Tarceva., 24 months
Primary Objective To determine Time to Chemotherapy Progression (ie includes time on Tarceva monotherapy and chemotherapy) in advanced NSCLC

Secondary Objectives To evaluate survival and response rate associated with Tarceva treatment To study the frequency of symptom improvement (Lung Cancer Subscale)
