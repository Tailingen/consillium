Overall survival, The time of randomization begins to cause the death of any cause, 3 years
Progress-free survival, The time of randomization begins to tumor progression, 3 years|Quality of life (QOL), Assess the quality of life of patients, 3 years|Phenotypic analysis of T cells, The number of CD3+ (or CD8+ or CD4+ or CD56+) T cell, 1 year
60 patients of esophageal cancer with TNM stage of tumor stage II-III,who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue, will be randomly divided into group A (receive cancer tissue antigen sensitized D-CIK immune cells in combination with chemotherapy treatment) or group B (just receive chemotherapy), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of autologous antigen-sensitized DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks) and chemotherapy. Patients in group B will receive only 3 cycles chemotherapy.
