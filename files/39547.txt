The Registry Study of Genetic Alterations of Oropharyngeal Cancer in Taiwan
We will use the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify genomic alterations of Taiwanese HPV positive and negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) for novel biomarker development and the study design of potential clinical trials or translational research.
Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To enroll a total of 300 patients with OPSCC who fit the criteria of this study in the enrolled period, To enroll a total of 300 patients with OPSCC who fit the criteria of this study in the enrolled period, 5 years of proposed observation period
To perform next generation sequencing analysis of OPSCC tumor tissues, To perform next generation sequencing analysis of OPSCC tumor tissues, 5 years of proposed observation period|Collect clinical data of OPSCC, To correlate with the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with the genetic profile in Taiwan., 5 years of proposed observation period|To compare the difference of the genetic and molecular profiles among patients with HPV positive and negative OPSCC, To compare the difference of the genetic and molecular profiles among patients with HPV positive and negative OPSCC, 5 years of proposed observation period|To compare the difference of genetic and molecular profiles between early (stage I and II) and advanced stage (stage III and IV) of HPV positive OPSCC, To compare the difference of genetic and molecular profiles between early (stage I and II) and advanced stage (stage III and IV) of HPV positive OPSCC, 5 years of proposed observation period
In the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled cancer genome sequencing in screening and searching for new cancer genes in an efficient manner. This massive sequencing technique not only help to identify new altered genes for novel biomarker development, but also reveal gene alterations sensitive or resistant to specific therapies. Because the difference of genomic profiling between Taiwanese HPV positive and negative OPSCC is not clear yet, we propose this multi-center research project to address this issue. In this study, we will collect tumor tissues and clinical information from patients with OPSCC and create a platform for data storage and sharing.
