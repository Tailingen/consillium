Methylphenidate for Cancer-Related Fatigue
The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a combined N-of-1 trial (N-1-T) of MPH (methylphenidate) for amelioration of fatigue in children with cancer, and to evaluate the N-1-T design both for individual clinical decision making and for clinical trials in symptom management in pediatric oncology patients. Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will receive liquid MPH on some days and a placebo on other days. We will compare how the participant feels on MPH days with how they feel on placebo days to determine whether MPH makes a difference.
Cancer
DRUG: methylphenidate|OTHER: Placebo
Completion Rate of Two Treatment Pairs Using the N-1-T Design, The feasibility of conducting an N-1-T to evaluate MPH for cancer-related fatigue will be determined by the completion rate of two MPH-placebo pairs., 18 days
Rate of Receiving Clinically Definite Answer Regarding the Ability of Experimental Treatment to Reduce Fatigue Using the N-1-T Design, Efficacy of the N-1-T design is defined as patient providing a clinically definite answer regarding the ability of MPH to reduce fatigue.Based on the definition of the outcome being evaluated, aggregation of data for all participants is appropriate., 18 days|Change Over Treatment Pairs in pedsFACIT-F Score, The pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (pedsFACIT-F) is an 11-item instrument derived from a comprehensive pediatric item bank that assesses fatigue. (Lai et al. Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2007) Measuring fatigue over the past 7 days in a population of pediatric cancer patients, the pedsFACIT-F instrument has a score ranging from 0-44, with a higher score meaning more fatigue. A minimally important difference (MID) was established as 4.7 points., The pedsFACIT-Fwas administered at baseline and at the end of each treatment pair (TP) and related change in score was calculated for each period: baseline to end of TP 1 (day 6); end of TP 1 to end of TP 2 (day 12); end of TP 2 to end of TP 3 (day 18).
I. To assess the N-1-T as a study design to evaluate a symptom-directed intervention in children with cancer

Primary objective

-To evaluate the feasibility of conducting an N-1-T to evaluate MPH for cancer-related fatigue in children as a group

Secondary objectives

* To evaluate the ability of the N-1-T to assess efficacy of MPH for an individual subject statistically and clinically definite answer (regarding the ability of MPH to reduce fatigue)
* To explore subject/family and oncologist perspectives on N1T participation
* To examine in a preliminary fashion whether there are patient, family, disease or study-related factors that are associated with attrition to help guide future large-scale N1Ts

II. To evaluate MPH for treatment of cancer-related fatigue and related symptoms in children

Primary objective

-To evaluate the effect of MPH on cancer-related fatigue in children based on various assessments including pedsFACIT-F and a unidimensional single-item Likert scale for measuring fatigue

Secondary objective

-To assess the side effect profile of MPH for fatigue in children with cancer

III. To evaluate fatigue assessment tools Primary objective

-To evaluate correlation between fatigue scores
