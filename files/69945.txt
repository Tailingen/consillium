A Study of Relatlimab Plus Nivolumab in Combination With Chemotherapy vs. Nivolumab in Combination With Chemotherapy as First Line Treatment for Participants With Stage IV or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of relatlimab plus nivolumab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (PDCT) and to determine if nivolumab plus relatlimab in combination with PDCT improves overall response rate (ORR) when compared to nivolumab plus PDCT in participants with previously untreated Stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
