Postoperative CCRT Followed by Immunotherapy in High-Risk LA HNSCC
This trial aims to evaluate whether the addition of anti-PD-1 antibody to adjuvant postoperative chemoradiotherapy could improve disease free survival in patients with high-risk locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody|OTHER: Postoperative CCRT
Disease free survival at year 2 (2y-DFS), Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first disease recurrence（including carcinoma in situ）or death from any cause., From randomization until time of events up to 2 years
Locoregional control at year 2 (2y-LRC), LRC defined from randomization to first radiographically or pathologically confirmed local or regional recurrence., From randomization until time of events up to 2 years|Overall survival at year 2 (2y-OS), Time between the date of randomization and death., From randomization until death due to any cause, up to 2 years|Adverse events, Adverse events and serious adverse events according to CACTE 5.0., From randomization until time of events up to 2 years
This open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study will include 173 patients who have been operated for their LA SCCHN with high risk.

Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive post-operative concomitant cisplatin-RT followed by/not PD-1 antibody.

The study is designed with the general objective of demonstrating that treatment CCRT followed by PD-1 antibody is more efficient than CCRT alone.
