Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Breast With Intensity Modulated by Tomotherapy:
Adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy allows a local long-term control of the order 85 to 95% with a survival rate equivalent to that of the totally mastectomy. The diminution of the local recurrence rate after irradiation post- lumpectomy is also associated to a best global survival than only the surgery. The adjuvant radiotherapy after partially or totally mastectomy for the progressive tumors is a therapeutic standard (Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group 2011). The aim of our trial of routine care is to record our practices under this breast adjuvant radiotherapy.

Patients responding criteria for selection and not objecting to participate in this trial will address the quality of life questionnaires at baseline and during their standard follow-up (1, 6, 12 and 24 months after the end of radiotherapy). The data of toxicity and disease-free survival will be collected from data on medical record of the patient.

The therapeutic support and monitoring are standard.
