Hemoglobin, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet Count Improve Prognosis Prediction in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RATIONALE

1. In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, there is sometimes a discrepancy between actual clinical outcome and TNM stages because it is an anatomy-based system in which functional factors are not concerned.
2. Hemoglobin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet count were proved to improve prognosis prediction of TNM staging system in our previous retrospective study.

PURPOSE To validate that the prognostic index based on complete blood count and TNM system had higher prediction efficiency on survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than TNM system alone.
Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms|Blood Cell Count|Neoplasm Staging|Prognosis
5-year overall survival, The period until any event (death, local recurrence or distant metastasis) is detected., 5 years after diagnosis
5-year disease-free survival, The period until local recurrence or distant metastasis is detected., 5 years after diagnosis|5-year recurrence-free survival, The period until local recurrence is detected., 5 years after diagnosis|5-year distant-free survival, The period until distant metastasis is detected., 5 years after diagnosis
Totally 720 patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be include and will be divided into 3 groups (Low Risk, Intermediate Risk and High Risk Groups) according to their prognostic index, which is on basis of blood cell count indexes and TNM stage. The 3 groups of patients will undergo a radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and be followed until death or the end of the study. Comparison on survivals of the 3 groups will be made to validate the accuracy of the prognostic index. And comparison on prediction efficacy between prognostic index and TNM staging system will be made.
