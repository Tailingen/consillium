Cervical Cancer
DEVICE: Introducer "calla" device|BEHAVIORAL: Interviews only
Assessment of introducer, We will conduct interviews/surveys to determine if subjects enrolled prefer introducer over SOC speculum, Up to 1 week (at time of pap smear for patients and up to 1 week for healthy volunteers)
This project is to assess if the introducer, "calla", can be used in place of a speculum during a routine Pap smear. For the patient arm, the introducer will be used in conjunction with standard of care procedures. The healthy volunteer arm will include taking the introducer home for a week to determine if each person can find their cervix without the help of a physician. As well as completing surveys on ease of use and demographics related to their medial history.
