Clavien-Dindo grading, Grade I : long-term pain, fever, continuous bleeding and exudate, transient intestinal obstruction ; grade II : need blood transfusion, pneumonia ; grade III : hematuria requiring cystoscopy ; level IV : renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis, respiratory insufficiency requiring ICU treatment, and cardiac insufficiency requiring ICU care., 24 months
In this study, a multi-center retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of single-layer robot-assisted peritoneal retroperitoneal radical nephrectomy in patients with nephrectomy, and to compare the safety and effectiveness of traditional robot-assisted peritoneal radical nephrectomy
