A Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BRCX014 in Patients With Glioblastoma
An Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BRCX014 Combined with Standard-of-Care Treatment in Subjects with Glioblastoma
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide|DEVICE: Optune
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BRCX014 using clinical assessments and lab results., Through study completion, an average of one year
Maximum tolerated dose, A secondary objective of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of BRCX014., Through study completion, an average of one year|Levels of metabolites, A secondary objective of this study is to perform pharmacokinetics analyses by measuring the plasma concentrations of BRCX014, temozolomide, and their major metabolites using lab results., Through study completion, an average of one year|Progression-free survival, A secondary objective of this study is to measure PFS using lab results and radiographic data., Through study completion, an average of one year
Several studies have shown a possible anti-tumor role for cannabinoids by modulating cell signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and overcoming chemotherapy resistance. The investigators seek to demonstrate the safety profile of BRCX014, a cannabinoid formulation, when given to glioblastoma patients in conjunction with standard-of-care therapy.
