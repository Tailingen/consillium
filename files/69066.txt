Ad/HER2/Neu Dendritic Cell Cancer Vaccine Testing
Background:

- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB2 or neu)/neu (HER2) is a tumor protein that appears in almost a third of breast cancers and in several other types of cancers such as colon, prostate and non-small cell lung. Tumors that overexpress HER2 can be associated with a more aggressive cancer, higher recurrence rates, and reduced survival rates. Researchers are testing a therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to stimulate the immune system to recognize HER2. The vaccine, called adenoviral transduced autologous human epidermal growth factor receptor (AdHER)/neu dendritic cell vaccine, is custom-made using an individual's own immune cells. These cells will be collected and used to produce the vaccine.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of AdHER2 vaccination.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HER2-expressing tumors.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.
* Participants will have an apheresis procedure to collect immune cells to create the vaccine.
* Participants will receive five doses of the vaccine at study Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24.
* Participants will be monitored with physical exams, frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

Number of Participants With Cardiac Toxicity, Cardiac toxicity defined as cardiac dysfunction due to damage to the heart muscles or valves. Cardiac toxicity was assessed by serial echocardiography to determine left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and following receipt of the last dose of vaccine. Cardiac toxicity is at least a 10% decline from the baseline in cardiac function. Normal LVEF is \>-53%. Below 53% is a cardiac dysfunction., Baseline through receipt of last dose of vaccine, up to 24 weeks|Number of Participants Who Develop at Least a 4-fold or 2.5- Fold Increase in Anti-Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2)/Neu Antibody Dilution Titers, Vaccine immunogenicity was determined by the number of participants who develop at least a 4-fold increase in antibody dilution titers over baseline at the time points measured. The antibody response following the vaccination was assessed using peptide-array and reported as fold increase compared to the baseline values using the cut-off of 4 fold per study definition of the vaccine immunogenicity and also of 2.5 fold to aid the interpretation of the result., Baseline through last dose of vaccine, up to 24 weeks
Number of Participants Who Experienced Tumor Shrinkage or Stabilization That is Sufficient by Modified Immune Response Related Criteria (irRC) to be Considered Stable Disease (SD), a Partial Response (PR) or Better (Complete Response (CR), Number of participants who experienced tumor shrinkage or stabilization that is sufficient by modified immune response related criteria (irRC) to be considered stable disease (SD), a partial response (PR) or better (complete response (CR). SD is neither partial response nor progressive disease (PD). PR is ≥ 30% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline, confirmation required. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Lymph nodes must regress to \<10mm short axis. No new lesions, confirmation required. PD ≥ 20% increase in tumor burden compared with baseline, with nadir, or reset baseline. New lesions added to the tumor burden, confirmation required., At 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 76, 100, and 124 weeks after initial vaccination
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 29 months and 13 days, 28 months and 28 days, 40 months and 2 days, 24 months and 23 days, 25 months and 30 days, and 28 months and 3 days for each group respectively.
Background:

* Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB2 or neu) is a proto-oncogene that encodes a 185-kd transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that participates in receptor-receptor interactions that regulate cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. Its over-expression contributes to neoplastic transformation.
* HER2 is over-expressed in up to 25-30% of node-positive or node-negative primary breast cancers and is associated with clinically aggressive breast cancer, a high recurrence rate and reduced survival.
* Trastuzumab (Herceptin (Registered trademark)) is a recombinant humanized mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to the extracellular (EC) domain of the HER2 receptor. Its clinical efficacy is limited to patients with 3+ HER2 tumor expression documented by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a Vysis fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of greater than 2.2. IHC is a subjective measurement of HER2/neu protein while FISH is an objective measurement of amplification of the HER2 oncogene.
* Although the use of trastuzumab has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, a significant number of patients are unresponsive to therapy and most eventually experience clinical progression. At present no vaccine is available that induces patients to make their own anti-HER2 antibodies.
* We propose to investigate the use of an adenoviral vector (Ad5f35) expressing human HER2ECTM (Ad5f35HER2ECTM- AdHER2) to transduce autologous dendritic cells for therapeutic vaccination in patients with HER2 expressing solid tumors.

Objectives:

-To determine the safety and toxicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination.

Specifically, to determine if the fraction of patients with cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \>=10 percentage points, to a value LVEF to less than or equal to 53% (normal reference value for two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography), is sufficiently low to warrant further development in subsequent trials.

-To determine the immunogenicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination as measured by a 3-fold increase in anti-HER2/neu antibody concentration or a 4-fold increase in antibody dilution titers over baseline.

Study Design:

Open label, non-randomized, two-part, phase I study of 48 weeks duration for evaluation of primary endpoints with extended follow-up out to 30 months to monitor LVEF cardiac function.

Part I involves vaccine dose escalation in a population with no prior exposure to trastuzumab or other HER2-targeted therapies to determine if there is a significant, adverse safety signal regarding cardiac toxicity, in addition to preliminary assessment of the vaccine s immunogenicity and clinical activity. Five doses of 5, 10, 20 or 40 x 10(6) viable cells/AdHER2 DC vaccine will be given intradermally at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 in patients with metastatic solid tumors or high risk bladder cancer in the adjuvant setting Response will be evaluated by a Modified Immune- Related Response Criteria (irRC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors

(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (modified irRC) at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. Adjuvant bladder cancer patients will undergo re-staging at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.

Part II is identical to part I, in the schedule of treatment and response evaluation, but is conducted in a population with prior exposure to trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted therapies.
