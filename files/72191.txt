Dose Escalation Trial of Denileukin Diftitox (Ontak) Post Autologous Transplantation
The primary goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of giving two doses of denileukin diftitox (DD) at days 0 and 21 post autologous stem cell transplantation in a dose escalation fashion. Secondary goals include evaluating the the effect of DD on the number and percentage of T-regs in the peripheral blood post transplant at each dose level, the effect of DD on T cell (CD4/CD8) reconstitution post transplant at each dose level and determining the time to engraftment: absolute neutrophil count (\>0.5 x 10\^9/L for 3 consecutive days), and platelet (\>20X 10\^9/L for 3 consecutive days).

The hypothesis for the study is based on the ability of DD to deplete T-regs and subsequently enhance the immune reconstitution and reverse post transplant lymphopenia. This may indirectly enhance the efficacy of autologous transplantation and reduce disease relapse.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Denileukin Diftitox (Ontak)
Assess Toxicities of Giving Two Doses of Ontak at Days 0 and 21 Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in a Dose Escalation Fashion., After drug infusion, participants will be closely monitored for at least 4 hours for side effects, Up to 21 days post transplant
To Evaluate the Effect of Ontak on the Number and Percentage of Regulatory T Cells in the Peripheral Blood Post Transplant at Each Dose Level., days 0 and 21 post autologous stem cell transplantation|To Evaluate the Effect of Ontak on T Cell CD4/CD8 Reconstitution Post Transplant at Each Dose., days 0 and 21 post autologous stem cell transplantation|To Evaluate the Effect of Ontak on Engraftment of Neutrophils and Platelets Post Transplant at Each Dose., During hospitalization stay (approximately 2 weeks), participants will receive injections of G-CSF on a daily basis starting on Day 6 and ending when white blood cells have engrafted. Participants usually remain hospitalized until engraftment., days 0 and 21 post autologous stem cell transplantation
