Evaluation of Viatar™ Oncopheresis System in Removing CTC From Whole Blood
This study will access the safety and efficacy of the Viatar™ Oncopheresis System to remove a meaningful quantity of circulating tumor cells from the blood of subjects' with breast, colon or prostate solid tumor cancers in a single treatment. CTC reduction will be measured as the change in circulating tumor cells as determined before and after treatment.
