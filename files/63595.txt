A Study of LY2334737 in Participants With Cancer That is Advanced and/or Has Spread
The purpose of this study is to evaluate two different dosing regimens of LY2334737 in participants with cancer that is advanced and/or has spread to other parts of the body. Information about side effects will be collected.
Malignant Solid Tumor|Solid Tumor|Metastatic Tumor
DRUG: LY2334737
Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies, Recommended Phase 2 dose was determined by maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD was the highest dose level at which \<2 out of 6 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1. DLT was an adverse event (AE) during Cycle 1 that was likely related to LY2334737 and fulfilled any of the following criteria: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ≥Grade 3 nonhematological (except nausea/vomiting controlled with treatment); Grade 3 neutropenia with fever or any Grade 4 neutropenia with or without fever; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥Grade 2 bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding; A recovery period longer than 14 days from last dose of LY2334737 to values allowing Cycle 2 to start; Other significant drug-related toxicity deemed by investigator to be dose limiting or that caused the participant to withdraw from the study. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) were also taken into consideration for Phase 2 recommended dose., Baseline up to 28 days postdose in Cycle 1 (28-day cycle)
Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) for LY2334737, AUC over the dosing interval (AUC0-Ƭ) of LY2334737 for Arm A (single dose) is 0 to 48 hours postdose. AUC0-Ƭ of LY2334737 for Arm B (multiple doses) is 0 to 24 hours postdose and AUC time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) for LY2334737., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1): 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 7 24 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1 D21): predose, 0.5, 2, 3 to 4, 7, 24 hours postdose of 28-day cycle|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) for 2'2'-Difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC), AUC over the dosing interval (AUC0-Ƭ) of dFdC (a metabolite of LY2334737) for Arm A (following a single dose of LY2334737) AUC0-Ƭ is 0-48 hours postdose, Arm B (following multiple doses of LY2334737) AUC 0-Ƭ is 0-24 hours postdose and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1): 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 7 24 hours post dose; Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1 D21): predose, 0.5, 2, 3 to 4, 7, 24 hours post dose of 28-day cycle|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) for Difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), Daily AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) of dFdU (a metabolite of LY2334737) for Arm A (single dose of LY2334737) and Arm B (multiple doses of LY2334737)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1): 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 7 24 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1 D21): predose, 0.5, 2, 3 to 4, 7, 24 hours postdose of 28-day cycle|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax for LY2334737 and its metabolites 2'2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) and difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1): 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 7 24 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1 D21): predose, 0.5, 2, 3 to 4, 7, 24 hours postdose of 28-day cycle|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR), Response defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0) criteria. Complete Response defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD) defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable Disease was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria and unknown defined as response status was not known. The BOR was the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Baseline to measured disease progression up to 33 weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause.

Due to the different tumor types, schedules and doses, the PFS was not analyzed., Baseline to measured disease progression or death up to 33 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Changes in QT Interval (>30 Milliseconds) From Baseline, Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval corrected for heart rate was assessed using triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). Change in QT interval from baseline was calculated using a time matched approach, that is change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the respective reading taken at the same nominal time on Day-1 from the reading taken on Days 1 and 21; change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the last non-missing ECG assessment on or prior to Day 1, 0.5 hours prior to dose from assessment on Day 2 and Day 22. The outlying QTcF intervals were defined using the criteria: change from baseline in mean QTcF interval \>30 milliseconds, Day -1: 24.5 hours, 22 hours and 17 hours predose; Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21, 0.5 hours predose, 2 hours, 7 hours and 24 hours postdose (28-day cycles)|Percentage of Participants With Changes in R-R Interval From Baseline, Changes in R-R interval from baseline was calculated using a time matched approach, that is change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the respective reading taken at the same nominal time on Day -1 from the reading taken on Days 1 and 21; change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the last non-missing electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment on or prior to Day 1 and 0.5 hours prior to dose for Day 2 and Day 22. Percentage of participants with changes in R-R interval from baseline was calculated as the number of participants with a change not equal to 0 across all time points divided by the number of treated participants multiplied by 100., Day -1: 24.5 hours, 22 hours and 17 hours predose; Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: 0.5 hours predose, 2 hours, 7 hours and 24 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetics: Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin), Cmin for LY2334737 and its metabolite 2'2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1): 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 7, 24 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Day 21 (C1 D21): predose, 0.5, 2, 3 to 4, 7, 24 hours postdose of 28-day cycle
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) during Cycle 1 that was likely related to the LY2334737 and fulfilled any of the following criteria: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ≥Grade 3 nonhematological (except nausea/vomiting controlled with treatment); Grade 3 neutropenia with fever or any Grade 4 neutropenia with or without fever; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥ Grade 2 bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; with or without bleeding A recovery period longer than 14 days from the last dose of LY2334737 to values allowing Cycle 2 to start; other significant drug-related toxicity deemed by the investigator to be dose limiting or that caused the participant to withdraw from the study., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle)
This study will consist of a Dose Escalation Phase (Arms A and B) followed by a Dose Confirmation Phase.
