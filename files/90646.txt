Enzalutamide & Dutasteride/Finasteride as 1st Line Treatment for Patients =/> 65 Years Old With Prostate Cancer.
Determine the effect of enzalutamide and dutasteride or finasteride on the time to prostatic-specific antigen level increase in patients age 65 or older.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Enzalutamide and Dutasteride or finasteride
Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression Free Survival, Percentage of participants with progression-free survival at 3 years. PSA disease progression is defined as an increase in the PSA that is \>=25% and \>=2 ng/ml above the nadir PSA value., 3 years.
Absolute PSA Response, Lowest PSA value achieved., up to approximately 8 years|Time to PSA Nadir, Time (months) to achieve the lowest PSA value compared to baseline PSA level, up to approximately 8 years|Number of Participants Who Experience a Treatment-related Adverse Events., Adverse events will be defined according to CTCAE version 4.0., up to approximately 8 years
Number of Participants With a Change in Bone Density, Change in bone density at week 103 compared to baseline bone density, measured using DEXA study., baseline to week 103|Mean Quality of Life, Change in quality of life score at follow up compared to baseline score, using FACT-P survey. The FACT-P survey is a 39 item questionnaire with a score that ranges from 0-156 with higher scores indicating better quality of life., baseline to week 61|Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Domains, Change in comprehensive geriatric assessment domains at follow up compared to baseline evaluation., Week 1 to approximately 36 months
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of enzalutamide and dutasteride or finasteride on the time to prostatic-specific antigen progression in patients aged 65 or older receiving this combination as first line treatment for systemic prostate cancer.

To determine the safety and toxicities of the study drug combination.

To determine the time to prostatic-specific antigen nadir from the start of study treatment and to evaluate the absolute prostatic-specific antigen nadir as a result of the study drug combination
