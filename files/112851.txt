Impact of a Process Optimizing the Decision to Continue or Stop Cancer Treatments in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
Sequential comparative prospective interventional study evaluating the impact of the use of an optimization device of the decision of cancer treatment on aggressiveness of end of life care. Comparison between a first period, period (A), of care as usual and a second period, period (B), of systematic and iterative use of a device for optimizing the decision to continue an anti-cancer treatment.

We propose to study the optimization of this decision process in an advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) population, with a Performance Status (PS) â‰¥ 2 (median survival of approximately 3 months) piloting iteratively (before each decision to continue treatment) a process consisting of an evaluation framework (30 items to be answered by the oncologist with the patient), consolidating:

1. clinical parameters;
2. doctors' expectations regarding the continuation of anticancer treatment;
3. patient expectations and preferences;
4. the possibility of referring the patient to a supportive care specialist and strengthening home care.

The process triggers a dialogue between the patient and the oncologist, based on facts and seeks objectivity, ultimately allowing a shared decision.

In this prospective comparative study, the rate of systemic oncological treatment during the last month of life will be measured consecutively, over a period of usual management, followed by a period of systematic application of a process of optimization of the medical decision.
