Hypo-Combi Trial: Hypofractionated EBRT Plus HDR-BT Boost for Prostate Cancer
Hypo-Combi Trial: A Prospective Phase I/II Study of Combined Hypofractionated External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) plus Interstitial High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT) for Intermediate/High Risk Prostate Cancer
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Radiation Toxicity
RADIATION: External beam radiation therapy, High-dose-rate brachytherapy|DRUG: Goserelin 10.8 mg
Rate of acute and early late genitourinary, gastrointestinal and sexual toxicity, RTOG/EORTC questionnaires will be collected and evaluated for GU/GI toxicity. International Prostate Symptom Score will be assessed for lower urinary tract symptomatology and IIEF-5 for erectile function., up to 2 years
Rate of biochemical control, Evaluation of 2- and 5-year biochemical control based on the Phoenix criteria, 2 years, 5 years|Rate of overall survival, Evaluation of 2- and 5-year overall survival rate, 2 years, 5 years|Rate of prostate cancer-specific survival, Evaluation of 2- and 5-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate, 2 years, 5 years|Rate of distant metastasis-free survival, Evaluation of 2- and 5-year distant metastasis-survival rate, 2 years, 5 years|Rate of treatment-related symptoms on Quality of Life assessed by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) questionnaire, Record quality of life (QOL) issues related to treatment-related symptoms and overall satisfaction. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) questionnaire will be used. Minimum score is 0 points and maximum score is 60 points, with lower points meaning better quality of life and higher point score meaning, alternatively, worse outcome., 2 years, 5 years|18F-PSMA PET/CT Vs conventional imaging for identification of pelvic nodal or distant secondaries, Evaluation of the accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined reference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up and compare to 18F-PSMA PET/CT, 2 years
The Phase I/II trial will prospectively assess the acute, early late and late gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU) and sexual toxicity of combined hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) plus high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) schedule (total dose of EBRT 36 Gy/ in 12 fractions of 3 Gy plus HDR-BT with a total physical dose of 14 Gy in a single fraction) for patients with unfavourable intermediate/high risk (based on NCCN stratification guidelines) organ-confined prostate cancer, not requiring pelvic irradiation.
