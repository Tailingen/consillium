Endoscopic Characterization of Colorectal Neoplasia With the Different Published Classifications: a Prospective Comparative Study
Endoscopic characterization of colorectal lesions has become essential to predict histology and choose the best therapeutic strategy. We have created the CONECCT classification grouping all the endoscopic criteria already published in a single table. To validate this classification, we carried out this comparative study evaluating the endoscopic characterization performance of all recognized classifications and CONECCT in terms of inter-observer agreement and histological prediction.
