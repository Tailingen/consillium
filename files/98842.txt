Study to Investigate the Safety and Clinical Activity of GSK3326595 and Other Agents to Treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK3326595 in participants with relapsed and refractory MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and AML.

This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK3326595 in participants with relapsed and refractory MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and AML. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 will determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of GSK3326595 in monotherapy and Part 2 will be expanded to study GSK3326595 in combination with 5-Azacitidine which will be composed of a dose escalation phase followed by dose expansion cohort of GSK3326595.
