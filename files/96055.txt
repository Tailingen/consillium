Evaluation of PSMA-PET and mpMRI in High-risk Prostate Cancer - Using Histopathologic Validation
In this trial the connection between image properties (mpMRI and PSMA-PET) and tissue properties (molecular and histopathology) will be investigated in order to improve diagnostics and image-based treatment guidance of prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: [18F]PSMA-PET|DEVICE: MRI sequences optimized for prostate cancer examinations
Accuracy of PSMA-PET and mpMRI for identification and delineation of intraprostatic lesions, Spatially defined aggressive PC lesions, or subparts of lesion, identified and defined using PSMA-PET and/or mpMRI compared to histopathology., Pre-surgical imaging 1-6 weeks before surgery vs. post-surgery histopathology as performed within 1-4 weeks for normal clinical work-up. Within the 5-year time frame of the study, analyses will be complemented with detailed study specific histopathology
Open, non-randomized, prospective multi-center trial, with consecutive recruiting, between Skåne University hospital and Umeå University Hospital.

High-risk prostate cancer patients referred for radical prostatectomy.
