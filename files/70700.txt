Rehabilitation After Breast Cancer
The aim of the study is to evaluate whether a screening-based individually tailored nurse navigator intervention compared to standard care significantly reduce psychological and physical symptoms among women being treated for breast cancer who had moderate-to-severe distress (score â‰¥ 7 on the distress thermometer).

Social support, Modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale (MOS), Baseline
During a 2-year period, 758 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer will be screened for inclusion at the Section of Breast Surgery at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Of these 324 participants enter the randomized controlled trial (RCT) and are randomized in a computer-generated sequence of 1:1 to the intervention (nurse-navigation) or control group (standard care). A total of 432 participants will enter an observational questionnaire study. All participants are followed for 1,5 years.
