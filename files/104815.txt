Fixed Low-dose Simethicone Combined With Macrogol 4000 (PEG) Reduces Colon Bubble Formation in Colonoscopy
Several randomised studies have shown that the addition of low-dose Simethicone to the bowel preparation was sufficient to reduce the presence of bubbles during colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bowel preparation containing low-dose Simethicone on bubble formation.

Patients and Methods This prospective, real-life, phase 4 study was conducted from February 2020 to May 2021, in five private endoscopy centres, among adult patients undergoing a colonoscopy. Clinical, endoscopic and histological parameters were collected on e-CRF. The primary endpoint was the measurement of bubble formation in the various colon segments.
