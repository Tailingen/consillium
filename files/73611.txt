Efficacy & Safety for LN144 With Pembrolizumab With High Risk Stage IIIb-dResectable Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant adoptive cell therapy (ACT) via infusion of LN-144 (autologous TIL) followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) after a nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion (NMA-LD) preparative regimen, followed by Pembrolizumab.

LN-144 Efficacy, measured as the rate of RFS (Relapse-Free Survival), 1 year following TIL infusion|LN-144 Safety Profile, measured by the incidence Serous Adverse Events (SAE), Within 30 days of LN-144 administration
LN-144+ Pembrolizumab Efficacy Overall Survival (OS), measured using overall survival (OS). This is the length of time from the start of treatment to a given time point that measures participants on the study that are still alive, 1 year after initial treatment|LN-144+ Pembrolizumab Efficacy Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), measured using Relapse-free survival described as the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer, 1 year after initial treatment|LN-144+ Pembrolizumab Efficacy Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), measured using distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). This is the length of time from the start of treatment for cancer that a patient is still alive and the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body., 1 year after inital treatment|LN-144 Safety Profile, Incidence of adverse events following LN144 administration, within 12 months of LN144 administration|Location of relapse, In participants who relapse, the location of the relapse will be located using standard imaging and physical exam, Up to 3 years|Rate of Achievable Recruitment, The number of participants enrolled will be counted in which an "achievable" recruitment is considered to be 1 participant every 2-3 months., 2 years from the study start date
Primary:

• To evaluate the efficacy of LN-144 with adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Stage IIIb-d melanoma patients as assessed by 6 and 12-month relapse-free survival (RFS)

Secondary:

* To further evaluate the efficacy of LN-144 with adjuvant Pembrolizumab in Stage IIIb-d melanoma patients using overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival
* To characterize the safety profile of LN-144 in Stage IIIb-d melanoma patients as measured by the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 3 months of LN-144 administration
* To identify location of relapse
* Rate of achievable recruitment for duration of planned recruitment period
