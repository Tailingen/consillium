A Study Assessing the Safety and Utility of PINPOINT® Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging in the Identification of Lymph Nodes in Patients With Uterine and Cervical Malignancies Who Are Undergoing Lymph Node Mapping
This is a randomized, prospective, open label, multicenter study to assess the safety and utility of PINPOINT® Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging (PINPOINT) in identification of lymph nodes (LN) in patients with uterine and cervical malignancies who are undergoing LN mapping.
