Evaluation of Patients With Bulky GIST Using Sunitinib
The primary purpose of this study is to determine if oral (mouth) delivery prior to tumor removal in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) results in tumor shrinkage allowing for successful surgery. Therapy will be administered orally and the response of the tumor will be assessed using CTs or MRIs.
Tumor
DRUG: Sunitinib|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, 6 months
Measurable Disease Response Rate, Positron electron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and computed tomography (CT) will be used. None of the participants were analyzed, FDG PET scan at baseline and Week 2, CT scan at baseline and Week 12|Alteration in Diffusion and Vascularity Kinetics, The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria may be insensitive in assessing GIST so the Choi criteria will be used. The Choi criteria accounts for morphologic tumor changes and biologic alterations. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic contrast magnetic resonance will be used to find the vascular permeability and apparent diffusion coefficient 9ACD) at baseline, Week 2 and Week 6. Weeks 2 and 6 values will be compared to the baseline values using paired t tests., MRI at baseline, Week 2 and Week 6
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare cancer affecting primarily the digestive tract and sometimes abdominal cavity in adults. The most common site is the stomach followed by the duodenum and small intestine.

Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for GIST patients whose primary tumor is felt to be resectable. Prior to the introduction of Gleevec, patients with inoperable GIST had essentially no therapeutic options. However, sunitinib trials offer options to patients who are Gleevec resistant or have intolerant GIST. Clinical benefit has been demonstrated with positive results in several sunitinib studies of varying phases.
