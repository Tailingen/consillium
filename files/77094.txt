Investigating the Tumour Immune Response of Radiotherapy
This study aims to investigate immune changes which occur before and following standard radiotherapy in a range of tumour types. We will collect tissue and blood samples before and after radiation treatment from participants across six cancer types: cervical, rectal, Head and Neck cancer, nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cutaneous lymphoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/ basal cell carcinoma.
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Biopsy and blood sample collection
Feasibility of obtaining paired biopsy samples, To assess the feasibility of obtaining tumour samples pre-radiotherapy (diagnostic or fresh) and a second biopsy during or immediately after radiotherapy, or a surgical sample, from patients undergoing standard of care RT., Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy|Collection of matched blood samples, To obtain additional matched blood samples pre-radiotherapy, during or post-radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy for assessment of immune status of peripheral blood in comparison to the intratumoural microenvironment., Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy
Immunohistochemistry analysis of expression markers on tumour tissue, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of expression markers on tumours pre-radiotherapy and during/post radiotherapy, Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy|RNA evaluation of immune signatures, RNA evaluation of immune signatures in tumour tissue and blood pre-radiotherapy and during/post radiotherapy, Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy|Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Assessment of changes in immune phenotypic markers, Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy|Analysis of plasma proteins, cytokines and chemokines, Analysis of plasma proteins, cytokines and chemokines as biomarkers of immune response, Within 6-7 weeks of starting radiotherapy
The purpose of this prospective, non-CTIMP, translational study is to assess the feasibility of achieving paired biopsies for immune analysis in patients across six different cancer types: cervical, rectal, Head and Neck cancer, nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cutaneous lymphoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma/ basal cell carcinoma.

All participants will have a minimum of 1 mandatory biopsy (during/post-radiotherapy \[irradiated site\]) and the potential to have a pre-treatment biopsy if the archival biopsy does not meet the suitability criteria.

Matched blood samples will be collected from participants at baseline, during/post-radiotherapy, and if radiotherapy continues after the on-treatment biopsy is taken, an additional end of treatment blood sample will be collected.

We aim to recruit 10-20 participants per study arm, with the option to increase numbers in study arms that are recruiting well - a maximum of 120 patients in total will be recruited to the study.
