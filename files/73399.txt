Rituximab and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With High Risk, Refractory, or Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving rituximab together with cyclophosphamide may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with high risk, refractory, or relapsed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: rituximab|DRUG: cyclophosphamide
Event-free Survival, Percentage of study participants who did not report that their multiple myeloma relapsed or progressed (got worse), 1 year|Safety of Maintenance Rituximab Following High Dose Cyclophosphamide, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
Safety and Toxicity, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate and Partial Response (PR) Rate, 1 year|Effect of Rituximab by Clonogenic Growth of Multiple Myeloma (MM) Progenitors and the Mechanisms by Which MM Stem Cells Are Inhibited, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Overall Survival, 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the effect of rituximab and high-dose cyclophosphamide on the growth of myeloma stem cells in patients with high-risk, refractory, or relapsed multiple myeloma.

OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days -10 and -7; once weekly for 4 weeks (after completion of high-dose cyclophosphamide); and then once in months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients also receive high-dose cyclophosphamide on days -3 to 0.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.
