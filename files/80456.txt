A Study of ERY974 in Patient With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is the open label, multicenter Phase 1 study which consists of a dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and cohort expansion to obtain a preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor activity. ERY974 is intravenously injected to patients with Glypican 3 positive advanced solid tumors until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ERY974
Dose escalation： MTD determination, Determination of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLT evaluation period, defined as from the first ERY974 injection until 7 days after the third injection|Cohort expansion：Preliminary assessment of change in tumor size, Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), From the date of informed consents obtained until disease progression: at screening , week 6,12,18 and subsequently every 3 months up to 38 months
Dose escalation： Number and severity of adverse events, Adverse events will be reported through 28 days after the last dose|Dose escalation： Plasma ERY974 concentrations, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Dose escalation：Area under curve (AUC), PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Dose escalation：terminal half-life, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Dose escalation：total clearance, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Dose escalation：volume distribution, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Dose escalation： Change in tumor size assessed by mRECIST, From the date of informed consents obtained until disease progression: at screening , week 6,12,18 and subsequently every 3 months up to 38 months|Dose escalation： Determining the recommended dose, Recommended dose will be determined after completion of DLT assessments in all dose escalation cohorts. It is estimated as 18 months after first patient enrollment.|Cohort expansion：Number and severity of adverse events, Adverse events will be reported through 28 days after the last dose|Cohort expansion ：Plasma ERY974 concentrations, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Cohort expansion ：Area under curve (AUC), PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Cohort expansion ：terminal half-life, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Cohort expansion ：total clearance, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months|Cohort expansion ：volume distribution, PK will be assessed from day 1 to day 22, day 1 to day 29, or day 1 to day 36, then every 3 weeks from day 43 until end of treatment visit, up to 38 months
