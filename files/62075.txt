Temozolomide in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Primary Malignant Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating adults with newly diagnosed primary malignant glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: temozolomide|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of temozolomide in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
* Define the relationship between tumor O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity and tumor response in these patients.
* Define the relationship between tumor DNA mismatch repair activity and tumor response to temozolomide.

OUTLINE: Patients receive temozolomide orally once daily on days 1-5. Treatment courses are repeated every 28 days. In the absence of disease progression and toxicity, patients receive up to 4 courses of treatment prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, patients demonstrating partial or complete response may receive an additional 12 courses of treatment.

Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 50 patients.
