Prognostic Significance of Bioscore in Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer
assess the validity of applying the bioscore system to predict the disease-free survival (The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who have not experienced disease relapse in a defined period of time.) in breast cancer patients presenting to our

the correlation between pathological stage, T stage (T), nodal stage (N), grade (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status combined score and the disease specific survival (DSS), Disease free survial:The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who have not experienced disease relapse in a defined period of time. The time period usually begins after surgerical treatment and ends at the end of study period 2020, Non metastatic breast cancer patients presented at our department from 2015 to 2018.. Then follow up till 2020
Retrospective cohort analysis of breast cancer patient's records for patients treated with surgery as an initial intervention at our department from 2015 to 2018 will be identified. Multivariate analyses of factors, including pathological stage (PS), T stage (T), nodal stage (N), grade (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status will be recorded to identify associations with disease-free survival DFS. A score of 0-4 will be assigned for each factor by considering the hazard ratio magnitude.
