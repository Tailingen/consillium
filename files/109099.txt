2-year disease-free survival rate, Refers to the proportion of patients who did not experience recurrence, metastasis or death (from any cause) within 2 years after surgery., The day of surgery until the second year.
Disease-free survival, It is the time from randomization to tumor progression or death (from any cause)., Randomization until disease recurrence, metastasis, death (from any cause) , or 36 months after surgery, whichever occurs first.|Overall survival, It is the time from randomization to death (from any cause)., Randomization until death (from any cause) or 36 months after surgery, whichever occurs first.|Cumulative annual recurrence and metastasis rate for 1-3 years, Refers to the proportion of patients with recurrence and metastasis within 1-3 years from the day of surgery., The day of surgery until the once, second and third year.|Cumulative annual survival rate for 1-3 years, Refers to the proportion of patients with survical within 1-3 years from the day of surgery., The day of surgery until the once, second and third year.|Indexes related to fat distribution, Total Fat Area, Visceral Fat Area and Subcutaneous Fat Area. They measure fat area on cross-sectional images using plain CT scanning., before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Visceral Adiposity Index, It is a new assessment of visceral fat based on waist circumference (WC), BMI, triglyceride (TG) and HDL.

Male VAI = during \[WC/(39.68 + 1.88 x BMI)\] \* (TG / 1.03) \* (1.31 / HDL). Female VAI = during \[WC/(36.58 + 1.89 x BMI)\] \* (TG / 0.81) \* (1.52 / HDL)., before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Tumor marker, CEA, CA724 and CA199, before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Peripheral blood inflammatory index, The ratio of lymphocytes to monocytes (LMR) and ratio of Lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio (LNR), before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Prognostic nutritional index, Serum albumin level (g/L) +5× total number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (×10 \^ 9 /L), before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Quality of life of the patient, This will be measured with Quality of Life Questionnaire of Stomach22 (QLQ-STO22). The minimum score is 22 and the maximum is 88. A higher score indicates a poorer quality of life., Before and after every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to death or 3 years after surgery.|Evaluation of the patient's symptoms, This will be measured with M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-GI) and Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale (PGSAS-45). The minimum score of MDASI-GI is 0 and the maximum is 240. The minimum score of PGSAS-45 is 0 and the maximum is 271. A higher score indicates a poorer symptom., Before and after every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to death or 3 years after surgery.|Medication compliance, The number of cases and percentage were calculated as \< 80%, 80-120% and \> 120%, From randomization to the end of the sixth course of medication （up to 24 weeks）.|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events in different arms., Baseline until disease progression, death, or assessed up to 36 months after surgery.
This study include a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo, parallel controlled clinical trial.The randomized clinical trial will enroll approximately 212 patients. Participants will be randomly divided into experimental (n=106) and control groups (n=106).Patients in the experimental group was treated with Yiqiuyang Jiedu prescription within 6-8 months after radical gastroctomy and after the completion of standard regimen (XELOX and SOX) for at least 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients in the control group will receive the placebo.The primary endpoint is 2-year DFS (Disease-free survival) rate after surgery, that refers to the proportion of patients who do not have recurrence, metastasis or death (from any cause) within 2 years after surgery. The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the trial.
