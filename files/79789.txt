HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: A166|DRUG: T-DM1
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 39 months
Overall survival (OS), OS, 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, and 3-year survival rate., Randomization up to approximately 48 months|Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response(CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by BICR/investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 39 months|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as assessed by BICR/investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 39 months|Duration of response(DOR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented CR or PR until date of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR/investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 39 months
This study will evaluate the efficacy of A166 versus trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane therapy

To further evaluate the efficacy of A166 versus T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer, based on effectiveness endpoints including:

Overall survival (OS)

Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigators

Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) assessed by both blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigators.

To assess the safety profile of A166 for injection in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.

To evaluate the immunogenicity of A166 for injection in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.

To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of A166 for injection in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.
