Systemic Anti-tumor Activity and Safety of the Combination of SBRT and Concurrent PD-1 Blockade in Metastatic RCC.
Prior research has indicated that stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can effectively trigger systemic anti-tumor immune response. The goal of this observational study is to learn about abscopal effects of stereotactic body radiotherapy and concurrent anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in patients of metastatic clear renal cell carcinoma. The primary objective was to assess the objective response rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions, and incidence of adverse events (AEs).
