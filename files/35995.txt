Bacterial Intestinal Gut Modification Around Cancer Surgery (BIG MACS) Diet
The long-term study objective is to develop optimized nutritional therapies for surgery and test them in clinical practice. This pilot study will test a microbiome-optimization diet in colorectal cancer surgery patients. The study hypothesizes that the Bacterial Intestinal Gut Modification Around Cancer Surgery (BIG MACS) Diet will provide participants with increased microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) to support the microbiome and improve outcomes.
