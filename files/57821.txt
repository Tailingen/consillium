Preoperative Palbociclib in Patients With DCIS of the Breast That Are Candidates for Surgery
This is a feasibility study which will evaluate the effects of pre-operative treatment of DCIS of the breast with palbociclib. Patients with biopsy-proven DCIS are eligible for the study.

There will be 2 independent and unrelated study groups of 12 patients each, for a total of 24 patients:

1. Group A, of male or female patients treated with palbociclib single agent (n=12);
2. Group B, untreated, of male or female patients who consented translational studies in blood, as well as diagnostic and definitive surgical specimen, but not the pre-operative treatment with palbociclib (n=12).
DCIS
DRUG: Palbociclib
Feasibility: recruitment rates, The approach will be considered feasible if more than 50% of the enrolled patients are treated and followed within protocol rules, if collected samples are suitable for studies, and if pathologic changes are detectable when comparing diagnostic and surgical specimens, or treated and untreated specimens. In Group A, patients will be treated with palbociclib alone, providing the opportunity to address if proposing this kind of treatment for these patients is feasible. Obtaining human data and feasibility data would be key for designing efficacy/definitive studies of palbociclib in DCIS. This will be measured through data collected on eCRFs regarding timeline from consent to treatment, and treatment to surgery, including treatment delivery (beginning date, end date, number of tablets taken) and date of definitive surgery, as well as number of drop outs., 14 - 40 Days
Pathology: descriptive findings on H&E, Pharmacodynamic effects as measured by changes in tissue morphology (evaluated by H\&E) in pre- and post-dose tumor specimens, 14 - 40 Days|Pathology: descriptive findings on IHC, Pharmacodynamic effects as measured by changes in biomarkers Cdk4, Cdk6, pRb, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E (evaluated by IHC) in pre- and post-dose tumor specimens., 14 - 40 Days|Toxicity based on CTCAE, Will be evaluated by CTCAE. There is no plan to compare Groups A and B regarding efficacy or toxicity. Toxicity will be descriptive for each treatment group, independently., 14 - 40 Days
