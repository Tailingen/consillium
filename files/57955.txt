Melatonin for Fatigue and Other Symptoms in Patients With Advanced Cancer
BACKGROUND:

Patients with advanced cancer often suffer from fatigue and other symptoms and problems such as insomnia, appetite loss and pain. Problems that may have great consequences for their quality of life. Several studies suggest that a supplement of the hormone melatonin (MLT) may have a beneficial effect on these symptoms/problems. This needs further investigation.

AIM:

To investigate if a supplement of melatonin have an effect on a) fatigue (the primary outcome of the trial), b) the symptoms insomnia, appetite loss, depression and pain, and c) overall quality of life.

METHODS AND PATIENTS:

The trial takes place in the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bispebjerg Hospital, and 50 patients will participate. The participants have to be 18 years or above, have advanced cancer, and suffer from quite a bit or very much fatigue.

The study consists of two parts. In part I it is investigated if melatonin has a better effect than placebo on the outcomes mentioned above. This part is a consecutive, prospective, double blinded, randomized (MLT vs. placebo), cross-over study where the patients serve as their own control. In part II the effect of melatonin over time is investigated. Part II is a consecutive, prospective, open-label study.

The outcomes are assessed with weekly questionnaires (MFI-20 and EORTC QLQ-C15PAL) and a few daily diary questions.

Melatonin has been used in several studies, and the general conclusion is that it is a safe substance with few adverse drug reactions.

PERSPECTIVES:

If melatonin has the potential to alleviate fatigue and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer and enhance the quality of life of these patients, this will be of benefit to many future patients. Trials such as this are important both nationally and internationally to develop an evidence-based palliative medicine.
Cancer|Fatigue
DRUG: Melatonin|DRUG: Placebo
Fatigue as Measured by the Physical Fatigue Scale in the The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) (Smets EM, Garssen B, Bonke B, et al., J Psychosom Res 39:315-325, 1995), Primary outcome: Change from baseline to week one in intervention group minus change from baseline to week one in control group.

Because it was a cross-over trial this was calculated the following way:

Outcomes for arm 1 (melatonin then placebo) were calculated as the difference in mean change scores between week 1 and week 2 (scores for day 7 to day 1-scores for day 17 to day 10). Outcomes for arm 2 (placebo then melatonin) were calculated as the difference in mean change scores between week 2 and week 1 (scores for day 17 to day 10-scores for day 7 to day 1).

The physical fatigue scale conists of four item each ranging from one to five. The four item were summed and the scae was converted to 0 to 100, where 100 indicated maximum fatigue., One week
Insomnia Measured by the Insomnia Item in the Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, Primary outcome: Change from baseline to week one in intervention group minus change from baseline to week one in control group.

Because it was a cross-over trial this was calculated the following way:

Outcomes for arm 1 (melatonin then placebo) were calculated as the difference in mean change scores between week 1 and week 2 (scores for day 7 to day 1-scores for day 17 to day 10). Outcomes for arm 2 (placebo then melatonin) were calculated as the difference in mean change scores between week 2 and week 1 (scores for day 17 to day 10-scores for day 7 to day 1).

Insomnia was converted to a 0 til 100 scale according to the scoring manual for EORTC QLQ C15-PAL where 100 indicated maximum insomnia., One week|Emotional Function as Measured by the Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL (Groenvold M, Petersen MA, Aaronson NK, et al, Eur J Cancer 42:55-64, 2006), Change from baseline to week one in intervention group minus change from baseline to week one in control group.

Outcomes for arm 2 (placebo then melatonin) were calculated as the difference in mean change scores between week 2 and week 1 (scores for day 17 to day 10-scores for day 7 to day 1).

Emotional function was converted to a 0 til 100 scale according to the scoring manual for EORTC QLQ C15-PAL where 100 indicated the best possible emotional function.

Pain was converted to a 0 til 100 scale according to the scoring manual for EORTC QLQ C15-PAL where 100 indicated maximum pain.
