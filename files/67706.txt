Implementation of Smoking Cessation Within NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Sites
Evaluate a multi-faceted training program to improve short-term smoking cessation rates (\<14 days post-visit) and short (3 months) and sustained abstinence (6 months) among 1,114 enrolled smokers who present for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening in 26 community-based practices.
Smoking Cessation
OTHER: Personnel Training and Coaching Calls
Percentage of Patients With 7-day Sustained Smoking Abstinence Reported in the Patient Survey, 7-day sustained smoking abstinence will be measured by the question "Have you smoked a cigarette (or other tobacco products), even a puff, in the last 7 days?" in patient survey., 6 months (after baseline)
Salivary Cotinine Test for Non-Smokers, 7-day Sustained Smoking abstinence will be validated using a salivary cotinine test in non smokers. Abstinence will be determined by percentage of smokers whose tests come back negative for cotinine. Low levels of cotinine less than 15 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) would suggest true smoking cessation and levels higher than or equal to 15 mg/mL would suggest they are still smoking., 6 months (after baseline)|Short-term Smoking Abstinence - Patient Survey, Short-tem smoking abstinence will be measured as part of the patient survey as the percentage of patients who report that they have not smoked., 3 months (after baseline)|Total Number of Services Participant Reported Received at 14 Days, Fidelity to the intervention will be measured by a patient survey that asks patients if they received up to 18 cessation services during the screening visit. This is the total each participant reported receiving and can range from 0 to 18, with higher values representing more services., <= 14 days after baseline
We utilize an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, employing a cluster, randomized control trial of community-based NCORP sites to study the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention to improve smoking cessation among lung cancer screening patients, as well as dissemination and implementation (D\&I) science to optimize and accelerate translation of findings into clinical practice. We will: (1) Evaluate a multi-faceted training program to improve short-term smoking cessation rates (1-week post-visit) and sustained abstinence (6 months) among 1,114 enrolled smokers (557 in each trial arm) who present for LDCT lung cancer screening in community-based lung cancer screening practices; (2) Characterize the adoption and adaptation of the evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in 26 community-based LDCT lung cancer screening programs; and (3) Develop and evaluate an implementation toolkit for integrating evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in community-based LDCT lung cancer screening programs. Qualitative data will be collected from key informants at participating screening programs during and after intervention implementation. Quantitative survey data (baseline, \<14 days, 3 months, and 6 months) and saliva specimens (6 months only) will be collected from smoking patients receiving screening within these programs.
