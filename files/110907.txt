Study of Escalating Doses of INA03 Administered Intravenously as Single Agent in Adult Patients With Relapse/Refractory Acute Leukemia
This Phase 1 Study is an open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation, safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation study of INA03 administered as a single agent IV infusion every 2 weeks to patients ≥18 years of age with R/R AML, MLL, or ALL.

The study will be performed in 2 parts: a Dose Titration for Day 1 study (Part 1) followed by a Dose Escalation Part (Part 2) of INA03 used as monotherapy.

DRUG: INA03 administration
Determination of the minimal erythroblastopenia-inducing dose (MEID) for INA03 in adults with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia, MEID defined as the lowest dose associated with the risks of residual erythroblasts in the bone marrow at 2 weeks from initial dosing or grade 2 or above non hematologic toxicity within 2 weeks from initial dosing, within 2 weeks from initial dosing|Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for subsequent administrations (D15 from initial dosing and beyond) for INA03 in adults with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for subsequent administrations (D15 from initial dosing and beyond), 28 days from the first administration of INA03
Safety of INA03: NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Safety from the findings of reports of adverse events based on incidence, severity (as graded by the NCI-CTCAE v5.0), cumulative nature of treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs), Until 30 days after last dose|pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INA03, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) will be calculated, as appropriate, From initial dosing day to Day 42|pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INA03, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be calculated, as appropriate, From initial dosing day to Day 42|pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of INA03, The terminal half-life will be calculated, as appropriate, From initial dosing day to Day 42|pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of INA03, PD according to variation of erythroblast and blasts decrease using bone marrow as-pirate (BMA), and blood samples before and under treatment, From screening to end of study visit (maximum 182 days)|Concentration of anti-INA03 antibodies, Serum concentration of anti-INA03 antibodies in micrograms per milliliter, From screening to end of study visit (maximum 182 days)|Preliminary clinical response of INA03, Clinical response as defined by European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 recommendations, from the date of treatment initiation (Day-1) to the date of relapse, progression or death, whichever comes first (a maximum 182 days)
