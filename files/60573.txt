To Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Furmonertinib Versus Placebo, in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive Stage II-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Following Complete Tumour Resection With or Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy and safety of Furmonertinib (AST2818) versus placebo in patients with stage II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with centrally confirmed, most common sensitising EGFR mutations (Ex19Del and L858R) either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations as confirmed by a central test, who have had complete tumour resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Drug: Furmonertinib 80 mg|DRUG: Furmonertinib 80 mg placebo
DFS, Disease free survival, From date of randomization until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence). Estimated median time to event of 60 months for those treatment) [ Time Frame: Up to 5 years]
Disease free survival (DFS) rate, Disease free survival (DFS) rate at 2, 3 and 5 years, Time Frame: From date of randomization until date of disease recurrence or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence)Estimated median time to event of 60 months for those treatment[ Time Frame: Up to 5 years]|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of death due to any cause, Time Frame: From date of randomization until date of death due to any cause Estimated median time to event of 60 months for those treatment[ Time Frame: Up to 5 years]|Overall Survival rate at 5 years, Defined as the proportion of patients alive at 5 years, estimated from a Kaplan Meier plot of OS at the time of the primary analysis, Time Frame: From date of randomization until date of death due to any cause about 5years[ Time Frame: Up to 5 years]
