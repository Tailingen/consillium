PH 2 ADI-PEG 20 Study in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Subjects Who Have Failed Prior Systemic Therapy
Certain cancers require the amino acid arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is an enzyme from microbes that degrade arginine. ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol and has been used to treat patients that have cancers that have arginine. In this study, the primary efficacy variable will be assessment of tumor response rate.
