18F-DOPA-PET in Non-tumoral and Tumoral Brain Lesions
Background: 3,4-dihydroxy-6-\[18F\]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) can identify well low and high grade brain tumors. However, increased FDOPA uptake has been reported in non-tumoral brain lesions. The aim was to analyse FDOPA-PET in patients with non-tumoral brain lesions and to compare them with patients with (low and high grade) brain tumors.

Methods: retrospective analyse. Patients consecutively recruited with suspected primary brain tumor (based on clinical and MRI findings) referred for FDOPA-PET at Nimes university Hospital between June 2015 and June 2019. FDOPA-PET parameters (maximum and mean lesion standardized uptake values \[SUV\] and ratios comparing lesion with different background uptake SUV) and thresholds were analysed in search for those offering optimal discrimination between non-tumoral and tumoral lesions.
