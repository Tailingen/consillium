E7080 Food Effect Study in Healthy Subjects
This will be a randomized, single-dose, open-label, two-period crossover study in 16 healthy subjects. The study will consist of two phases: Pre-randomization and Randomization. The Pre-randomization phase will have two periods: Screening and Baseline. In the Randomization Phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two possible treatment sequences (fed/fasted and fasted/fed). In each period, subjects will receive a single capsule containing 10 mg lenvatinib either with or without a standard breakfast. There will be a 2-week washout between treatments.
