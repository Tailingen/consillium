A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) With or Without Lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) as First Line (1L) Intervention in a Programmed Cell Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Selected Population With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) (MK-7902-010/LEAP-010)-China Extension
This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with or without lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) as a first line intervention in a PD-L1 selected population with participants with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Hypotheses include:

* Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab + placebo with respect to Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR).
* Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab + placebo with respect to Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.
* Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab + placebo with respect to overall survival (OS).
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR based on modified RECIST 1.1 were reported., Up to approximately 33 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD., Up to approximately 33 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 33 months
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death., Up to approximately 33 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. Number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 52 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study., Up to approximately 52 months
The MK-7902-010-China Extension Study will include participants previously enrolled in China in the global study for MK-7902-010 (NCT04199104) plus those enrolled during the China extension enrollment period.
