Frailty Score and Postoperative Morbidity in Colorectal Cancer Surgery
This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the independent predictive value of the Edmonton Frailty Index (EFI) in estimating postoperative morbidity among older patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. Frailty, characterized by a decline in physiological reserves and increased vulnerability to stressors, has been recognized as a stronger predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes than chronological age alone. While the relationship between frailty and surgical outcomes has been extensively investigated in general surgical populations, data specifically focusing on patients with colorectal cancer remain limited.

In this study, patients aged 65 years and older scheduled for elective colorectal cancer surgery will undergo preoperative frailty assessment using the validated Edmonton Frailty Index (EFI). Postoperative complications, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total hospital stay, and 30-day adverse outcomes, including mortality, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and the need for reoperation, will be recorded and analyzed.

The primary objective is to determine whether frailty, as measured by the Edmonton Frailty Index, serves as an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity in this specific patient population. Secondary objectives include exploring associations between frailty and intraoperative variables such as blood loss, fluid administration, and vasopressor requirements.

By addressing this gap, the study aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the routine incorporation of frailty assessment into preoperative risk stratification protocols for older patients with colorectal cancer. The ultimate goal is to enhance perioperative risk assessment, optimize perioperative care, and improve patient outcomes.
Postoperative Complications|Colorectal Cancer|Frailty
Postoperative Complication Rate (Clavien-Dindo ≥ Grade II) Postoperative Complication Rate (Clavien-Dindo ≥ Grade II), The primary outcome is the incidence of postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery, classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification System (Grade II and above). The relationship between preoperative frailty status, measured using the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS), and the development of postoperative complications will be assessed., 30 days after surgery
Postoperative Mortality, All-cause mortality within 30 days after surgery, assessed in relation to preoperative frailty status measured by Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS)., 30 days after surgery|Length of Hospital Stay, Total length of postoperative hospital stay (in days), compared across frailty categories based on Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS) scores., From surgery to hospital discharge (up to 30 days)|ICU Admission and Length of Stay, Requirement for ICU admission and duration of ICU stay (in days), analyzed in relation to preoperative frailty status., From surgery to hospital discharge (up to 30 days)|Surgical Site Infection, Incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) within 30 days after surgery, compared between frail and non-frail patients based on the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS)., 30 days after surgery|Unplanned Reoperation, Incidence of unplanned reoperations within 30 days after surgery, related to preoperative frailty score., 30 days after surgery|Unplanned Readmission, Incidence of unplanned readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge, compared across frailty groups., 30 days after discharge|Functional Decline, Change in functional status from preoperative baseline to 30 days postoperatively, assessed using the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. Comparison will be made between frail and non-frail patients based on the Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS)., Baseline to 30 days after surgery|Postoperative Delirium, Incidence of postoperative delirium during hospitalization, identified using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and stratified by frailty category (frail vs non-frail)., During hospital stay (up to 14 days)
