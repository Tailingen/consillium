A Study to Determine Number of Patients Who Develop High Ammonia Levels After Receiving Recombinant Erwinia Asparaginase
This study evaluates the incidence of symptomatic hyperammonemia (high ammonia levels) in patients being treated with recombinant Erwinia asparaginase.
Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm|Acute Lymphobkastic Leukemia
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Incidence of patients who develop hyperammonemia, Assessed by measuring ammonia levels via blood test. Baseline ammonia level will be determined around the time of consent. During the first two recombinant Erwinia asparaginase (Rylaze®) courses, there will be two blood draws per week. Each course of recombinant Erwinia asparaginase (Rylaze®) lasts for two weeks, so there will be four blood draws per course., Up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine incidence of patients who develop hyperammonemia secondary to recombinant Erwinia asparaginase.

II. To characterize patients at risk for hyperammonemia secondary to recombinant Erwinia asparaginase.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo blood sample collection, complete surveys, and have their medical records reviewed on study.
