A Safety and Efficacy Study of Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced (Unresectable) Chondrosarcoma
IPI-926 is an inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway. IPI-926 may improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with Chondrosarcoma.
Conventional Chondrosarcoma
DRUG: IPI-926|DRUG: Placebo Arm
Progression Free Survival (PFS), * To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma administered IPI-926 or placebo.
* Number of Incidence of reported adverse events and abnormal laboratory test results. To evaluate the safety of IPI-926 or placebo in patients with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma, estimated 6 months
Comparison of Time To Progression (TTP), \*To compare, Time To Progression (TTP) with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma patients administered IPI-926 or placebo, estimated 6 months|Comparison of Overall Survival (OS), To compare Overall Survival (OS) with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma patients administered IPI-926 or placebo, estimated 6 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), To compare Overall Response Rate (ORR) with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma patients administered IPI-926 or placebo, estimated 6 months
Study IPI-926-04 is a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of IPI-926 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced (unresectable) chondrosarcoma. The study includes an optional cross-over to open-label IPI-926 for patients randomly assigned to placebo who experience documented disease progression.
