A Study Evaluating SYHX2005 in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human study with the SYHX2005 tablet primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SYHX2005 at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid tumors and for whom no standard of care exists. The study will be conducted in two parts: Stage1 dose-escalation and Stage2 dose-expansion. In Stage1, patient enrolment will be proceeded according to a "Accelerated Titration + BOIN" design in order to identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose. In Stage2, preliminary efficacy response will be assessed in patients with advanced solid tumors in use of the recommended dose.
