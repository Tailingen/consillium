Prehabilitation Feasibility Among Older Adults Undergoing Transplantation
This is a pilot feasibility trial among older adults (â‰¥60y) scheduled to undergo Autologous Stem Cell transplantation at UAB. Participants will be randomized into either a prehabilitation program or an attention control group before their transplant. The primary outcomes will be feasibility and secondary outcomes include changes in physical function at the time of transplant and at 12 weeks follow up.
Multiple Myeloma
OTHER: Multi-modal Exercise Regimen|BEHAVIORAL: Dietary Guidelines
Participation rate, Participation rate will be measured as the number of participants agreeing to participate in the study divided by total participants approached for the study., 1 year|Completion rate, Completion rate will be measured as the number of participants completing the study intervention phase (8 weeks) divided by the total number of participants starting the intervention., 1 year|Adherence rate, Adherence rate will be computed Number of participants attending at least 80% of the planned intervention sessions divided by the total number of participants initiating the intervention., 1 year|Acceptability, Acceptability of intervention will be measured using a) 9-item Theoretical Framework of Acceptability Questionnaire which measures participants perspectives on the acceptability of the study intervention. Responses are measured in a likert type scale. and b) a semi-structured interview that will be focused on gathering overall acceptability of the intervention to the participants. Interview questions will be focused on understanding participants perspectives using 7 different proposed constructs of acceptability, i.e affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness and self efficacy., 1 year
Change in Lower Extremity Physical Function, Investigators will measure lower extremity physical function using the Short Physical Performance Battery Scores (SPPB, score 0-12; higher score indicates better physical function) and compare the difference in SPPB scores before and after intervention, 1 year|Change in Functional Exercise Capacity, Investigators will measure functional exercise capacity using 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and compare the difference in 6MWD before and after intervention, 1 year|Change in mobility, Investigators will measure mobility of study participants using the 9-item life space questionnaire (LSQ; score range 0-120, higher scores indicate better mobility) and compare the difference in LSQ before and after intervention, 1 year|Change in functional status, Investigators will measure functional status using the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL/IADL) compare the difference in ADL/IADL scores before and after intervention, 1 year
This is a pilot randomized trial of older adults 60y and above planned to undergo Autologous Stem Cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma. Eligible participants will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to one of two study conditions: 1) an 8 week long home-based prehabilitation exercise program delivered using a telehealth format or 2) an 8-week long nutrition counseling (attention control group). Assessments will occur at baseline, post-intervention (during transplant) and at 12-weeks post-transplant. Investigators will assess the feasibility and acceptability of our program as well as preliminary impact of the program on physical functioning during these time-periods.
