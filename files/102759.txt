First-in-human Study of Oral TP-0184 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
TP-0184 is a potent inhibitor of ALK2 or ACRV1 kinase, a constitutively active serine/threonine receptor kinase due to activating mutations or upregulated upstream signaling pathways. This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study, with a purpose of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-0184 administered once weekly for 4 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TP-0184
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and treatment emergent adverse events, A DLT is defined as any one of the following events observed within Cycle 1 regardless of investigator attribution unless there is a clear alternative explanation:

* Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia
* Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥7 consecutive days
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding or that requires a platelet transfusion
* Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic AEs including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances persisting for more than 48 hours despite optimal medical management
* Dosing delays ≥1 week due to treatment emergent adverse events or related severe laboratory test values, Day 1 - 28|Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), If a patient experiences a DLT, up to three additional patients will be treated at that dose level. If no additional DLTs are observed in the expanded six-patient cohort, the dose will be escalated in a new cohort of three patients. If two or more patients at a given dose level experience a DLT during the first cycle, then the MTD will have been exceeded and up to a total of six patients will be treated at the next lower dose level. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT at this previous lower dose level, this dose will be declared the MTD., 20 months
Recommended Phase 2 Dose of TP-0184, To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-0184, MTD data to be reviewed, 23 months|Determine antitumor activity of TP-0184, Objective radiographic assessment to be performed to determine antitumor activity by modified RECIST criteria, 20 months
Primary Objective:

• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-0184 administered once weekly for 4 weeks, over a range of doses in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To establish the pharmacokinetics of orally administered TP-0184
* To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-0184 by objective radiographic assessment
* To study the pharmacodynamics of TP-0184 therapy
* To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-0184
