Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases From a Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide in treating patients who have leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma.
Brain Tumors|Central Nervous System Tumors|Leptomeningeal Metastases
DRUG: temozolomide
Objective Response, Response will be assessed clinically, cytologically, and radiographically., Every 6 weeks
Pharmacokinetics, Drug levels in cerebrospinal fluid assessed every 6 weeks, Every 6 weeks|Survival, every 6 weeks|Quality of Life, FACT-Br, Baseline, weekly during cycle 1, before each additional cycle
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the objective response rate, survival time, and quality of life of patients with leptomeningeal metastases from a solid tumor or lymphoma when treated with oral temozolomide.
* Determine adverse events related to this regimen in this patient population.
* Measure temozolomide concentrations in CSF and serum and correlate with appropriate pharmacodynamic parameters (e.g., response) in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 10 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR. Patients with a CR except for residual radiographic abnormalities that persist unchanged for 2 full courses continue for 4 courses past best response.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly for the first 4 weeks of therapy, and then monthly thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
