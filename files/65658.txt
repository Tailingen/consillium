Ziconotide for Non-cancer Pain by Intrathecal Administration
Although ziconotide's marketing authorization does not restrict its use to a given type of pain, the drug has been used mainly in cancer patients. Most data on ziconotide-based intrathecal (IT) treatment has therefore been obtained in this population, for whom the drug's place is clearly documented (national and international recommendations).

In contrast the management of non-cancer pain is less straightforward, partly because of the very large range of possible clinical conditions, and the utilization of ziconotide is poorly documented, mainly described in single-centre small series.

Due to the lack of data, physicians are often reluctant to undertake this type of treatment, which may represent a loss of opportunity for patients.

This registry aims at providing information on patients suffering from non-cancer pain refractory to standard therapy, treated by ziconotide-based intrathecal analgesia.

Patients suffering from all types of non-malignant pain will be eligible for the study, including but not limited to spinal cord injury, radiculopathy, failed back surgery, diabetic neuropathy, central pain syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, fibromyalgia.

The collected data will cover the first 2 years of treatment.
