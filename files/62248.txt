The LINFU® U.S. Registry in Patients With IPMN (Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm of the Pancreas)
In this study, LINFU® will be evaluated in patients who have been identified with IPMN to determine if it can be used to help identify early, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its noninvasive precursor lesions (dysplasia). The study will also help determine if LINFU® results in earlier intervention, treatment and improvement in patient outcomes.

The number of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas or their precursor lesions, dysplasia, identified only with LINFU® will be compared to standard screening methods, The total number of asymptomatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified with LINFU® by analysis of pancreatic fluid will be compared to the number of these lesions identified with current screening tests, including EUS, CH-EUS, CEUS, MRI/MRCP, PET/CT, CT, 5 years
The change in size of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU® will be determined over a 5 year period, Patients with early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU® and not detected with other diagnostic tests will be monitored long- term (5 years) by EUS, CH-EUS, CEUS, MRI/MRCP, PET/CT, CT to assess whether these tumors increase in size (measured in mm) and to determine how many require medical or surgical intervention., 5 years|Determine the number of patients with early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU® that require medical or surgical intervention., Patients with early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU® and not detected with other diagnostic tests will be monitored long- term (5 years) by EUS, CH-EUS, CEUS, MRI/MRCP, PET/CT, CT to assess whether these tumors increase how many require medical or surgical intervention., 5 years
Yearly survival rate of patients with early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas or their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU®, Patients will be followed by EUS, CH-EUS, CEUS, MRI/MRCP, PET/CT, CT and yearly survival rates of patients with early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and their noninvasive precursor lesions identified only with LINFU® and not detected with other diagnostic tests will be recorded., 5 years
Adenocyte has developed a proprietary pancreatic cancer detection method, LINFU®, (Low Intensity Non-Focused Ultrasound excitation of the pancreas) that increases the sensitivity of pancreatic juice cytology. LINFU® excitation of circulating microbubbles increases the exfoliation of pancreatic ductal cells. The sensitivity of cytological examination of the pancreatic fluid obtained by LINFU® can also be potentially enhanced by neural network-based computer-assisted analysis.

In this study, LINFU® will be evaluated in patients who have been identified with IPMN to determine if it can be used to help identify early, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its noninvasive precursor lesions (dysplasia) which are not identified with current diagnostic tests. In addition, patients identified with PDAC or precursor lesions only with LINFU® and not detected with other diagnostic tests will be followed long term to determine the progression rate of these tumors and whether LINFU® results in earlier intervention, treatment and improvement in patient outcomes
