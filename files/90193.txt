Assessing the Utility of Tissue Dielectric Constant (TDC) Measurements to Differentiate Breast Cancer From Healthy Breasts
Patients with pending breast biopsies will have the tumor site's tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measured prior to the biopsy. Similar TDC measurements will be made at a standard breast site on the biopsied breast and on mirrored sites on the non-affected breast.

Patients with pending breast biopsies will have the tumor site's tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measured prior to the biopsy. Similar TDC measurements will be made at a standard breast site on the biopsied breast and on mirrored sites on the non-affected breast. Values obtained at the biopsy site will be compared against the outcome of the biopsy analysis: benign vs. malignant. In addition the measurements obtained at the standardized site for all breasts will be used to establish a set of reference values to characterize breast TDC values. In addition, inter-breast differentials will be used to characterize these ranges for future studies and clinical assessments.
