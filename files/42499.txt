FLOX in Combination With Cetuximab in First-line Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
The main objective of this trial is to explore the effect of combining an established chemotherapy regimen (FLOX), based on 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (Eloxatin速), with the EGF receptor antibody cetuximab (Erbitux速) in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The trial will investigate two regimens of FLOX plus cetuximab, in which FLOX is given continuously or intermittently, compared to standard FLOX without cetuximab.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FLOX (5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/oxaliplatin)|DRUG: FLOX (5-fluorouracil/folinic acid/oxaliplatin) and Cetuximab|DRUG: FLOX (5-fluorouracil and folinic acid and oxaliplatin) intermittently and maintenance cetuximab
To compare efficacy, as measured by time to disease progression, of treatment with cetuximab in combination with the FLOX regimen compared to FLOX alone, in first- line treatment of patients with metastatic cororectal cancer, Every 4th cycle
To measure response rates, response duration, secondary surgical curative resection frequency, safety profile, overall survival and quality of life in the treatment groups., Every 2nd week (safety profile)
