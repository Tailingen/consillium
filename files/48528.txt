A Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Carboplatin Plus (+) Nab-Paclitaxel Compared With Carboplatin+Nab-Paclitaxel in Participants With Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This randomized Phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] antibody) in combination with carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel compared with treatment with carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive participants with Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A (Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin) or Arm B (Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin).

SILC questionnaire comprises 3 individual symptoms \& are scored at individual symptom level, thus have a dyspnea score, chest pain score, \& cough score. There are a total of 9 questions in SILC questionnaire, each question has a minimum value of 0 \& maximum value of 4. Each individual symptom score is calculated as average of responses for symptom items. 'Chest pain' score is mean of question 1 \& 2, 'Cough' score is mean of question 3 \& 4 and 'Dyspnea' score is mean of question 5 to 9 in SILC questionnaire. An increase in score is suggestive of a worsening in symptomology.
