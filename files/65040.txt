Pembrolizumab + Radiation for Locally Adv SCC of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) Not Eligible Cisplatin
This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy of Pembrolizumab, concomitant with and following standard of care definitive radiation, for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck patients who are not good candidates for Cisplatin.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy
20 Week Progression Free Survival Rate, the proportion of patients who are alive and free of progression from disease at 20 weeks from the start of treatment, 20 weeks after D1 of treatment|One Year Progression Free Survival Rate, the proportion of patients who are alive and free of progression from disease atoneyears from the start of treatment, 1 years after D1 of treatment|Two Year Progression Free Survival Rate, the proportion of patients who are alive and free of progression from disease at two years from the start of treatment, 2 years after D1 of treatment|Median Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from D1 of treatment to progression or death from any cause. The median was not reached, thus Kaplan Meier's estimated rate at 5 years is reported., up to 5 years after D1 of treatment
One Year Overall Survival Rate, the proportion of patients who are alive at one year after Day 1 of treatment, 1 year after Day 1 of treatment|Two Year Overall Survival Rate, the proportion of patients who are alive at two years after Day 1 of treatment, 2 years after Day 1 of treatment|Proportion of Participants Who Received <95% of Intended Dose of Radiation, Evaluate the safety of the proposed regimen by Estimating the proportion of patients who receive \<95% of the intended dose of radiation (i.e., \<67 Gray), 7 weeks|Number of Participants With Clinically Relevant Adverse Events, Safety was assessed by documenting clinically relevant adverse events, defined as events reported by both the clinician and participant related to concurrent radiation plus pembrolizumab. Clinicians classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0). The grading (severity) scale for each AE term: Grade (G) 1 Mild; asymptomatic/mild symptoms; clinical/diagnostic observations only; G 2 Moderate; G 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; G 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE. Patient assessed toxicity were classified based on the Patient-Reported Outcome version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) which measures the severity, interference, and frequency of events on a 5 point likert scale (0-4) with a higher score indicating worse or more bothersome event, Monitored continuously from D1 of treatment through 40 weeks.|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate will be determined per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) which defines Complete Response (CR) as Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Overall Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR/total number of subjects., 2 years after start of treatment|Complete Response Rate, complete response rate will be determined using RECIST 1.1 and is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a Complete response (CR)-Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node (LN) (whether target or non-target) must have decreased in short axis to \<10mm., 2 years after start of treatment|Five Years Locoregional Recurrence Rate, Time to locoregional recurrence is defined from Day 1 of treatment until the first locoregional progression, 5 years from start of treatment|Five Years Distant Metastasis Rate, Time to distant metastasis is defined as the time from day 1 of treatment to progression of disease at a distant site; deaths or other progressions will be censored, 5 years from start of treatment|Quality of Life Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-HN), The FACT-HN is the FACT-General (FACT-G) and a head and neck cancer specific (HNC) subscale given at baseline, at end of treatment, and at first follow-up visit. The FACT-G is a measure of general QOL with Items rated by patients on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, assessing function in 4 domains: physical well-being (PWB) (7 items, score range 0-28), social-family well-being (SFWB) (7 items, score range 0-28), emotional well-being (EWB) (6 items, score range 0-24) and functional well-being (FWB) (7 items, score range 0-28). The HNC subscale has 12 items and a score range from 0 to 48. Higher scores represent better QOL., At baseline, 10 and 20 weeks after initiation of treatment
This open label, phase II trial will enroll 29 subjects in order to evaluate the efficacy of Pembrolizumab, concomitant with and following standard of care definitive radiation for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head and neck patients who are not good candidates for Cisplatin. Objectives include estimating progression free survival and overall survival, response rates, safety and toxicity, and quality of life in these patients. Correlative studies, based on serial blood collections and tumor samples, may be done under a separate protocol based on availability of archival diagnostic tissue.
