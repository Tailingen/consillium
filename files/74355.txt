Phase 0/1 Biomarker and Pharmacodynamic Study of Roflumilast in Patients With Advanced B-Cell Hematologic Malignancies (CTRC# 13-0013)
This is a Phase 0/1 open-label, non-randomized, biomarker and pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed at least one prior therapy and for whom no standard curative therapy exists. Patients with advanced stage disease are those whose disease is resistant or refractory to standard chemotherapy or biological therapies.
Advanced B-cell Lymphoid Malignancies
DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Roflumilast
Total Number of Adverse Events., Adverse events were listed using CTCAE Version 4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) toxicity grade., Average of 21 days.
This pilot study will evaluate whether the administration of roflumilast inhibits the activity of PDE4 and results in the modulation of AKT/mTOR pathways in patients with B-cell hematologic malignancies. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of determining the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers as related to GC resistance. Samples are obtained at baseline prior to starting study treatment, on Day 8 before the administration of the Day 8 study drugs (prednisone and roflumilast), and on Day 15. If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study treatment or at any time during treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis. Normal PBMC (and bone marrow when it is obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to the inhibition of PDE4 and potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance. Biomarker blood samples will be analyzed in order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone and in combination with prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT, phosphorylation levels of mTOR targets.
