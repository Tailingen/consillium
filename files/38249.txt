Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.

PROCEDURE: computed tomography|PROCEDURE: positron emission tomography|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy

Rate of acute and late treatment-related toxicity related to specific symptoms, including gastrointestinal, cardiac, neurologic, hemorrhagic, and pulmonary symptoms|Toxicity|Patterns of failure and overall survival at 2 years|Measurement of pre-treatment and post-treatment PET scan standardized uptake values and correlation of this data with local control at 1 and 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the central lung region (peri-mediastinum) in patients with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I)
* Determine local control and time to local progression in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)
* Evaluate the ability of peak standardized uptake values (SUV) for fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET scan, obtained shortly after SBRT (post-treatment), to predict local control and time to progression in these patients.

Secondary

* Evaluate the ability of maximum SUV for FDG-PET scan, obtained shortly after SBRT, to predict long-term local control and time to progression in these patients.
* Evaluate the ability of peak SUV and max SUV for FDG-PET scan, obtained prior to SBRT, to predict local control and time to progression in these patients.
* Determine the utility of PET/CT scan data in guiding treatment planning.
* Determine if treatment with radiotherapy involving high biological doses with limited treatment volume using these SBRT techniques achieves acceptable treatment-related toxicity.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study.

* Phase I: Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 3 times within a 2-week time frame.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of hypofractionated SBRT until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

* Phase II: Patients undergo hypofractionated SBRT at the MTD as in phase I. In both phases, patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET/CT scans at baseline and at 12-16 weeks after completion of SBRT.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
