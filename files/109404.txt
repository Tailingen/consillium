A Phase I Study of ZN-d5 in Chinese Subjects With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A phase I dose-escalation, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ZN-d5 in Chinese subjects with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: ZN-d5
Safety monitoring, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0, until 30 days after the last dose of study drug|DLT, Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in DLT evaluable subjects, at the end of Cycle 1
Effacy Evaluation, Efficacy as defined by the 2014 Lugano response criteria, up to 24 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], Plasma PK parameters of ZN-d5, up to 24 months
For the Phase I dose escalation study of ZN-d5, it is planned that after the starting dose, subsequent dose assignments will be made by means of a model-assisted design, until the MTD or RP2D is determined in the Chinese population.
