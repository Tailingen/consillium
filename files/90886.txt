This is a phase 1b/II clinical trial using a fixed recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD24Fc to explore the safety and efficacy of combining CD24Fc with ipilimumab and nivolumab to reduce the toxicity of immunotherapy combination, in patients who are na√Øve to anti-PD1/L1 based checkpoint inhibitors. The dosing of nivolumab and ipilimumab will be fixed at FDA approved levels for each indication. Dosing of the drugs will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met. Patients who complete 12 months on study treatment and demonstrate clinical benefit with manageable toxicity will be given the opportunity to continue treatment for another 12 months upon agreement between investigator and drug manufacturers.
