Preoperative Hyperthermia in Major Abdominal Surgery Patients
The investigators hypothesize that preoperative hyperthermia improves postoperative complications and compare a placebo group with standard thermoregulatory management (normothermia) to a treatment group receiving 2,5 hours of hyperthermia (38.5-39.5 °C core temperature) in a randomized, single blinded, controlled trial.
