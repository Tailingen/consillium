Anti-EGFR Therapy Rechallenge in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
A-REPEAT (Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor -EGFR- rechallenge and plasma genotyping of patients with advanced colorectal tumors) is a Greek, investigator-initiated, single arm open-label phase II study of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Patients with a metastatic, histologically proven colorectal carcinoma RAS wild type will be treated with a combination of panitumumab and third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX,FOLFIRI or irinotecan monotherapy).
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab
Evaluation of overall response rate of the addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line therapy, Evaluation of efficacy of overall response rate, of the addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initially treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agents., At baseline, every 8 weeks with a 2-week tumor evaluation window through study completion, an average of 30 months.

Few clinical studies have evaluated the role of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in metastatic colorectal cancer patients and there is no prospective clinical trial assessing the activity of treatment rechallenge with panitumumab-based therapy after initial progression. This study aims at exploring the concept of evolution and expansion of RAS wild type clones in order to restore sensitivity of the tumor to prior anti-EGFR therapy after a time interval in which a different, non-anti-EGFR second-line therapy is administered. Based on aforementioned data, it is hypothesized that rescue through rechallenge with panitumumab-based third-line therapy combined with chemotherapy could be associated with further response and clinical benefit. A significant component of the proposed prospective trial is exploratory translational: cell free plasma and platelet-based genotyping for genetic mutations in different time points will be undertaken in order to study the genetic composition of the metastatic tumour at initiation of and at progression through, anti-EGFR rechallenge therapy.

Primary endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of overall response rate, of the addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initially treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agents.

Exploratory endpoints include to identify, in the context of translational research, tumour tissue and blood-based biomarkers with prognostic/predictive significance in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with rechallenge panitumumab in combination with standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, who were initially treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agent.
