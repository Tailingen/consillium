Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine in Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to see what effects trastuzumab in combination with vinorelbine has on breast cancer when the participant has circulating tumor cells that are positive for the protein called HER2. Trastuzumab is an FDA approved drug that targets HER2. The drug combination of trastuzumab and vinorelbine is an effective treatment for patients with breast cancers that are positive for HER2. This trial seeks to determine if the combination can also benefit participants whose original breast cancer was HER2 negative but whose circulating tumor cells are HER2 positive.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, on trt every 6 weeks (wks) for the first 18 wks and then every 12 wks; Median (range) trt duration was 12 weeks (3-67).
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR was defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. SD needed to be a minimum 24 weeks in duration, Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, on trt every 6 weeks (wks) for the first 18 wks and then every 12 wks; Median (range) trt duration was 12 weeks (3-67).|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study or death. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions or not evaluated., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, on trt every 6 weeks (wks) for the first 18 wks and then every 12 wks and within 2 wks off-study; Median follow-up was 2.7 months.|Baseline Level of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), CTCs levels were determined based on established methods., Assessed at baseline
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of trastuzumab and vinorelbine in patients with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 negative primary tumors and HER2 positive circulating tumor cells.

Secondary

* To describe the number of CTCs and the CTCs characteristics before and after therapy, and to explore the correlation of these findings with response.
* To further characterize the safety and tolerability.
* To evaluate progression-free survival.
* To evaluate clinical benefit rate \[complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)+stable disease (SD)\>24 weeks\].

Exploratory

* To determine the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling on circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
