Fertility Preservation Surgery|Ovarian Malignancy
DRUG: GnRHa
the content of FSH(mIU/mL), LH(mIU/mL), E2(pmol/L), P(nmol/L), T(nmol/L) and PRL(nmol/L), by monitoring six above-mentioned hormones preoperatively and postoperatively, the ovarian function is evaluated, 1 year during the perioperative period|the volume of ovary(cm*cm*cm), by monitoring the change of ovarian form and volume, we evaluate the physical ovarian transformation, 1 year during the perioperative period|the ovulating period, by comparing the ovulating period perioperatively and postoperatively between two groups, we assess the GnRHa effect on the reproductive function, 1 year during the perioperative period
20 patients with ovarian maligancies are anticipated to be enrolled in this study within 2 years. With their permission, they will be randomized into the control group and the experimental group when the latter is supposed to receive GNRHa preoperatively and postoperatively. And their physical and endocrinic indexes will be monitored. The effect of extra use of GnRHa will be observed by comparing these two groups' outcomes.
