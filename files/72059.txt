Allogeneic Gamma-delta T Cells Combined With Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy in a Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Resistant to PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic γδ T cells combined with targeted therapy and PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma resistant to PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

This is a double-arm, single-center, randomized, open label phase I clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of ex-vivo expanded allogeneic γδ T cells plus targeted therapy and PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with BCLC stage B or C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A typical 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used to determine the optimal dose level of γδ T cells based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The initial infusion dose level will start from 1×10\^8/kg to 4×10\^8/kg in every 3 weeks.
