A Phase I Trial of Alloreactive Cell Infusion Following Transplantation of Haplotype Cells in Patients With Myeloid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of alloreactive NK cells that can be transfused following stem cell transplant.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Leukemia, Lymphoid|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic
DEVICE: CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System
Investigate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of highly-purified alloreactive NK cells infused following haplotype-mismatched, KIR ligand-mismatched transplants in patients with refractory hematological malignancies., through Day 128
Assess toxicity associated with the infusion of alloreactive NK cells, through Day 128|Assess the risk of acute and chronic GvHD following infusion of alloreactive NK cells., through Day 128|Assess the feasibility of multiple harvesting and purifying NK cells to the relatively high-doses., through Day 128|Describe the frequency and type of infections occurring within the first year following transplantation., through Day 128|Describe immune reconstitution following transplantation., through Day 128
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of alloreactive NK cells that can be transfused following stem cell transplant.
