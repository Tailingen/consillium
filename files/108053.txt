The study is conducted in two parts. The dose escalation portion of the trial subjects are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of HuMax-TF-ADC in 21 day treatment cycles.

In the Cohort Expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose of HuMax-TF-ADC as determined in Part 1
