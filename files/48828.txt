An Open-Labeled, Extended-Use of XERECEPT (hCRF) for Patients in Studies NTI 0302, 0303, or Other Designated Studies
The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term safety and tolerability of human corticotropin-releasing factor (hCRF), XERECEPT®, in patients requiring dexamethasone (Decadron) to treat peritumoral brain edema. This open-label, extended-use study is open to all patients who participate in either of the blinded studies, NTI 0302, NTI 0303, or other designated studies, including patients who may have discontinued blinded study medication early but completed the protocol-stipulated follow-up periods.

DRUG: hCRF [XERECEPT (corticorelin acetate injection)]
Long Term Safety and Tolerability of hCRF, Number of patients reporting adverse events, Prospective
XERECEPT® is not a potential treatment for cancer, but may reduce the edema associated with tumors and as a result, decrease neurological symptoms.
