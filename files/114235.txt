Efficacy and Safety Study of Combination of CPGJ602 and Chemotherapy, in First Line, With Wild KRAS/NRAS/BRAF in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of CPGJ602 and chemotherapy in subjects with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CPGJ602|DRUG: cetuximab
Best of Response (BOR), Defined as the percentage of patients whose overall response is CR or PR from day 1 to 16th week of study and maintain at least until efficacy confirmation assessment (4 weeks ± 2 days), per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by BIRC., for 16 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the interval from the date of randomization until first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed based on tumor assessments according to RECIST v1.1 per BICR and Investigator., for 16 weeks|BOR Assessed by investigator, for 16 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of patients whose overall response is CR, PR and SD from day 1 to 16th week and maintain at least until efficacy confirmation assessment (4 weeks ± 2 days), per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by BIRC and Investigator., for 16 weeks|unConfirmed BOR at the end of 16th week by BICR and Investigator., Defined as the percentage of patients whose overall response is CR or PR from day 1 to 16th week per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by BIRC and Investigator., for 16 weeks|Time to Tumor Response (TTR), Defined as the time from the first dose study treatment until the date of the first assessment of confirmed CR or PR, assessed by BICR and Investigator, for 16 weeks|Deepness of Response (DpR), The relative change in the sum of longest diameters of RECIST target lesions at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions or progression of non-target lesions, when compared with baseline assessed by BIRC and Investigator, for 16 weeks
This is an open label, randomized, positive control, phase II study to treat subjects with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. The patients will be randomized into three arms consist of CPGJ602 (2 weeks/cycle) + mFOLFOX6, CPGJ602 (1 week/cycle) + mFOLFOX6, and cetuximab (1 week/cycle) + mFOLFOX6 at a ratio of 2:2:1. This study is conduct to assess the efficacy and safety of three treatments for patients.
