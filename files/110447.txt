JAK1 Inhibitor Ivarmacitinib Reversing Immunotherapy Resistance in TNBC
This is a prospective, open-label, randomized phase II clinical study which recruits unresectable recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer resistant to immunotherapy.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ivarmacitinib|DRUG: Camrelizumab (SHR-1210)|DRUG: Eribulin
Safety run-in: Incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Incidence rate of DLT will be evaluated in participants in the Safety Run-In, who will be followed for protocol-defined DLT events up to 21±3 days after the first dose of Ivarmacitinib + Camrelizumab + Eribulin., 21±3 days|Safety run-in: adverse events (AEs), Incidence rate of AEs of any cause will be evaluated in participants in the Safety Run-In according to CTCAE v5.0., 21±3 days|Safety run-in: Serious adverse events (SAEs), Incidence rate of SAEs of any cause will be evaluated in participants in the Safety Run-In according to CTCAE v5.0., 21±3 days|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) according to RECIST v1.1., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 12 months.
Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of participants with CR and PR as the best overall response., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 12 months.|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause). Participants without reported events are censored at the last disease evaluation., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 12 months.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS based on Kaplan-Meier methodology will be defined as the time from randomization until the identification of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects without disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 12 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants alive are censored at the last date of contact (including lost-to-follow-up) or at the date of withdrawal of consent, if relevant., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 24 months.|Treatment-Related Toxicity Rate, The percentage of participants who experienced any grade treatment-related adverse event based on the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse events Version 5.0 (CTCAEv5) as reported on case report forms., The observation period related to this endpoint is up to 12 months.
This is a prospective, open-label, randomized phase II clinical study. The purpose of this study is to test the combination of the JAK1 inhibitor Ivarmacitinib and the PD-1 inhibitor Camrelizumab in patients with immunotherapy-resistant locally advanced inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The study included a safety run-in period to explore the safety of Ivarmacitinib in combination with Eribulin and Camrelizumab, which will provide a recommended dose for the triplet combination of Ivarmacitinib, Camrelizumab and Eribulin. The latter phase II period is set to compare the efficacy of the triplet combination of Ivarmacitinib, Camrelizumab and Eribulin versus Eribulin plus Ivarmacitinib.
