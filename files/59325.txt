Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of CC-92328 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), clinical study of CC-92328 will explore the safety, tolerability and preliminary biological and clinical activity of CC-92328 as a single-agent in the setting of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). The study will be conducted in two parts: monotherapy dose escalation (Part A) and monotherapy dose expansion (Part B).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CC-92328
Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Are defined as toxicities that meet the protocol-specified criteria occurring within the DLT assessment window (Cycle 1, Days 1 to 28) except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes., Up to 28 days after the first dose|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Defined as the highest dose at which less than 33% of the population treated with CC-92328 experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle and at least 6 evaluable participants have been treated at this dose level., Up to 12 weeks after the last dose|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Type, frequency, seriousness, severity and relationship of AEs to CC-92328., Up to 12 weeks after the last dose
