Minimally INvasive Colon Cancer Surgery Through IMmunomics and Optical Mapping of the Sentinel Lymph Node.
The project investigates the feasibility of laparoscopic fluorescent imaging for the intraoperative detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in colon cancer patients. In addition, the topology of immunological and microenvironmental changes in normal and invaded lymph nodes (LN's) will be correlated to the LN location (anatomical mapping).

Tumor status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and other lymph nodes (LN's), All LN in the resection specimen will be collected, mapped, and labeled. The SLN is defined as fluorescent hotspot that appears after injection of the tracer. Standard H\&E staining will be performed on LN sections and all mapped LN (including the SLN) will be analyzed for their tumor status., up to 1 month after surgery
Immunological markers, Single cell suspensions will be prepared from all LN (including the SLNs) and the primary tumor. Cell suspensions will be analyzed for cytotoxic CD8+ CD45RO+T cells, CD4+ T helper cells, dendritic cell subsets (DC), natural killer (NK) cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by multicolor fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based immuno-panels. FACS is technique to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells and provides quantifiable data., up to 12 months after surgery
