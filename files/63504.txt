CD7 CAR T-Cell Therapy for r/r T-cell Lymphomas
This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial. Refractory/relapse T-NHL patients are treated with autologous and allogeneic CD7 CAR T-cell therapy. The primary objective is to prospectively evaluate the safety of CD7 CAR T cell bridging to HSCT in the treatment of r/r T-NHL. The primary endpoint is the type and incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within 21 days after CD7 CAR-T cell infusion. A total of 36 subjects is estimated to be enrolled.
T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL and CTCL)
DRUG: CD7 CAR-T cells infusion
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Incidence and type of dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) within 21 days of CD7 CAR-T infusion., 21 days|Adverse events (AEs), Total number, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) within 21 days of CD7 CAR-T infusion., 21 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The assessment of ORR by dose group at 21 and 90 Days after CD7 CAR T infusion., 21, 90 days|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the date when CR response criteria are first met to the date of relapse or death caused by T-NHL in the absence of documented relapse, up to 2 years
