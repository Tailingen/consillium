Effectiveness and Safety of Therapy Based on Attenuated ATO Plus Low-Dose ATRA in Patients With APL
ATRA is the standard of care for all patients with APL. The use of lower doses of ATRA has been shown since the 1990s to achieve therapeutic efficacy with doses of 25mg/m2/day. ATO demonstrated considerable effectiveness in this disease. More recently, an attenuated regimen has been proven to be effective. In this study we intent to demonstrate the effectiveness of combined therapy of low-dose ATRA plus attenuated dose ATO.
Promyelocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Arsenic trioxide|DRUG: all-trans retinoic acid
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Safety will be defined by the number of patients deceased after 1 induction cycle of 28 days, 28 days
Overall response, Overall response rate was definide as partial response plus complete response after 1, 28 days|Progression-free survival, Time from achievement of complete hematologic remission to relapse, 6 months|Event-free survival, Time from registration to induction failure, relapse, or death., 6 months|Rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity., Rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity., 28 days
The use of lower doses of ATRA has been shown since the 1990s to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations sufficient to achieve therapeutic efficacy with doses of 25mg/m2/day. ATO alone demonstrated considerable effectiveness in this disease. More recently, an attenuated regimen has been proven to be effective in inducing similar remission rates and achieving prolonged survival, also demonstrating a reduction in associated toxicities, mainly hepatic and cardiac when using this new scheme.

The investigators will conduct a phase 1/2, non-randomized, single center, non-comparative clinical trial to demonstrate the effectiveness of combined therapy of low-dose ATRA plus attenuated dose ATO which is accessible to a population with limited resources while maintaining acceptable efficacy and safety.
