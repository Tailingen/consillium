The Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics Of JS207 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumor
This is a Phase I open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),Pharmacodynamic characteristics, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of JS207 in patients with advanced malignant tumor. The Recommended dose for phase II trial （RP2D） will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics.
