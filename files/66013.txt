Bioinformation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this study is the synergistic effect of cancer ablation and life information rehabilitation therapy on unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: Cancer ablation|DRUG: Life information rehabilitation therapy
Relief degree of tumors, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, The duration between treatment and cancer recurrence, 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, The duration between treatment and patient pass away, 3 years
By enrolling patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the synergistic effect of cancer ablation and life information rehabilitation therapy. The efficacy will be evaluated according to local relief degree, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
