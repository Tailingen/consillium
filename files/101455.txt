Proteiomic Fingerprints of Gastric Juice
No accurate, inexpensive and non-invasive test for gastric cancer screening is currently available. The investigators' recent study identified a1-antitrypsin and other proteins as potential biomarkers of gastric cancer in gastric juice. The aim of this study was to develop a novel non-invasive modality for detecting gastric cancer by measurement of biomarkers in gastric juice.
Gastric Cancer
OTHER: normal subject|OTHER: gastric cancer
Number of Participants With Accurate Diagnosis for Gastric Cancer, Normal subject group: number of the subjects with normal alpha 1-antitrypsin level in gastric juice Gastric cancer group: number of the subjects with elevated alpha 1-antitrypsin level in gastric juice, 2 months
Patients and methods: The study consisted of two parts: (1) investigating the differences in gastric juice biomarker concentrations between gastric cancer patients and controls, and (2) screening gastric cancer using string test to obtain gastric juice followed by immunoassay for biomarker concentration.
