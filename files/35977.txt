The Safety of Intravenous Tranexamic Acid in Patients Undergoing Supratentorial Meningiomas Resection
Growing evidence of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) being used to reduce blood loss and blood transfusions in various guidelines. However, the adverse effects of TXA especially seizure has always been a problem of concern, especially in neurosurgery. Therefore, this study aims to provide a scientific evidence for the safety of TXA in supratentorial meningiomas resection patients.
Seizures|Meningioma
DRUG: Tranexamic acid|DRUG: 0.9% saline
Early postoperative seizures within 7 days, Postoperative seizures were defined as a transient occurrence of involuntary movements, abnormal sensory phenomena, or an altered mental status that could not otherwise be explained., Within 7 days after surgery
The incidence of non-epileptic complications, Including intracranial hematoma, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute kidney infarction, anaemia, and infection., Within 7 days after the intervention|Estimated intraoperative blood loss, Estimated intraoperative blood loss = collected blood volume in the suction canister (ml) - volume of flushing (ml) + volume from gauze tampon (ml)., During surgery|The changes in haemoglobin concentrations, The changes in haemoglobin concentrations between baseline and end of surgery., During surgery|The intraoperative blood transfusion volume and rate, The intraoperative blood transfusion volume and rate., During surgery|The intraoperative cell saver volume and rate, The intraoperative cell saver volume and rate., During surgery
