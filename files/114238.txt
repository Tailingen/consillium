Study of Romiplostim for Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia in Adult Subjects With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Ovarian Cancer, or Breast Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim for the treatment of CIT in patients receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer measured by the ability to administer on-time, full-dose chemotherapy
Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: Romiplostim|DRUG: Placebo
Incidence of either a chemotherapy dose delay or reduction, No thrombocytopenia-induced modification of any myelosuppressive agent in the second and third cycles of the planned on-study chemotherapy regimen. Thrombocytopenia-induced modifications include chemotherapy dose reduction, delay, omission, or chemotherapy treatment discontinuation due to platelet counts below 100 x 109/L, 48 days

This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international study for the treatment of CIT in adult subjects receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer. Subjects must have a platelet count ≤ 85 x 10\^9/L on day 1 of the study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period long enough to allow for assessment of 3 planned cycles of chemotherapy, a follow-up visit, and long-term follow-up (LTFU). Given that subjects are required to have 3 remaining planned cycles of chemotherapy, the chemotherapy cycles may be 3 or 4 weeks in duration, and the investigational product dose adjustment guidelines allow for up to 12 weeks of dosing before a subject is declared a non-responder, the majority of study subjects will receive investigational product for a range of 10-24 weeks.
