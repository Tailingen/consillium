A Pilot "Window-3" Study of Acalabrutinib Plus Rituximab Followed by Brexucabtagene Autoleucel Therapy in Patients With Previously Untreated High-risk Mantle Cell Lymphoma
To learn if giving acalabrutinib, rituximab, and brexucabtagene autoleucel to patients with previously untreated high-risk mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) can help to control the disease.
Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab|OTHER: Brexucabtagene Autoleucel|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate
Incidence of adverse events, Unacceptable toxicity is defined as any grade 3 or higher treatment related toxicities happened within 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. Will monitor the unacceptable toxicity for two patient cohorts together using the Bayesian stopping boundaries calculated based on beta-binomial distribution. The regimen will be considered excessively toxic if the unacceptable toxicity rate at 30 days after CAR T infusion is above 30%. Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables such as toxicity type/severity., Within 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

To determine the safety profile of the acalabrutinib plus rituximab combination followed by CAR T-cell therapy in newly diagnosed high risk MCL patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

To evaluate efficacy measured by complete response (CR) rate and progression free survival (PFS) of the acalabrutinib plus rituximab combination followed by CAR T-cell therapy in newly diagnosed high risk MCL patients.
