A Brentuximab Vedotin Trial for Patients Who Have Previously Participated in a Brentuximab Vedotin Study
This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) in patients who have previously participated in an brentuximab vedotin study.
Disease, Hodgkin|Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: brentuximab vedotin
Objective Response Rate by Investigator, Percentage of participants in the retreatment arm who achieved a best response of complete remission (CR, disappearance of all evidence of disease) or partial remission (PR, regression of greater than or equal to 50% of measurable disease and no new sites) per Cheson 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., Up to approximately 38 months|Adverse Events by Severity, Seriousness, and Relationship to Treatment, Counts of participants who had adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE, defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose on SGN35-006). Serious adverse events are reported from the time of informed consent. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 3.0) were used to assess severity (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life threatening/disabling, 5=death). Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category are counted once within the category., up to 39 months|Laboratory Abnormalities >/= Grade 3, Counts of study participants with post-baseline laboratory abnormalities of Grade 3 or greater per NCI CTCAE version 3.0. Participants with multiple occurrences of a laboratory abnormality within a category are counted once in that category., Up to 39 months
Duration of Objective Response by Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Duration of objective response (CR + PR) on retreatment, defined as time of initial response until disease progression or death, Up to 38 months|Progression-free Survival by Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Progression-free survival, defined as time from start of study treatment in the retreatment arm to disease progression per investigator or death due to any cause, Up to approximately 29 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival for both extension and retreatment arms, defined as time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 41 months|Incidence of Antitherapeutic Antibodies, Counts of participants with anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies at any time during extension treatment on Study SGN35-006 or number of retreatment experiences with anti-brentuximab vedotin antibodies at any time during retreatment, Up to 39 months
This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate single-agent brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) treatment in patients who previously participated in a brentuximab vedotin study, including Studies SGN35-005 (NCT01100502), SGN35-007 (NCT01026233), and SGN35-008 (NCT01026415). Patients treated on this study (SGN35-006) could re-enroll on study if eligible. The study consisted of 2 arms, as follows:

* Retreatment arm: Patients with CD30-positive hematologic malignancies who experienced a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) with previous brentuximab vedotin treatment on a clinical study and subsequently experienced disease progression or relapse. The purpose of this arm was to assess safety and efficacy of retreatment with brentuximab vedotin.
* Extension treatment arm: Patients with either CD30-positive hematologic or nonhematologic malignancies who completed treatment in a prior brentuximab vedotin study without unacceptable toxicity and experienced clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator. The purpose of this arm was to enable patients who participated in certain prior brentuximab vedotin trials to receive extension treatment and to assess patient safety and survival in the extension treatment setting.
