Anlotinib indication: Anlotinib is a novel oral multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by suppressing signaling pathways involving angiogenesis and cell proliferation. It has been approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration as a third-line therapy for NSCLC.

SRT indication: SRT（Stereotactic Radiation Therapy） is a form of local radiation therapy that delivers high doses of radiation in a limited number of treatments. Within Chinese guidelines and consensus, it is clearly defined that limited intracranial metastases can be treated with SRT instead of WBRT (Whole Brain Radiotherapy), achieving comparable or even superior efficacy while better preserving neurocognitive function.
