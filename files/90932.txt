Research for Predictive Biologic Parameters of Cutaneous Hypersensitivity After Brachytherapy in Breast Cancer
25 patients, treated by brachytherapy in a phase II study "Mammosite" (from 2003 to 2005), will be asked to attend a clinical exam in order to evaluate the late cutaneous toxicity due to brachytherapy.

During this consultation, a blood sample will be taken for analysis ( rate of CD8 T-Lymphocyte Apoptosis)
