Dupilumab_Metastatic NSCLC
This is a multi cohort, sequential enrollment clinical trial to determine the safety and tolerability of Dupilumab and Anakinra with PD-(L)1 blockade for patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic NSCLC. For Phase 2, to determine the effect of adding IL-4Ra and IL-1R blockade to PD-(L)1 blocking agents in patients with relapsed/refractory NSCLC, who have progressed on prior PD-(L)1 agents.

Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), Phase 1: Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) as defined based on the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0., 9 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Phase 2: Overall response rate by imaging at time of first repeat imaging (\~9w from the start of therapy) using standard response criteria (RECIST v1.126). ORR is defined as the combined percent of the patients experiencing a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) at time of first reimaging., 9 weeks
Best overall response (BORR), Best overall response (BORR) will be a combined percent of the patients experiencing a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) at any point within the first year from the initiation of therapy, or until the documented progression of disease or start of a new anti-cancer therapy., 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time in days from the first administration of dupilumab until documented progression of disease on imaging or death Defined as the time in days from the first administration of dupilumab until documented progression of disease on imaging or death, 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time in days from the first administration of dupilumab until documented death from any cause., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from which a patient achieves either a PR or a CR until subsequent progression of disease is documented radiographically or clinically.

Defined as the time from which a patient achieves either a PR or a CR until subsequent progression of disease is documented radiographically or clinically., 2 years
