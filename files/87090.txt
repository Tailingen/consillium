Pre-pectoral Tissue Expander and Acellular Dermal Matrix for a Two-stage Muscle Sparing Breast Reconstruction
The aim of the research is to evaluate clinical outcomes of a two stage muscle sparing prepectoral breast reconstruction using tissue expander (TE) entirely covered by an ADM. The authors aim to report surgical indications, technical tips, clinical and histological outcomes with the final objective of delineate a decision-making algorithm for immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: breast reconstruction
Patient satisfaction, Patients satisfaction will be evaluated through BREAST-Q questionnaire. the results from the questionnaire will be converted into a 0-100 scale with higher values meaning a better outcome, 24 months of follow-up
Pain Evaluation, Pain will be assessed trough Visual Analogic Scale (from minimum 0 to maximum 10). Higher values mean worse outcome, 24 months of follow-up
Complication rate, Complication will be recorded and classified with Clavien-Dindo Classification, 24 months of follow-up
