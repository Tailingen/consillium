Quality of Life of Adults With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Treated With Tisagenlecleucel
The aim of this non-interventional multi-center study is to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and other patient reported outcomes (PROs) among adults with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) following Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy with tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah). Up to 100 individuals will be enrolled prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion in either the inpatient or ambulatory setting and followed for 6 months post-enrollment to evaluate changes in QOL from baseline to post-treatment, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment- lymphoma (FACT-Lym). Secondary outcomes will assess patient self-efficacy in assessing for and managing treatment-related toxicities including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and communicating these and other concerns across care settings. To support patients and facilitate the collection of key PROs, a digital health coaching solution provided by Pack Health will be provided to each participant over the 6-month study enrollment. The digital coaching program provides an evidence-based curriculum focused on monitoring and managing CAR T-cell associated toxicities, enhancing overall wellness post-treatment, and navigating within and between referring and treating facilities. The participating site(s) will collect longitudinal PRO data focused on QOL across physiologic and psychosocial domains that coaching personnel will access and review with participants.

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Lymphoma (FACT-Lym), The FACT-lym is a 42-item assessment that measures self-reported quality of life across 4 domains: physical, functional, emotional and social and includes 15 additional items validated specifically for individuals with lymphoma. The instrument can be scored as a whole as well as within the individual domains., Change across Enrollment, Months 1,2,3,4,5,6
SF-36, The SF-36 is a validated measure for the assessment of health-related quality of life for individuals with diverse chronic conditions, including individuals with hematologic malignancies. It consists of 36-items assessing 8 health domains, including physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health. The instrument is scored on a scale of 0-100 for each of the 8 health domains. It was recently used in a study of quality-of-life following treatment with tisagenlecleucel., Enrollment, Months 3,6|Cancer Behavior Inventory- Brief (CBI-B), This 12-item instrument measures self-efficacy in coping with cancer across 7 domains. These include: Seeking and Understanding Medical Information, Emotion Regulation, Coping with Treatment Related Side Effects, Accepting Cancer/ Maintaining a Positive Attitude, Seeking Social Support, and Using Spiritual Coping. The instrument utilizes a 9-point response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all confident" to 9 "Confident"., Enrollment, Months 1,2,3,4,5,6|Subjective Assessment of Patient Experience in Managing CAR T Specific Care, As there are no currently validated instruments specific to CAR T-cell therapy, a 5-item assessment of patients' experience in monitoring, managing, and reporting treatment related toxicities will be created specifically for use in this study and will mirror the response scale in the CBI-B. This includes a 9-point response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all confident" to 9 "Confident". The following items will be included: 1) Understand the treatment toxicities I may experience while receiving CAR T-cell therapy; 2) Identify the signs and symptoms of these toxicities; 3) Communicate symptoms to provider; 4) Manage symptoms according to provider's instructions; 5) Explain treatment to a healthcare provider, Enrollment, Months 1,2,3,4,5,6
