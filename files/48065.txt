Preoperative Concurrent Chemotherapy and Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The hypothesis of this study is that dose escalated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to a dose of 55Gy in 25# to primary rectal tumor concurrent with oral capecitabine results in an improved pathological response rate from 8% (German trial) to 25%.
Rectal Cancers.
RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy
Pathological complete response rates, Pathogical complete response rate 8 weeks post chemoradiotherapy at surgery according to Ryan's classification, 8 weeks post chemoradiotherapy
Toxicity, Toxicity including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dermatitis, proctitis, urinary frequency/urgency as per common toxicity criteria v3.0, 2 years|Disease Free survival, Time from study entry to disease recurrence or death, 2 years|Downstaging rates, percentage of patients who achieve downstaging 8 weeks post chemoradiotherapy at surgery according to TNM classification, 8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy|Sphincter Preservation rates, Sphincter Preservation rates 8 weeks post chemoradiotherapy at surgery.Percentage of patients who underwent sphincter salvage surgery after chemoradiotherapy, 8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy
This study aims to look at whether radiation dose escalation with intensity modulated radiotherapy can increase the rates of pathological complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
