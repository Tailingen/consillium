Study of Cabazitaxel Combined With Prednisone and Prophylaxis of Neutropenia Complications in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
Primary Objective:

- To assess effectiveness of prophylactic treatment of hematological complications (grade ≥ 3 neutropenia) resulting from cabazitaxel treatment for 21 days after treatment initiation.

Secondary Objectives:

* PSA response rate;
* Descriptive assessment of CTC (circulating Tumor Cells);
* Rates of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia and grade ≥3 diarrhea over the treatment period;
* Description of the Health Quality of Life of the patients;
* Incidence of adverse events.
