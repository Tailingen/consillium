Co-administration of CART22-65s and huCART19 for B-ALL
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering two CAR T cell products, huCART19 and CART22-65s, in children with advanced B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B Lineage Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous, humanized anti-CD22 CAR T cell therapy (CART22-65s)|BIOLOGICAL: Autologous, humanized anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy (huCART19)
Safety of CART22-65s and huCART19 co-administration, The safety of the administering CART22-65s and huCART19 will be measured by the monitoring the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients with advanced or refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or B Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (B-LLy), including those previously treated with cell therapy., 1 year|Efficacy of CART22-65s and huCART19 co-administration, The efficacy of CART22-65s and huCART19 co-administration will be measured by the evaluating the overall response rate in patients with advanced or refractory B cell hematologic malignancies, including those previously treated with cell therapy., 1 year
Manufacturing Feasibility, The manufacturing feasibility of manufacturing both CART22-65s and huCART19 will be measured by the percentage of manufactured products that do not meet release criteria for vector transduction efficiency, T cell product purity, viability, sterility or due to tumor contamination., 5 years|Anti-tumor response due to CART22-65s and huCART19 co-administration, Anti-tumor response due to CART22-65s and huCART19 co-administration will be measured by negative minimal residual disease (MRD) as measured by multiparameter flow cytometry at day 28., Day 28|Event Free Survival, 1-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B), 1 year|Relapse Free Survival, 1-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate in CAR-naïve subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in CAR-exposed subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B), 1 year|Overall Survival, 1-year overall survival (OS) rate in CAR-naïve subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in CAR-exposed subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B)., 1 year|CAR T Cell Therapy Persistence, CART22-65s and huCART19 persistence polymerase chain reaction (or flow cytometry) analysis of whole blood to detect and quantify survival of CART2265s and huCART19 over time., 1 year|Bioreactivity of CART22-65s and huCART19 when co-administered, The bioreactivity of CART22-65s and huCART19 when co-administered, as measured by elevations level in any of; Uric Acid, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), c-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines (e.g.IL -10) before and after CART T cell infusions., 1 year
CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy has transformed the treatment landscape for children and young adults with chemo-refractory or relapsed B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). Despite remarkable initial response rates, approximately 50% of pediatric patients experience a subsequent disease relapse. The prognosis for these patients is dismal with a median survival of less than one year from the time of post-CART19 relapse. The primary mechanisms contributing to CART19 failure include CD19-antigen escape and loss of CAR T cell surveillance due to short CART persistence. This study aims to counter each driver of relapse by co-administering two next-generation CAR T cell products: an anti-CD22 CART (CART22-65s), designed to overcome CD19-antigen escape; and a humanized anti-CD19 CART (huCART19), designed to overcome immune-mediated rejection of murine CART19.
