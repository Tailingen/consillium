Study of the AL3810 in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor
This was a monocentric, open label, non-randomised, non-comparative, dose-finding phase I study
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Lucitanib
Identify Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To assess the tolerability of AL3810 in patients with advanced solid tumors, 35 days|Identify maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To assess the tolerability of AL3810 in patients with advanced solid tumors, 35 days
Cmax (maximum plasma concentration), Metabolism profiling of AL3810 and its potential metabolites in plasma The potential food interaction on metabolism profile of AL 3810 in plasma, Day0,Day8,Day15,Day22,Day29,Day57|Tmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), Metabolism profiling of AL3810 and its potential metabolites in plasma The potential food interaction on metabolism profile of AL 3810 in plasma, Day0,Day8,Day15,Day22,Day29,Day57|AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve), Metabolism profiling of AL3810 and its potential metabolites in plasma The potential food interaction on metabolism profile of AL 3810 in plasma, Day0,Day8,Day15,Day22,Day29,Day57|Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion, 8 weeks|progression free survival (PFS), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion, 8 weeks|10.CBR (clinical benefit rate), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion, 8 weeks
Methodology:

This was a monocentric, open label, non-randomised, non-comparative, dose-finding phase I study with a traditional 3+3 design, conducted in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumours without an established therapeutic alternative.This study was performed in strict accordance with Good Clinical Practice including the archiving of essential documents.
