A Phase I Study of Hyper-CVAD In Combination With Venetoclax In Pediatric Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemias That Are of the Lymphoid Lineage Including Bi-Phenotypic or Undifferentiated Leukemias
To find the recommended dose of hyper-CVAD in combination with venetoclax that can be given to participants with relapsed or refractory leukemia.
Refractory Acute Leukemia|Relapsed Acute Leukemia|Undifferentiated Leukemia|Bi-Phenotypic Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Hyper-CVAD
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax in combination with hyper-CVAD in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias that are of the lymphoid lineage including bi-phenotypic or undifferentiated leukemias.
* To characterize the safety and tolerability of hyper-CVAD in combination with venetoclax.

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by overall response (OR), including complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) and partial response (PR).
* Evaluate additional measures of clinical benefit including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS) minimal residual disease (MRD) rate, and duration of response (DOR).

Exploratory Objectives

. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) and biological effects of hyper-CVAD in combination with venetoclax through molecular and cellular markers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance.
