P:II Above-Label Octreotide-LAR With Insufficiently Controlled Carcinoid Syndrome
The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of high-dose octreotide on flushing, diarrhea, and quality of life in patients whose disease-related symptoms are inadequately controlled by the maximum approved dose of octreotide LAR.
Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
DRUG: Octreotide LAR
Number of Participants With Improved Frequency of Diarrhea, The frequencies of flushing, diarrhea, and carcinoid syndrome control rating (scale 1-5) will be measured and compared at week 0 and week 12 . These measurements will be compared using two-sided non-parametric paired Wilcoxon signed-rank., At 12 weeks
Rate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months, Progression-free survival, defined as rate of patients alive and free of progression from the date of first study treatment to the end of trial at 6 months. Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., At 6 months
The study population will consist of patients with advanced (metastatic or unresectable) neuroendocrine tumors with suboptimally controlled carcinoid syndrome. While the majority of patients will have primary tumors of the ileocecum (midgut), any serotonin-producing neuroendocrine tumors will be eligible (including pancreatic, lung and unknown primary).

All patients will be followed for adverse events and serious adverse events for 28 days following the last dose of above-label octreotide, or until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first.
