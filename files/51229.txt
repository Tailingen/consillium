A Phase 2, 2-Stage, 2-Cohort Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673), in Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With BRCA Mutation (ABRAZO Study)
The purpose of this 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of talazoparib (also known as BMN 673) in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious germline BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation. Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or 2 based on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease:

* Cohort 1) Subjects with a documented PR or CR to a prior platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease with disease progression \> 8 weeks following the last dose of platinum; or
* Cohort 2) Subjects who have received \> 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and who have had no prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease

DRUG: talazoparib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR: Percentage of participants with a confirmed best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm) in short axis. PR: Greater than or equal to (\>=) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. Response evaluation was done by an independent radiology facility (IRF)., From randomization until data cutoff date (01 Sep 2016)
Clinical Benefit Rate-24 (CBR-24), CBR24: Percentage of participants with a best response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) sustained for at least 24 weeks, as assessed by IRF using RECIST 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to \<10 mm in short axis. PR: \>=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. SD: Neither PR nor progression of disease (PD) criteria met. SD follow PR only when sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but previously seen 30% decrease from baseline no longer hold. PD: \>=20% increase (\>=5 mm absolute increase) in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions., From randomization until data cutoff date (01 Sep 2016)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR: Time from first documentation of CR or PR, to PD by IRF assessment using RECIST 1.1, or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, with target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to \<10 mm in short axis.
