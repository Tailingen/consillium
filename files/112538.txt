Use of Specific Genetic Alteration s of Tumoral Cells Identified by the Next Generation Sequencing Techniques (NGS) to Follow Peripheral Samples of Children With Metastatic and/or High Risk Solid Tumor - NGSKids
The search for genetic alterations in primary tumor by NGS techniques followed by the detection of these alterations in circulating tumor DNA and/or CTC/DTC present in peripheral samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, possibly urine) collected during several steps and after the treatment could be a tool to monitor the response during and after the treatment.
