Nasal Polyposis
DRUG: AK001 low dose|DRUG: AK001 high dose|DRUG: Placebo
Change in Total Polys Score (TPS), NPS was the sum of the right and left nostril scores, as evaluated by means of nasal endoscopy. Change in TPS from Baseline (prior to the first dose) to Week 12 (Day 84) was the primary outcome of the study. TPS ranges from 0 to 8 (scored 0 \[no polyp\] to 4 \[large polyps\] for each nostril), with a lower score indicating smaller-sized polyps, a higher scores mean a worse outcome., From Baseline (prior to the first dose) to Week 12 (Day 84)
