Study of TJ004309 in Combination With Atezolizumab (TecentriqÂ®) in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1 dose escalation study of TJ004309 in combination with standard dose atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer in patients who are refractory to or intolerant to all available therapy.
Solid Tumor|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: TJ004309|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Maximum Tolerate Dose of TJ004309 plus Atezolizumab, Evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of TJ004309 when combined with standard dose atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 and coded using MedDRA 14.1., Approximately 2-8 months
Determine Phase 2 dose to TJ004309 as a single agent, Determine the Phase 2 dose of TJ004309 as a single agent, Approximately 2-8 months|Trough TJ004309 concentrations, Trough (pre-dose and post-dose) serum TJ004309 concentrations will be measured when given as a single agent and with atezolizumab, Approximately 2-8 months|Trough atezolizumab concentrations, Trough (pre-dose and post-dose) serum atezolizumab concentrations will be measured when given with TJ004309, Approximately 2-8 months|Determine the Rate of TJ004309 Immunogenicity, The number of patients who develop immunogenicity to TJ004309 (anti-product antibody development) will be determined., Approximately 2-8 months|Determine the Rate of Atezolizumab Immunogenicity, The number of patients who develop immunogenicity to atezolizumab (anti-product antibody development) will be determined., Approximately 2-8 months|Assessment of antitumor activity, Antitumor activity will be assessed by the response rate by iRECIST and RECIST 1.1, Approximately 2-8 months
