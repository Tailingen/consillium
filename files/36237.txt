Super Hypofractionated Irradiation for Whole Breast Treatment
The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of super hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (SHF-WBI) in breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery. Eligible breast cancer patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate the acute and late radiation-induced toxicities, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, death, contralateral breast cancer and quality of life.

RADIATION: External Beam radiotherapy using IMRT technique
Cumulative complication rate of ≥Grade 2 Acute Radiation-induced Toxicity, Within time from the beginning of radiotherapy to 6 months after completion of radiotherapy, any acute radiation induced toxicities will be assessed and recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0., 6 months
Cumulative complication rate of ≥Grade 2 Late Radiation-induced Toxicity, Within time from 6 months after completion of radiotherapy to 5 years after completion of radiotherapy, any late toxicity will be assessed and recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) /European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema and CTCAE 5.0, 5 years|Number of Participants with excellent or good Cosmetic outcomes following breast conserving surgery-Harvard/ NSABP/RTOG scoring scale, The cosmetic outcomes will be evaluated at 6 months after last fractions. The cosmetic outcomes are evaluated based on the Allegheny General Modification of the Harvard/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)/RTOG scoring scale which graded patients into the following four classifications: excellent, when compared to the untreated breast, there is a minimal or no difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; good, slight difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; fair, obvious difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; and poor, marked change in the size or shape of the treated breast, 6 months|Number of Participants with excellent or good Cosmetic outcomes following breast conserving surgery-Harvard/ NSABP/RTOG scoring scale, The cosmetic outcomes will be evaluated at 5 years after last fractions.

Eligible breast cancer patients will receive SHF-WBI of 5.2 Gy in 5 fractions to ipsilateral whole breast within one week and a sequential tumor bed boost of 5.2 Gy in 2 fractions at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. All patients are treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique. The primary endpoint is ≥2 grade any acute radiation induced toxicity event. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate the acute and late radiation-induced toxicity, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, death and quality of life.

Calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 10% during and within 6 months after SHF-WBI comparing to hypofractionated whole breast irradiation(40-42.5Gy/15-16Fx) and lost rate of follow up of 10%. In total 217 patients are needed to be recruited.
