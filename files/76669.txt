Brain Metastases
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Apatinib plus radiotherapy
The intracranial disease progression free survival time, To observe the intracranial disease progression free survival time of apatinib combined with radiotherapy for brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer patients, tumor assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months
Progression free survival time, Baseline to measured date of progression or death from any cause, evaluated in 24 months since the treatment began|Overall survival, Baseline to measured date of death from any cause, the first day of treatment to death or last survival confirm date ,up to 24 months|Disease control rate, Baseline to measured progressive disease, tumor assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Objective response rate, Baseline to measured stable disease, tumor assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Dosage changes of dexamethasone, To observe the change of the dosage of dexamethasone before and after treatment, Dosage changes of dexamethasone every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Volume change rate of cerebral edema, To observe the change of volume change rate of cerebral edema, Volume change rate of cerebral edema every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To observe the safety of therapeutic schedule every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Cognitive function screening ：Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), The Mini-mental state examination checklist includes 30 problems. Answer the correct question, get 1 points, answer wrong or answer not know, get 0 points, the scale of the total score is 0-30. If the score is 27-30 points, cognitive function is normal; if the score is less than 27, there is cognitive dysfunction. If the score is 21-26 points, there is a mild cognitive impairment. If the score is 10-20 points, there is moderate cognitive impairment. If the score is 0-9 points, there is severe cognitive impairment., Volume change rate of cerebral edema every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Executive function testing：trail marking test（TMT）, The TMT, parts A and B, assesses psychomotor speed and executive function.The A part of the TMT test defined the time range of 0-180 seconds, and the greater the value was, the lower function; the B part of the TMT test defined the time range of 0-300 seconds, and the greater the value, the lower function., Volume change rate of cerebral edema every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Language function detection ：Hopkins verbal learning test-revised（HVLT-R）, The COWA tests verbal fluency and executive function.Within 1 minutes, the subjects say how many words contain one word or within the specified category, each acceptable word counts 1 points, and the repeated words are scored without repetition. The higher the score, the better the function., these neurocognitive function tests assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months|Verbal learning and memory:Hopkins verbal learning test-revised（HVLT-R）, The HVLT-R assesses aspects of verbal learning and memory, including immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition.In the HVLT-R test, the range of learning score and delayed recall score was 0-12 points, and the greater the score, the better the function., these neurocognitive function tests assesment every 8 weeks,up to 24 months
