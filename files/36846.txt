Effects of Open Thoracic Paravertebral Block on Postoperative Analgesia
The study was aimed to assess the effects of open thoracic paravertebral block on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general anesthesia. Then, A total of 90 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores of Ⅰ or Ⅱ, scheduled for open pulmonary lobectomy under propofol - remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia, were randomly divided into PCIA group (group G), Ultrasound-guided TPVB combined with PCIA group (group U), and open TPVB combined with PCIA group (group E).Finally, the study find that Open TPVB can provided satisfactory analgesia for patients undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general anesthesia, and the analgesia efficacy was equivalent to the TPVB under ultrasound guidance,which should be popularized.

Purpose: The study was aimed to assess the effects of open thoracic paravertebral block on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing open pulmonary lobectomy under general anesthesia.

Methods: A total of 90 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores of Ⅰ or Ⅱ, scheduled for open pulmonary lobectomy under propofol - remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia, were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 30 each) by using a random number table: PCIA group (group G), Ultrasound-guided TPVB combined with PCIA group (group U), and open TPVB combined with PCIA group (group E). In group G, patients were received PCIA after the surgery. In group U, TPVB was performed on the operated side under ultrasound guidance with 0.25% ropivacaine 30 ml combined with the PCIA after the surgery. In group E, the TPVB was performed under the direct vision with 0.25% ropivacaine 30 ml combined with the PCIA. The Visual Analogue Score (VAS) at rest and during coughing, the sensory nerve block segment, as well as the respiratory rate were measured and recorded at different time-points. Furthermore, the hemodynamic vital signs at different time - points, the number of successfully delivered doses 48 h after the surgery, as well as the incidence of postoperative complications were also recorded and analyzed.
