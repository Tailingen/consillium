AMT-151 in Patients With Selected Advanced Solid Tumours
This first-in-human study will evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) / the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of AMT-151, a novel antibody-drug conjugate against folate receptor alpha, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
