Progression-free Survival (PFS) (RECIST1.1), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression or death of any cause., From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anticancer therapy (up to approximately 2 years)|Objective response rate (ORR)(RECIST1.1), The incidence of confirmed complete response or partial response, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anticancer therapy(up to approximately 2 years)]|Duration of response (DoR)(RECIST1.1), Duration from the first time reported partial response or complete response to the first time of disease progression or death., From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anti-cancer therapy (up to approximately 2 years)]|Disease control rate (DCR)(RECIST1.1), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (reduced or enlarged) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit., From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anti-cancer therapy (up to approximately 2 years)]|PD-L1, To evaluate the relationship between the efficacy and tumor biomarkers of PD-L1, Baseline (before the randomization)|Ki67, To evaluate the relationship between the efficacy and tumor biomarkers of ki67, Baseline (before the randomization)|Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), The changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) score from baseline and the time to deterioration of symptoms (TTD) as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), From the within 7 days prior to the initiation of treatment to 30 days after the last administration
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase III clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatnib combined with toripalimab compared with FOLFIRI in patients with advanced neuroendocrine carcinoma who have progression of disease or intolerable toxicity after previous 1st-line chemotherapy.
