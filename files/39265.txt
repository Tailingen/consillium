Ex-vivo Expanded γδ T Lymphocytes in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
This study investigates the potential curative properties of ex-vivo expanded gamma delta T-cells obtained from a blood-related donor for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded γδ T-lymphocytes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. PBMCs will be separated from peripheral blood of suitable donors. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cells, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.
