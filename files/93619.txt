Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Erlotinib Six Months or Longer
With roughly 80% of cancer patients receiving their oncology care in the community setting, the investigators are proposing to sample from a community-based center to evaluate the percentage of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-wild type patients that gain benefit from erlotinib and assess the clinical characteristics that are associated with erlotinib-responders. Additionally, biopsy specimens from enrolled patient cases that are EGFR-wt will be evaluated via exploratory genetic analysis for correlated markers.

demographics, To describe patient demographic characteristics of patients with erlotinib (single-agent) treatment duration of six months or longer, including patients who are EGFR-wt. Demographic characteristics include age, race,ethnicity, date of initial diagnosis, age at initial diagnosis, location of biopsy at diagnosis, extent of disease with description and location of metastatic sites, histology,and smoking history., 24 months|treatment characteristics, To describe patient treatment and characteristics of patients with erlotinib (single-agent) treatment duration of six months or longer, including patients who are EGFR-wt. Including number and kind of prior therapies, disease stage at initial diagnosis, sites of metastasis at time of erlotinib treatment, prior surgery, and radiation., 24 months|outcome characteristics, To describe patient outcome characteristics of patients with erlotinib (single-agent) treatment duration of six months or longer, including patients who are EGFR-wt including the reason for discontinuing erlotinib treatment, best response to erlotinib treatment and did patient receive any dose modifications while receiving erlotinib treatment., 24 months
