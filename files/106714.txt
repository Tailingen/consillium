Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Regional Nodal Irradiation
The primary objective of this study is to document lymphedema rates in patients requiring regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who receive hypofractionated radiation as compared to conventional radiation.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy
Lymphedema Rate, Defined as a 10% increase in arm circumference from pre-treatment (baseline) arm circumference measurement., One year post end of treatment (EOT)
Local Recurrence, Defined as biopsy proven recurrence of breast cancer involving the chest wall, breast, axilla, internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes, 12 months post-EOT|Cosmetic (Breast) Outcome, Measured using the Breast Qâ„¢ Assessment questionnaire, 12 months post-EOT|Quality of Life, Measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Questionnaire for Breast Cancer (FACT-B+4) questionnaire, After enrollment but prior to CT simulation; 14-90 days post-EOT; 12 months post-EOT|Range of Motion (Upper Extremities), Percent reduction in referrals to physical therapy for impaired range of movement post-EOT, 14-90 days post-EOT; 6 months post-EOT; 12 months post-EOT
Participants with stage II or stage III node-positive breast cancer, or T3N0 node-negative will receive hypofractionated radiation for 4 weeks. We hypothesize that patients receiving a shorter course of radiation will have reduced lymphedema. Lymphedema is diagnosed when the patient's arm circumference measures 10% or more as compared to pre-treatment (baseline) arm circumference measurement. Secondary endpoints will address the effectiveness, quality of life, and side effect profile of a shortened course of treatment.
