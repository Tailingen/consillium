IGG Using in Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (cT2-4a N-/+ M0) were selected as study subjects to investigate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of ICG near-infrared imaging tracing in guiding laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by comparing injection ICG group and non-injection ICG group
Gastric Cancer|Lymph Node Metastases
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
3-year disease free survival rate, Disease-free survival is calculated from the day of surgery to the day of recurrence (When the specific date of recurrence of the tumor is unknown, the ending point is the date of death due to tumor causes). In the event that neither death nor recurrence of the tumor are observed, the end point is the final date that a patient is confirmed as relapse-free., 3 years
Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, 30 days
