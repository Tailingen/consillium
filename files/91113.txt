Radical resection is the primary treatment for patients with advanced middle or upper third gastric cancer. And D2 lymphadenectomy, including No. 10 lymph node dissection, should be performed according to the Japanese treatment guidelines for gastric cancer. Because of the complexity of the anatomy around the spleen, spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection is difficult. Although Professor Huang from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital has proposed the "Huang's three-step maneuver" to dissect No. 10 lymph node with preserved spleen laparoscopically, such method is far from popularized, especially in North China. In addition, the safety, feasibility and oncological efficacy of this method was not confirmed in such area, either.

In this study, a prospective, single center, single-arm, non-inferiority clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the short and long-term outcome of the laparoscopic spleen-preserving No. 10 lymph node dissection for patients with locally advanced middle or upper third gastric cancer in Beijing.
