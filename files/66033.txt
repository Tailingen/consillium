Cancer Treatment Followed by Surgery for Early Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
* The purpose of the phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant bortezomib in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin followed by surgery in early stage non-small cell lung cancer, via a multi-cohort dose escalation trial.
* The phase II portion of the study will look at the clinical response rate and the pathology response rate. Other purposes are to look at surgical morbidity, mortality and respectability rates. Molecular correlates of response and survival to this neoadjuvant regimen will be explored.
