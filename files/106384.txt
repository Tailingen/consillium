A Study to Learn More About How Radium-223 Affects the Quality of Life of Colombian Patients With Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Testosterone Lowering Treatment and Has Spread to the Bones, and to Better Understand Its Safety
The study drug, radium-223, gives off radiation that helps to kill cancer cells in the prostate. It is already available for patients to receive as a treatment for prostate cancer that has not responded to testosterone lowering treatment and has spread to the bones. This type of cancer is called metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, also called mCRPC. Sometimes, researchers continue studying an available treatment to learn more about how it affects patients' daily lives.

In this study, the researchers want to learn more about how radium-223 affects the patients' ability to do their daily tasks. The patients in this study will already be receiving treatment with radium-223 as part of their routine care. The tests and measurements in this study will be done by the patients' own doctors. The researchers will collect information about the patients' treatment and results.

The study will include patients with mCRPC who have at least 2 tumors in their bones. These patients will have recently started treatment with radium-223. The patients will have also had surgery or treatment to lower their testosterone levels. But, the treatment did not help their cancer. The study will include about 105 men in Colombia who are at least 18 years old.

All of the patients will receive radium-223 through a needle put into the vein, also called an intravenous injection. They will visit their doctor's office up to 8 times during 28 weeks. At these visits, their doctors will ask how they are feeling and what medications they are taking, and will take blood samples. The doctors will also give the patients surveys about their physical, social, and emotional health and about the symptoms of their prostate cancer.

Absolute scores for FACT-P, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P): It is a multidimension, selfreport QoL instrument specifically designed for patients with prostate cancer. It consists of 39 questions items, made up by 2 parts: the 27 questions for functional assessment of cancer therapy general (FACT-G) and 12 prostate cancer subscale questions. It assesses 4 main domains which are: physical (n=7), social/family (n=7), emotional (n=6) and functional wellbeing (n=7)., At baseline|Absolute scores for FACT-P, At week 12|Absolute scores for FACT-P, At week 16|Absolute scores for FACT-P, At week 24|Absolute scores for FACT-P, At week 28|Absolute scores for EORTC QLQ-PR25, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Specific module (EORTC QLQ-PR25): It is a questionnaire with score calculation is by subscales: urinary symptoms, bother due to use of incontinence aid, bowel symptoms, hormonal treatment-related symptoms, sexual activity and sexual functioning. Absolute score \[scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual)., At baseline|Absolute scores for EORTC QLQ-PR25, At week 12|Absolute scores for EORTC QLQ-PR25, At week 16|Absolute scores for EORTC QLQ-PR25, At week 24|Absolute scores for EORTC QLQ-PR25, At week 28
