Phase II Trial to Modulate Intermediate Endpoint Biomarkers in Former and Current Smokers
The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational combination drug called Lovaza (made with fish oils)+Curcumin C3 Complex (made from a root called curcumin) can help reduce the size of lung nodules. Researchers also want to find out if the combination of Lovaza+Curcumin C3 Complex is safe and tolerable.
Lung Diseases|Lung Cancer, Protection Against
DRUG: Curcumin C3 complex®|DRUG: Lovaza®|OTHER: Placebo
Mean Change in Bronchial Nodule Size, Difference in the average change in bronchial nodule size from baseline to end of therapy at 6 months for each study arm. A lower size is taken to be the desired value for participants receiving study drug, assuming an increase in size for the placebo arm., 6 months post treatment|Rate of Nodules ≥4 mm, Number of nodules ≥4 mm per study arm, post treatment., 6 months post treatment
Rate of Adherence, Rate of participant adherence per study arm. Proof of adherence based on study team pill counts, participant diet logs and pill logs at end of study, vs. data collected at midpoint., 6 months post treatment|Rate of Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs), Safety of the combined agents (Curcumin C3 complex® + Lovaza®) at 2 dose arms vs. placebo as indicated by incidence of related adverse events and toxicities, monitored using Common Toxicity Criteria version 5.0., Up to 30 days post treatment, approximately 7 months
