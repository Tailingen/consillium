The Comparison Between Computed Tomography and Colonoscope in Detecting Colorectal Tumors in Patients With FIT+
Colonoscopy is the mainstay modality of choice in colorectal cancer screening worldwide. However, the rate of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening is very low (approximately 5-10%) because of the limited local medical resources (such as endoscopists and regional endoscope). This observational diagnostic test study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of routine computed tomography and colonoscopy in detecting colorectal tumors in patients at risk of colorectal cancer (aged more than 50 years and FIT+). The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

1. To compare the diagnostic yield between the routine computed tomography and colonoscopy.
2. To compare the procedure-related adverse events between the routine computed tomography and colonoscopy.
Patients at Risk of Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CT and colonoscopy
Diagnostic yield in diagnosis colorectal tumor, Sensitivity, specitivity, accuracy, 2 weeks
Procedure-related adverse events, Procedure-related adverse events such as, contrast induced nephropathy, contrast allergy, colonoscope-related perforation, post polypectomy bleeding, 2 weeks
All enrolled patients underwent routine CT scans of whole abdomen, then subsequently under went a colonoscopy on the next day
