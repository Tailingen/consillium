PET and MRI in the Follow-up of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Breast Cancer
Predict and follow thanks to imaging the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast carcinoma. Hypothesis : FLT-(18F)PET will be a predictor superior to both FDG-(18F) PET and MRI
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Fluoro-L-thymidine-(18F)
Determine and compare sensitivity and specificity of 3 different modalities for the prediction of effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Determine and compare sensitivity and specificity of 3 different modalities for the prediction of effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during de study
PET/CT with FDG-(18F) and FLT-(18F) and MRI are performed at the initial staging, 3 times during sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and prior to surgery, aiming to find the most efficient modality to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the primary breast cancer and its possible lymph node metastases. Post-surgical histology and a 6 month follow-up (to detect occult metastases) will constitute the standard of truth for determination and comparison of diagnostic performances.
