ImmunoPET Targeting Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (Trop-2) in Thyroid Cancer
The objective of the study is to construct a noninvasive approach 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT to detect the Trop-2 expression of tumor lesions in patients with thyroid cancer and to identify patients benefiting from Trop-2 targeting antibody-drug conjugate treatment.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: standard-of-care imaging (18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT), 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT
Diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of standard-of-care imaging (18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT) and 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy., 2 years
Number of lesions, The numbers of positive primary and metastatic lesions of standard-of-care imaging (18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT) and 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation., 2 years|SUV, Standardized uptake value (SUV) of standard-of-care imaging (18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT) and 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT for each target lesion of subject or suspected primary tumor or/and metastasis., 2 years
As a new trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) targeting PET radiotracer, 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH is promising as an excellent imaging agent applicable to various cancers. In this research, subjects with thyroid cancer or highly suspected recurrence detection underwent contemporaneous 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH and standard-of-care imaging (18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT) either for an initial assessment or for metastases or highly suspected recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The numbers of positive tumor lesions of standard-of-care imaging and 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation. The diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-THP-Trop2 VHH was calculated and compared to standard-of-care imaging.
