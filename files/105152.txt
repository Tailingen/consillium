Antiangiogenic Peptide Vaccine Therapy With Gemcitabine in Treating Patient With Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, and tolerability of HLA-A\*2402 restricted epitope peptide VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with gemcitabine

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 and 2 (VEGFR1 andVEGFR2) are essential targets to tumor angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and in vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of these peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with gemcitabine
