Mean Change (6 Weeks - Baseline) and Standard Deviation in Cancer-related Fatigue, Using the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Short Form (BFI-SF) and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF). 81 Subjects Had Both a Baseline and 6 Week Value, BFI-SF is a 4 item questionnaire to assess the severity of fatigue, ranging from 0 (No Fatigue) to 10 (As bad as you can imagine).

MFSI-SF is a 30 item questionnaire to assess the level of fatigue in terms of general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigor). First four subscales (general, physical, emotional, and mental) are summed and the vigor scale is subtracted to create fatigue total score with a range of -32 (low fatigue) to 96 (high fatigue)., Baseline to 6 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To collect preliminary statistical data (mean changes and standard deviations) on two omega-3 supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo for reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in fatigued breast cancer survivors.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.

ARM II: Patients receive high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation PO BID for 6 weeks.

ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.
