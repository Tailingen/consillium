Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) as Neo-Adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety, and tolerability of neo-adjuvant treatment with tislelizumab in participants with early-stage (Stage II-III) Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer.
