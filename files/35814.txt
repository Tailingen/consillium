IORT on Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This phase II study investigates the efficacy of IORT for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the addition of IORT, after FOLOFIRINOX-base chemotherapy, and SBRT, increases the 3-year survival rate. A total of 101 patients will be enrolled, and these patients will receive IORT of 10 to 20 Gy, according to the resection status (to the tumor bed after resection, or to the tumor in situ in case of non-resection).

Treatment outcomes of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer are still poor even after completion of FOLFIRINOX-based chemotherapy and radical resection. A growing body of literature is demonstrating that Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), within a multimodal approach, allow to obtain better oncological outcome, at the price of low to negligible rates of morbidity and mortality. The investigators hypothesize that a "total neoadjuvant" scenario, with the best current therapy, based on up to 6 months of FOLFIRINOX (minimum 4), SBRT and IORT (in situ or after surgery) would increase the disease-specific survival of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients. An historical cohort will be used as a comparison group.

Considering the intention-to-treat design and the institutional rates of chemotherapy completion and exploration/resection of borderline resection pancreatic cancer patients, a total of 100 patients will be enrolled in this phase II trial. Patients submitted to IORT, will receive IORT of 10 to 20 Gy according to the resection status (to the tumor bed after resection, or to the tumor in situ in case of non-resection).
