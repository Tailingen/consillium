A Clinical Trial of TQB3006 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Cancer
This study includes two stage: dose escalation and dose extension, with a single dose and a multiple dose study. This is a single-center, open, non-randomized, single arm, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TQB3006 tables in patients with advanced malignant cancer.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT will be defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria (according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version5.0), and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug that occurred from first medication to the end of the first treatment cycle., At the end of Cycle 1 (21 Days).|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., At the end of Cycle 1 (21 Days).|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to evaluate RP2D of TQB3006 tablets in adult patients with Advanced Malignant Cancer, Baseline up to 24 months.
