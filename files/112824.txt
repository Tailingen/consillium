Study of Irinotecan Liposome Injection as Second-line Regimen in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
This study is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have progressed after platinum-based first-line therapy. Subjects will receive irinotecan liposome injection until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
DRUG: irinotecan liposome injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved partial response or complete response according to RECIST V1.1 guidelines., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), from date of the first dose to date of the first documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), from date of the first dose to date of death from any cause, From date of first dose until the date of death from any cause , assessed up to 24 months|Proportion of Patients with Symptom Improvement, Patient-reported EORTC-QLQ symptom scales, date of the first dose to 30 days after permanent treatment termination|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities, Incidence of AE, SAE and laboratory abnormalities, date of the first dose to 30 days after permanent treatment termination
PK parameters-Cmax, Cmax of total, encapsuled and free irinotecan, Cycle 1（each cycle is 14 days）|PK parameters-AUC, AUClast, AUCinf of total, encapsuled and free irinotecan, Cycle 1（each cycle is 14 days）|PK parameters-others, tmax, tlast, t1/2 of total, encapsuled and free irinotecan, Cycle 1（each cycle is 14 days）
Patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed after platinum-based first-line therapy will be enrolled in this study. Patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection at 70 mg/m\^2 intravenously, over 90 min on Days 1 of every 14-day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Imaging assessments will be conducted every three cycles to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection as second-line regimen in patients with SCLC.
