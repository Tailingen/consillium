A Clinical Study of CHT101 in CD70-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
Evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD70-targeting UCAR-T cells in the treatment of CD70-positive advanced solid tumors.
Relapsed / Refractory Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: CHT101
Safety and Tolerability, Treatment-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 28 days|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR, SD after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 28 days|Progress-free survival(PFS), PFS will be assessed from the first CD70 UCAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression (Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 2 years|Overall survival (OS ), OS will be assessed from the first CD70 UCAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 3 years|pharmacokinetics (PK), Concentration levels of CD70+ CAR-T cells, 6 months|Pharmacodynamics (PD), Concentration levels of CD70 U CAR-T-related serum cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 6 months
4 planned dose cohorts will be evaluated during dose escalation phase. The dose expansion will be initiated after SRC (safety review committee) review the avaliable safety, PK and preliminary efficacy data.
