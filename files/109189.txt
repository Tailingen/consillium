Study of Genistein in Pediatric Oncology Patients (UVA-Gen001)
Toxicities related to pediatric cancer treatment can lead to significant illness, organ damage, treatment delays, increased health care cost, and decrease in quality of life. Such toxicities are largely due to tissue damage sustained by chemotherapy, and strategies designed to limit such cellular damage to normal tissues may reduce therapy-related morbidity and mortality. In addition to their in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects, naturally occurring soy isoflavones have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and have been shown to reduce side effects of therapy in adult oncology clinical trials. This study will examine the effect of genistein, the major isoflavone component in soybeans and the most extensively studied of the soy isoflavones, on short-term side effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in pediatric cancer patients. Subjects will be randomized to receive either: a) 30 mg genistein daily throughout chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2 and placebo during chemotherapy Cycles 3 and 4; or b) placebo daily during chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2 and 30 mg genistein daily during chemotherapy Cycles 3 and 4. Investigators hypothesize that subjects will have fewer short-term therapy-related side effects during cycles of chemotherapy given in conjunction with genistein supplementation than cycles given with placebo.

This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones on the short term untoward effects of myelosuppressive chemotherapy used to treat pediatric cancers. Newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 1-21 years will be registered to the study and informed consent will be obtained prior to any study-related procedures. Stratification will be based on length of chemotherapy cycles, between 14 day and 21 day cycles. Within strata registered subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two schedules:

Arm A: Subjects will receive genistein daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and placebo during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

Arm B: Subjects will receive placebo daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and genistein during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy during each cycle with clinical labs, cytokine panels, and physical exams. Drug compliance will be monitored by use of a patient diary as well as monitoring of serum genistein levels. Adverse events will be monitored starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 through 30 days following the last day of protocol therapy (genistein/placebo).
