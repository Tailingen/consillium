Effect of Dill in Thyroiditis and Nodular Goiter Patients
The aim of the study was to investigate the functional and morphological effects of Anethum graveolens L. in patients with thyroiditis and nodular goiter by evaluating hormone levels, anti-Inflammatory markers and comparing thyroid nodule sizes measured by ultrasonography for 90 days.

The effect of Anethum graveolens L. was evaluated in euthyroid goiter patients diagnosed with benign thyroid nodule via fine needle aspiration biopsy. Aerial parts of Anethum graveolens L. were dried and grinded to yield a fine powder. Size 1 hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsules were filled with 300 mg powder. Placebo was prepared in the same manner using maltodextrin. Patients were suggested to take 3 pills a day. Blood samples were collected at the initial and the final day for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-Tg) and C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis. Nodule sizes were also measured at the beginning and at the end of the trial with ultrasonography to identify the changes and effectiveness of dill dosage forms.

After 90 days in the study, the status of TSH, fT3, fT4, anti-TPO and CRP levels were examined in the group with and without Anethum graveolens L..

Again, after the study, the size of thyroid nodules was evaluated in the group who received and did not receive Anethum graveolens L. by ultrasonography.
