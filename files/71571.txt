Thai Cancer Anemia Study (TCAS) is a prospective survey that will track anemia management in an adult cancer population. This survey is not intended to interfere with standard medical practices for handling anemia. Information on laboratory values including target and achieved hemaglobin (Hb) levels during chemotherapy cycles, use of blood transfusions, iron supplementation, and epoetin will be collected in addition to information on cancer status and treatment. Data on the level that triggers clinicians to decide on the need for anemia therapy will also be collected. Each patient included in the survey will be followed for six months. Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
