Daily Imaging, Target Identification, and Simulated Computed Tomography-Based Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy Workflow in a Novel Ring Gantry Radiotherapy Device
The investigators propose here to evaluate the feasibility of a novel cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) workflow on the Halcyon device.
Cancer of Pancreas|Cancer of Pelvis|Cancer of Abdomen|Cancer of Thorax
DEVICE: Ring gantry kV-CBCT combined with linear accelerator
Feasibility of the device as measured by successful completion of the full CBCT-guided online ART workflow, from volumetric imaging through phantom delivery in at least 90% of attempted fractions, Completion of ART workflow in all enrolled participants (estimated to be 30 months)
