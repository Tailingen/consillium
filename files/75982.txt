Influence of Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in the Value of Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte Subsets Among Thoracic Cancer
This study is an observation, single center study to evaluate the alternations and prognostic value of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) in patients diagnosed with thoracic cancers, including lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and thymic epithelial carcinoma underwent radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.
