Investigating Cardiovascular Adverse Events Related to Cancer Treatment
Cisplatin, anthracyclines, bleomycin and trastuzumab can cause severe cardiovascular or pulmonary toxicity. Why some patients are susceptible to extreme toxicity of cancer treatment is largely unknown. Unraveling extreme cardiovascular toxic responses in cancer patients may help understand the pathophysiology of cardiovascular toxicity of these agents and help in understanding the more subtle, long-term cardiovascular side effects that affect a larger part of cancer survivors. With induced pluripotent stem cells we will obtain patient-derived cells to recapitulate and mimic and study pathological (cardiovascular) responses and (cardiovascular) toxicity in vitro.
