Effects of Creatine Supplementation in Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that creatine will accelerate adaptations associated with exercise in breast cancer survivors recently completing chemotherapy.

Change in strength in breast cancer survivors, Participants will be evaluated for knee extensor strength via isometric maximum voluntary contraction at approximately 60Â° knee flexion., From baseline to 12 weeks|Change in functional capacity in breast cancer survivors, Functional exercise capacity will be assessed via the 6 minute walk test (6MWT)., From baseline to 12 weeks
Change in intramuscular creatine and altering energy storage., Muscle Creatine, Phosphocreatine, and Adenosine-triphosphate content will be assessed in vivo by 31P-MRS using a whole body 3.0T MRI scanner., From baseline to 12 weeks|Change in muscle cross sectional area, Magnetic resonance imaging will be used to capture the mid-thigh cross section., From baseline to 12 weeks
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of creatine supplementation in modulating strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors that have recently completed chemotherapy. The primary hypothesis for this objective is that creatine will lead to significantly greater gains in strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors compared to exercise alone. The secondary objective is to determine if supplemental creatine can increase intramuscular storage of creatine and alter energy storage. The hypothesis for this objective is that creatine supplementation will significantly increase intramuscular concentrations of creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the vastus lateralis (VL) compared to controls. The secondary hypothesis for this objective is that the creatine group will have significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area and significantly lower intramuscular fat compared to controls. The final objective for this study is to test the hypothesis that creatine supplementation will improve body composition in breast cancer survivors.
