Diagnostic and Prognostic Accuracy of FDHT-PET and Liquid Biopsies in Prostate Cancer
Depending on the cohort of the study the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy and health economics considerations of \[18F\]-fluoro-5α-dihydrotestosterone (FDHT)- positron emission tomography (PET) and/or circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients are studied.
