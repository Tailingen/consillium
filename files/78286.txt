131-I-TM-601 Study in Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
This drug is being developed to treat a type of brain cancer, glioma. This study was developed to evaluate the safety, time to disease progression and survival rates after treatment.

Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 131-I-TM-601 administered intracavitary to patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, 28 days post last dose|Determine the toxicity of a three (3) and six (6) dose cycle of 131-I-TM-601 administrations into the tumor resection site of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, 28 days post last dose and then at 3 month intervals from first dose, until disease progression|Evaluate the 6 and 12-month rate of progression and survival of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with a three (3) or six (6) dose cycle of 131-I-TM-601, at 3 month intervals from first dose administration, until disease progression|Evaluate the overall time to progression and death of patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with either a three (3) or six (6) dose cycle of 131-I-TM-601, at 3 month intervals until disease progression
Evaluate if either a three (3) or six (6) dose cycle of 131-I-TM-601 affects Quality of Life, 3 month intervals until disease progression
This phase II trial was designed in two sequences. The first sequence, which is now complete to accrual was an open-label, dose escalation, multi-dose study and treated 12 evaluable patients with high-grade glioma.

The second sequence is currently open and accruing eligible subjects with high-grade glioma. The trial is an open-label, randomized study and will accrue a total of 54 evaluable patients. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 3 or 6 injections of 131-I labeled TM-601 (131-I-TM-601), in weekly intervals at the dose determined in the first sequence of the trial. Patients will undergo debulking surgery and placement of a ventricular access device into the tumor cavity for administration of 131I-TM-601. Patients who participated in the first sequence are not eligible to participate in the second sequence of the study.

High-grade gliomas include; glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma or gliosarcoma.

Patients will undergo follow-up clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments, at defined intervals, until 12 months after the first study dose.
