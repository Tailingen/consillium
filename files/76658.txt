Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs (SAEs), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)., Based on incidence of adverse events (AE) using NCI-CTCAE v5.0 and ASTCT criteria, Start of SCG101 infusion until disease progression or 12 months post infusion|The preliminary clinical efficacy of SCG101, including objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), time to response (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)., Per mRECIST and iRECIST, Start of SCG101 infusion until disease progression or 12 months post infusion|Change in pharmacodynamics markers (PD) before and after SCG101 infusion, Based on changes in serum liver function markers, including HBsAg, ALT, AST, and AFP, Start of SCG101 infusion until disease progression, an average of 24 months|Persistences of viral vector copy number (VCN) after SCG101 infusion, Start of SCG101 infusion until disease progression, an average of 24 months
