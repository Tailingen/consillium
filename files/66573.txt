CD19/CD22 CAR-T Cells in Adults With R/R ALL or NHL
This study examines the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of anti-CD19 /CD22 CAR T cells (KQ-2002)manufactured on-site in adults with relapsed or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or CD19+ B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma.

Patients will undergo screening, leukapheresis (cell collection), lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by the anti-CD19 KQ-2002 CAR T cell infusion. The lymphodepleting chemotherapy is administered over 3 days IV to prepare the body for the CAR T cells. The CAR-T cells are infused between 2-7 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. Patients will be followed for two years after the cell infusion on the study and for up to 15 years to monitor for potential long term side effects of cell therapy.
