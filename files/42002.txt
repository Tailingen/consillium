Study of the CHK1 Inhibitor BBI-355, an EcDNA-directed Therapy (ecDTx), in Subjects with Tumors with Oncogene Amplifications
BBI-355 is an oral, potent, selective checkpoint kinase 1 (or CHK1) small molecule inhibitor in development as an ecDNA (extrachromosomal DNA) directed therapy (ecDTx). This is a first-in-human, open-label, 3-part, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety profile and identify the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of BBI-355 administered as a single agent or in combination with select therapies.

DRUG: BBI-355|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Futibatinib
Frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of BBI-355 as a single agent and in combination with each of the following agents: erlotinib or futibatinib, TEAEs will be assessed and severity assigned by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0., Start of Cycle 1 until 30 days following last dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BBI-355 as a single agent and in combination with either erlotinib or futibatinib, The MTD and/or RP2D of BBI-355 as a single agent and in combination with either erlotinib or futibatinib, will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until 30 days following last dose (each cycle is 28 days)
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Trough observed plasma concentration (Ctrough) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib, Trough observed plasma concentration (Ctrough) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib, Time to Cmax (Tmax) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib, Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of BBI-355, erlotinib, and futibatinib will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Anti-tumor activity of BBI-355 as a single agent and in combination with either erlotinib or futibatinib, Tumor response will be determined by RECISTv1.1., 1-2 years: Start of Cycle 1 until documented disease progression or death (each cycle is 28 days)
BBI-355 is administered orally in various dosing schedules to subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-resectable solid tumors harboring oncogene amplifications, whose disease has progressed despite all standard therapies or for whom no further standard or clinically acceptable therapy exists.
