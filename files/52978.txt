The Utility of 18F-DOPA-PET in the Treatment of Recurrent High-grade Glioma
This proposal is for a pilot study comparing volumes of 18F-DOPA-PET avidity with contrast enhancement and T2 FLAIR on MRI. Investigators then plan to compare patterns of failure with target volumes, pre-treatment MRI changes and pre-treatment 18F-DOPA-PET.
Glioma
DRUG: Fluorine F 18 Fluorodopa|RADIATION: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography
Proportion of Participants With Progression-free Survival, measured by reviewing 18F-DOPA-PET and conventional MRI with historical controls, up to 3 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival from initial diagnosis: Time from initial diagnosis to death from any cause censoring patients alive at their last follow-up, assessed up to 2 years from date of randomization, From date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause censoring patients alive at their last follow-up; patients assessed for survival up to 2 years from randomization. Diagnosis date occurs prior to randomization by up to 15 years|Toxicity, Rate of Grade 3 or Higher Treatment Related to Toxicities, The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site:(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm), up to 2 years|Quality of Life Brief Fatigue Index (BFI) Change From Baseline, Measured by change from baseline to 3 month evaluation in MDA-BFI global fatigue score. Brief fatigue index is a QOL questionnaire with scores ranging from 0, no fatigue, to 10, as bad as you can imagine., Baseline and 3 months|Re-operative Count, Count of patients that receive re-operation post re-irradiation, up to 2 years|Quality of Life MDASI-BT Change From Baseline, QOL will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and fatigue will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Brief Fatigue Inventory.Measured by change from baseline to 3 month evaluation in MDASI-BT overall symptom distress score. Scores may range from 0 to 10, with 0 being 'Not present' and 10 being 'As bad as imaginable'., Baseline and 3 months
