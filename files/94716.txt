Using Technology to Improve Physical Activity Levels Among Postmenopausal Women (The Active & Aware Study)
Women who are overweight or do not exercise are at higher risk for breast cancer after menopause. This study will test a new electronic device that measures the body's movement and works alongside a website to help women increase their physical activity level. If effective, this system could be tested in larger studies aiming to reduce breast cancer risk by reducing or preventing obesity.
