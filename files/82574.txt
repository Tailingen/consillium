A Study of Chidamide Plus Endocrine in Maintenance Treatment of HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer After First-line Chemotherapy
To explore the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with endocrine for maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy for HR+/HER2- breast cancer
HR Positive HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Chidamide
Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease, 2 year
Objective response rate, Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1). The percentage of patients who achieved CR and PR was defined as objective response rate (ORR), 2 year|Disease control rate, his means that in all patients with a tumor who receive a certain treatment, the tumor shrinks or stays stable, and stays that way for a certain amount of time, 2 year|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the rate of patients who achieved complete response, partial response, and stable disease for \>= 24 weeks as the best response of treatment., 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first study treatment administration to death from any cause, 2 year|Adverse events (AE), The level of the adverse event (AE) is analyzed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (version 5.0)., 2 year
