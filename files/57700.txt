Neoadjuvant Treatment Associated With Maintenance Therapy by Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy in Patients With Resectable Head and Neck Mucosal Melanoma
The main objective will be to estimate the disease free survival (DFS) of patients with resectable head and neck mucosal melanomas treated by neo-adjuvant anti-PD1 (in combination or not with lenvatinib) followed by surgery, radiotherapy and maintenance immunotherapy in order to compare it to historical DFS results of this kind of patients treated by surgery and radiotherapy. Our primary end-point will be disease-free survival at 2 years
