Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Interest in the Follow Up of Colorectal Cancer Stage II and III
The follow up of colorectal cancer after curative surgery has to find loco-regional relapses or synchronous metastases, and to detect adenomas and new cancer on the rest of the colon.

The increase of survival after relapse of the colorectal cancer depends on the possibility of curative action or after chemotherapy response.

This is a Phase III open-labeled, multicenter, multidisciplinary, randomised study, comparing 2 arms of 188 patients (i.e. 376 total patients).

Study Period (date of first inclusion/last inclusion): 3 years.

Follow Up: 3 years.

The primary objective is the evaluation of PET performance in the earlier relapse detection of the colorectal cancer relapse in comparison with conventional control (including carcinoembryonic \[CEA\] levels and other classic radiological exams).
