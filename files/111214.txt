Phase II Docetaxel / Carboplatin / XRT + Surgical Resection in Stage III NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to assess how well this particular combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery works to help people with locally advanced lung cancer, how well PET scans indicates whether someone has responded to chemotherapy and radiation, and gene expression patterns related to outcomes in patients with locally advanced lung cancer who receive this treatment regimen.

2 Year Overall Survival After a Combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and Surgery in Stage III NSCLC Patients Following the Protocol Therapy., Patients were analyzed for 2 year overall survival after receiving trimodality (chemotherapy/radiation/surgery) therapy for stage III NSCLC. Patients had a chest x-ray and a doctor visit with a physical examination every 3 months after completion of all therapy for 3 years then every 6 months for 3 years to look for evidence of recurrent disease and to follow survival. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 6, 12, 18 months after completion of all therapy and then yearly for 3 years or as clinically indicated to evaluate for relapse., Two years
Change in Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans Pre and Post Chemotherapy and Radiation in This Trial and Ability to Predict Surgical Resection Rate, Progression-free Survival and 2 Year Overall Survival, The change in standardized uptake values (SUV)max on PET scans obtained pre- and after 5 weeks of combined chemo-radiation for patients enrolled on the trial were evaluated for ability to predict outcomes including complete resection at time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of the chemo-radiation), progression-free survival and 2 year overall survival. The mean SUVmax pre chemoradiation minus the mean SUVmax post-radiation is reported., baseline, 5 weeks after combined chemo-radiation
Exploratory Analysis of Relation of Gene Expression Patterns to Outcomes in Patients With Locally Advanced Lung Cancer Who Receive This Treatment Regimen, This analysis of gene expression patterns related to outcomes in patients with locally advanced lung cancer who received this treatment regimen was not performed due to lack of funding., Specimen collected at time of surgery
