Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin Plus Bevacizumab as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Untreated Unresectable Liver-only Metastases From Colorectal Cancer

No previous treatment.

The 21 day cycle of treatment will be given for four courses before being reassessed by MRI/CT for resectability of their liver metastases.

Those patients with stable disease or partial response, but are not yet resectable will continue for a further four courses of treatment before reassessment.

Patients whose liver metastases have become resectable will proceed to surgery after a 6 week break from the last administration of Capecitabine (8 weeks from the last administration of Bevacizumab).

A further four courses of treatment will be administered post-operatively to commence at least 8 weeks after surgery and when the patient is well recovered and healed.
