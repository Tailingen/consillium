A Single-arm, Multicenter Exploratory Clinical Trial of Anlotinib Combined With TQB2450 and the SOX Regimen as First-line Treatment for Advanced Gastric Cancer With Low PD-L1 Expression
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with TQB2450 and the SOX regimen as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer with low PD-L1 expression
Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (G/GEJ) Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: anlotinib +TQB2450 + Oxaliplatin+S-1
Objective Response Rate(ORR), The RECIST1.1 standards were used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs., about 2 years
Disease Control Rate(DCR), about 2 years|Progression Free Survival(PFS), about 2 years|Duration of Response(DOR), about 2 years|1-year OS rate, about 1 year
Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in combination with TQB2450 and the SOX regimen as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer with low PD-L1 expression. Additionally, real-world data were collected from hospital-based patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-combined chemotherapy as first-line therapy for PD-L1-low advanced gastric cancer to establish an external control cohort. The efficacy outcomes between the two treatment strategies were then compared.
