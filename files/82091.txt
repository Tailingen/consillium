Analysis of Effectiveness and Safety of Teclistamab in Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
200 adult patients with multiple myeloma receiving teclistamb will be included. Effectiveness, safety, and condition of use of teclistamab in early access program (post-MA) will be assessed. Primary objective is the evaluation of overall response rate (ORR) of teclistamab according to IMWG criteria.

This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study.
