Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) of the Prostate: A Clinical Feasibility Study
The purpose of our study is to image human prostate tissue using a transrectal photoacoustic imaging probe.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Hand held transrectal Combined Ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) probe
lesion signal intensity on Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) in relation to different lesion characteristics and the surrounding tissues, measure of the lesion signal intensity on PAI in relation to different lesion characteristics and the surrounding tissues. The average signal intensity (or more specifically the SNR) of the lesions measured in dB) will be tabulated against lesion depth from the transducer, and lesion size, based on ultrasound measurements, 36 months
Measures of hypoxia in the lesion, total lesion hemoglobin concentration (HbT) at PAI and percentage SO2 (oxygen saturation) in region of interest (ROI) (average and maximum) which will be tested against lesion characteristics based on histology at pathological examination of the biopsy and/or prostatectomy specimen if the patients proceed to have radical prostatectomy performed, 36 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S):

The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess PAI-performance in a clinical setting to understand limitations of our current PAI instrumentation and to help improve the next-generation design.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

To do preliminary evaluations of oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements in order to distinguish malignant from benign prostatic tissue as a basis for future studies.
