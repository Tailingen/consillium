Thoracic Surgery Combined With Intrathoracic Hyperthermic Perfusion for Advanced Lung Cancer / Esophageal Cancer
The goal of this clinical research study is to explore whether intrathoracic hyperthermic perfusion after radical surgery could reduce local recurrence rate(13%) for advanced lung cancer / esophageal cancer. The safety of intrathoracic hyperthermic perfusion right after surgery.
