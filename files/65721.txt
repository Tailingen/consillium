Ruxolitinib Phosphate in Reducing Fatigue in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in reducing fatigue in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking a protein called Janus kinase (JAK) that is needed for cell growth and may also help control fatigue, decrease the size of lymph nodes and/or lower the number of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the blood.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Ruxolitinib Phosphate
Change in fatigue, As measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) question 3 regarding the worst fatigue in the past 24 hours. Will be analyzed in a continuous fashion., Baseline to 3 months
Proportion of patients with 2 point reductions in the BFI #3 score, Proportion of patients at 3 months versus at enrollment tabulated., Up to 3 months|20% improvement in symptoms, As measured by the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate the reduction in fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 recommendations.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate the reduction in other symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and to assess disease burden and response by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately 12 hours apart) for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
