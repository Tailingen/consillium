The Efficacy of Oral Cryotherapy in Preventing TROP2-ADC-Induced Oral Mucositis in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
The incidence of oral mucositis associated with TROP2-ADC therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer is notably high. Identifying effective preventive and therapeutic strategies is essential for enhancing patient quality of life and optimizing treatment outcomes. Oral cryotherapy has been demonstrated to be efficacious in mitigating oral mucositis induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Consequently, this study seeks to investigate the potential preventive efficacy of oral cryotherapy on TROP2-ADC-induced oral mucositis in patients with advanced breast cancer
