The study will use BOIN design for dosing cohort management to determine the MTD and RDE/RP2D. The starting dose of KH815 is 0.5 mg/kg, followed by 1.0 to 4.0 mg/kg. The investigational product will be administered on Day 1 every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion, and the first cycle of KH815 treatment is for DLT evaluation. Enrolled patients will be sequentially assigned to the planned dose levels as required by the protocol and treated with KH815 IV Q3W to observe the occurrence of treatment related AEs and dose limiting toxicities. The dose-escalation decision will be determined per discussion between Safety Review Committee and Sponsor if deemed necessary. Moreover, the SRC is also responsible for deciding the MTD and the recommended dose level for dose-expansion study.
