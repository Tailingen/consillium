Zero Ischemia Robot-Assisted MWA Assisted Suture-less Tumor Enucleation of RCC With T1 Stage
Zero ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation has been proved to enable tumor excision with relatively better renal function preservation comparing with conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a randomized clinical trial in single center. The investigators want to explore this technique to robotic surgery and add suture-less technique to T1 RCC patients in randomized clinical trial.

Zero ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation has been proved to enable tumor excision with relatively better renal function preservation comparing with conventional laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in a randomized clinical trial in single center. The investigators want to explore this technique to robotic surgery and add suture-less technique to T1 RCC patients in randomized clinical trial. This project is based on the previous research and aims to develop an approach of the combination of intraoperative real time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography technology, sutureless technology and the zero ischemia robot-Assisted tumor enucleation of the kidney. By using the real time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography technology, the current shortcomings of the zero ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation assisted tumor enucleation were overcome. The degree of elimination was monitored during surgery to avoid excessive bleeding caused by insufficient ablation during the surgery. Beside, the difficulty of zero ischemia laparoscopic radio frequency ablation is reduced, and doctors can quickly grasp the learning curve of this technology.
