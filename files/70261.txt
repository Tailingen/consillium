Whole Breast Irradiation With Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy and Simultaneously Integrated Boost for Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients
This is a phase II study. In patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer or carcinoma in situ treated by breast conserving surgery, postoperative whole breast irradiation with inversely intensity modulated radiotherapy and a simultaneous integrated boost is technically feasible. The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiation toxicity, cosmetic outcome and local control rate in a single center
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: IMRT with an simultaneous integrated boost
Radiation toxicity, first analysis will occur 2 year after accrual of all patients|Cosmetic outcome, first analysis will occur 2 year after accrual of all patients
Time to ipsilateral breast recurrence, first analysis will occur 5 year after accrual of all patients|Local recurrence rate, first analysis will occur 5 year after accrual of all patients|Disease free survival, first analysis will occur 5 year after accrual of all patients|Overall survival, first analysis will occur 5 year after accrual of all patients
