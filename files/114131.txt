Toripalimab Combined With Chemotherapy in Primary Tracheal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a single-arm, open, II phase study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab + carboplatin + paclitaxel in 15 newly diagnosed patients with tracheal malignant tumors.
Tracheal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Toripalimab
Safety: frequency of severe adverse events, The frequency of severe adverse events from the participants enrolling to 30 days after the last drug administration or 30 days after surgery or new anti-cancer therapy, which comes first., up to 5 months|Major pathologic response (MPR), MPR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy before surgery., up to 4 months
Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the time from enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date. In the event of a patient with the survival status unknown, the date when the patient is last known to be alive will be used for interpolation (censoring)., up to 60 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the enrollment of the subject to the first determination of disease progression or death of any cause according to RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first., up to 60 months|Duration of remission (DOR), According to the time from the first recording of objective remission to relapse or death from any cause determined by RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first., up to 60 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients whose best overall remission (BOR) is CR, PR or disease stable (SD) according to RECISTv1.1 evaluation, up to 60 months|Health related quality of life (HRQol), The assessment is made according to the Quality of Life Scale for Lung Cancer Patients (EORTC-QLQ-C30 \& LC13, Version 3). EORTC's QLQ-C30 \& LC13 (V3.0) is a core scale for lung cancer patients, with a total of 43 items. Among them, Item 29 and 30 are divided into seven grades, which are assigned with 1 to 7 scores according to the answer options. The other items are divided into 4 grades, up to 6 months
This is a single-arm, open, II phase study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab + carboplatin + paclitaxel in 15 newly diagnosed patients with tracheal malignant tumors.
