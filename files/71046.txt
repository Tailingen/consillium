Effect of AT7519M Alone and AT7519M Plus Bortezomib in Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether AT7519M alone or AT7519M plus bortezomib are effective treatments in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: AT7519M|DRUG: Bortezomib
To evaluate the clinical efficacy of AT7519M alone or in combination with bortezomib, Efficacy will be assessed using the International Multiple Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria, Subjects with be followed until disease progression (an average of 4 cycles per subject. i.e an average of 84 days)
Assess the type, incidence and severity of clinically significant treatment emergent adverse events as assessed by National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) V 4.03, Subjects with be followed until disease progression (an average of 4 cycles per subject, i.e an average of approximately 84 days)|To define the pharmacokinetic profile of AT7519M and bortezomib when administered alone or in combination with bortezomib, The pharmacokinetic evaluation will include the calculation of plasma clearance and elimination phase half-life for AT7519M and bortezomib, 2 cycles (i.e an average of 42 days)|To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AT7519M in combination with bortezomib, The MTD will be based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities, Subjects with be followed until disease progression (an average of 4 cycles per subject, i.e an average of approximately 84 days)
The clinical study AT7519M/0004 is an open-label multicenter study to investigate the efficacy of AT7519M alone and AT7519M in combination with bortezomib in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma (MM).
