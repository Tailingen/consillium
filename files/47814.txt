Third-line Therapy of Multiple Myeloma a Prospective Phase I /II Trial
To investigate the effect of an anti-inflammatory therapy consisting of lenalidomide in combination with pioglitazone, dexamethasone and metronomic low-dose chemotherapy with treosulfan on the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory or progressive multiple myeloma(MM).

Phase I: to determine the lenalidomide dse for the phase II part (5 mg or 10 mg or 15 mg) on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs') in the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Phase II: to determine

* response rate (primary objective)
* time to progression (TTP)
* time to partial response (TPR)
* overall survival (OS)
* quality of life
* tolerability and safety
