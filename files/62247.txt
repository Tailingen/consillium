In Vitro Models of Liver and Pancreatic Cancer
The primary objective is to develop an in vitro model of cancer for laboratory study using liver, biliary and pancreatic cancer tissue. The secondary objective is to study the genetic and cellular biology of cancer of the liver, biliary tract and the pancreas. As well the investigators hope to compare molecular and cellular biology of cancer cells with normal cells as well as potentially test the efficacy of current and future anti-cancer therapies.

Samples will be collected from tissue that has been resected as part of the treatment for a patient diagnosed with liver, bile duct or pancreas cancer.

GENETIC: Organoid in vitro culture
Number of tumour-derived organoids successfully cultured in vitro for a minimum of 3 months., 3 years
