Low-dose Oral Cyclophosphamide and Methotrexate Maintenance for Hormone Receptor-negative Early Breast Cancer
This randomized, phase III trial was designed to test the efficacy of a low-dose chemotherapy-maintenance regimen, hypothesized to have anti-angiogenic activity, administered following standard chemotherapy in patients with early breast cancer whose tumors are hormone receptor negative.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Methotrexate
Disease-free Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where disease-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first appearance of one of the following: invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, invasive contralateral breast cancer, second (non-breast) invasive cancer, or death without cancer event; or censored at date of last follow-up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 6.9 years
Overall Survival, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause; or censored at date last known alive., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 6.9 years|Distant Recurrence-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where distant recurrence-free Interval is defined as the time from randomization to invasive breast cancer recurrence at distant site, or invasive contralateral breast cancer; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 6.9 years|Breast Cancer-free Interval, Estimated percentage of patients alive and disease-free at 5 years from randomization, where breast cancer-free interval is defined as the time from randomization to invasive breast cancer recurrence at local, regional, or distant site, or invasive contralateral breast cancer; or censored at date of last follow up., 5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 6.9 years
PURPOSE:

* Evaluate a low-dose cyclophosphamide and methotrexate chemotherapy-maintenance regimen in early breast cancer.
* Compare the disease-free survival, overall survival, and systemic disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

OUTLINE:

This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, menopausal status (pre vs post), and approved induction chemotherapy (anthracycline and cyclophosphamide vs other agents). Treatment duration is 12 months of low-dose chemotherapy-maintenance regimen (CM-maintenance) vs no chemotherapy-maintenance regimen (no-CM) following standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years, and yearly follow-up thereafter.
