Study of Peretinoin for Suppressing Recurrence of HCV-positive HCC
The purpose of this study is to verify the superiority of NIK-333 (Peretinoin) to placebo in inhibiting the recurrence of HCV-positive HCC in patients showing complete cure of the disease, with the recurrence-free survival as the primary endpoint, in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study.
Hepatic Neoplasm Malignant Recurrent
DRUG: NIK-333(peretinoin)|DRUG: Placebo
Recurrence-free Survival, HCC recurrence was defined as the appearance of new intrahepatic lesions which was confirmed based on findings of hypervascularity (nodules enhanced in the arterial phase and washout in the late phase) by dynamic CT images, or a new extrahepatic metastasis. Recurrence of intrahepatic HCC was evaluated by an independent image reading committee.

RFS was defined as the time from randomization to HCC recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For subjects who terminated the study without HCC recurrence or death, RFS was censored at the day of the latest dynamic CT examination., Date of randomization to the date of recurrence of HCC (followed every 12 weeks) or death (whichever occurs first)
Disease-free Survival, DFS was defined as the time from randomization to HCC recurrence, death from any cause or occurrence of secondary cancer (malignant tumors other than HCC), whichever occurred first. For subjects who terminated the study without HCC recurrence, death, or occurrence of secondary cancer, DFS was censored at the day of the latest dynamic CT examination., Date of randomization to the date of recurrence of HCC (followed every 12 weeks), death, or secondary cancer (malignant tumors other than HCC)(whichever occurs first)|Time to Recurrence, TTR was defined as the time from randomization to HCC recurrence. For subjects who terminated the study without HCC recurrence, TTR was censored at the day of the latest dynamic CT examination., Date of randomization to the date of recurrence of HCC(followed every 12 weeks)
