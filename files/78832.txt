No Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy
The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of no use of antimicrobial prophylaxis during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma.
Stomach Neoplasms
OTHER: No Antimicrobial prophylaxis
Postoperative surgical site infection, Incidence of surgical site infection, including superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space infection, until postoperative 1 month, Within postoperative 1 month
Postoperative morbidity and mortality, Occurence of postoperative complications or deaths until postoperative 1 months or during hospitalization. Postoperative complications will be assessed with respect to types and severity., Within postoperative 1 month or during hospitalization|Hospital stay, The duration of hospital stay from the operation to hospital discharge, Up to 1month after operation
This is a phase II clinical trial investigating the postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) rates after no antimicrobial prophylaxis use during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. Target ranges of SSI rates after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy were determined based on the previous reports and our data. If SSI rates are within the target range, the investigators will proceed to a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of no antimicrobial use for laparoscopic gastrectomy.
