Standardized Extract of Cultured Lentinula Edodes Mycelia (AHCCÂ®) in Ovarian Cancer Patients on Adjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a pilot phase, randomized, double-blinded feasibility pilot study of AHCC in participants with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Epithelial Carcinoma|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma|Peritoneal Carcinoma
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: AHCC|DRUG: Chemotherapy|OTHER: Placebo
Proportion of participants randomized to taking AHCC or placebo during adjuvant chemotherapy, Study activation to randomization of 20th participant, which is estimated to be up to 1 year post study activation|Time required to randomize 20 participants, Study activation to randomization of 20th participant, which is estimated to be up to 1 year post study activation|Proportion of participants that complete study treatment, First dose through Cycle 3-6 post adjuvant chemotherapy; each cycle is 3 weeks
Proportion of participants that adhere to taking study treatment, First dose through Cycle 3-6 post adjuvant chemotherapy; each cycle is 3 weeks|Adherence to taking study treatment for each participant, First dose through Cycle 3-6 post adjuvant chemotherapy; each cycle is 3 weeks|Proportion of participants that adhere to completing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O), All health-related quality of life assessments use a 5 point Likert-type scale and is scored based on a manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored; the higher the score, the better the quality of life., Baseline through 30d post last dose|Proportion of participants that adhere to completing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group - Neurotoxicity (FACT/ GOG-NTX), All health-related quality of life assessments use a 5 point Likert-type scale and is scored based on a manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored; the higher the score, the better the quality of life., Baseline through 30d post last dose|Proportion of participants that adhere to completing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), All health-related quality of life assessments use a 5 point Likert-type scale and is scored based on a manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored; the higher the score, the better the quality of life., Baseline through 30d post last dose|Participant experience self-reported in the acceptability questionnaire compared to self-reported anticipated acceptability, The acceptability questionnaire measures the following ordinal data listed in order of most acceptable to least acceptable: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree., Baseline and at end of treatment (about 9-18 weeks post adjuvant chemotherapy)
This is a pilot phase, randomized, double-blinded feasibility pilot study of AHCC in participants with ovarian cancer. 20 women who plan to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer at the University of California (UC) Davis Health Comprehensive Cancer Center will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive AHCC (3 grams by mouth daily) or placebo during standard of care chemotherapy. HRQOL and adverse events will be assessed at baseline and during chemotherapy. The hypothesis is that a randomized controlled trial of AHCC supplementation for ovarian cancer patients on adjuvant chemotherapy is feasible.
