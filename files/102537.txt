A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of XmAb24306 in Combination With Cevostamab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of XmAb24306 in combination with cevostamab in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) who have received a minimum of three prior treatments, including at least one immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), one proteasome inhibitor (PI), and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.
