Randomised Trial of Volume of Post-operative Radiotherapy Given to Adult Patients With eXtremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy to a smaller area of tissue surrounding the tumor is as effective as giving radiation therapy to a wider area of tissue surrounding the tumor in treating soft tissue sarcoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving external-beam radiation therapy to a small area of tissue surrounding the tumor to see how well it works compared with giving external-beam radiation therapy to a wider area of tissue surrounding the tumor in treating patients who have undergone surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the arms, hands, legs, or feet.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine if reduced volume adjuvant radiotherapy increases limb function without compromising local control in patients with previously resected extremity soft tissue sarcoma.

Secondary

* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the overall level of disability in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor grade (1 vs 2 vs 3), adequacy of surgical clearance (R0 vs R1), and treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I (control): Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), including full margins, once daily 5 days a week for 6Â½ weeks .
* Arm II: Patients undergo EBRT as in arm I but only reduced margins are included.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
