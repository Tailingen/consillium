HCT With PTCy in Higher-risk MDS
This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide with myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The efficacy of the treatment will be measured in terms of the GVHD-free, relapse-free survival.

The secondary end points of the study include engraftment, relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, graft-versus-host disease, donor chimerism, immune reconstitution, infections, and survivals (overall and event-free).
