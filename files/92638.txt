Study on the Evolution of Genes Mutation Related With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
Mutations of tumor-related genes are dynamic. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells often are obviously more invasive in case of recurrence. The great majority of relapses may be associated with secondary mutation in the GIST related genes. Full gene sequences of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1, which is extracted from the specimen cells of repeated surgical resection or biopsy tissue in GIST patients with postoperative recurrence, are analyzed with the screening-sequencing approach, in order to investigate the characteristics and variations associated with the different gene mutations of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1 in GIST patients and be likely to find out the evolutionary pattern, try to learn the facts about the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the GIST related genes, make a survey of any association of c-KIT、PDGFRA and DOG1 gene mutations and provide the basis for seeking molecular marker of GIST for monitoring course of disease, and offer a theoretical basis and new therapeutic strategies for application of clinical treatment.
