A Study to Assess AMG 701 Montherapy, or in Combination With Pomalidomide, With or Without, Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The primary purpose of the phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of AMG 701 monotherapy to identify the RP2D for AMG 701 monotherapy followed by a dose-confirmation part to gather further safety data for AMG 701 monotherapy at the RP2D in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In addition, this study will include a sequential dose exploration part to identify the RP2D of AMG 701 in combination with pomalidomide, with and without dexamethasone (AMG 701-P+/-d). Phase 2 will consist of the dose-expansion part to gain further efficacy and safety experience with AMG 701 monotherapy in adult subjects with RRMM.
