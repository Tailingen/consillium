Role of the MET Oncogene in Human Colorectal Cancer - A Translational Study
The MET oncogene is known to sustain the Trousseau's syndrome in murine experimental models, featuring association of carcinogenesis with a blood procoagulant disorder. MET is frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer, a tumor where venous thromboembolism (VTE) may occur in association with poor prognosis, but the biological and genetic factors that cause VTE are still obscure.

The Investigators propose to study whether in patients harboring a surgically resectable colorectal cancer the MET oncogene is expressed and may be associated with a blood thrombophilic condition that favors the onset of VTE.

These data would have two main implications: (i) for the first time, a direct genetic link between the MET oncogene and a procoagulant disorder would be demonstrated in humans; (ii) the procoagulant alterations would have diagnostic/prognostic significance for the identification of patients at risk for poor outcome, and implementation of appropriate therapeutic protocols.
