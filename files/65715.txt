A Study of SHR-4602 in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, three-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SHR-4602 and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy in HER2 expressing or mutated advanced malignant solid tumor subjects.
