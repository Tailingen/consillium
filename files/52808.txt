PET Imaging of Patients With Melanoma and Malignant Brain Tumors Using an 124I-labeled cRGDY Silica Nanomolecular Particle Tracer: A Microdosing Study
Current tests to detect cancer, including CAT scans and MRI scans, are limited. PET scans use special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe.

The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.
Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Metastatic Melanoma Patients|Malignant Brain Tumors
DRUG: PET scan with 124I-cRGDY-PEG-dots
Conduct pilot single-dose studies of 124I-cRGDY-PEG-dotsâ€ , in a limited number of human melanoma and brain tumor patients to characterize biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic stability., 2 years
