Feasibility and Benefits of Reflexology in the Prevention of Neuropathy Induced by Oxaliplatin in Colorectal Cancer
The management of colorectal cancer often requires oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, either as part of curative treatment plans or exclusively in palliative situations. Oxaliplatin therefore plays a key role in the management of colorectal cancer. In addition to its digestive and hematological toxicity, oxaliplatin frequently induces chronic, often limiting, sensitive peripheral neuropathy.

Only early discontinuation of oxaliplatin can limit the risk of clinically limiting neurotoxicity (grade â‰¥ 3).

In oncology, managing the side-effects of treatment is an essential objective of supportive care, and is open to a variety of complementary medicines, including reflexology. This technique, derived from traditional Chinese medicine, involves stimulating reflex points on the arch of the foot.

OTHER: Foot reflexology
number of sessions performed, at least 50% of patients included and realized at least 70% of reflexology sessions over the 6-month treatment., 6 months
concordance of peripheral neuropathy evaluation, peripheral neuropathy evaluation between physician's assessment and programming nurse's assessment, every month until 6 months
This first monocentric, prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate if the intervention is feasible in routine clinical practice for patients initiating bimonthly oxaliplatin chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. It will also provide initial estimates of the parameters needed to measure efficacy and impact on patient quality of life.

Patients will receive a reflexology session with each cycle of chemotherapy, and will be assessed during all the treatment period.
