Apatinib in Refractory Colorectal Cancer
Limited agents have been approved after standard first and second line treatment. Regorafenib and Trifluridine/Tipiracil (TAS-102) are still not approved in China.Apatinib has shown significant efficacy in refractory advanced gastric cancer regarding PFS and OS with controllable toxicity.This study is aimed to explore the efficacy,safety as well as predictive biomarker in advanced colorectal cancer failed to standard therapy in Chinese population.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: apatinib
Progression-free Survival(PFS), PFS was defined as the time from assignment to disease progression radiological/clinical or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of assignment to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From assignment of the first subject until 40 death events observed, up to 2 years.|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR) + total number of Stable Disease (SD), From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019|Objective response rate(ORR), The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR), From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019|Quality of life, The general well-being of participants, outlining negative and positive features of life., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019|relationship between the tumor molecular burden & gene mutation and the drug efficacy., The tumor molecular clones and gene mutations of 1021 tumor related genes will be detected by next-generation sequencing,which will be matched with the CT scanning ., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019.|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, adverse events will be assessed according to CTCAE v4.0, including hematological and non-hematological adverse events. Non-hematological adverse events will be collected by patients reported outcomes questionaire. The adverse events of interest include hypertension,hand-foot syndrome,proteinuria,hoarseness,rash,etc.The dose reduction and drug discontinuance due to adverse events will also be recorded., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.The last participant will be recruited before Mar 30,2019.
