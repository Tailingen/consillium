TR1801-ADC in Patients With Tumors That Express c-Met
First-in-human, Phase 1 study to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TR1801-ADC in patients with select solid tumors that express c-Met.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BIOLOGICAL: TR1801-ADC
Characterize safety of TR1801-ADC in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies which express c-Met, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, 4 years|Establish maximum tolerated dose, Number of participants with protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity, 3.5 years
Evaluate pharmacokinetics of TR1801-ADC, Analyze blood plasma concentrations, 4 years|Immunogenicity, Assess anti-drug antibodies of TR1801-ADC, 4 years|Evaluate clinical activity of TR1801-ADC, Assess objective response rate in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1), 5 years
First-in-human, Phase 1, multiple dose-dose escalation study designed to determine safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose of TR1801-ADC in patients with select solid tumors that express c-Met. This study will also assess pharmacokinetics (PK), anti-tumor activity, and correlation between clinical outcomes (safety, anti-tumor activity, and PK) and c-Met expression.
