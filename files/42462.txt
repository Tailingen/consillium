Study of ILX651 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label study of ILX651 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in this study that is expected to last 18 months. All patients will be treated with ILX651 administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 consecutive days once every 21 days. The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate. The secondary objectives are to determine the progression free survival, duration of response, time to tumor progression, survival, safety/tolerability of ILX651, and to evaluate pharmacokinetic profile.
