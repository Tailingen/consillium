The Impact of a Patient Education Intervention for Ambulatory Oncology Patients
This study will test the impact of newly created and available symptom management patient education brochures on symptom burden \[measured via the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS)\], health-related quality of life \[measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30)\], patient satisfaction with care \[measured by the Princess Margaret Hospital Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PMH/PSQ-MD 29) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Patient Satisfaction with Radiation or Chemotherapy (EORTC PatSat35 RT/CT)\], self-efficacy, and knowledge at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Canada. These brochures are designed for oncology patients in order to provide a response to symptom screening and are now a standard part of care. Symptom screening occurs at each visit as patients are required to fill out ESAS, that asks about their experience with the occurence and severity of symptoms. The intent of the patient brochures are to acknowledge the screen, validate the symptom and provide knowledge of self-management strategies for symptoms. The brochures also provide information to patients about when and how to seek further help from their oncology team. The hope is that patients will experience a useful response to their screen with all levels of symptoms-from 0-10 in severity

It is hypothesized that the addition of patient education symptom management pamphlets on 7 of the symptoms measured by ESAS (appetite, nausea and vomiting, depression, anxiety, fatigue, dyspnea and pain) will provide new and meaningful information which will build knowledge, validate the patient's experience of the symptom, lead to increased satisfaction with care, improved self efficacy in managing and accessing help for the symptom and therefore improved health related quality of life.

BEHAVIORAL: Instructed to read patient education pamphlets
Impact of Patient Pamphlets on knowledge, Participants who are asked to read patient education pamphlets on symptoms will complete our survey subsequent to reading which test their knowledge about pamphlets. We will be about to conclude later whether reading the pamphlets was correlated with greater knowledge when compared to the control group who did not read the pamphlets., approx. 6 months for data collection
Impact of patient education pamphlets on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), This study will also assess whether the intervention group (that read the pamphlets) differed from the control group (who did not read the pamphlets) in terms of health-related quality of life., approx. 6 months for data collection
Impact of patient pamphlets on self-efficacy, This study will assess whether the intervention group (who read the patient education pamphlets) differed from the control group (that did not read the pamphlets) in terms of self-efficacy. More specifically, this study will evaluate self-efficacy in terms of patient confidence in managing their symptoms., approx 6 months for data collection|Impact of patient education pamphlets on patient satisfaction with care, This study will evaluate whether the intervention group (who read patient education pamphlets) differed from the control group (who did not), in terms of patient satisfaction with care. We predict that patients who read the education pamphlets will be more satisfied with their care., approx. 6 months for data collection
