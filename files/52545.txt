Phase 3 Study of Gedatolisib as First-Line Treatment for Patients With HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer (VIKTORIA-2)
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib plus fulvestrant and CDK4/6 Inhibitors for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Arm A: Gedatolisib + Palbociclib or Ribociclib + Fulvestrant|DRUG: Arm B: Palbociclib or Ribociclib + Fulvestrant
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer

PFS is defined as the time from randomization to death or the first documented progression, whichever occurs first, confirmed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR), From date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 48 months
Overall Survival (OS) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, OS is defined as the length of time from randomization until the date of death from any cause method, where PFS is defined as the time from randomization to death or the first documented progression, whichever occurs first, confirmed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR), From date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 48 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Percentage of subjects who achieved an objective response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) as assessed by BICR), Up to approximately 48 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Percentage of subjects who achieved an objective response according to RECIST v1.1 (CR or PR) as assessed by BICR, Up to approximately 48 months|Duration of Response (DOR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Time from the assessment of initial response (PR or better) to death or first documented radiologically confirmed disease progression as assessed by BICR, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 48 months|Time to Response (TTR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Time to Response (TTR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Time from randomization to the first assessment of PR or better as assessed by BICR|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Percentage of subjects with CR or PR; or with stable disease (SD) lasting \>24 weeks as assessed by BICR, Up to approximately 48 months|Quality of Life (QOL) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Trial Outcome Index (FACT-B TOI), Questions in Patients with PIK3CA ND and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, From baseline to 30 Day Safety Follow-up|Adverse Events, Type, incidence, severity (as graded by the NCI CTCAE v5.0), seriousness, and relationship to study medications of Adverse Events and any laboratory abnormalities in Arm A compared with Arm B, Up to approximately 48 months
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib plus fulvestrant combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Investigator's choice of palbociclib or ribociclib) for the treatment of patients with advanced (inoperable) or metastatic hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer whose disease has progressed during or within 12 months of adjuvant treatment with endocrine therapy (either an AI or tamoxifen), and who have not received prior systemic therapy for ABC. Gedatolisib is an intravenously administered pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). Following completion of the safety run-in phase to determine the gedatolisib dose with ribociclib, subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on their PIK3CA status and then randomized to either the investigational treatment arm (gedatolisib with fulvestrant and ribociclib or palbociclib) or standard-of-care control arm (fulvestrant and ribociclib or palbociclib).
