Perioperative Chemotherapy Compared To Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus
The trial is designed to investigate differences in outcome of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and junctional adenocarcinoma treated with perioperative (neoadjuvant + adjuvant) chemotherapy (FLOT) plus surgical resection versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS) plus surgical resection.

DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Neoadjuvant radiation
Overall survival, Overall survival will be calculated as time from start of study treatment to death due to any cause., At end of trial- up to 3 years in follow up
Progression free survival time (PFS), PFS will be calculated as the time interval from randomisation to the first event of locoregional failure, metastatic progression or death., From randomisation up to 3 years in follow up|Site of failure: local, regional or distant Failure, From time of surgery up to 3 years in follow up|Recurrence free survival time, RFS will be calculated in resected patients who achieved an R0 or R1 resection as the time interval from surgery to the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant) or death, whatever comes first., From time of surgery up to 3 years in follow up|Postsurgical Quality of Life, From randomization up to 3 years in follow up|Postoperative complications, From time of surgery up to 90 days postoperatively|Non-surgical site complications, From time of surgery up to 90 days postoperatively
According to the given evidence a survival benefit of perioperative chemotherapy (periCTX) over Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (neoCRT) for patients with Esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC) has not been proven in any randomized controlled trials (RCT). Data supporting the value of periCTX have all been obtained in studies including mixed patient cohorts with EAC and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). Due to relevant differences of histologic subtype distribution, response to periCTX and survival rates between EAC and GAC there is a clear need to obtain evidence concerning the value of periCTX for EAC. As nowadays periCTX is extensively and successfully applied in clinical practice in patients with EAC there is an obvious need to obtain evidence from a multicentre RCT. Moreover a confirmation of the superior survival rates of the recent RCT on neoCRT should be obtained in a RCT conducted exclusively on EAC. Therefore, this prospective RCT with the primary objective of longterm patient survival comparing periCTX and neoCRT was designed.
