Safety & Activity of Controllable PRAME-TCR Therapy in Previously Treated AML/MDS or Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of BPX-701 in participants with relapsed AML, previously treated MDS, or metastatic uveal melanoma expressing high levels of PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME). Participants' T cells are modified to recognize and target the PRAME tumor marker on cancer cells.

BIOLOGICAL: BPX-701|DRUG: Rimiducid
Part 1 Arm 1: Dose-limiting Toxicity, Incidence of dose limiting-toxicity (DLT), 28 days after BPX-701 infusion|Part 1 Arm 1: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs assessed for severity using CTCAE, 15 months
The goal of this study is to characterize the safety, feasibility, and clinical activity of BPX-701, a genetically modified autologous T cell product incorporating an HLA-A2-restricted PRAME-directed TCR and a rimiducid-inducible safety switch, when administered to subjects with relapsed AML, previously treated MDS, or metastatic uveal melanoma.

The study will be comprised of multiple parts:

Part 1 (Phase 1): Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-701 T cells (escalating doses from 1.25 x 10E6 cells/kg up to 5.0 x 10E6 cells/kg to be explored) Parts 2 and 3 (Phase 2): Dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including BPX-701 T cell persistence and response to rimiducid as applicable), and clinical activity at the recommended dose identified in Part 1 During Parts 1, 2, or 3, rimiducid may be administered following BPX-701 T cell infusion in response to uncontrollable, treatment-emergent toxicity
