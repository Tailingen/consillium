Safety and Tolerability Study of AlloVax(TM) in Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer of the Head and Neck
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tumor debulking efficacy of personalized anti-cancer vaccine AlloVax(TM) in Subjects with confirmed recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who cannot be treated with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. AlloVax(TM) is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine combining Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) as a source of tumor antigen prepared from patient's tumor and AlloStim(TM) as an adjuvant. The combination of CRCL and AlloStim(TM) is designed to provide cross-reactivity of alloantigen specific recognition with tumor-specific recognition. All the key components necessary to develop tumor-specific immunity by creating the inflammatory environment necessary to overcome the HNC immunosuppressive environment, breaking tumor immune tolerance, and provision of specific HNC antigens for generation of a specific adaptive anti-tumor response.

Tumor Response, Tumor response evaluation by clinical exam including photographs of visible tumor lesions on head, neck and/or tongue (endoscopic) and by CT scan assessment for change in target lesion tumor volume (TV). TV is defined as the volume occupied by macroscopic visible target lesion in two longest cross-sectional diameters., baseline, every 28 days for 5 months (CT scan confirmation at baseline and day 90 and day 150)
Anti-tumor immune response, change in tumor pathology and immune cell inflitration, baseline, 30 days after the last dose|Anti-Tumor Response, expression of CTLA4., baseline and 30 days after the last dose
This is a Phase II study following up on a previous Phase I/II study in chemotherapy refractory metastatic disease with \<90 day survival expectancy. In the Phase I/II study all patients progressed using RECIST criteria. However, 11/42 (26%) were alive at 1yr and 9/42 (21%) alive at 2 yr. Therefore, CT scans did not correlate with clinical presentation and "pseudo-progression" was suspected. This study was designed to select subjects with visible tumor burden on the head, neck or tongue that could be measured and photographed so as not to rely solely on CT scans to determine anti-tumor debulking efficacy. Subjects are initially primed with intradermal AlloStim(TM) injections creating systemic anti-allo-specific cellular immunity. Tumor biopsy samples taken prior to dosing were processed into personalized Chaperone Rich Cell Lysate (CRCL) vaccine containing enriched heat shock proteins which are believed to chaperone tumor-specific neoantigens . AlloStim(TM) was then injected with CRCL into primed subjects to create tumor-specific cellular immunity. Subsequently, subjects are infused with intravenous AlloStim(TM) to cause extravasation of memory cells to the tumor lesions. The protocol including intradermal AlloStim(TM) day 0, 3, 7, 10. Intradermal AlloStim(TM)+CRCL on days 14, 17, 21, 24. Intravenous AlloStim(TM) day 28. This experimental treatment schedule will continue for 3 cycles.
