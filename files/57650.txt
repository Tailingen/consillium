HPV Self-sampling for Underscreened Latinas
The goal of this study is to learn if women of Hispanic/Latina ethnicity are willing to self-collect a cervico-vaginal sample for HPV testing. The main question the study will answer is:

â€¢ Does a brief educational intervention increase the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling among Hispanic/Latina women?

The study team will compare whether including a brief educational intervention with a mailed HPV self-sampling kit is more acceptable than receiving a mailed HPV self-sampling kit alone.

Participants will be asked to complete surveys at study entry (baseline) and then randomized to receive only the HPV self-sampling kit, or the kit plus a small group education that meets with a bilingual health educator.

Participants will then be contacted about one-month later to complete a follow-up survey. The study team will also measure the number of participants in each group who self-collect a sample and mail it in for HPV testing.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasm
BEHAVIORAL: HPV Self-Sampling|BEHAVIORAL: Group Education
Intervention Feasibility, The number of participants in the intervention arm who attend at least one session, 1 month
Participation in screening, The number of participants who return a self-collected sample, 1 month
The study team will recruit a sample of underscreened Latinas (n=100) who will be randomly assigned to either the educational intervention (n=50) or a control condition (n=50). Feasibility will be measured through study enrollment and intervention completion (defined as the proportion of women who self-collect a sample). Acceptability of intervention materials and self-sampling procedures will be measured using self-report surveys at follow-up assessments.
