Testing JNJ-42756493 (Erdafitinib) as Potentially Targeting Treatment in Cancers With FGFR Mutations or Fusions (MATCH - Subprotocol K2)
This phase II MATCH treatment trial tests how well erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493) works in treating patients with tumors that have FGFR mutations or fusions. Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial response to treatment among analyzable (ie, eligible, treated and PIK3CA mutation status confirmed) patients. Objective response is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, the Cheson (2014) criteria for lymphoma patients, and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for glioblastoma patients. Details about how to define complete response and partial response can be found in the master protocol. 90% two-sided binomial exact confidence interval is calculated for ORR., Tumor assessments occurred at baseline, then every 2 cycles for the first 26 cycles and every 3 cycles thereafter until disease progression, up to 3 years post registration
6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate, Progression free survival is defined as time from treatment start date to date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, the Cheson (2014) criteria for lymphoma patients, and the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria for glioblastoma patients. Please refer to the protocol for detailed definitions of disease progression. 6 month PFS rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, which can provide a point estimate for any specific time point., Assessed at baseline, then every 2 cycles for the first 26 cycles, and every 3 cycles thereafter until disease progression, up to 3 years post registration, from which 6-month PFS rate is determined|Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as time from treatment start date to date of disease progression or death from any causes, whichever occurred first.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. III. To identify potential predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and imaging-based assessment platforms.

IV. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive erdafitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tumor biopsy throughout the study. (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 02/25/2022)

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
