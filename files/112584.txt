Tonation Breathing Technique Method to Ease Aromatase Inhibitor-induced Joint and/or Muscle Pain
This clinical trial evaluates how well tonation breathing techniques (use of a breathing and tonation \[creating sounds\]) works to ease pain joint and/or muscle pain in patients with stage I-III breast cancer and currently take an aromatase inhibitor. Tonation breathing techniques may help relieve pain in patients with stage I-III breast cancer who are receiving aromatase inhibitor.

OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|BEHAVIORAL: Tonation Breathing Technique
Change in aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal pain symptoms, Patients will be asked to complete a validated brief pain inventory- SF ( BPI-SF) at baseline and after 2 weeks which would be end of study. The BPI- SF measures pain intensity at its worse in the last week, at its least in the last week in addition to average pain and location of pain. It also measures relief of pain from pain treatments or medications and percentage of relief., Baseline to 2 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To study impact of active participation of patients in producing tones in combination with breathing technique, i.e., tonation breathing techniques (TBT) to reduce aromatase inhibitor induced musculoskeletal symptoms.

OUTLINE:

Patients participate in tonation breathing techniques twice daily (or more if pain occurs) for 2 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaire at baseline and at 2 weeks.
