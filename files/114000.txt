A Study of Evaluating The Effects Of Pyrotinib After Adjuvant Trastuzumab In Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer
This is a randomised, double-blind multicenter Phase III study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in women with early stage high-risk breast cancer after adjuvant trastuzumab. The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether pyrotinib can further reduce the risk of recurrence from previously diagnosed HER-2 positive breast cancer after adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab.

Invasive Disease-free Survival (iDFS), Invasive disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first invasive disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence and death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years
Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, non-breast primary invasive cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS),or distant recurrence and death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., up to 2 years|Distance Disease-free Survival (DDFS), Distance Disease-free Survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first distant recurrence and death from any cause., distant recurrence From randomization until time of event up to 2 years
