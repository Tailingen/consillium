Exploring Merkel Cell Carcinoma Clinical Trial Engagement Patterns
Taking part in medical research usually favors a particular demographic group. But there is limited research available to explain what trial attributes affect the completion of these specific demographic groups.

This study will admit a wide range of data on the clinical trial experience of Merkel cell carcinoma patients to determine which factors prevail in limiting a patient's ability to join or finish a trial.

It will also try to analyze data from the perspective of different demographic groups to check for recurring trends which might yield insights for the sake of future Merkel cell carcinoma patients.
