Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only option curative intended in the treatment of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, duodenal carcinoma, ampullary carcinoma, lower common bile duct cholangiocarcinoma,. It is still associated with very high morbidity and mortality. \[1\]. Pancreatic cancer ranks as the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and the fourth among other cancers\[2,3\]. In recent years, the minimally invasive techniques has considered revolution in surgeries of pancreatic cancers \[4,5\]. Laparoscopic assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy is a hybrid procedure combining laparoscopic resection and reconstruction through a small incision.it companies laparoscopic mobilization and dissection due to magnification compared with open pancreaticoduodenectomy\[6\]. Several studies have shown that laparoscopic assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy could result in less blood loss less, pain ,less wound infection and shorter hospital stay compared to open pancreaticoduodenectomy\[7,8\]. Limited literature described the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic assisted pancraticododenostomy .Also such comparative studies deficient in evaluation of outcomes of laparoscopic assisted pancraticododenostomy and open pancraticoduodenoctomy.So the interest of our study is to compare between the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic assisted pancraticododenostomy and open pancraticoduodenoctomy.
