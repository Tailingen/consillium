Molecular Determinants Affecting Fluoro-L-thymidine (FLT) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with an imaging agent called 18F-fluorodeoxythymidine(\[18F\]-FLT) will allow investigators to measure how well tumor(s) respond to treatment without taking a tissue sample (biopsy). Additionally, the investigators want to determine if it is possible to predict how well tumor(s) might respond to treatment with \[18F\]-FLT PET imaging.
Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: PET imaging with [18F]-FLT|DRUG: [18F]-fluorodeoxythymidine
Utility of [18F]-FLT PET to assess cellular proliferation in neoadjuvant trials of patients with rectal cancer, Ability of this imaging technique to determine growth of cancer cells and as a quantitative biomarker of response to relevant, molecularly targeted, therapies, at study entry, at week 3 during chemotherapy and radiation, and at week 11 after treatment but before surgery
Correlative biology, Pre-treatment and intra-treatment rectal biopsy tissue and tissue from the post-treatment surgical tumor resection will be examined for cyclin D1, TK1, PCNA, pHis-H3, thymidylate, p-Erk, p-Akt to identify changes from pre-treatment to post-treatment, at study entry before treatment, at week 3 of treatment, and at week 11 after treatment
