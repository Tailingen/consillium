Incidence and Mortality
Extragonadal germ cell tumors are rare and account for only a small percentage
of all germ cell tumors.  However, the true incidence of these tumors may
conceivably be higher than originally thought because of failure to diagnose
them properly.
Cellular Classification of Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors
In This Section
Good Prognosis
Nonseminoma
Seminoma
Intermediate Prognosis
Nonseminoma
Seminoma
Poor Prognosis
Nonseminoma
Seminoma
Extragonadal germ cell tumors can be benign (teratoma) or malignant.  The
latter group can be divided into seminoma and nonseminoma germ cell tumors, which include:
Embryonal carcinomas.
Malignant teratomas.
Endodermal sinus tumors.
Choriocarcinomas.
Mixed germ cell tumors.
Extragonadal germ cell tumors occur much more often in males than in females [
1
]  and are usually seen in young adults.  These aggressive neoplasms can arise virtually anywhere, but the site of origin is typically
in the midline (mediastinum, retroperitoneum, or pineal
gland).  Gonadal origin should be excluded by careful testicular examination
and ultrasound.  The diagnosis can be difficult and should be considered in any
patient with a poorly defined epithelial malignancy, particularly young
individuals with midline masses.[

,

]
An international germ cell tumor prognostic classification has been developed
based on a retrospective analysis of 5,202 patients with metastatic
nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and 660 patients with metastatic seminomatous germ cell
tumors.[
4
]  All patients received treatment with cisplatin-containing or carboplatin-containing therapy as their first chemotherapy course.  The prognostic
classification, shown below, was agreed on in early 1997 by all major clinical
trial groups worldwide and  should be used for the reporting of clinical trial
results of patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.
Good Prognosis
Nonseminoma
Testis/retroperitoneal primary
and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases
and
Good markers–all of:
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) less than 1,000 ng/mL
and
Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) less than 5,000 IU/L (1,000 ng/mL)
and
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) less than 1.5 × upper limit of normal
A total of 56% of nonseminomas are good prognosis. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate is 89%; the 5-year survival rate is 92%.
Seminoma
Any primary site
and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases
and
Normal AFP, any beta-hCG, any LDH
A total of 90% of seminomas are good prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 82%; the 5-year survival rate is 86%.
Intermediate Prognosis
Nonseminoma
Testis/retroperitoneal primary
and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases
and
Intermediate markers–any of:
AFP 1,000 ng/mL or greater and 10,000 ng/mL or less
or
Beta-hCG 5,000 IU/L or greater and  50,000 IU/L or less
or
LDH 1.5 × upper limit of normal or greater  and 10 × upper limit of normal
or less
A total of 28% of nonseminomas are intermediate prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 75%; the 5-year survival rate is 80%.
Seminoma
Any primary site
and
Nonpulmonary visceral metastases
and
Normal AFP, any beta-hCG, any LDH
A total of 10% of seminomas are intermediate prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 67%; the 5-year survival rate is 72%.

Nonpulmonary visceral metastases
or
Poor markers–any of:
AFP greater than 10,000 ng/mL
or
Beta-hCG greater than 50,000 IU/L (1,000 ng/mL)
or
LDH greater than 10 × upper limit of normal
A total of 16% of nonseminomas are poor prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 41%; the 5-year survival rate is 48%.
Seminoma
No patients are classified as poor prognosis.

Treatment of Benign Teratoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Benign teratomas are treated with surgical excision only.  These tumors are
frequently very large, and the surgical procedure can be formidable.
Current Clinical Trials
Use our
advanced clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria.
General information
about clinical trials is also available.
Treatment of Seminoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
The diagnosis of seminoma requires that the serum alpha-fetoprotein be
normal, with no other germ cells present.  Management decisions in patients presenting with these tumors can be difficult.
As in testicular seminoma, these tumors
are very radiosensitive.  About 60% to 80% of patients will remain disease free after
treatment with radiation therapy.[
1
]  Craniospinal radiation therapy for intracranial germinomas (the
intracranial counterpart of seminoma) is associated with relapse-free and
overall survival rates of 90% to 95% at 5 years, respectively, as evidenced in the GER-GPO-MAKEI-86/89 trial, for example.[
2
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Initial chemotherapy with regimens used in nonseminoma testicular cancer is also
efficacious.  Practically speaking, patients with localized relatively
small tumors are usually treated initially with radiation therapy, while those with
very bulky tumors or nonlocalized tumors are treated with etoposide-based and
cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens.
As in testicular seminoma, many patients will be left with a residual mass posttreatment.  If the residual mass is smaller than 3.0 cm, 
most experts agree that observation is appropriate.  In those with larger residual
masses, some experts favor surgical excision while others favor
observation.[

Treatment of Nonseminoma
In This Section
Mediastinal Nonseminoma
Retroperitoneal Nonseminoma
Current Clinical Trials
Patients with nonseminomas should receive chemotherapy at diagnosis.  These
patients tend to have a large tumor volume at diagnosis and are usually
symptomatic.  Initial debulking surgery is rarely useful.  Many high-risk
patients qualify for clinical trials. 
Standard therapy is generally four courses of
BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin).[
1
,
2
]
A randomized study comparing
four courses of BEP with  four courses of VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin)
showed similar overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment failure for the two
regimens in patients with advanced disseminated germ cell tumors who had not
received previous chemotherapy.[
3
,
4
][
Level of evidence A1
]  Of the 304 patients in this study, 66 had extragonadal primary tumors. In this subset
of patients, responses to the two regimens were similar.  Hematologic toxic effects in OS were substantially worse with the VIP regimen than  with  the BEP
regimen.
Patients with a residual mass after
chemotherapy may achieve long-term disease-free survival after postchemotherapy surgery with resection of all
residual disease.[
5
][
Level of evidence C2
]  Patients with nonseminomatous extragonadal germ cell tumors
who relapse after front-line chemotherapy generally have poor prognoses with
poor responses to salvage chemotherapy regimens, including autologous bone
marrow transplant, that have had success for recurrent testicular
cancer.[
6
-
8
]  Such patients are candidates for studies of new
approaches.
Mediastinal Nonseminoma
Mediastinal nonseminomas have certain unique aspects. The tumors are more frequent in
individuals with Klinefelter syndrome and are associated with a risk of
subsequent development of hematologic neoplasia that is not treatment related.[
9
,
10
]  Approximately 50% of patients with mediastinal nonseminomas will survive with appropriate
management.[
11
]  High risk is partially related to tumor bulk, chemotherapy
resistance, and a predisposition to develop hematologic neoplasia and other
nongerm cell malignancies.
In an uncontrolled study, some patients with a postchemotherapy residual mediastinal mass achieved long-term  disease-free survival after complete resection, even when serum tumor markers were elevated.[
5
][
Level of evidence C2
] Patient selection factors may play a role in these favorable outcomes.
Retroperitoneal Nonseminoma
The prognosis of retroperitoneal nonseminoma is reasonably good and, similar to
the situation with nodal metastasis from a testicular primary tumor, is related to
tumor volume.
Current Clinical Trials
Use our
advanced clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria.

Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
A randomized controlled trial compared conventional doses of salvage chemotherapy to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow rescue in 263 patients with recurrent or refractory germ cell tumors.   Of the 263 patients,  43 of whom had extragonadal primary tumors, more toxic effects and treatment-related deaths were seen in the high-dose arm, without any improvement in response rate or overall survival.[
