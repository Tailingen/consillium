Erlotinib and Chemotherapy for 2nd Line Treatment (Tx) of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
The purpose of this study is to see if alternating chemotherapy with erlotinib increases tumor shrinkage in people with metastatic colorectal cancer. The investigator will also be studying the side effects (good and bad) of alternating chemotherapy with erlotinib on metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan
Response Rates of Radiographically Measurable Disease, The primary outcome measure will be the response rates of radiographically measurable disease. Response rate of disease will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), \>= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., Disease response assessed after every 2 Treatment Cycles, or around 8 weeks.
Second-line Progression Free Survival, Time to disease progression from start of second-line experimental regimen. Disease progression will be measured per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), \>= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease., Upon completion of follow-up, for an average of 99 days following the initiation of study treatment.|Time to Second Progression (From Start of First-Line Regimen), Number of days from the initiation of first line treatment to first documented progression. Progression will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), \>= 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.

Progression free survival (time to progression or death, whichever occurs first) is the same as time to progression as all of the patients in this trial progressed., Documented by Follow-up CT scans following first line treatment, average of 225 days.
