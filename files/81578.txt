Reduced Intensity Allogeneic HCT in Advanced Hematologic Malignancies w/T-Cell Depleted Graft
Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) has emerged and been increasingly adopted as a modality to allow preparative conditioning pre transplant to be tolerated by older adults or those patients that are otherwise unfit for myeloablative conditioning. In this study, we aim to use RIC followed by matched related/unrelated donor, 7/8 matched related/unrelated donor, or haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Standard strategies to control the alloreactivity following HCT utilize immunosuppressive or cytotoxic medications. In this study, we explore donor graft engineering to enrich for immmunoregulatory populations to facilitate post transplantation immune reconstitution while minimizing graft versus host disease (GVHD) with post-transplant immunosuppressive agents.

Determine the GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) post-HCT ( Arm-A), Clinical effect will be assessed as graft vs host disease (GVHD)-free relapse free survival (GRFS), GVHD-free is defined as no GVHD symptoms, and relapse free survival is defined as survival at 12 months without relapse. The outcome will be measured in Arm A only., 12 months|Determine the overall survival (OS) post-HCT ( Arm-B), Overall survival is measured as number of participants alive. Alive at the time of last observation will be censored., 2 years|Incidence of Grade III-IV acute GVHD, Acute GVHD will be staged and graded per Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) Standardization criteria., At baseline, day +30, 60, 90, 180, year 1 and year 2|The incidence and timing of primary graft failure, Primary graft failure is defined as being alive with donor CD3 chimerism \<5% at day +30 after transplant without recovery of neutrophils (i.e. without achieving an absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] ≥ 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days) at Day+28, 2 years from the Day 0 (day of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cell infusion|Donor CD3 chimerism at Day+60 post-HCT, Defined as a percentage on donor CD3 cells chimerism at day +60 after transplantation., 2 years from the Day 0 (day of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cell infusion)
GVHD-relapse-free survival, Clinical effect will be assessed as graft vs host disease (GVHD)-free relapse free survival (GRFS), GVHD-free is defined as no GVHD grade 3 and 4, and relapse free survival is defined as survival at 12 months without relapse., 12 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is measured as number of participants alive. Alive at the time of last observation will be censored., 12 months|Secondary graft failure, Secondary graft failure (defined by donor CD3 chimerism \<5% at day +30 after transplant) and neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in ANC \< 500/mm3 unresponsive to growth factor therapy, by Day +100, from Day 0 through 100 days|Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs), TEAEs will be categorized by the System Organ Class and preferred term and will be graded according to the CTCAE version 5.0, from Day 0 through 100 days|Acute GVHD (all grades), Acute GVHD (all grades) will be reported, from Day 0 through 100 days|Steroid-refractory acute GVHD, Steroid refractory acute GVHD will be defined as per the EBMT-NIH-CIBMTR Task Force position statement, within 3-5 days of therapy onset|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), Non-relapse mortality is measured as number of participants died without relapse/ recurrent disease. Subjects without evidence of relapse/progression at last follow-up date or date of death will be censored., 12 months|Disease-free survival (DFS), Overall survival is measured as number of participants alive and in remission. Alive in remission at the time of last observation will be censored., 12 months|Chronic GVHD (limited or extensive), Chronic GVHD will be diagnosed per 2014 International NIH Chronic GVHD Diagnosis and Staging Consensus Working Group criteria (Jagasia 2015). Chronic GVHD scored according to the first day of chronic GVHD onset will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves. Subjects will be followed for 2 years from the Day 0 (day of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cell infusion) for estimation of cGVHD incidence., from Day 0 through Year 2
Time to Neutrophil engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment is defined as having an ANC ≥ 500 cells/µL for three consecutive days. The first of three days will be designated as the day of engraftment., from Day 0 through 100 days|Time to Platelet engraftment, Platelet engraftment is defined as achieving a platelet count \> 20,000 cells/µL for three consecutive days without platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days. The first of three days will be designated as the day of engraftment., from Day 0 through 100 days|Incidence of serious infections (grade 2 and greater), Incidence of serious infections will be measured as event of infections that led to hospitalization or death or required antibiotic treatment. Infections will be graded according to the CTCAE version 5.0, from Day 0 through 100 days
