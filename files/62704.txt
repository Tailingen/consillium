Stratified Evaluation of PDS and NACT-IDS in Ovarian Cancer (FOCUS)
The purpose of this study is to answer the fundamental question 'The Optimal Timing of Surgery' in advanced ovarian cancer patients with different tumor burden, and to perform translational study.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Primary debulking surgery|PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy|DRUG: PARPi
Overall survival, Time from randomization to the date of death from any cause or date of last contact, Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization
Progression-free survival, Time from randomization to the date of first progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first or date of last contact, Participants will be followed for at least 2 years after randomization|Post-operative complications, The surgical complications will be evaluated at 30-day, 60-day, 90-day after upfront cytoreductive surgery or interval debulking surgery, Participants will be followed up to 3 months after randomization|Quality of life assessments, Quality of life (Qol) as measured by QOQ-C30, Participants will be followed for at least 12 months or death after randomization, whichever came first|Quality of life assessments, Quality of life (Qol) as measured by FACT-O, Participants will be followed for at least 12 months or death after randomization, whichever came first|Accumulating treatment-free survival, The overall survival time minus the total treatment time of surgery and chemotherapy after randomization, regardless of the targeted therapy, Participants will be followed for at least 5 years or death after randomization, whichever came first|Time to first subsequent anticancer therapy, Time from the date of randomization to the starting date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first or date of last contact, Participants will be followed for at least 2 years or death after randomization, whichever came first|Time to secondary subsequent anticancer therapy, Time from the date of randomization to the starting date of the second subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first or date of last contact, Participants will be followed for at least 5 years or death after randomization, whichever came first|Progression-free survival 2, Time from randomization to second progressive disease or death, which occurs first or date of last contact, Participants will be followed for at least 5 years or death after randomization, whichever came first
OBJECTIVES: Compare the efficacy and safety in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NACT-IDS versus PDS, among different tumor burden groups. Compare survival benefit of PARPi therapy in patients treated with PDS or NACT-IDS.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive upfront maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy or 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery, and then at least 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, and maintenance therapy of PARP inhibitor for patients with gBRCA/sBRCA mutation who had a complete or partial clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months within the first 5 years, and then every 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 410 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
