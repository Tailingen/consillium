Human Papillomavirus in Young People Epidemiological Research 4
Anal cancer is overrepresented among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly those living with HIV. Australia was the first country to introduce a publicly funded national HPV vaccination program in 2007. This program was expanded to include schoolboys aged 12-13 years in 2013; with a 2-year catch-up for boys aged up to 15 years.

The goal of the HYPER4 study is to determine the prevalence of anal, genital and oral HPV among 500 young gay and bisexual men aged 21-25 years who were eligible for the school-based gender-neutral quadrivalent vaccination program.

Participants will be required to complete a questionnaire and provide samples for HPV testing. No follow-up visits will be required.
