A Study of SI-B001+SI-B003 Combined With Platinum-based Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study is a open, multi-center phase II clinical study to explore the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of SI-B001+SI-B003 combined with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: SI-B001|DRUG: SI-B003
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of SI-B001+SI-B003 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of SI-B001+SI-B003. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of SI-B001+SI-B003., Up to approximately 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of SI-B001+SI-B003 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of SI-B001+SI-B003 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Ctrough, Ctrough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of SI-B001+SI-B003 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to approximately 24 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency and titer of anti-SI-B001 and SI-B003 antibody (ADA) will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months
