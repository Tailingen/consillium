The management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1-1)-related pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) remains controversial. In general, surgical resection is currently the first-line therapy for MEN1-1-related pNETs. However, the surgical resection of pNETs is conditional for specific patients, and the incidence of postoperative adverse events is still high. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle injection (EUS-FNI) with ethanol or lauromacrogol may provide an alternative to surgical resection of pNETs. Nevertheless, their sample size was relatively small and conclusions were drawn based on short-term results. Therefore, a multicenter prospective study is being performed to further access the efficacy and safety of EUS-FNI for MEN1-1-related pNETs.
