ONC201 in Adults With Recurrent H3 K27M-mutant Glioma
The primary objective of this phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of ONC201, an oral small molecule imipridone DRD2 antagonist, in adult subjects with recurrent high-grade glioma. This study will test the research hypothesis that histone H3 K27M mutation sensitizes to oral administration of ONC201 in gliomas.
