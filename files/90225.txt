A Study of LAM-003 in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of LAM-003 in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Oncology|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Open Label LAM-003
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), A primary objective was to determine the LAM-003 MTD and/or recommended dosing regimen (RDR) based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Cycle 1 of therapy. MTD as determined by DLTs., At the end of the 28-day observation period for Cycle 1.
Adverse Event Assessment, Number and percentage of participants with an adverse event (AE)., Weekly during the first 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks for up to 48 weeks.|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax was determined in plasma for the active metabolite of LAM-003A and LAM-003 (prodrug), Cycle 1 Days 1, 2 and 8 (1 cycle = 28 days)|Time of Maximum Concentration [Tmax], The pharmacokinetic parameter Tmax was determined in plasma for the active metabolite of LAM-003A and LAM-003 (prodrug), Cycle 1 Days 1, 2 and 8 (1 cycle = 28 days)|Area Under the Curve [AUC], The pharmacokinetic parameter area under the concentration-time curve was determined in plasma for the active metabolite of LAM-003A and LAM-003 (prodrug). AUClast is the area under the concentration-time curve from time-zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration. AUCtau is the area under the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval where tau=24hours for once daily (QD) dosing. AUCtau was not calculated for LAM-003., Cycle 1 Days 1, 2 and 8 (1 cycle = 28 days)|Objective Response Rate, Tumor response by AML response criteria (Cheson 2003)., Every 8 to 12 weeks for up to 48 weeks.|Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS), Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to the earliest of the first documentation of disease relapse, disease progression, treatment failure (TF), or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS), defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to death from any cause., Every 8 to 12 weeks for up to 48 weeks.
This clinical trial is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of LAM-003 across a range of LAM-003 dose levels when administered to subjects with previously treated relapsed or refractory cute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

Subjects will self-administer oral LAM-003 either once or twice per day as long as they are safely benefitting from therapy. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of LAM-003 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities observed in the first 4 weeks of therapy, escalation will proceed to define a recommended LAM-003 dosing regimen.
