Maintenance Tislelizumab + Capecitabine to Treat Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Surgery with integrated treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has created a new clinical setting known as mCRC with no evidence of disease (NED). However, these patients have a high risk of developing persistent cancer. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab combined with capecitabine as a maintenance treatment for patients with mCRC-NED.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancerï¼ŒNED
DRUG: Tislelizumab + Capecitabine|OTHER: Best supportive care
Disease-free survival, The time from NED to the first occurrence of any of the following events: local relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause., 36 months
Overall survival, The time from NED to death from any cause, 60 months|Adverse events, Side effect of both agents, 60 months
This is a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, single-center study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab+ capecitabine versus best-supported care as a first-line maintenance treatment in participants with mCRC-NED.

Patients who underwent synchronously or staged removal of primary and metastatic lesions, achieving NED, and histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma were recruited in this trial. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events. This study will provide novel data on the efficacy and safety profile of the combination of tislelizumab and capecitabine in patients with mCRC-NED.
