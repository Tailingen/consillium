PSMA MRI Guided Prostate SBRT (ARGOS)/Comprehensive, Longitudinal Evaluation of Imaging Biomarkers Post Radiotherapy (CLIMBER)
This study is a prospective Phase I/II protocol enrolling men with either high intermediate-risk or high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer. All men will have PSMA Targeted PET (using the PSMA targeting ligand PSMA 1007) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for delineation of intra-prostatic foci of cancer and any involved regional lymph nodes based on high SUV uptake on PET or mpMRI (T2W, DWI/ADC, DCE) appearance suspicious for cancer. Tumour delineation will be performed by fusing the PSMA PET and mpMRI with planning CT simulation images. Fiducial marker implantation for treatment guidance will be mandatory but use of other organs at risk protection strategies (i.e. GU Loc, Space-OAR) will be allowed but not mandatory. Patients will be treated with image-guided SBRT using the fiducial markers for intra-fraction motion management. Dose escalation to imaging defined targets (intra-prostatic and involved nodes on PSMA PET + MRI) will be accomplished through a simultaneous boost technique. Maintaining dose to organs at risk will take precedence over boost dose targets (targeted maximum dose of 50Gy/5 fractions to imaging defined prostatic lesion; 35Gy/5 fractions to imaging defined involved nodes).

Cohort extension: We hypothesize that integration of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy will provide for pretreatment cancer downstaging and will allow us to achieve higher target doses to the imaging defined DILs than currently achieve. Additionally, we plan to include a novel sodium MRI protocol into the baseline imaging to compare DIL volumes delineated by this modality to those by mpMRI and PSMA PET and to characterize changes in sodium MRI in response to ADT alone and subsequent radiotherapy

Translational Endpoint 1, Serial PSMA PET/MRI images will be collected at baseline, 6 months and 2 years to characterize the imaging response of prostate cancer to treatment and potentially identify imaging biomarkers (including pharmacokinetic, radiomic and quantitative PET and mpMRI metrics) that predict for five-year DFS, 24 months|Translational Endpoint 2, Baseline collection of diagnostic tissue biopsy samples and serial collection of blood and urine over multiple time points (baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years post radiotherapy) for correlative biologic biomarker analyses with imaging changes and disease-free survival and toxicity post treatment, 24 Months|Translational Endpoint 3, A prostate biopsy at baseline and 2 years will allow for correlation of histopathology with PSMA PET/MRI images.
