A Study of Dapansutrile Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With PD-1 Refractory Advanced Melanoma
This phase 1/2 trial will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose Selection) is designed to find the dose of dapansutrile with acceptable tolerability in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 1 will consist of up to 2 dose selection cohorts to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant melanoma to find the recommended part 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 will include a lead-in phase of dapansutrile monotherapy at 500 mg PO BID. At day 15, combination therapy with pembrolizumab will be initiated. Dose escalation is planned to a maximum of 1000 mg BID of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab.

Part 2 (Dose Expansion) is designed to assess preliminary efficacy of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in PD-1 resistant melanoma. Once all patients in Part 1 have completed 4 weeks of dapansutrile therapy, the expansion phase will start enrolling. Part 2 will also include a 14-day lead-in period of dapansutrile monotherapy at the RP2D.
