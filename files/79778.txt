Immunogenicity and Safety of Commercially Available Vaccines Against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
D1. Primary Objective:

1. Determine the immunogenicity of FDA approved COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hematologic malignancies

D2. Secondary Objectives:

1. Assess the safety of FDA approved COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hematologic malignancies
2. Analyze the kinetics of immunogenic response over time after receipt of the COVID-19 vaccination
3. Compare the immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccinations that will be approved by the FDA
4. Analyze advanced flow immunophenotyping of innate and adaptive immune blood cells in all participants and correlate with response to vaccination
