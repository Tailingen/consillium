Temozolomide Plus Vorinostat in Relapse/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of the study is to first determine if temozolomide plus vorinostat in combination can control relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine if this combination can be safely taken. The study will look at the side effects of the Temozolomide plus Vorinostat in combination and whether the treatment schedule is tolerated.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23-abnormality in Relapse
DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Vorinostat
Complete Remission (CR), This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of temozolomide + vorinostat as administered to Groups 1 and 2, assessed as the rate of complete remission \[CR, aka morphologic complete remission (mCR)\], defined as the morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), WITH absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL AND platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL. The outcome is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that demonstrated CR. CR is defined as all of the following.

MLFS = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease ANC = ≥ 1,000/µL PLT = ≥ 100,000/µL, up to 10 weeks
Morphologic Leukemia-free State (MLFS), The rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that achieve MLFS. The outcome is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that demonstrated MLFS. This assessment is independent of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or platelets (PLT) recovery status. MLFS is defined below.

MLFS = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease, up to 10 weeks|Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRp), The rate of complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRp) for Groups 1 and 2 was assessed as the rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) but with EITHER residual neutropenia (ANC \< 1,000/µL) OR residual thrombocytopenia (PLT \< 100,000/µL). MLFS is defined as follows.

MLFS = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease, up to 10 weeks|Cytogenetic Response (CyR), Cytogenetic response (CyR) is defined as complete remission (CR), PLUS a documented decrease or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities, when analyzed microscopically for 20 cellular metaphases (actively dividing cells). The outcome is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that demonstrated CyR. CR is defined as all of the following.

CR = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL, up to 10 weeks|Partial Remission (PR), Partial remission (PR) is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that demonstrated PR. PR is defined as all of the following.

PR = 5% to 25% blasts (must be ≥ 50% reduction of blasts) in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL, up to 10 weeks|Treatment Failure (TF), Treatment failure (TF) is defined as failing to achieve either a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after induction chemotherapy. The outcome is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that experienced TF. CR and PR are defined as the following.

CR = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL

PR = 5% to 25% blasts (must be ≥ 50% reduction of blasts) in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL, up to 10 weeks|Disease-free Survival (DFS) at 2 Years, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as survival after complete response (CR) without disease progression. DFS is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that experienced CR and were alive without progression (ie, without disease) 2 years after induction chemotherapy. CR is defined as all of the following.

CR = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL, 2 years|Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) at 2 Years, Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as survival after complete response (CR) or (PR) without further disease progression. RFS is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that experienced CR or PR, and were alive without progression 2 years after induction chemotherapy. CR and PR are defined as the following.

CR = \< 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods; no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL

PR = 5% to 25% blasts (must be ≥ 50% reduction of blasts) in bone marrow aspirate containing marrow spicules; \> 200 nucleated cells no blasts with Auer rods no persistence of extramedullary disease absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/µL platelets (PLT) ≥ 100,000/µL, 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) at 2 Years, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as survival regardless of clinical status. OS is reported as the percentage without dispersion of participants in Groups 1 and 2 that remained alive 2 years after induction chemotherapy., 2 years
The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy as determined by the rate of morphological complete remission, of 2 different treatment regimens of temozolomide and vorinostat administered to 2 distinct groups of participants patients with AML and poor prognostic features. Participants will be allocated to treatment on the basis of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status.
