A Phase Ib Dose De-escalation Study With BYL719 in Premenopausal Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Based on the evidence acquired in the post-menopausal setting with everolimus and on pre-clinical evidences supporting the investigation of PI3K inhibitors, such as alpelisib and buparlisib, in combination with endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive MBC, the purpose of this phase Ib trial is to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the RP2D(s), to characterize the safety and tolerability, to determine the single and multiple dose PK profile and assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of alpelisib and buparlisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer patientsgroup.
Pre-menopausal Breast Cancer|PI3K Pathway Inhibition
DRUG: alpelisib (BYL719)|DRUG: buparlisib (BKM120)
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), To estimate the MTD(s) and/or the RP2D(s) of a) alpelisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate (Group 1) and b) buparlisib in combination with Tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate (Group 2) in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive locally advanced or MBC patients., 12 months
Incidence, type, intensity, severity and seriousness of Adverse Events (AEs) during the first 2 cycles dose interruptions, reductions and dose intensity during the study, To characterize the safety and tolerability of a) alpelisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate and b) buparlisib in combination with Tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate, 12 months|Alpelisib/buparlisib: plasma concentrations and PK parameters, including but not limited to AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, AUC0-24, Cmax, tmax, CL/F, half-life t1/2 and other PK parameters if deemed appropriate. Tamoxifen: trough plasma concentrations, To determine the single and multiple dose PK profile of a) alpelisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate and b) buparlisib in combination with Tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate, 12 months|Preliminary anti-tumor activity acccording to RECIST 1.1 : It will include overall response rate, clinical benefit, progression free survival and proportion of patients who are alive without progression at 9 months from the date of treatment start, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of a) alpelisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate and b) buparlisib in combination with Tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate, 12 months|Index score from the EQ-5D-5L; and WPAI-GH scores for work time missed, impairment while working, overall work impairment, and activity impairment, To evaluate and compare the impact of alpelisib and buparlisib in combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin on patient-reported health status and impact on work using the EQ-5D-5L and WPAI-GH questionnaires., 12 months
