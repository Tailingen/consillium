Patients' Opinions and Responses to the National Cancer Institute's Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
Little is known about the impact of risk assessment tools on decision-making by patients and clinicians. In particular, even though the NCI Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is one of the most prominent risk assessment tools available, no study has quantified its usability or impact on decision-making or uptake of screening. In this study, we will measure patients' satisfaction with the NCI CRC RAT, their perception of its usability and helpfulness, and its impact on their decision-making and behavior. In addition, we will assess the impact of adding information about their chance of having an advanced adenoma.
