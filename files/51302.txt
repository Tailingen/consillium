A Feasibility Study With Iressa in Resistant Cytokeratin-Positive Tumor Cells Circulating in the Blood of Women With Breast Cancer
Based on preclinical data, ZD1839 is considered a novel and promising therapeutic approach with potential application in the treatment of human breast cancer. Therefore it could be very important and clinically relevant to know if ZD1839 is capable of eliminating occult tumour cells circulating in the blood of breast cancer patients
Breast Cancer
DRUG: ZD1839
Efficacy of ZD1839 by quantitative analysis of CK-19 mRNA CTCs, Detection of CK-19 mRNA CTCs during and after the completion of ZD1839 treatment
To assess duration of response by means of CK-19 mRNA detection, 6 months|To assess Progression Free Survival by means of CK-19 mRNA detection, 1 year|To assess the safety of ZD1839 administration in this patient population, Toxicity assessment every month
