Donafenib Plus Sintilimab in Combination With TACE in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Donafenib plus Sintilimab in combination with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Donafenib plus Sintilimab in combination with transarterial chemoembolisation
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years)
The disease control rate (DCR) Duration of response DuraDuration of responsetion of response Duration of response, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, stable disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years)|Disease control rate (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From the first documentation of CR or PR to the first date of documentation of disease progression or death whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Progression free survival rate, The progression free survival time defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall survival rate, Overall survival rate is measured from the start date of the Treatment Phase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and the participants who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the participant was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes early., From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)
Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Donafenib was better than sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated TACE plus donafenib and sintilimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
