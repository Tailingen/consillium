A Trial to Strengthen Existential Resiliency Among Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The investigators group has piloted a 6-week psycho-educational program, Growing Resiliency And CouragE with Cancer™ (GRACE), that bring together a variety of strategies and experiences from an inter-professional perspective to mitigate distress among patients with an advanced cancer diagnosis. GRACE is a six-session, empirically anchored intervention emphasizing a Logotherapy (Existential Therapy) and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy approach involving psycho-education and process-oriented experiences. The curriculum includes themes illustrated via PowerPoint slides with semi-structured delivery, video presentations, a variety of mindfulness meditation practices, and selected readings that serve to reflect and capture the theme for the week of the curriculum.
