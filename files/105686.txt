Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Oral Etoposide Followed by Weekly Paclitaxel in High Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
carboplatin and etoposide, followed by maintenance therapy with weekly paclitaxel in patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. We hope to identify a "standard treatment" for this unusual group of patients who are not usually eligible for clinical trials.
