Efficacy and Tolerability of Cisplatin Plus Alternating Weekly Temozolomide in Recurrent High-grade Gliomas
Currently, the prognosis of recurrent high-grade gliomas is still dismal with no standard treatment protocol established. Cisplatin (CDDP), recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as a chemotherapeutic agent in salvage treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas, was shown to reduce O6-alkylguanine DNA-alkyl transferase (AGAT) activity and potentially capable of enhancing the antitumor effects of temozolomide (TMZ). Compared to the standard 5-day TMZ regimen, alternating weekly regimen that deliver more prolonged exposure of TMZ may lead to higher cumulative doses, and may deplete more O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), thus reducing the resistance of tumor cells to TMZ.

The investigators therefore initiate a single-arm Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of CDDP plus alternating weekly TMZ regimen in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
