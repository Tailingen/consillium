This research study will test whether dual anti-estrogen therapy (anastrozole and fulvestrant) slows the time to when the cancer progresses.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Postmenopausal Women

To Evaluate the Time to Overall Survival, Time to Progression, and Toxicities, 1.5 years|To Evaluate the Levels of 17b-estradiol, VEGF, E-selectin, Thrombospondin-1 and IGF-1, and Other Biomarkers in the Plasma., 1.5 years|To Evaluate Biomarkers (ERa, ERb, PR, VEGF and Aromatase Expression) in Baseline, Archival Tumor Tissue and Correlate Their Expression With Progression-free Survival, Time to Progression, and Overall Survival., 1.5 years
Women invited to participate in this study must be post-menopausal and be 18 years of age or older. The study is being performed on a total of 100 individuals. Of this group, 75 will be in the Treatment Groups using Fulvestrant/Anastrozole with our without bevacizumab and 25 will be in the "Best Supportive Care" groups receiving no treatment or just bevacizumab at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
