TAK-228 and TAK-117 Followed by Cisplatin and Nab Paclitaxel for Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This study evaluates efficacy of TAK- 228 and TAK- 117 followed by cisplatin and nab paclitaxel in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tak-228 & Tak-117|DRUG: Cisplatin & Nab Paclitaxel
Efficacy (Objective Response Rate), To assess the objective response rate associated with sequential treatment of the oral combination TAK 228 and 117 followed by nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin in metastatic TNBC. Objective response is measured as prolonged clinical benefit; clinical benefit is defined as progression free survival on study therapy for at least 6 months., Through study completion, up to 2 years 8 months
Efficacy (Duration of Response), To assess duration of response associated with sequential treatment of the oral combination Tak 228 and 117 followed by nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin. Duration of response is measured as prolonged clinical benefit; clinical benefit is defines as progression free survival on study therapy for at least 6 months., Through study completion, up to 2 years 8 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0"., To assess safety associated with sequential treatment of the oral combination Tak 228 and 117 followed by nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin, For up to 30 days following last dose, approximately 7 months|Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), To assess safety associated with sequential treatment of the oral combination TAK 228 and TAK 117 followed by nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin per CTCAE v4.0 criteria., For up to 30 days following last dose, approximately 7 months
Seventy to eighty percent of breast cancers have a gene expression profile which is characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads to errors in DNA pathway \[non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)\] that repair DNA-breaks, a process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis of this pilot trial is that administration of the oral combination of TAK-228 and TAK-117 (PIKTOR) will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC, leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive to cisplatin plus nab paclitaxel therapy.
