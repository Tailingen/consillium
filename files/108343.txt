A Vaccine (PDS0101) and Chemoradiation for the Treatment of Stage IB3-IVA Cervical Cancer, the IMMUNOCERV Trial
This phase IIA trial studies the effect of a vaccine (PDS0101) when given together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiation) in treating patients with stage IB3-IVA cervical cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. PDS0101 is a type of vaccine that is intended to help the immune system respond to human papillomavirus (HPV16)-infected cervical tumor cells. PDS0101 contains two active components: the first is called R-DOTAP (Versamune) and is included in the vaccine to boost the immune system's response against the HPV viral proteins and the second group of active components are selected small pieces of proteins (called peptides) taken from the HPV virus. Giving PDS0101 in combination with chemoradiation may work help to control cervical cancer.

DRUG: Cisplatin|BIOLOGICAL: Liposomal HPV-16 E6/E7 Multipeptide Vaccine PDS0101|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Rate of grade >= 3 acute toxicity, Measured from first vaccine injection up to 30 days following completion of chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT). Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Any AE that occurs between the first day of PDS0101 injection and up to 30 days following completion of chemoRT (\~Day 80) will be considered as acute toxicity (AT)., Day -10 to day 80
Rate of complete metabolic response, Measured by positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT)., Day 170|Rate of >= 90% gross tumor volume reduction, Measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., Day 35|Rates of local control, Will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves., At 12 and 18 months|Rates of progression-free survival, Will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves., At 12 and 18 months|Rates of overall survival, Will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves., At 12 and 18 months|Rate of grade >= 3 chronic toxicity, AEs will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Chronic toxicity (CT) is any toxicity that occurs outside of the AT window (between Days 81 and study completion of the study)., Day 81 to completion of trial
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of delivering the immune nanoparticle liposomal HPV-16 E6/E7 multipeptide vaccine PDS0101 (PDS0101) with standard-of-care chemoradiation (chemoRT) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Rate of complete metabolic response on day 170 (+/- 14 days) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT).

II. Rate of \>= 90% gross tumor volume reduction day 35 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (+/- 5 days).

III. Report rates of local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) at 12 and 18 months following chemoRT completion.

IV. Long-term safety: rate of grade \>= 3 chronic toxicity (from day 81 to completion of trial).

EXPLORATORY HPV-SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE OBJECTIVES:

I. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays on interferon-gamma and granzyme B levels in E6/7-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

II. Compare intratumoral T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality at baseline and end of treatment by TCR sequencing.

III. Measure CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from cervical brush samples by using markers of T-cell exhaustion (PD1, CTLA4) and T cell-activation (granzyme B, CD69+).

IV. Assess the intestinal and cervical microbiome by analyzing rectal and cervical swab samples with 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing.

V. Additional assays such as circulating tumor cells, circulating cell-free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ccfDNA), and other assays will be performed at the discretion of the principal investigator.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo radiation therapy over 1 hour 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) for 5-7 weeks and receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours once per week (QW) during the 5 weeks of radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive PDS0101 subcutaneously (SC) on days -10, 7, 28, 49, and 170 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 1, 4, 6, 12, and 18 weeks, and 18 months.
