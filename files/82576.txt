Optical Coherence Tomography in Staging Patients With Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer
This clinical trial studies how well optical coherence tomography works in staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas. Staging describes the severity of a person's cancer based on the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether or not cancer has spread in the body. It also helps the doctor plan the appropriate treatment. Optical coherence tomography is a procedure that uses infrared light waves to give three-dimensional pictures of structures inside tissues and organs. The pictures are made by a computer linked to the light source. Optical coherence tomography may be effective in staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas.
Kidney/Urinary Cancer
DEVICE: optical coherence tomography
Feasibility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in staging upper-tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC), Feasibility defined as the ability to relate the features associated with cancerous tissues in pathohistological analysis to the features in OCT images, Up to 3 months
Imaging Analysis, Number of cancerous images with at least one feature different from normal pathology slide, Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test the feasibility and imaging ability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to stage upper-tract urothelial carcinomas (UTUC).

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo optical coherence tomography over 10-15 minutes.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
