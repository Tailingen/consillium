Trial of RNActive®-Derived Prostate Cancer Vaccine in Metastatic Castrate-refractory Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new RNActive®-derived prostate cancer vaccine CV9104 prolongs survival in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer that is castrate resistant.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CV9104|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Phase I (Safety Lead-In): Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 4 weeks of treatment (after administration of 3 vaccinations and after a 1 week observation period, Safety Lead in Portion:

Patients will receive CV9104 at a starting dose of 1920 µg in weeks 1, 2 and 3. Safety lead-in patients will be observed for DLTs until 1 week after Vaccination 3 (week 4). In case no DLTs will be observed vaccinations will continue in weeks 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24, then every 6 weeks for up to 12 months after the first vaccination and then every 3 months thereafter until one of the criteria for study treatment discontinuation is met, Up to 4 weeks|Phase II (Randomised Portion): Overall Survival from time of randomisation- up to 3.5-4 years., Overall survival will be assessed during the lifetime of the study
Progression free survival from date of randomisation, Every 3 months for up to 2 years|Progression free survival from start of first subsequent systemic therapy, Every 6 months until 2 years|Percent change to maximal and to minimal PSA from baseline and before start of first subsequent systemic cancer therapy and from start of first systemic therapy to end of first subsequent systemic therapy, Every 3 months up to 2 years|Cellular and humoral immune response rate against the 6 antigens encoded by CV9104, Immune responses will be assessed at baseline, in week 6 and week 24 after start of vaccination|Time to symptom progression based on FACT P score and subscores, Assessments at baseline, weeks 5, 9,18, 24 and every 3 months for up to 2 years|Absolute change and area under the curve from baseline EQ-5D score and pain sub-score, Assessments at baseline, weeks 5, 9,18, 24 and thereafter every 3 months for up to 2 years|Progression free survival from randomisation until second progression on first subsequent therapy, Every 3 and 6 months up to 2 years
The study is the first clinical study with the new prostate cancer vaccine CV9104. This vaccine is composed of 6RNActive®-based compounds, each encoding for an antigen that is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared to healthy tissues. RNActive®-based vaccines are a novel class of vaccines based on messenger RNA.

The study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II trial in men with asymptomatic- minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-refractory prostate cancer.

The phase 1 (safety lead- in) part of the trial has the primary objective to assess the safety of CV9104 and to determine the dose for the randomized phase II part.

The primary objective of the phase II part is to compare overall survival in patients treated with CV9104 compared to patients treated with placebo.
