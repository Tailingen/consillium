Cap+Bev vs Cap+Iri+Bev 1st-line Therapy in mCRC
Patient with multiple metastases, not eligible for surgery, might not profit from intensive chemotherapy regimens. Therefore less intensive regimens focusing on survival and disease control may be a better choice for first line treatment. Therefore this study investigates the combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab versus the combination of capecitabine, bevacizumab and irinotecan. In case of progressive disease, the therapy in patients treated with capecitabine and bevacizumab is intensified by adding irinotecan. Primary endpoint is time-of-failure strategy (TFS) comparing both treatment arms.
