A Study to Describe the Real-world Treatment Patterns and Associated Outcomes in Patients of China With HER2-positive Unresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective, real-world study that enrolled patients diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. This study will be conducted to understand the treatment pattern and sequencing of therapies, survival outcomes, and associated burden of toxicities with line of treatment in the real world.

The treatment landscape has changed dramatically with the lack of real-world evidence for usage and the efficacy of newly approved drugs in China. This multicenter, retrospective, non-interventional study will include patients newly diagnosed with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer, or first recurrent from early breast cancer.

The primary objective of this real-world study is to describe the treatment patterns of HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer in China. Secondary objectives will include describing the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients, efficacy of different treatment regimens, treatment options and efficacy of brain metastases, and safety and tolerability of different treatment regimens in patients with HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.
