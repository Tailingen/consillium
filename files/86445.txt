Gemcitabine as a Single Agent in the Maintenance Chemotherapy of Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of our study is to evaluate whether gemcitabine as a single agent is superior to observation in improving progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who achieved disease control with an initial six cycles of PG as their first-line treatment
