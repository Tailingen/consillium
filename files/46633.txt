Locally Advanced NSCLC Hyperfractionated RT
This is a prospective phase II study designed to evaluate an accelerated and adaptive RT approach for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All eligible subjects will have an interim PET-CT during radiation therapy to determine the metabolic complete response rate. Radiation therapy will be given in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy/fraction, 6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy. Interim responses will be assessed using PERCIST criteria.

Despite concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, local/regional failure occurs in \~50% of patients with locally-advanced NSCLC. Clinical studies have demonstrated that accelerated fractionation (giving the same total dose in a shorter period of time) improves outcomes in several malignancies, including lung cancer. Administering higher than conventional doses of RT to all sites of original disease leads to inferior outcomes. Adapting the RT approach, giving a higher dose to slowly responding disease as assessed with interim PET has been shown to be feasible. PERCIST (Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors) provides guidelines on how to report responses to therapy based on PET-CT. PET-CT response has been shown to be prognostic in a variety of clinical scenarios in lung cancer including after induction therapy. In one study, PET was performed after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (40-50.4 Gy). Complete or partial metabolic response using PERCIST criteria was predictive of loco-regional, distant, and overall progression-free survival.

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Daily hyperfractionated radiation therapy
The Metabolic Complete Response Rate, Assessed Using Interim PET-CT, in an Accelerated Fashion (2 Gy/Fraction, 6 Fractions/Week) With Concurrent Chemotherapy, For the cohort of the participants who meet eligibility criteria and receive radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, the metabolic complete response (MCR) rate will be measured with interim PET-CT utilizing PERCIST response reporting criteria., 4 weeks
The Number of Participants Eligible for an RT Boost After Completing a Standard Dose of RT (60 Gy), Delivered in an Accelerated Fashion (6 Fractions/Week) With Concurrent Chemotherapy, In the same participant cohort, the proportion of the participants who are eligible for an RT boost after completing a standard dose of RT (60 Gy), delivered in an accelerated fashion (6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy, will be estimated as well as its confidence interval., 4 weeks|Overall Survival With an Accelerated and Adaptive RT Approach., The overall survival (OS) for the treated participants will be characterized by Kaplan-Meier estimator. The medial OS will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval., 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) With an Accelerated and Adaptive RT Approach., Median progression-free survival for participants will be characterized by Kaplan-Meier estimator. The median PFS will be estimated as well as their 95% confidence intervals., 2 years|Number of Participants With Local Control With an Accelerated and Adaptive RT Approach, The local control rate for the same cohort of participants will be measured by standard of care imaging per NCCN guidelines at routine follow up clinic visits., 2 years
