Comparison of Contrast Enhanced Mammography to Breast MRI in Screening Patients at Increased Risk for Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) will be able to detect smaller/earlier breast cancers as well as breast MRI can.
Women at Increased Risk for Developing Breast Carcinoma
OTHER: Mammography (CESM) and MRI
compare the sensitivity and specificity CESM, CESM to that of breast MRI in a population of women who are being screened because they are at increased risk for developing breast cancer. For this purpose a positive CESM test will be defined as a score of 4 or 5. We will use the existing MRI BIRADS system to score CESM images based on the characteristics of individual lesions and increased enhancement compared to the background. A positive MRI test will be defined by a BIRADs score of 4 or 5., 1 year
