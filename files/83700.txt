Melphalan, Prednisone, Thalidomide and Defibrotide in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Patients
This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the association of Melphalan/ Prednisone/Thalidomide/Defibrotide (MPTD) as salvage treatment in advanced and refractory myeloma patients. This association might further increase the response rate achieved by oral MPT regimen

The safety will be assessed by showing DLT and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of defibrotide when administered in combination with MPT, The DLT is defined by the development of febrile neutropenia, or Grade 4 neutropenia \>= a week, or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity except neutropenia, or any \>= Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity considered by investigators to be related to study drug(s) in \>30% of pts.

Defibrotide (DF) is a novel orally bioavailable polydisperse oligonucleotide with anti-thrombotic and anti-adhesive effects, which has been shown to be active in various microangiopathies, including the treatment and prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease. While DF has minimal inhibitory effect on multiple myeloma (MM) in cell isolates, it showed single agent activity on human MM xenografts in SCID/NOD mice and markedly increased responsiveness of MM to cytotoxic agents, including melphalan, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in the same models. DF might thus enhance the response rate of Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide, while protecting against the prothrombotic state seen with this combination in the treatment of MM. In this multicenter, open label, non-randomised phase I/II trial, dosing safety and efficacy of melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide, and DF (MPTD) were determined in pts with relapsed/refractory MM.

Primary refractory or pts receiving therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded. Oral melphalan was administered at 0,25 mg/Kg on D1-4, oral prednisone at 1,5 mg/kg on D 1-4, thalidomide was delivered at 50 mg on D1-35 on cycle 1 and at 100 mg from cycle 2 to cycle 6.

Level + 1 DF = 17 mg/Kg i.v. or 2.4 g p.o. D1-4, followed by 1.6 g p.o. through D 35 Level + 2 DF = 34 mg/Kg i.v. or 4.8 g p.o. D 1-4, followed by 3.2 g p.o. through D 35 Level + 3 DF = 51 mg/Kg i.v. or 7.2 g p.o. D 1-4, followed by 4.8 g p.o. through D 35.

Each course was repeated every 35d for a total of 6 courses and no DVT prophylaxis was used.
