A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety of TRK-950 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of TRK-950 as single agent
2. To establish the dose of TRK-950 recommended for future phase 2 studies

This study is a first-in-human study of TRK-950 in patients with advanced solid tumors and is primarily designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRK-950 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion once weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days in Arm 1.

Once enrollment in Arm 1 was completed, two dose schedules will be evaluated in Arm 2 to determine the dosing schedule. Up to six (6) patients will be enrolled respectively.

In parallel, to determine anti-tumor activity up to twelve (12) patients will be enrolled in Arm 3.
