Study of the P16 Gene as a Predictor of Myelosuppression in Breast Cancer Patients
The primary purpose of this study is to measure the association between baseline expression of the senescence effector protein p16INK4a and myelosuppression due to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Patients with Stage I-IV breast cancer will be included and myelosuppression will be assessed after the first cycle of chemotherapy via measurement of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measured one time between days 7-11 post cycle one. Study subjects will also be asked to complete a brief health behaviors questionnaire to gather information on other relevant variables.
Breast Cancer
Determine if p16INK4a Expression at Baseline is Related to Nadir Neutrophil Counts in Women with Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy, To measure and correlate baseline p16INK4a expression in subjects with stage I-IV breast cancer starting a new course of chemotherapy with a post cycle 1 chemotherapy absolute neutrophil count (ANC)., 24 months
Define the Association Between p16INK4a Expression and Physical Activity, Smoking and Alcohol Consumption in Women with Breast Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy, To explore the associations between p16INK4a expression at baseline and amount of vigorous physical activity, smoking habits, and weekly alcohol consumption., 24 months|Explore the Associations between p16INK4a Expression at Baseline and Other Chemotherapy-Related Toxicities including Nausea and Vomiting, Neuropathy, Fatigue and Other Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities, To explore the associations between p16INK4a expression at baseline and other chemotherapy-related toxicities, including the maximum toxicity experienced during that course of chemotherapy., 24 Months|Explore Associations between p16INK4a Expression at Baseline, Chemotherapy Regimen, and its Effect on Patient Function, To explore the associations between p16INK4a expression at baseline and type of chemotherapy received, co-morbidities, concomitant medications, and tumor characteristics., 24 months
