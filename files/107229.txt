A Study of Surufatinib in the Treatment of Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This is a single-center, open, single-arm, phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety of patients with soft tissue sarcoma who have failed anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and whose antivascular agents have been effective and failed.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was used as the primary outcome measure to preliminatively estimate the efficacy and safety of 29 patients with soft tissue sarcoma who had failed chemotherapy with anthracyclines and who had received effective and failed antivascular agents. Sofantinib 300mg orally, once a day, with continuous administration every 21 days, until the disease progresses or becomes intolerable; Imaging methods were used every 6 weeks (±7 days) after enrollment according to RECIST1.1 standard to evaluate the efficacy of tumor.
