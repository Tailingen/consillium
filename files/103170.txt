Study of Eryaspase in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone as 2nd-Line Treatment in PAC
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have failed only one prior line of systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer and have measurable disease.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: eryaspase|DRUG: Gemcitabine plus Abraxane|DRUG: Irinotecan plus 5-FU plus leucovorin
Overall Survival (OS), To determine whether the addition of eryaspase to chemotherapy improves OS when compared to chemotherapy alone, ~12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To compare PFS between the 2 treatment arm. Progression is determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., ~24 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To compare the ORR between the 2 treatment arms. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve objective tumor response (CR or PR) per modified RECIST 1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., ~24 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR), To compare the DoR between the 2 treatment arms, ~24 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To compare the between the 2 treatment arms, ~24 weeks|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of eryaspase in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone by assessing the number of patients with with treatment emergent adverse events per CTCAE v5.0, ~9 months|Time to Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 First Worsening in Global Health Status Analysis, The time to first Worsening was defined as the date of randomization to the date of first Worsening occurred in patient score on their global health status. Patients who did not have any worsening were censored at date of last measurement or at baseline if no measurement is available post-baseline., ~1 year
Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms (see figure below):

* Arm A (investigational arm): eryaspase in combination with either gemcitabine/Abraxane or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI \[FOLinic acid-Fluorouracil-IRInotecan regimen\] or OnivydeÂ®/5 fluorouracil/leucovorin), or
* Arm B (control arm): gemcitabine/Abraxane or irinotecan-based therapy (FOLFIRI or Onivyde/5-FU/leucovorin)

The chemotherapy will be investigator's choice and based on what patient has received in first line treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient's withdrawal of consent.

An End of Treatment visit should occur within approximately 30 days from last dose of eryaspase or chemotherapy regimen.

A survival follow-up period will include the collection of survival, progression of disease if applicable, treatment updates, and quality of life assessments every 8 weeks.
