Safety Study of a Fluorescent Marker to Visualize Cancer Cells
Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced patient survival. In addition, in some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. We hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time, as they operate.
Skin Neoplasms
DRUG: BLZ-100
Number of participants with adverse events, Safety will be assessed by physical examination and measurement of vital signs and laboratory safety parameters., Within at least 1 week from baseline
Change in concentration of BLZ-100 in the blood, BLZ-100 levels in blood will be analyzed by chemical means and these data will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters., Prior to dosing and 1, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose|Determination of a dose level for Phase 2 studies, At end of study - approximately 14 months
Change in fluorescence signal in urine, Fluorescence signal in urine samples will be measured using an infrared imaging system to determine the amount of BLZ-100 being excreted in the urine post-dosing., Prior to dosing and at 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 and 24-48 hours post-dose|Change in fluorescent signal in skin tumor and normal skin, Fluorescence signal in skin tumor and normal skin will be measured in situ using the Fluobeam(TM) infrared imaging system., Prior to dosing on day 1 and at 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours post-dose|Expression of biomarkers of response in excised skin tumor, Immunohistochemistry will be used to measure the expression of other biomarkers of response, including Annexin A2, Ki67 and MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2), in normal and tumor tissue., 48 hours post-dose
