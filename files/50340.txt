Diet Modification in pAtients With Luminal Early Breast Cancer Candidate for Primary Surgery
to analyze the feasibility for patients with early luminal breast cancer to be compliant with a diet modification - ketogenic or proteins restricted diet - during 9 +/- 1 days, before breast cancer surgery.

It's a Pilot study, monocentric, randomized

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: iso-caloric ketogenic diet|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: protein restricted diet
study of the compliance of patients to the two proposed diets. The proportion of compliant patients to the proposed diet according to the dietary survey realized during 3 days, A patient is considered compliant to the diet if the caloric intake is equal +/- 25% to the caloric intake of the proposed diet AND For the ketogenic diet : the carbohydrate intake is equal +/- 25% to the carbohydrate intake of the proposed diet; i.e. a carbohydrate intake between 7.5 and 12.5% of the total energy intake For the protein restricted diet, the protein intake is equal +/- 25% to the protein intake proposed for this diet; i.e. a reduction between 15 and 25% compared to the previous protein intake, during 3 days before the primary surgery

Many patients are modifying their diet after the diagnosis of cancer. There is a supposedly benefit, among the general public, of starving cancer cells with several diet deprivations.

Due to the lack of coherent scientific data, no evidence base recommendations can be made regarding the optimal diet during cancer and its effect on cancer growth.

The objective of this trial is to analyze the feasibility for patients with early luminal breast cancer to be compliant with a diet modification - ketogenic or proteins restricted diet - during 9 +/- 1 days, before breast cancer surgery.

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the compliance to the proposed diet.

The study will be conducted in patients with luminal early breast cancer, candidate to primary surgery, in order to study an homogeneous population of patients, with good performance status and without nutritional deprivation.

Metabolic changes on the main metabolic pathways and the potential antitumor effects related to these metabolic changes following the diet will be analyzed as secondary objectives of the study. We hope to find biological hypotheses to further test in a next larger prospective trial.

The impact of the patient's beliefs, anxiety and/or depression on the compliance will be analyzed as well.
