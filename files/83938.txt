Adjuvant Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer
Hypofractionated radiation therapy is a new type of radiotherapy which has been shown to play a larger role in the treatment of prostate cancer. The aims of the trial were to evaluate the safety and feasibility of adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

The present study will be conducted as a prospective, prospective, single-centre, single-arm clinical trial. Patients after radical prostatectomy with high-risk pathological factors will receive hypofractionated post-prostatectomy radiotherapy in 15 fractions. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence of radiotherapy-related gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events,judging by (CTCAE)5.0. The secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS) including biochemical recurrence-free survival (bPFS) and radiological progression-free survival (RPFS), economic evaluations, self-assessment of quality of life including Abbreviated Version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer In-dex Composite Instrument (EPIC-26) and Physical Activity Rank Scale-3 (ARS-3), overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS).
