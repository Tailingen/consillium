Visualization of Anti-angiogenic Effects With Perfusion Computed Tomography (CTP)
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the anti-angiogenic effect of bevacizumab measured by CTP as a predictive marker for efficacy measured by progression-free survival (PFS) in mCRC patients under first-line bevacizumab-containing, fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: Computed tomography X-ray system
CTP as predictive marker for efficacy measured by progression-free survival, Predictive power of decrease in tumor vasculature on the clinical outcome in bevacizumab-based chemotherapy measured by progression-free survival (PFS). Decrease in tumor vasculature is measured by blood flow in CTP 3 compared to CTP 1 (baseline), one year
CTP as predictive marker for efficacy measured by progression-free survival, Predictive power of decrease in tumor vasculature on the clinical outcome in bevacizumab-based chemotherapy measured by progression-free survival (PFS). Decrease in tumor vasculature is measured by blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability surface-area product in CTP, one year|CTP as predictive marker for efficacy measured by overall survival, Predictive power of decrease in tumor vasculature measured by CTP on the clinical outcome in bevacizumab-based chemotherapy measured by overall survival (OS), four years|Tumor vasculature at progression, Tumor vasculature measured by blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability surface-area product in CTP at the time of confirmed progression, one year|Subgroup analyses according to the RAS mutation status, BRAF mutation status and VEGF-A level, Predictive power of RAS-mutation status, BRAF-mutation status and VEGF-A level on the clinical outcome in bevacizumab-based chemotherapy measured by progression-free survival (PFS), one year|Local and distant recurrences, Rates of local and distant recurrences according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, one year
So far, CTP has provided non-invasive imaging of tumor biological response to anti-angiogenic and vascular targeting agents in a number of clinical trials with increasing clinical application. CTP can be examined with a variety of commercially available CE-certified CT scanners and imaging post-processing is possible with commercially available CE-certified software from different vendors, too. In several studies, anti-angiogenic effects have been detected with CTP but further evidence for its clinical validation has to be proven in clinical trials.

Changes in tumor vasculature measured by CTP will be correlated to the clinical efficacy parameters progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate, thus identifying a group of patients who profit most from the anti-angiogenic treatment.
