Ixazomib in the Prophylaxis of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease.
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HTC) is the only curative option for many patients with hematologic malignancies but \>50% of this patients will develop extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains the most important complication after HTC.

Classically, the most effective strategies to prevent GVHD have not improved survival; therefore, the new strategies are being sought.

This study is designed in two phases: the main objective for phase I study is the more suitable dose for ixazomib search. Phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of ixazomib at the doses stablished in phase I.
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Ixazomib|DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Any prophylaxis for GVHD
Maximun tolerated dose, Maximun tolerated dose of the ixazomib in combination with sirolimus and tacrolimus in patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the phase I study will be determinated, 3 months after transplantation (a total of 3 cycles of 28 days length of study treatment)|Efficacy of ixazomib for phase II study, Presence of moderate plus severe Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease according to NIH scale in patients receiving the maximum tolerated dose., 9 months after transplantation (a total of 9 cycles of 28 days length of study treatment)
Event immune recovery for the phase I study, Quantification of time of event immune recovery in patients exposed and not exposed to ixazomib., The post-transplant days +180, +270, +365, +545, +730|Event free survival for phase II study., Quantification of time of event free survival for patients receiving the maximum tolerated dose., Just after the time of transplantation and 1 and 2 years after transplantation|Event immune recovery for phase II study., Quantification of time of event immune recovery in patients exposed and not exposed to ixazomib., The post-transplant days +180, +270, +365, +545, +730|Exposure to immunosuppressive treatment for phase II study., Evaluation of needs of additional permitted immunosuppressive treatment administered as concomitant medication, 1 and 2 years after transplantation.|Overall disease free survival for phase II study, Quantification of time of overall survival after study treatment, 2 years after transplantation.|Serious adverse event for phase II study, Describe the serious adverse event notified during the study, 1 and 2 years after transplantation|Risk of moderate or severe GVHD for phase II study, To evaluate the risk of moderate or severe GVHD according to the NIH scale, 2 years after transplantation|Differences among patients receiving a reduced-intensity and myeloablative conditioning regimen for phase II study., To evaluate differences in terms of chronic GVHD and treatment tolerance, 1 and 2 years after transplantation
The study design is based on a phase I / II trial in eight Spanish hospitals.

In the phase I, a number of 3 to 12 patients will be included to evaluate the optimal dose of ixazomib in combination with sirolimus and tacrolimus.

In the phase II, a total number of 130 patients will be randomized to receive ixazomib or the best medical recommendation added in order to evaluate the efficacy of ixazomib. This patients who will receive any prophylaxis for GVHD, except those patients who received antithymocyte globulin , cyclophosphamide or any T depletion protocol in vitro or in vivo.
