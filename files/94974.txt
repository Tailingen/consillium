Paclitaxel-induced Polyneuropathy in Breast Cancer: Early Detection, Risk Factors, Quality of Life and Lifestyle Outcomes
This is a single center prospective observational cohort study that aims to:

* examine and identify possible risk and susceptibility factors for the incidence and progression of chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (CIPN) in female patients primarily operated for early non-metastatic breast cancer who will receive adjuvant chemotherapy containing paclitaxel
* test different neurophysiological methods for early detection of CIPN
* explore changes that underlie the development of CIPN in relation to clinical presentations, neurophysiological assessment, including measures of small nerve fiber dysfunction, and possible biochemical, metabolic and genetic associations
* explore the effects of CIPN in the patient's lifestyle and quality of life for up to 12 months after the initiation of treatment

Correlation of significant deterioration in neurophysiological parameters including alterations in morphology of small fibers or reduced IENFD (Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density) on first follow up visit and development of CIPN, by performing detailed clinical neurophysiological examination and skin biopsies (where IENFD will be quantified) in different timepoints as described in the study protocol, 1 year|Correlation of abnormal laboratory tests in baseline assessment with development/severity of CIPN, 1 year|Correlation of parameters of NCS, temperature thresholds, and IENFD at baseline screening with development and severity of CIPN, 1 year|Biochemical and metabolic abnormalities prior to paclitaxel treatment and their association with the development of CIPN, by performing blood tests, genotyping and skin biopsies, 1 year
Calculate and compare the false negative and false positive rate of CIPN in every used method during follow up, 1 year|Association of altered scoring in different questionnaires (Fact/GOG-Ntx, SFN-SIQ) and different examinations (UENS) with the presence and severity of CIPN, 1 year|Evaluation of whether specific genotypes of breast cancer and higher or lower levels of different proteins are related with higher incidence rate and severity of CIPN, by extracting DNA from blood samples and performing subsequent genotyping using SNP-array and GWAS. Also, by using proteomics analysis in blood samples and measure plasma levels of different proteins., 2 years|Study any correspondence between deterioration of QoL indicated by REBECCA monitoring system and standardized patient self-reported measures with diagnosed CIPN after implementation of different methods during follow up, 2 years
The patients who follow the inclusion criteria of the study will be asked to complete:

* a baseline evaluation prior to receiving treatment. This will include a bedside clinical-neurological evaluation, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and quantitative sensory tests of thermal threshold (QST), blood sampling, an oral glucose tolerance test, a skin biopsy, and answering of questionnaires for assessment of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy as well as self-reports on their pre-treatment health and lifestyle status and cancer specific symptomatology
* an on-treatment evaluation 4 weeks after the start of the treatment which will include NCS and QST
* a post-treatment evaluation 4 weeks after the end of treatment which will include the evaluations stated above. During this visit the participants will be provided with the REBECCA lifestyle monitoring system which will include a smartwatch, installation of a mobile app and a PC plugin. The patients will be also asked to fill in some self-rated evaluations as in the pre-treatment period. Researchers, based on the outcomes of the participants, will divide them in two study groups A. CIPN-group and B. No CIPN which will be monitored with the REBECCA monitoring system.
* a final evaluation. This will be performed 8 months after the post-treatment evaluation and it will include clinical-neurological evaluation, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and thermal threshold testing (QST). Additionally, the participants will be requested to fill in the same self-rated evaluations as in the baseline and the post-treatment.
