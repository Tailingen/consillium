Osteosarcoma Study #2: A Randomized Trial of Pre-Surgical Chemotherapy vs. Immediate Surgery and Adjuvant Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Osteosarcoma. A Pediatric Oncology Group Phase III Study
The study is designed to determine if the administration of multi-drug adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with primary non-metastatic osteogenic sarcoma, both prior to and after the definitive surgical procedure for their primary tumor is superior as a treatment strategy to the current approach of giving drugs only after the definitive surgical procedure has been performed. An effort will be made as well to determine if the administration of pre-definitive surgery, chemotherapy leads to an increase in the proportion of the patients suitable for a limb salvage primary surgical procedure.
