PM8002 or Placebo Plus Nab-Paclitaxel as First-line Treatment in Inoperable Locally Advanced/Metastatic TNBC
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of PM8002 in combination with Nab-Paclitaxel compared with placebo combined with Nab-Paclitaxel as first-line treatment in inoperable locally advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC)
Triple Negative Breast Cancer(TNBC)
DRUG: PM8002|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on assessments by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis are censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in
PFS assessed by investigator, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on assessments by investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in|Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by BIRC or investigators, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR: disappearance of all lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR as assessed by BIRC or investigators based on RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by BIRC or investigators, DCR is defined as the sum rate of CR, PR and Stable Disease (SD), as determined by BIRC or investigators using RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in|Duration of response (DoR) assessed by BIRC or investigators, DoR is defined as the time period from the date of initial CR or PR until the date of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 37 months from first patient in|Incidence and severity of Adverse Event (AE) according to CTCAE 5.0, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Differences in the scores of health-related quality of life (HRQol) evaluated by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" (Item 29) and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined score are presented., Up to 30 days after last treatment|Differences in the scores of health-related quality of life (HRQol) evaluated by EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast Cancer (QLQ-BR42), Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score denotes worse symptoms for the systemic therapy side effects symptom scale., Up to 30 days after last treatment
