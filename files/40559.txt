Monosialoganglioside Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced by Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Lung Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether monosialoganglioside are effective in the prevention of neurotoxicity induced by albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy in lung cancer patients, and improve the quality of life of patients.
Neurotoxicity
DRUG: monosialoganglioside
incidence of neurotoxicity, up to 4 weeks after the 2nd cycle albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy
time(daysï¼‰neurotoxicity arise, up to 6 months neurotoxicity after the first use of albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy|Peripheral nerve conduction velocity, up to 4 weeks after the albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy
time(days) of neurotoxicity adverse events alleviation, up to 180 days after the albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy|quality of life, up to 4 weeks after the albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy|side effects of monosialoganglioside, up to 4 weeks after the albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy
Lung cancer patients received a single-agent albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy are included in this trial. Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and blank control group based on segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients will complete at least chemotherapy and GM1 injection/blank control. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, albumin-bound paclitaxel is conducted in D1 and D8, GM1(40mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D1 to D8. Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life assessment will be conducted every cycle and 3m/6m after the chemotherapy.
