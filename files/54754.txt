Imaging Study to Investigate the Safety and Diagnostic Performance of rhPSMA 7.3 (18F) in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.
A prospective, Phase 3, multi center, single-arm, imaging study investigating the safety and diagnostic performance of Radio-hybrid Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (rhPSMA) 7.3 (18F) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligand in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Injection|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Positron Emission Tomography scan
Specificity, The primary objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting N1 disease (as determined by the central BIE) on a patient level compared to the histopathology of pelvic lymphatic tissue removed during RP and PLND., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|Sensitivity, The primary objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting N1 disease (as determined by the central BIE) on a patient level compared to the histopathology of pelvic lymphatic tissue removed during RP and PLND., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration
Verified Detection Rate (VDR) for M1 Lesions - Percentage of Patients in Whom rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Imaging Detected at Least One Verified M1 Metastasis, as Determined by Central BIE and Confirmed by SoT (Biopsy or Imaging) (Objective 1), This was a key secondary endpoint in this study and included patients in the EEP with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) imaging., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET. followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|Percentage of Patients With Negative Conventional Imaging for M1 Disease in Whom rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Detected at Least One Verified M1 Metastasis, as Determined by Central BIE (Objective 2), Patients counted in this variable were a subset of those in Point 1 above, where both the numerator and denominator were only counting patients with negative conventional imaging (according to investigator assessment) for M1 disease., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|Patient-level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET BIE for N1 and M1 Lesions Compared to Histopathology or Confirmatory Imaging (M1 Lesions Only) (Objective 3), This analysis included patients with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) imaging and either N1 or M1 lesions detected, where PPV=TP/(TP+FP)., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET for Detecting PLN Metastases Compared to Surgical Pathology on a Patient-level, in Which a FP Patient is Defined as Having at Least One FP Region (Right or Left Pelvis), Regardless of Any Coexisting TP Findings (Objective 4), This analysis included patients in the EAP where rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) imaging detected PLN metastasis. Regions where rhPSMA7.3 (18F) imaging detected no LN metastasis were not included (by definition of PPV), hence only TP and FP regions were considered. TPs were all patients with a surgical pathology confirmed positive region and without a FP region. FP patients were those patients with any rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PETpositive region with negative or no surgical pathology., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|NPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET for Detecting PLN Metastases Compared to Surgical Pathology on a Patient-level, in Which a FN Patient is Defined as Having at Least One FN Region (Right or Left Pelvis), Regardless of Any Coexisting TN Findings (Objective 5), This analysis included patients in the EAP with rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) imaging where no LN metastases were detected and LN surgical pathology was available; where NPV=TN/(TN+FN)., Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|The Percentage of Patients Being Upstaged to N1 or M1 Disease. (Objective 6a), TP \[confirmed by SoT\] central BIE PET finding and negative conventional imaging finding from the local reading, Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|The Percentage of Patients in Whom Planned RP Was Converted to EBRT. (Objective 6b), Conventional images within 60 days or at least 24 hours prior to rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET, followed by treatment within 60 days post IMP administration|Kappa Statistic for the Agreement Between and Within Blinded Independent Readers on the Interpretation of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Scans (Objective 7), Pairwise agreement between any 2 of the 3 readers (Kappa statistic could not be calculated for 2 of the pairwise agreements), and within readers between the initial read and re-read (Kappa statistics could not be calculated for 2 of the within-reader agreements), PET/CT scans on Day 1
Main objective is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting N1 disease (as determined by the central blinded image evaluation \[BIE\]) on a patient level compared to the histopathology of pelvic lymphatic tissue removed during radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). At least one positive pelvic LN on PET (N1) and one positive lymph node (LN) as determined by histopathology (pN1) on the same side of the pelvis (left or right) will be deemed a True Positive (TP) at the patient level.
