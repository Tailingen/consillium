PET/MRI as a Predictor of Response to Pre-op Chemoradiation in Resectable Rectal Cancer: a Pilot Study
This is a single arm, single center pilot study of 40 patients with uT3N0 or uT1-3N+ rectal cancer receiving pre-operative chemoradiation. Subjects will undergo PET/MRI scans before and after surgery.
Rectal Carcinoma
Negative post-chemoradiation PET/MRI scan, as correlated with surgical pathology, 4-8 weeks post-chemoradiation
Recurrence-free survival, 5 years|Disease-specific survival, 5 years|Overall survival, 5 years
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the negative predictive value of PET/MRI for determining pathological complete response from neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
