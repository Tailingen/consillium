A Clinical Trial to Assess COM503 in Participants with Advanced Solid Malignancies
The overall goal of this first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial is to learn about the safety and dosing of COM503 when given alone or in combination with zimberelimab in participants with advanced solid tumors.

The primary objectives of this study are:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of COM503 as monotherapy and COM503 in combination with zimberelimab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
* To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / maximum administered dose (MAD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of COM503 as monotherapy and in combination with zimberelimab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
