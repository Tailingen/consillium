Clinical Trial to Investigate the Efficacy of Treatment With Gemcitabine/Pazopanib in Patients With Biliary Tree Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether gemcitabine and pazopanib are effective in the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tree cancer (cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma).
Cholangiocarcinoma|Gallbladder Carcinoma|Biliary Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine-Pazopanib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), Imaging evaluation for the determination of response to treatment will be performed every 8 weeks, At an average of 6 months for each patient
Evaluation of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of disease progression or date of death, assessed up to 48 months|Evaluation of 6-month Progression-Free Survival rate (6-month PFS rate), The aim is to determine the rate of PFS in patients, at 6 months of treatment, Assessed up to 6 months|Evaluation of Overall Survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 48 months.|Assessment of safety and tolerability, Distribution of Adverse Events (AEs) according to severity grade. Evaluation of AEs will be performed every 21 days (per treatment cycle) throughout the course of treatment, Assessed up to 48 months|Evaluation of Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of Life Questionnaires will be filled out before treatment initiation, every 8 weeks and at the end of treatment, Assessed up to 9 months|Evaluation of potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in tissue and blood samples, The following biomarkers will be analyzed:

In bioptic material:

* Stem Cell Factor (KIT)
* Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 (VEGF-2)
* Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3 (VEGF-3)

In peripheral blood/plasma:

* Interleukin 8
* Interleukin 12
* Hepatocyte growth factor

There may be additions to the biomarkers to be analyzed, dependent on the clinical and bibliographical data, Tumor blocks and blood samples will be collected at baseline
This is an open label, uncontrolled, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gemcitabine/Pazopanib combination as 1st line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tree adenocarcinoma. A total of 46 patients will be included in the study. The patients will receive open label Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 and Pazopanib 800 mg per os on days 1 to 21 every 21 days. Treatment with gemcitabine/pazopanib combination will continue until disease progression, appearance of significant toxicity, completion of 8 cycles or informed consent withdrawal. Upon completion of 8 treatment cycles with the combination, and in the absence of disease progression, administration of pazopanib monotherapy as maintenance treatment will be continued until disease progression, appearance of significant toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.

Imaging assessments will be performed every 8 weeks
