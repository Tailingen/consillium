Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Moderately hypofractionated conformal radiation combined With S-1
Progression-Free Survival, 3 years
Overall Survival, 3 years|rate of grade 3-4 radiation esophagitis, 1 year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation pneumonitis, 1 year
This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy and toxicities of moderately hypofractionated conformal radiation combined With S-1 for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

All patients will receive two cycles of S-1 (40mg/„é°, BID, po) on D1-14, D22-35, combined with thoracic radiotherapy of 60 Gy/24 fractions for GTV and 40 Gy/16 fractions for CTV. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date on which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will be calculated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
