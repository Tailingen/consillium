A Study of TAS-120 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study for the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor futibatinib (TAS-120). The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumor activity of futibatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors with and without genomic FGF/FGFR abnormalities. The study will be conducted in 3 parts:

1. Dose escalation portion to determine the -Maximum Tolerated Dose and/ or Recommended Phase 2 Dose of futibatinib.
2. Phase 1 expansion portion to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of futibatinib in patients with tumors harboring FGF/FGFR aberrations, including patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), primary central nervous system tumors, urothelial carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer.
3. Phase 2 study portion to confirm objective response rate of futibatinib in intrahepatic CCA patients with tumors harboring FGFR2 gene rearrangements (incl fusions).
