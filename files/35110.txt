Continuous Local-anesthetic Wound Infusion for Neck Dissection
The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of continuous local anesthetic wound infusion to improve quality of recovery following ablative surgery and neck dissection.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: 0.5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride|DRUG: 0.9% Normal Saline
Quality of Recovery, The primary outcome will be the 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-15)., At 24 hours after surgery
Postoperative salvage analgesics, Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary for 72 hours that records their daily postoperative salvage analgesics., Up to 72 hours after surgery|Phrenic nerve block, Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary for 72 hours that records their daily dyspnea., Up to 72 hours after surgery|Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain, Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary for 72 hours that records the numeric pain rating scale composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain)., Up to 72 hours after surgery|Recurrent laryngeal nerve block, Patients will be asked to complete a daily diary for 72 hours that records their daily hoarseness., Up to 72 hours after surgery|Quality of Recovery, The primary outcome will be the 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-15)., Up to 72 hours after surgery
Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) time, Length of PACU stay, Intraoperative (At the end of surgery)|Post-operative hospital time, Length of hospital stay, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Bilateral cervical plexus catheters are convenient and safe to place under the direct vision of the surgeons during ablative and neck dissection. The investigators hypothesize that continuous local anesthetic wound infusion to block bilateral cervical plexus will improve quality of recovery following ablative surgery and neck dissection. The primary endpoint is the quality of recovery, which will be assessed using the 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire (QoR-15). Secondary endpoints include numeric pain scale, number and proportion of patients on salvage analgesics, Incidence of phrenic nerve block, Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve block, length of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, length of post-operative hospital stay.
