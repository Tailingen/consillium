Icotinib as Neoadjuvant Therapy in EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib as neoadjuvant in EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially radical treated by surgery.
EGF-R Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Icotinib
Objective Response Rate, eight weeks
R0 resection rate, eight weeks|Disease Control Rate, eight weeks|Decrease in cT-stage, eight weeks|pathologic complete remission rate, eight weeks|Time to Tumor Progression, five years after surgery|Overall survival, five years after surgery|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, five years after surgery
Patients with EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially radical treated by surgery are arranged to receive Icotinib with a dose of 125 mg three times per day orally for 8 weeks as neoadjuvant therapy; then patients with clinical benefits receive surgical resection of the tumor. If there is curative effect of Icotinib according to the RECIST or pathological report, the patients will continue receive Icotinib for two years as adjuvant therapy after surgery or till progressive disease or unaccepted toxicity. The primary objective of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib neoadjuvant therapy.
