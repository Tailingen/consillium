complete remission rate, complete remission rate after treated by Sintilimab+ R-CHOP regimen., every 3 months until 30 months after the last patient's enrollment.
overall survival, from the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause, 30 months after the last patient's enrollment|adverse events, any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.For safety reasons, the initial enrollment of the first 6 patients in the study will be slow and conduct intensive monitoring for safety. the monitoring time window for each patient is 21 days after the first treatment.
