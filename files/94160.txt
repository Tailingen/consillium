Liquid Biopsy-Based Novel Modality for Postoperative Management of Lung Cancer
The goal of this study is to develop new techniques for minimal residual disease(MRD) monitoring and to confirm the efficacy and safety of MRD-guided postoperative management for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* How to develop multi-omics-based high-sensitivity detection methods to accurately capture MRD and monitor postoperative recurrence in lung cancer?
* Is adaptive treatment guided by ctDNA-MRD for lung cancer patients superior to traditional clinical management and effectively improves survival?
* Do heterogeneous patient populations (grouped by stages, histopathological subtypes, driver mutations, and treatment histories) show differences in effects under ctDNA-MRD guided postoperative management strategies?

Approximately 30% of early-stage lung cancer patients experience recurrence after curative surgery. However, the clinical utility of routine chest CT surveillance remains limited. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that liquid biopsy-based minimal residual disease (MRD) detection may serve as a more sensitive monitoring strategy. Longitudinal ctDNA dynamics analysis further enables real-time assessment of tumor progression and early detection of molecular relapse.

This study aims to develop a novel multidimensional approach for non-invasive postoperative recurrence monitoring in lung cancer and establish an MRD-guided adjuvant therapy model to optimize precision treatment and MRD-stratified follow-up protocols for lung cancer patients. This study will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of novel monitoring methods and further compare emerging non-invasive recurrence monitoring approaches with conventional ctDNA-based techniques, driving continuous advancements in lung cancer research.
