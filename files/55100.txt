Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: a Real-world Multicenter Cross-sectional Study (CABS001 Study)
Objective: To investigate the current clinical practice of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early stage breast cancer in China. Methods: The data of early breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB in 40 Grade III Level A hospitals in China in 2018 will be collected. Different centers, tracer methods, molecular typing and neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be used as stratification factors to analyze the implementation rate, number of detections, positive rate of SLNB and the follow-up treatment.

the performance rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early stage breast cancer in China, the performance rate of SLNB refers to the number of patients implementing SLNB divided by the total number of breast cancer patients, 2020-12-31|the positive rate of SLNs in patients with early stage breast cancer in China, SLNs positive rate is the number of positive SLN patients divided by the number of patients implementing SLNB, 2020-12-31|the number of resected SLNs in patients with early stage breast cancer in China, the average number of resected SLNB will be calculated, 2020-12-31
incidence of infection events after SLNB in patients with early stage breast cancer in China, incidence of infection events is the number of patients who have an infection event after SLNB divided by the total number of patients implementing SLNB. The infection events include incision infection, local skin infection and injured vascular infection., 2021-12-31
