Phase I/II Study of SyB L-0501RI in Combination With Rituximab to Treat Lymphoma
For SyB L-0501RI administered by an intravenous rapid infusion in combination with rituximab, the safety will be investigated in previously untreated patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Lg-B-NHL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and the safety and tolerability will be investigated in patients with recurrent/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
