Ruxolitinib Plus LVP in Patients With R/R ETP-ALL
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if present, and dose schedule of ruxolitinib in combination with L-ASP, vincristine, and prednisone (LVP) in patients with relapsed-and-refractory (R/R) early T precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ETP-ALL). Once determined, the purpose of this study will be to determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib in combination with LVP in patients with R/R ETP-ALL.
