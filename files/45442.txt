International Study to Evaluate a Navigation Program for Older People With Cancer and Their Family Caregivers (EU NAVIGATE Study)
Most people with cancer are older, and this affects millions of Europeans yearly. Integrating high-quality, equitable, and cost-effective care across the continuum of supportive, palliative, and end-of-life care for both patients and family caregivers is highly relevant from a healthcare, prevention, and economic perspective.

EU NAVIGATE is an interdisciplinary, cross-country, and intersectoral project funded by the European Union. The overall aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a patient and family navigation intervention (NavCare-EU) for older people with cancer and declining health and their family caregivers in different healthcare systems in Europe. Nav-Care EU is a person- and family-centered non-pharmacological intervention in which navigators collaborate with patients and families to improve quality of life and improve levels of social support, foster empowerment, and facilitate timely and equitable access to health and social care services and resources as needed, throughout the supportive and palliative care continuum. NavCare-EU is based on the existing and successfully tested Nav-CARE(c) intervention from Canada.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated through an international 6-country multisite pragmatic fast-track randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded mixed methods process evaluation to compare the NavCare-EU intervention in addition to standard care with the provision of standard care alone. The RCT and process evaluation will be conducted in Belgium (Flanders), Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal. Participants are people with cancer and declining health, who are aged 70 years and older, as well as their close family caregivers.

Specific objectives are:

1. To compare the NavCare-EU intervention to care as usual, in terms of its:

1. Effectiveness on (1) global health status/quality of life, and the levels of social support (two co-primary outcomes); and on feelings of loneliness of older persons with cancer across the continuum of supportive, palliative, and end-of-life care; (2) family caregiver burden
2. cost-effectiveness
3. effects on different subgroups defined by characteristics known to affect health equity and equitable access, i.e., gender, age, socioeconomic status, extent of social support and living situation, and geographical location (rural vs. urban)
4. effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in different health care systems and care regimes in Europe

2. To evaluate the implementation processes of the NavCare-EU intervention and the feasibility of its integration in different health care systems and care regimens in Europe, the contextual barriers and facilitators for effective and sustainable implementation, and the mechanisms involved in reaching the outcomes in each country, as perceived by patients, family caregivers, and other care providers
