The vascular invasions is a common complication in 16% to 30% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), contributing to poor prognosis and increasing the risk of cancer recurrence, with a median survival of approximately 2.7 to 4 months without intervention. Both the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend that HCC patients with vascular invasions be classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage C and receive systemic treatments. Nevertheless, there is limited data on patients with highly complicated HCC and no optimal treatment strategy for this patient population. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are commonly utilized in the systemic therapy of HCC, while the combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with systemic therapy has significantly improved treatment outcomes in advanced-stage patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that a triplet regimen comprising TACE, TKI, and ICIs may yield better prognoses for HCC patients with vascular invasions. This study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of the triplet regimen of TKIs, ICIs, and TACE versus Lenvatinib combined with ICIs in advanced-stage HCC with vascular invasions
