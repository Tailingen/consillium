Combination of RAD001 With Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients
This 2 step study aims to establish a tolerable dose level and regimen of RAD001 in patients with advanced NCLC not previously treated with systemic therapy. In step 1 of this study, RAD 001 is given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel and in Step 2 RAD001 is given in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: RAD001
Establish the feasible doses/regimens of RAD001 in combination with chemotherapy. Primary endpoint is the End-of-cycle DLT rate, Ever 3 months or once a critical DLT occurs
Relative dose intensity (RDI) of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel (step 1), End of step 1|Relative dose intensity (RDI) of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + bevacizumab (step 2), End of Step 2|PK parameters derived from PK profiles of treatment drugs alone and in combination, End of Step 1 and Step 2|Best overall response - measured by CT/MRI scan every 6-8 week, Every 6-8 week
This is a two-step, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation Phase 1 study in which RAD001 is administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) in Step 1 as well as carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (CPB) in Step 2 in patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) NSCLC not treated previously with systemic therapy for advanced disease
