IMC-F106C Regimen Versus Nivolumab Regimens in Previously Untreated Advanced Melanoma (PRISM-MEL-301)
This is a phase 3, randomized, controlled study of brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) plus nivolumab compared to standard nivolumab regimens in HLA-A\*02:01-positive participants with previously untreated advanced melanoma.
Advanced Melanoma
DRUG: Brenetafusp|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Nivolumab + Relatlimab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1)., Up to ~45 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to time of death from any cause., Up to ~57 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST 1.1., Up to ~45 months|Number of Participants Experiencing ≥1 Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that occur in the study., Up to ~57 months|Number of Participants Experiencing ≥1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE), An SAE is any untoward medical consequence that results in death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or any other important medical event in the opinion of the Investigator., Up to ~57 months|Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose Interruption, Reduction, or Discontinuation, The number of participants with a dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation due to AE will be reported., Up to ~45 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IMC-F106C, The Cmax of IMC-F106C will be reported., Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, and 3: Predose and 0.5 and 4 hours postdose|Incidence of anti-IMC-F106C Antibodies, The incidence of anti-IMC-F106C antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, will be reported., Up to ~45 months|Association between PFS and Intra-Tumor Immune Cells, The potential association between the effect of IMC-F106C on efficacy and intra-tumor environment will be explored. Intra-tumor environment is estimated as the ratio of CD3+ to CD163+ cells and the correlation with PFS will be estimated by the hazard ratio (+/- 95% CI) from a Cox model. This analysis will be restricted to subjects randomized to receive IMC-F106C., Up to ~45 months|Health-Related Quality of Life, The change from baseline over time and between treatments of health-related quality of life will be reported., Up to ~45 months
