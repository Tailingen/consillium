Evaluation of Bortezomib Induced Peripheral Neuropathy of Multiple Myeloma (MM) Patients
In the present study we are planning to study electrophysiological changes related to the dose and time of bortezomib administration in newly diagnosed patients with MM, during the first months of treatment and 6 months after ending. In addition a possible correlation between the incidence of BIPN and the subtype of myeloma and other risk factors will be investigated.
Multiple Myeloma|Peripheral Neuropathy
PROCEDURE: EMG
A dose-related neurotoxic effect of bortezomib will be determined through regression analysis with the change in TNSr as the dependent variable Bortezomib doses will use as independent variables., 3 months
To accommodate the dose of bortezomib with the progression of Peripheral Neuropathy, 4 months
