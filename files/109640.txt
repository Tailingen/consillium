A Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics and Safety Between BR9004 and BR9004-1 in Healthy Male Volunteers
To compare the pharmacokinetics and safety between BR9004 and BR9004-1 in healthy male subjects after a single-dose administration while fasting.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BR9004|DRUG: BR9004-1
Pharmacokinetic variables-Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration(Cmax) of BR9004 and BR9004-1, 1~22 days after medication|Pharmacokinetic variables-AUClast, Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over the time interval from 0 to the last quantifiable plasma concentration(AUClast) of BR9004 and BR9004-1, 1~22 days after medication
Pharmacokinetic variables-t1/2β, Terminal half-life(t1/2β) of BR9004 and BR9004-1, 1~22 days after medication|Pharmacokinetic variables-Tmax, Time of maximum concentration(Tmax) of BR9004 and BR9004-1, 1~22 days after medication|Pharmacokinetic variables-AUCinf, Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over the time interval from 0 to extrapolated to infinity(AUCinf) of BR9004 and BR9004-1, 1~22 days after medication
This is a randomized, open label, single dose, full replicated crossover study to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety between BR9004 and BR9004-1 in healthy male subjects under fasting conditions. To this end, subjects were divided into two sequence groups \[Sequence A (TRTR) \& Sequence B (RTRT), T: BR9004, single oral administration, R: BR9004-1, single oral administration\].
