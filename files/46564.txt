Neoadjuvant Doxorubicin, Polyglutamate Paclitaxel, Capecitabine and Metronomic Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of neoadjuvant treatment utilizing chemotherapy formulations with favorable toxicity profiles: weekly doxorubicin, PPX and capecitabine. It is expected this combination will at least maintain the efficacy of a traditional chemotherapy regimen but will be associated with less toxicity, particularly nausea, vomiting and alopecia. In order to accomplish this the investigators have designed a chemotherapy regimen whose components (or administration schedule) are associated with minimal or no alopecia and are also considered to have low emetogenic potential.

In an attempt to improve the efficacy of the regimen the investigators plan to study an alternate schedule of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate administration (metronomic chemotherapy) which appears to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore enhance the activity of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered concurrently.

In this trial the investigators aim to determine the clinical and pathologic response rate of 12 weeks of doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of PPX and capecitabine. Metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be administered during the 24 weeks of chemotherapy.
