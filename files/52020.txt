Role of Curcumin in Paclitaxel Induced PN
Paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy is the most common and serious side effect associated with Paclitaxel treatment in breast cancer patients receiving Paclitaxel.

The efficacy of antioxidant molecules as neuroprotective strategies to preventing the development of peripheral neuropathy has been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Vitamin E and Glutathione have been explored as adjuvant therapies to preventing taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. Other tested neuroprotective treatments with limited success include amifostine, glutamine and acetyl l-carnitine. Curcumin's antioxidant capacity is similar to other potent antioxidants, such as trolox (a vitamin E analog). Curcumin inhibits lipid peroxidation in different tissues, regulates intracellular levels of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and is an effective intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger.

The investigators are going to investigate the neuroprotective effect of Curcumin against Paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy.
Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Curcumin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Evaluate the effect of Curcumin on the incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in breast cancer patients., After each cycle, initial evaluation of response will be done guided by clinical examination and functional assessment and questionnaire., Baseline|Evaluate the effect of Curcumin on the damage of nerve fibers induced by paclitaxel., Nerve growth factor level will be obtained at day 0 and at the end of the paclitaxel course, Baseline
Evaluate the effect of adding curcumin to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy on response rate in neoadjuvant therapy., CT scan will be done before first dose of paclitaxel and at the end of the course, baseline
The work is a prospective, randomized, open label controlled study. A total of 90 breast cancer female patients will be enrolled in the study. Eligible patients will simply be randomized using random allocation generator, after the end of anthracycline adjuvant therapy to one of two groups, Group I: will receive paclitaxel regimen plus 2g of curcumin Group II: will receive paclitaxel regimen only.

The cases involved in the study will be recruited from Ain Shams Teaching Hospital.

All patients presenting to the department were assessed for eligibility according to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Details of the research steps that the subscriber will be exposed to:

* Base line evaluation then alignment in either intervention or control group either for taking the interventional drug or standard of care in control group.
* Blood samples will be collected at baseline.
* Patient will be given a weekly supply of the medication and will be asked to take his prescribed dose daily.
* Every week all patients will be asked about their symptoms and if they experience any adverse drug reaction.
* Patients will receive the interventional drug until the last paclitaxel dose will be taken.
* After 3 months, another full clinical examination and blood sample will be obtained.
