organ responses were defined according to the updated International Society of Amyloidosis criteria, "through study completion, an average of 1 year".
AL amyloidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by progressive multiorgan failure and premature death. While autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the standard therapy, eligibility is limited, and excludes a substantial proportion of patients. Recent guidelines recommend daratumumab-based regimens for these patients, but, particularly for cases with severe renal involvement, optimal treatment remains a challenge.

This study explore the efficacy of daratumumab monotherapy in patients with histologically proven severe renal involvement who are ineligible for ASCT
