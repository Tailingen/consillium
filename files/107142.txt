Tirelizumab in Combination With Carboplatin and Albumin-binding Paclitaxel for Neoadjuvant Therapy in HNSCC
In this study, 100 patients with resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (oral squamous cell carcinoma and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma) were enrolled, who were combined with tirelizumab, carboplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel before and after surgery. Tumor tissues and paracancer tissues of patients were collected to observe the imaging and pathological changes before and after treatment. At the same time, clinical information of patients, such as pathological grade, stage, treatment, prognosis, serology, imaging, etc. were collected to evaluate the safety and feasibility of tirelizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-binding paclitaxel for neoadjuvant therapy of resectable oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. This is a prospective, one-arm, phase II clinical study.

Purpose Main purpose The efficacy of Tirelizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy for resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was evaluated by calculating the major pathological response (MPR) rates in the experimental group.

The severity of adverse events associated with neoadjuvant therapy will be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) during the course of this study and during follow-up, the incidence of adverse events in the experimental and control groups will be compared, and the safety of neoadjuvant therapy with Tirelizumab combined with carboplatin and albumin-paclitaxel in resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma will be evaluated.

Secondary Purpose

1. One-year event survival rate and event-free survival (EFS) of enrolled patients were evaluated (five years);
2. Pathological complete response rate (pCR) of enrolled patients was evaluated (5 years);
3. pTR of enrolled patients was evaluated;
4. Overall survival (OS) of enrolled patients was evaluated (5 years);
5. Radiological response of enrolled patients was assessed;
6. The rate of operation delay of enrolled patients was evaluated;

DRUG: Tirelizumab ,+Carboplatin+albumin-bound paclitaxel
Major pathologic response, Pathologic response rate to neoadjuvant treatment in resected tumor and lymph nodes. The rate of major pathologic response, defined as \<10% residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen will be compared to historic data with neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 6 weeks|Adverse events graded by CTCAE v5.0, Percentage of adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment per Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5.0)., 90 days after surgery
Pathologic complete response, The absence(percentage) of invasive/in situ cancer and/or axillary lymph nodes, 6 weeks|Event-free survival (EFS), In cancer, the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient remains free of certain complications or events that the treatment was intended to prevent or delay., 1 years and 5 years|Overall survival（OS）, The time(years) from day 1 of study treatment until death from any cause., 5 years|Operation delay rate, Rate of patients with an Unplanned Delay to Surgery defined as any change to scheduled surgery date considered to be at least possibly related to neoadjuvant treatment., 2months|Radiographic Response, Radiographic response(rate) to treatment as defined by RECIST 1.1., 6 weeks
Exploratory purpose, For inclusion, group treatment was performed according to the guidelines, and stratification factors affecting immunotherapy prognosis and treatment plan were explored according to stratification. The stratification factors taken into consideration are: P16 status, smoking history, TNM stage, tumor reduction (MPR condition), presence of risk factors (according to the guidelines, risk factors are presence of episopercular invasion, positive incisal margin, proximal incisal margin, pT3 or pT4, pN2 or pN3 lymph nodes located in the IV and V regions of the neck, Nerve invasion, vascular invasion, etc.) and postoperative radiotherapy., 5 years
