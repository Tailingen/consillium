Ramanspectroscopy in Barrett's Esophagus
This study is being done to see if a new device, called near-infrared Raman spectroscopy, can provide similar information as that obtained from taking biopsies of the lining of your Barrett's esophagus

In the search for means to enhance the surveillance of BE, optical spectroscopy is emerging as a candidate with high potential. Optical spectroscopic techniques measure specific light-tissue interactions, such as fluorescence, elastic scattering, and Raman (inelastic) scattering, which provide objective and quantitative diagnostic information about the molecular and/or structural status of tissue. Moreover, optical spectroscopy has the capacity to identify tissue pathology in situ in a rapid and non-destructive fashion. Among the optical spectroscopic techniques, near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (NIRS) is particularly promising because of the wealth of molecular-specific information contained in its spectra
