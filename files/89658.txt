Trial of Ibrutinib Combined With Nivolumab or Cetuximab to Treat Recurrent/Metastatic HNSCC
This is an open-label, randomized, phase II trial to test the efficacy of Ibrutinib in combination with either Nivolumab or Cetuximab in the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic head an neck squamous cell carcinoma
Head and Neck Cancer|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Ibrutinib 560mg PO daily (Imbruvica)|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Clinical Efficacy of Combined Therapies using RECIST v1.1, The primary endpoint is the clinical efficacy of each combinatorial treatment regimen as defined by the best overall response rate (proportion of patients with a partial or complete response in tumor burden) using RECIST v1.1, 3 yrs
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the interval from the date of first dose of ibrutinib to disease progression or death from any cause, 3 yrs|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS), defined as the date of first dose of ibrutinib to the date of death from any cause., 3 yrs|Duration of Response, Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response (whichever is recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), 3 yrs|Safety as assessed by the frequency of adverse events per CTCAE v4.0, Overall frequency and severity of adverse events per CTCAE v4.0., 3 yrs
Measurement of Biomarkers, Assessment of biomarkers in response to protocol based therapy, 3 yrs
Open-label, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Enrollment will be stratified by HPV status and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibrutinib + cetuximab or ibrutinib + nivolumab

The study will enroll patients who develop R/M HNSCC have not yet been treated with EGFR inhibitors in the recurrent/metastatic setting. All patients being considered for the study must be â‰¥ 18 years of age and will receive: i) ibrutinib + cetuximab or ii) ibrutinib + nivolumab.

To determine the clinical efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with cetuximab or nivolumab in patients with R/M HNSCC.

Ibrutinib will be supplied by Pharmacyclics as 140 mg hard gelatin capsules for oral (PO) administration.

Cetuximab will be supplied as a clear, colorless liquid formulated for intravenous administration.

Nivolumab will be supplied as a clear, colorless liquid formulated for intravenous administration.
