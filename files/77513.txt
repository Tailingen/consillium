Autophagy Markers in Endometrial Polyps
The aim of this research is to evaluate autophagy markers in patients with endometrial polyps

Endometrial polyp are benign formations that are frequently encountered in gynecology practice and have malignant potential. It may be asymptomatic in the clinic or may present with abnormal uterine bleeding. Although its pathophysiology has not been clearly revealed, there are many studies in the literature about it. However, the autophagy pathway emerges as a subject that has never been evaluated. In this study, the investigators would like to prospectively evaluate Beclin 1, LC3A / B and p62 markers in the autophagy pathway in endometrial polyp tissue samples by immunohistochemistry and reveal their importance.
