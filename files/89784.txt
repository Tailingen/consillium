A Study of PF-07820435 as a Single Agent and in Combination in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study aims to evaluate the safety, and early signals of anti-tumor activity of PF-07820435 when administered alone (Part 1A) or in combination with sasanlimab (Part 1B; Part 2) in patients with selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 will be dose-finding and Part 2 of the study will further evaluate PF-07820435 at the recommended dose for combination expansion in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
