Clinical Study of ALT-P7 to Determine Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics in Breast Cancer Patients
This open-label study assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ALT-P7(HM2-Drug Conjugate) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on previous Trastuzumab-based therapy. Patients received ALT-P7(0.3 mg/kg\~5.4 mg/kg, 7 groups) intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: ALT-P7 (HM2-MMAE)
DLT test, Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD) and the dose level showing Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT), or determination of Recommended Phase II Dose(RP2D) as an alternative to MTD establishment, 21 days after first administration
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Evaluate adverse events by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE v4.03) classification, immune-related adverse events(irAEs), up to 4 weeks|Pharmacokinetics test, analyze metabolism and discover the fate of a ALT-P7 from administration up to completely eliminated from the body (Group 3(1.2 mg/kg) \~ Group 7(5.4 mg/kg)), up to 4 weeks|Immunogenicity test, After administration of the drug for clinical trial, the descriptive statistics of the dose group and the measurement point are calculated, up to 4 weeks|Efficacy test, Provide descriptive statistics for each capacity group(the number of subjects, average, standard deviation, median, minimum value, maximum value), At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
