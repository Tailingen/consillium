Substantially Improving the Cure Rate of High-risk BRCA1-like Breast Cancer
Investigator-initiated, international, multicentre, randomized, open-label, (neo)adjuvant phase III study in target population (stage III, HER2-negative, BRCA1-like breast cancer patients) comparing optimized standard-dose chemotherapy with intensified, alkylating chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.
