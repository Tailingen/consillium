Difference between the two groups from Baseline in Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale at 6 Weeks, Pain intensity was assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS) , which is a 10-cm continuous line to assess the subjective perception of pain in the case, with a score of 0 on the leftmost end of the line indicating "painless" and 10 points indicating The "most severe pain" and the reliability of pain assessment , and all participants received this linear tool measurement, recording a total of five, from enrollment to end of treatment at 6 weeks
Difference between the two groups from Baseline in fatigue on Brief Fatigue Inventory at 6 Weeks, Fatigue is using the friction fatigue inventory (BFI) ; it is a nitrate-item self-reported for measuring fatigue intensity and interference with functionality. Item 1-3 describes the fatigue strength, during The past 24 hour using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (very severely fatigued). Item 4-9 describes interferes with certain functions such as daily activity, including work, walking ability, normal work, Relations with others, and enjoyment in life. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Its average score for each item indicates its severity of fatigue 1-3 points of helpful mild fatigue, 4 -6 is divided into moderate, 7-10 is divided into severe fatigue., from enrollment to end of treatment at 6 weeks|Difference between the two groups from Baseline in Anxiety and depression on Hospital Anxiety and depression scale, The Hospital Anxiety and depression scale (HADS) is composed of two seven-item subscales, one specifically targeting anxiety (HADS-A) and the other focusing on depression (HADS-D). The HADS is a 14-item measure divided into 2 subscales (anxiety and depression), HADS_A and HADS_D are scored separately, the topic arrangement is staggered, and the reverse problem is scored in reverse. The total score is between 0-21 points. Below 8 points means no anxiety and depression; 8 to 10 points may be anxiety and depression. And anxiety and depression of 10 points or more, from enrollment to end of treatment at 6 weeks|Difference between the two groups from Baseline in quality of life European organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire head and neck 35(EORTC QLQ-H & N 35), European organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire head and neck 35(EORTC QLQ-H \& N 35) is a specific questionnaire developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer for head and neck cancer. The module includes 35 questions Assessing symptoms and side effects of treatment, social function and body image/sexuality .This scale includes seven symptoms subscales that measure pain, swallowing, senses problems, speech problems, trouble with social eating, trouble with social Contact, and less sexuality, and also has 11 subscales related with teeth, opening mouth, dry mouth, sticky saliva, coughing, ill feeling, weight loss, weight gain, use of painkillers, nutritional supplements, and feeding tubes.

Data were collected from 92 participants in northern Taiwan medical center Radiation Outpatient.They are randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=46) with Acupoint stimulation and control group(n=46). Outcomes were assessed according to the pain, Brief fatigue inventory, Hospital anxiety and depression scale, quality of life, five repeated measures was conducted.
