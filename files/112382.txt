Evaluation of Cavernous Sinus Invasion by Pituitary Adenoma Using Deep Learning Based Denoising MR
Preoperative evaluation of cavernous sinus invasion by pituitary adenoma is critical for performing safe operation and deciding on surgical extent as well as for treatment success. Because of the small size of the pituitary gland and sellar fossa, determining the exact relationship between the pituitary adenoma and cavernous sinus can be challenging. Performing thin slice thickness MRI may be beneficial but is inevitably associated with increased noise level. By applying deep learning based denoising algorithm, diagnosis of cavernous sinus invasion by pituitary adenoma may be improved.
