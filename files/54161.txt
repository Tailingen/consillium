Bladder Fiducial Markers and Multiparametric-MRI (mp-MRI) to Optimize Bladder Chemo-radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of implanting small 24-K gold fiducial markers around a bladder tumor site, so that a Radiation Oncologist can identify the original tumor location at the time of radiation treatment. Other goals of the study include assessing whether a new MRI imaging technology can help with detection of bladder cancer earlier and more accurately when evidence of bladder cancer is not visible by scope.

PROCEDURE: Fiducial marker placement|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
Bladder volume differential, Change in bladder volumes targeted for high dose radiation (HDR) between the first (Baseline) dose volume histogram (DVH) without the fiducial markers present, compared to the second DVH made after placement of the fiducial markers, Baseline, after marker placement (anticipated to occur between study days 0-1)
Net dose radiation to collateral organs differential, comparison of a DVH (Dose Volume Histogram) made without the fiducial markers present, to the second DVH made with the fiducial markers present. This will be measured by net dose (Gy to area and/or volume) to collateral organs, Baseline, after marker placement (anticipated to occur between study days 0-1)|Positive Predictive Value of Multiparametric-MRI (mp-MRI), percentage of actual positive sites among those predicted positive by mpMRI, at the time of initial TURBT (Day 1), at the initial post-treatment surveillance cystoscopy (3 months post-treatment)|Difference in alignment when markers are incorporated into the planning, Difference in "on-table" patient alignment under the radiotherapy gantry (in millimeters, in X, Y and Z dimensions) when the patient is aligned daily based on conventional methods only (i.e. fiducial markers are not used for alignment), and when the patient is aligned based on the fiducial markers as the reference., Radiotherapy treatment period (Days 14-28)
This study of fiducial markers in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer will enroll patients electing bladder preservation with tri-modal therapy.

24-K gold fiducial markers will be endoscopically implanted around the tumor resection area to mark the location of the tumor site, into the bladder wall submucosa space under direct visualization via a coaxial needle. The markers are visible on all imaging modalities, including all available on-table imaging (e.g., portal and cone-beam CT) used for radiotherapy. Reliable fiducial marker placement within the bladder may have the potential to advance bladder-sparing management of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

This study will examine the effectiveness of bladder-preserving multi-modal treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with and without fiducial marker placement to guide radiotherapy targeting and to minimize collateral radiation. In addition, this study intends to verify the accuracy and report on the sensitivity and specificity of mp-MRI imaging to detect the presence and location of bladder cancer.
