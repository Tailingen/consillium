Vorolanib (X-82) Combined With Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients With Solid Tumors
The investigators hypothesize that vorolanib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab for gastric/gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancers and nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) may improve immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming treatment resistance of checkpoint inhibitors in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.

Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of vorolanib plus pembrolizumab, -The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Dose escalations will proceed for both nivolumab and pembrolizumab until the MTD or highest dose level (level 2), which is defined as RP2D., Completion of enrollment to Dose Escalation cohorts (estimated to be 13 months)|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of vorolanib plus nivolumab, -The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle.
