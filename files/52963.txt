CP-868,596 And CP-868,596 Plus AG-013736 In Combination With Docetaxel In Advanced Solid Tumors
A5301005 is a phase 1 study in patients with solid tumors which is testing the safety and tolerability of adding targeted agents to a standard chemotherapy. CP-868,596 is a platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor (PDGFR) and AG-13736 is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor (VEGFR). This study will test the use of docetaxel (the standard chemotherapy) with either CP-868,596 or the combination of CP-868,596 and AG-13736.
