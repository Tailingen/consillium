Biomarker Study in Tissue Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: cytogenetic analysis|OTHER: HUMARA assay|OTHER: fluorescence activated cell sorting|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Frequency of AML that originate in CD33+ or in which uncontrolled growth is restricted to CD33+ precursors|Extent of clonal hematopoiesis in small numbers of AML cells
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that originates in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is restricted to CD33+ precursors.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved acute myeloid leukemia cell samples are separated from endothelial cell by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for X-chromosome inactivation patterns by cytogenetic/molecular analysis and/or Humara assay.
