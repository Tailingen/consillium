The Impact of Oligo-Fucoidan in Cancer Cachexia and Sarcopenia
Fucoidan also ameliorates tumour and chemotherapy-induced muscle atrophy and -related cachectic symptoms in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the effect of fucoidan in cancer cachexia or sarcopenia in cancer patients.

Cancer cachexia is characterized by anorexia, skeletal muscle atrophy, and systemic inflammation. Fucoidan extracted from brown algae exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. In addition, fucoidan also ameliorates tumour and chemotherapy-induced muscle atrophy and -related cachectic symptoms in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the effect of fucoidan in cancer cachexia or sarcopenia in cancer patients.
