To evaluate the activity of rosiglitazone by comparing changes in PSA doubling time between rosiglitazone-treated and placebo-treated men., 3 years
Evaluate time to PSA progression as a measure of the activity of rosiglitazone., 3 years
* Patients will be randomly assigned to initial treatment with either rosiglitazone or placebo orally twice daily, every day as long as there is no disease progression or serious side effects. Patients will be asked to complete a drug log to keep track of the medication.
