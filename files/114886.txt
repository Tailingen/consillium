A Clinical Efficacy Study Of An Oral Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Of VEGFR-2 Given In Combination With Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether CP-547,632, an oral VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor when given in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) is effective in the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: CP-547,632
Statistical estimates used on the Stage 1 data indicated low likely-hood of a positive outcome if the study continued to Stage 2. This provided the basis for discontinuation of the trial.
Given the outcome of the primary objective, analysis of secondary objectives were not formalized.
