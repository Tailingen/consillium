NAD+ Supplement（NMN）With Radioimmunotherapy in Advanced NSCLC
This is a phase I, single center (West China Hospital, Sichuan University) study aimed at investigating the safety and efficacy of NMN supplements combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for second-line and above treatment of advanced NSCLC.
Solid Tumor|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: NAD supplement|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Immunotherapy
Number of Participants With Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicities of NMN supplements in RT+ICI treatment, Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicity graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, from enrollment through 30 days after last dosing, up to 24 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Investigator assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. Progression free survival is defined as time of enrollment to first evidence of progressive disease.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 24 months after the enrollment|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Investigator assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 including the all tumor, the tumor undergoing RT and the tumor which do not receive radiotherapy.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, up to 24 months after the enrollment|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the difference (in months) between the date of study enrollment to the date death due to any cause, up to 24 months after the enrollment
Exploratory indicators, The investigators will detect changes in CD4+T absolute count, CD8+T absolute count, CD4+/CD8+T cell ratio, CD38 expression, the concentration of NAD+, granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio, PD-L1 expression, immune related cytokine profile expression levels, etc. in blood/tissue samples by Flow cytometry,ELISA or immunofluorescence experiment., up to 24 months after the enrollment
This study is a prospective, phase I, dose exploration (NMN dose escalation) clinical trial of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell carcinoma. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NAD supplementation combined with radiotherapy and immunotherapy (+/- chemotherapy) in 20 patients with advanced non-small cell carcinoma who failed first-line treatment.The patient received PD-1 inhibitor combined with radiation therapy for the primary lesion and/or metastatic site (excluding intracranial lesions), and orally took NAD+supplement NMN. Regular monitoring indicators include ORR and PFS of patients' radiation therapy lesions and other observed lesions, medication safety, biomarkers, and OS.

Tolerance observation will be conducted using a 3+3 NMN dose escalation approach until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in at least 2 out of 3-6 subjects, or tolerance observation of the study treatment will be conducted。 3 cohorts with increasing dose levels:NMN12000 GeneHarbor:150mg,Oral administration, once a day;Second dose group: NMN12000 GeneHarbor:150mg,Oral administration, twice a day;Third dose group: NMN12000 GeneHarbor:150mg,Oral administration,3 times a day.
