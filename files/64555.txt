CKD-702 Plus Irinotecan in Gastric Cancer
CKD-702 is a tetravalent bispecific IgG1 targeting hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The investigators will test a hypothesis that CKD-702 may augment the efficacy of biweekly irinotecan as a 3L or later therapy for gastric cancer overexpressing either MET or EGFR.
