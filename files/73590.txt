A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of Luspatercept for the Treatment of Transfusion-dependent (TD) Anemia Associated With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) & Beta-thalassemia (β-Thal) in India
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of luspatercept in participants who require regular blood cell transfusions due to b-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in India
