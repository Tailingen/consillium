Retrospective Register for Uveal Melanoma
Background: Uveal melanoma (UM) is a common primary ocular malignancy associated with limited overall survival in the advanced stage of the disease. Fundamental breakthrough regarding the management of the disease and the overall-survival have not yet been achieved. Studies with large cohorts are difficult to perform due to limited patient numbers, therefore retrospective analyses are of great potential to gain further knowledge in a disease with high clinical needs.

Aim: The proposed project is a register for patients with UM treated at the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry at the Medical University of Vienna between 01.01.1997 and 31.12.2021.

Patients and Methods: Patients treated for UM at the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry at the Medical University of Vienna between 01.01.1997 and 31.12.2021 will be included in the register. Information on the baseline characteristics, survival times and course of the disease will be gathered via retrospective chart review and saved in a password-secured database.
