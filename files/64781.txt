A Study to Describe Treatment Patterns of Advanced Breast Cancer in Poland in the Real-world Data Setting
The study is descriptive and aims to characterize the treatment patterns of advanced breast cancer in Poland in the real-world data setting. The main goals are to assess the current treatment patterns of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer and their changes in clinical practice and relate them to patients' demographics, disease characteristics, type of other therapies used in patients as well as disease progression and visceral crisis occurrence.
