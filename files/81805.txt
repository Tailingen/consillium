TEMPUS ARIES: A Biobank Registry Platform Study in Oncology
This study is a non-interventional, multicenter, multicohort evaluation of participants with cancer who will undergo longitudinal plasma ctDNA biomarker profiling at specific time points in addition to standard of care therapy.
Cancer
Changes in ctDNA from baseline, on-treatment and post-treatment blood samples., Assess ctDNA kinetics using ctDNA clearance factors such as time to clearance, best overall clearance rate, best confirmed clearance, and time to ctDNA recurrence and correlate with standard of care therapy real-world outcomes such as overall survival, progression-free survival, time to next treatment, and time to treatment discontinuation., 5 years
Generation of DNA, RNA, immune and other multiomic datasets., Use blood and tissue based next generation sequencing to uncover biomarkers that may predict outcomes, identify markers related to disease, identify markers related to mechanism of drug action, and inform future research., 5 years
