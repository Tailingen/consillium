Multi-classifier System for Stratifying Stage III Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma of Receiving Adjuvant Therapy
The goal of this trial is to test whether patients with stage III papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) could benefit from adjuvant therapy or not. The investigators invented a multi-classifier system that was successfully categorise patients with stage III pRCC into high-risk and low-risk groups. Here the investigators randomly assign classifier-defined high risk patients of stage III pRCC into adjuvant pembrolizumab group placebo group. Disease-free survival and overall survival are the end points of observation.
Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-free survival, Disease free survival (DFS) was defined as the time interval (in years) from the date of randomization to the first date of recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy or death., From the date of registration to up to 7 years
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From the date of registration to up to 7 years
kidney cancer represented 4.2% of all new cancer cases, and its incidence has been increasing. Over 90% of kidney cancer cases are renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which includes various subtypes with distinct histologic features, clinical courses, and responses to therapy. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) are the most common histologic subtypes of RCC, accounting for approximately 75% and 20% of all cases, respectively. Adjuvant pembrolizumab showed promising efficacy in ccRCC, however, whether high-risk pRCC patients could benefit from adjuvant pembrolizumab remain unknown.

Participants will be assigned to continue with the study treatment until any of the following occurs: the recurrence of the disease; the emergence of unacceptable adverse events (AEs); the presence of an intercurrent illness that precludes further administration of the treatment; the decision of the Investigator to withdraw the participant; noncompliance with the study treatment or procedural mandates; administrative reasons necessitating the discontinuation of treatment; or the completion of 17 treatment cycles (approximately one year), with each cycle 3 weeks long.
