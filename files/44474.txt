Combination of IV Ascorbic Acid and Adebrelimab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Previous preclinical study has shown that high levels of ascorbic acid (AA) possesses the ability to kill human colorectal cancer cells and high expression of GLUT3 will augment the efficacy of AA. To date, no previous studies have investigated the combination of therapeutic role of AA and PD-L1 antibody in metastatic colorectal cancer with high expression of GLUT3. This protocol is a randomized controlled study of AA infusions combined with Adebrelimab and FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab alone in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with high expression of GLUT3.
