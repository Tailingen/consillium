Predictive Models of Treatment Responses and Survival Outcomes in Patients With Osteosarcoma
The aim of this study was to developed and validated models to predict therapeutic responses and patients' survivals in patients with osteosarcoma and compared these models with currently available models.
Osteosarcoma
OTHER: Prediction model
Treatment response, The primary outcome was the evaluation of treatment response to individualized therapy in patients with osteosarcoma., At least 1-year follow up|Progression-free survival outcomes, The endpoint was defined as the occurrence of progression or recurrence, or the last follow-up. Patients were followed from the day of histological diagnosis until the occurrence of progression or recurrence, or last visit. The outcome was evaluated by an experienced oncologist in each center every 3-6 months. At each visit, a medical history, physical examination, and standard laboratory tests were performed., At least 5-year follow up|Overall survival outcomes, The endpoint was defined as the occurrence of death or the last follow-up. Patients were followed from the day of histological diagnosis until the occurrence of progression or recurrence or last visit. The outcome was evaluated by an experienced oncologist in each center every 3-6 months. At each visit, a medical history, physical examination, and standard laboratory tests were performed., At least 5-year follow up
The investigator performed a retrospective-prospective cohort study with the aim of developing and validating comprehensive models to predict treatment responses and survival outcomes in patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma. Secondly, the investigator aimed to compare the predictive accuracy with currently available noninvasive model.
