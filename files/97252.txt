Study of ONTAKÂ® to Treat Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how effective ONTAK is in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) and determine whether the presence of a type of protein called CD25 on the cancer cells makes a difference in how the body responds to the treatment.

The hypothesis is that there is no difference in response rate for patients whose tumor cells are CD25 positive or negative.
Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous
DRUG: ONTAK (denileukin difitox, DAB389IL-2)
To estimate response rates (CR + CCR + PR) according to CD25 status (CD25 positive and negative) after 4 cycles of ONTAK.
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA)|Time to Event Variables - Time to response, remission, treatment failure|Response based on the CD25 status|Response based on patient demographics: stage of disease, age, sex, performance status, total dose|Number of cycles completed|6. Assess safety and tolerability of ONTAK
