This project is to to explore the safety and efficacy of shr-1210 combined with albumin, paclitaxel and carboplatin in the first-line treatment of extensive small cell lung cancer
Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210
6-month PFS rate, PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment, up to 24 months
