Clinical Trial of SP-2577 (Seclidemstat) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ewing or Ewing-related Sarcomas
Single agent, non-randomized, open label expansion in select sarcoma patients including myxoid liposarcoma and other sarcomas that share similar chromosomal translocations to Ewing sarcoma; AND dose expansion of the combination of seclidemstat with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in patients with Ewing sarcoma

Safety and tolerability of seclidemstat (SP-2577) as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide measured by dose limiting toxicities and adverse events according to CTCAE version 5.0, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of seclidemstat (SP-2577) as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma and select sarcomas. Toxicities will be graded in severity per the guidelines outlined in the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which ≥ 2 patients from a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SP-2577 as determined by dose limiting toxicities measured according to CTCAE version 5.0, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma. Toxicities will be graded in severity per the guidelines outlined in the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which ≥ 2 patients from a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 as measured by peak plasma concentration, To characterize pharmacokinetics of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 as measured by area under the curve, To characterize pharmacokinetics of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 as measured by apparent clearance of seclidemstat, To characterize pharmacokinetics of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 as measured by median half-life, To characterize pharmacokinetics of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Food effects on the pharmacokinetics of SP-2577 as measured in both fasted and fed populations, primarily measured by apparent clearance., To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of seclidemstat. Both fasted and fed PK samples will be taken., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Anti-tumor activity as measured according to RECIST 1.1 criteria based upon radiological assessments., To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of seclidemstat as a single agent and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide. Tumor response will be measured according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Radiological assessments may be centrally collected and subjected to quality checks and review by a central imaging vendor at the discretion of Salarius., From screening through at least 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months
The single agent expansion cohort of select sarcoma patients will enroll myxoid liposarcoma patients and patients with other sarcomas that share similar chromosomal translocations to Ewing sarcoma (FET-family translocations), including but not limited to desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

A safety lead-in dose escalation and dose expansion will be conducted assessing the combination of seclidemstat with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.
