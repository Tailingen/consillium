The NutriNet-Santé Study
The NutriNet-Santé study was set up to investigate nutrition and health relationships. Specifically, it was the first web-based cohort worldwide on such a large scale (n=171 000 as of 2021) focused on the complex link between nutrition and health status. It is characterized by a very detailed assessment of nutritional exposure and dietary behavior.

NutriNet-Santé is a large-scale (n=171,000) web-based cohort coordinated by EREN, launched in France in 2009 to investigate nutrition and health relationships. All required ethics authorisations have been obtained (listed here). NutriNet-Santé participants regularly fill questionnaires through a dedicated and secure website, providing extensive, high-quality nutritional and non-nutritional data, including repeated data on socio-demographics and lifestyle (yearly), anthropometrics (every 6 months), dietary intake (every 6 months), physical activity (IPAQ questionnaire, yearly)5 and health status (every 6 months). NutriNet-Santé is characterised by a very detailed and up-to-date assessment of nutritional exposure and dietary behaviours. Usual dietary intakes are assessed at baseline and every 6 months thereafter through a series of 3 non-consecutive randomly assigned 24h dietary records. Daily energy, alcohol, micro- and macronutrient intakes are calculated using the published NutriNet-Santé food composition database (\>3,500 generic items). All major health events (e.g., cancers, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases) are reported by the participants and validated by an expert committee of physicians based on medical records, and/or retrieved from the French National Health Insurance medico-administrative databases to limit potential reporting bias. In turn, mortality data are obtained from the exhaustive French National Mortality Registry (CépiDC). The number of incident events already registered is as follows: 4,200 cancers and 1,240 deaths. A sub-sample of the cohort (n=20,000) provided blood and urine samples, currently stored at -80°C in EREN's biobank.
