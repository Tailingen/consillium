Clinical Specialty Queue For Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia
The aim of this study is to establish a bidirectional cohort study of GTN specific diseases, including 1020 retrospective cases Queue and 1000 prospective cohorts. Based on the clinical collaboration system for gynecological tumors in multiple tertiary hospitals across the country, establish unified criteria for case inclusion and exclusion, and establish a multi center clinical queue for GTN; Collect baseline information of GTN patients, such as age, reproductive history, environmental and social information, genetic related information, physical examination, physicochemical, imaging, and pathological information; Collect biological specimens such as blood/tissue from patients; Collect information related to the diagnosis, treatment plan, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, and toxic side effects of patients during the diagnosis and treatment period; After the end of treatment, follow-up blood hCG levels, imaging, fertility status, as well as recurrence and metastasis status, are conducted to track prognosis, thus building a clinical diagnosis and treatment information database, forming a standardized follow-up system for GTN, identifying high-risk factors for GTN chemotherapy resistance, constructing a precise evaluation model for GTN resistance, and providing high-level evidence-based medicine for effectively improving the initial treatment efficacy of GTN.
Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia
Collect disease-related clinical and pathological features of the included subjects, Collect baseline information of GTN patients, such as age, reproductive history,environmental and social information, genetic related information, physical examination, physicochemical, imaging, and pathological information; Collect biological specimens such as blood/tissue from patients; Collect information on the diagnosis, treatment plan, levels of human chorionic gonadotropin, and toxic side effects of patients during the diagnosis and treatment period., GTN should be closely followed up after treatment, with monthly follow-up once in the first year and 2-3 days Follow up once every 3 months annually for a total of 5 years.
