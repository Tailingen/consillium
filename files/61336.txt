Safety Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus to Treat Refractory Solid Tumors in Pediatric Patients
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) in pediatric patients with advanced/metastatic, unresectable solid tumors refractory to standard therapy and/or the patient does not tolerate standard therapies. Tumors are likely to include neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Benign tumors are excluded. These tumor types were selected because evidence of biological activity was observed in cancer cells lines and ex vivo infected primary human tissue samples, specifically pediatric cancer types such as sarcomas and neuroblastomas.
