TPF+CCRT vs.CCRT+PF in High Risk Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To see the effect of induction chemotherapy（TPF） followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (PF) in treating patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: TPF+CCRT|DRUG: CCRT+ PF
Progress-free survival(PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site or death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years
Overall survival(OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS), The LRRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Overall response rate, Tumour response was classified according to RECIST, version 1.1, 16 weeks after completion of IMRT|Incidence of acute and late toxicity, Incidence of acute toxicity is calculated for each adverse event respectively and severity is evaluated on basis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria.Late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme., 3 years
Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage AnyTN2-3M0 and plasma EBV DNA≥1500copies/ml are randomly assigned to receive TPF(paclitaxel liposome+cisplatin+5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus PF (cisplatin+5-fluorouracil) adjuvant chemotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy(IMRT), and cisplatin (100mg/m2) every three weeks for three cycles during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive paclitaxel liposome (135mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (25mg/m2 on day 1-3) and 5-fluorouracil (750mg/m2 civ 120h) every three weeks for three cycles before the radiotherapy. Patients in the control arm receive adjuvant cisplatin (80mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000mg/m2 civ 96h) every four weeks for three cycles after the radiotherapy. The primary end point is progress-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points include overall survival(OS),locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), overall response rates after treatments and toxic effects(short-term and long-term). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population.
