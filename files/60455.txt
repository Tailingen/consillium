Ultrasound Guided Rhomboid Intercostal and Subserratus Plane Block in Breast Cancer Surgeries
Postoperative analgesia after breast cancer surgery is a challenge for anesthesiologists due to the complex innervation of the breast. Interfascial plane blocks of the chest are gaining widespread popularity with the introduction of ultrasonography into the regional anesthesia practice. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of Rhomboid intercostal and subserratus plane block (RISS) for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.
Breast Cancer Surgery|Postoperative Analgesia
DRUG: Rhomboid Intercostal and Subserratus Plane Block with local anesthetic
Postoperative opiod consumption, Opioid consumptions for both group will be recorded., The first 24 hours postoperatively
Postoperative pain scores, Postoperative pain will be assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).The NRS will be recorded in postoperative unit and in ward at first hour and at 2th, 6th, 12th and 24 th hour., The first 24 hours postoperatively
This prospective randomized controlled trial will be carried out on female patients who scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Our hypotesis is that this new interfascial plane block technique will able to provide postoperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery.
