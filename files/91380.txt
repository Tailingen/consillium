A Study of Botensilimab in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test if the addition of botensilimab to standard chemotherapy improves the efficacy compared to just chemotherapy alone in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer. One group of participants will only receive chemotherapy while a second group of participants will receive botensilimab and chemotherapy.
Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Botensilimab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival as Assessed by Independent Central Review Committee (IRC), Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression, assessed by IRC per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years
Number Of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, First study dose through up 1 year|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Complete Response, Complete response will be assessed by IRC per RECIST 1.1 criteria and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 down to normal limits (from at least \> 2 x upper limit of normal \[ULN\]). Cancer antigen 125 or carcinoembryonic antigen will be evaluated for non-expressors of carbohydrate antigen 19-9., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival as Assessed by Investigators, Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression, assessed by investigators per RECIST 1.1, or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate will be defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response is complete response or partial response assessed by IRC and investigators per RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years|Duration Of Response, Duration of response will be defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response assessed by IRC and investigators per RECIST v1.1, until the first documentation of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Change From Baseline In Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9, Change in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 will be evaluated until progressive disease, death, date of last tumor assessment, or start of new anti-cancer therapy. Cancer antigen 125 or carcinoembryonic antigen will be evaluated for non-expressors of carbohydrate antigen 19-9., Baseline, 2 years|Rates Of Normalization Of Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9, Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 normalization will be defined as a value of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 down to normal limits (from at least \> 2 x ULN). Cancer antigen 125 or carcinoembryonic antigen will be evaluated for non-expressors of carbohydrate antigen 19-9., Up to 2 years
This will be a prospective, multicenter, clinical trial of botensilimab in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine alone. The trial will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will be a safety lead-in to establish the safety and dose of botensilimab for Part 2. Part 2 will be a randomized, open-label assessment of botensilimab (at the dose level determined in Part 1).
