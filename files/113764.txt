To Compare Safety and the General Imaging Pattern of Cyclotron Produced Technetium vs. Generator Produced Technetium in Patients With Thyroid Cancer
The cyclotron production model of Tc-99m pertechnetate (CPERT) has received significant validation in the independent expert review conducted by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) in the follow up to the Chalk River crisis. The University of Alberta's Edmonton PET Centre and the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre is a cyclotron / radiopharmacy unit, providing a safe, cost effective, unsubsidized, and reliable supply of radiopharmaceuticals to hospitals and clinics in Edmonton and northern Alberta. A Phase I study is proposed to show safety of CPERT as well as comparability with generator-produced Tc-99m pertechnetate (GPERT) in subjects with well differentiated thyroid carcinoma post-thyroidectomy and prior to planned I-131 Iodide treatment.
Thyroid Neoplasms
DRUG: CPERT|DRUG: GPERT
Safety of CPERT, CPERT safety will be assessed by evaluation of vital signs (pre-injection and post-imaging), blood haematology (pre-injection and post-imaging), SMA-12 clinical biochemistry profile (pre-injection and post-imaging) and collection of adverse events., 7 months
Comparison of general biodistribution of CPERT and GPERT., The whole body biodistribution pattern of CPERT will be compared to GPERT using two independent and blinded Nuclear Medicine physicians., 7 months
Patients who have had a thyroidectomy for cancer routinely have a Tc-99m Pertechnetate (GPERT) scan at the Cross Cancer Institute to check for thyroid tissue remnants prior to radioactive iodine therapy. The first 10 subjects will receive a CPERT whole body scan, and and 20 subsequent case-matched controls (2 for each CPERT subject, matched for age and gender) will receive a GPERT whole body scan. CPERT safety will be assessed by pre-injection and post-imaging collection of vital signs and blood samples (haematology and biochemistry). Adverse event collection will be done for both CPERT and GPERT subjects. The whole body biodistribution pattern of CPERT will be qualitatively compared to GPERT by two independent and blinded Nuclear Medicine physicians.
