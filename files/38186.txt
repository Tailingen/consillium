Quality of Life Assessment of Cryotherapy in Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Cancer
Cryoablation combined with chemotherapy on the quality of life of patients with non resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
DEVICE: Administration of questionaires to patients receiving an upper endoscopy with cryotherapy in addition to chemotherapy for esophageal cancer palliation.
Change in baseline quality of life (QOL) assessment using a modified EORTC QLQ-OES18 at 6 months compared to baseline, 6 months
Change in dysphagia score using the 5 point Likert scale at 1 to 2 weeks post-procedure compared to baseline, 1 to 2 weeks|Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 4.03., 30 days|Number of participants requiring alternative treatments for dysphagia palliation such as stenting, photodynamic therapy or brachytherapy and stenting, 1 year|Subjective Global Assessment scale of nutritonal status will be determined at baseline and approximately 3 month intervals., 1 year|Tumor length in centimeters, endoscopist estimated luminal diameter and endoscopist subjective assessment of size as compared to the prior endoscopy will be determined, 1 to 12 weeks|Immunoassays will be obtained before and after treatment, 1 year|local tumor control will be compared to systemic tumor control, 1 year|Survival while on cryotherapy and systemic chemotherapy will be measured., 1 year|Change in baseline quality of life (QOL) assessment using a modified EORTC QLQ-OES18 at 1 to 2 weeks compared to baseline, 1 year
This is a single arm prospective study to determine the effect of cryoablation combined with chemotherapy on the quality of life of patients with non resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal cancer.
