Neurological Effects of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Colon Cancer
RATIONALE: Learning about the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on brain function may help doctors plan cancer treatments.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is looking at the neurological effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients with colon cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Identify the nature and long-term ramifications of CNS injury as a result of cancer treatment in patients with colon cancer.

Secondary

* Analyze differences in cognitive measures and MRI data in these patients.
* Correlate MRI measures with cognitive performance in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo cognitive performance assessment and MRI.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
