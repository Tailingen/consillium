the National Colorectal Cancer Cohort (NCRCC) Study: National Colorectal Cancer Research Consortium
NCRCC study is a national prospective cohort study including colorectal cancer screening population and stage Ⅰ-Ⅳ colorectal cancer patients.
Colorectal Cancer
colorectal cancer incidence, up to 15 years|Disease-free and overall survival, up to 10 years|Recurrence/metastasis, up to 5 years|Adenoma or advanced adenoma incidence, up to 1 year
Prevalence of treatment-related toxicities characterized by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), up to 5 years|Second primary cancer incidence, up to 15 years
NCRCC study is a large-scale multicenter study which includes 16 hospitals and research centers, establishing a national cohort which consists of two subcohorts (CRC Screening Cohort and Colorectal Cancer Patient Cohort).

1. To assess risk factors for colorectal cancer and evaluate risk prediction model of colorectal cancer to identify the high-risk population.
2. To discover, test and validate new biological markers (e.g. genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomics, proteomic and metagenomics biomarkers) for early diagnosis, prediction of clinical outcomes (e.g. therapeutic response, toxicity, surgical complications) and survivorship endpoints (e.g. recurrence, survival, quality of life, second primary cancer).
3. To estimate associations of epidemiological determinants (e.g. medication and supplement use, diet, lifestyle pattern) with clinical outcomes and survivorship endpoints among CRC patients.
