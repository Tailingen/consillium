A Study of HX008 for the Treatment of Patients With Malignant Melanoma
HX008 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 on T cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors. In this study, the efficacy and safety of HX008 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who have failed the standard treatments will be evaluated.
