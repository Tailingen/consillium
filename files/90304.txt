Real-world Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Liposome Irinotecan
This study is a prospective, multicenter, real-world study. There are four cohorts. Cohorts 1-3 include second-line, posterior-line, and neoadjuvant colorectal cancer patients, respectively. Cohort 4 include patients with the exception of those with pancreatic and colorectal cancer. As this study is a real-world investigation, treatment procedures, visit schedules, and examinations will be based on the routine clinical practice of physicians. Through the above cohort, the efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposome are comprehensively observed.
