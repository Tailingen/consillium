Liver Transplantation for Non-Resectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: a Prospective Exploratory Trial (TESLA Trial)
The study will investigate whether liver transplantation provides increased survival, low side effects and good quality of life in patients with bile duct cancer where the tumor cannot be removed by normal surgery. Analyzes of blood and tissue samples from the tumor will be investigated to see if the analyzes can indicate who may have recurrence of the disease after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the effect of chemotherapy on normal liver and tumor tissues in the liver that are removed during transplantation will be investigated..
