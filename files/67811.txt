Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor and PCSK9 Inhibitor for pMMR/MSS Locally Advanced Mid-low Rectal Cancer
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor and PCSK9 inhibitor in the treatment of patients with pMMR/MSS locally advanced middle and low rectal cancer.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Long-course chemoradiation and PD-1 inhibitor, with PCSK9 inhibitor|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Long-course chemoradiation and PD-1 inhibitor, without PCSK9 inhibitor
CR, complete response rate=(number of pathological complete responses + number of clinical complete responses)/total number of patients, pCR :within 10 days after surgery;cCR :12-13 weeks after radiotherapy ends|AE rate, Adverse event rate, during treatment
NAR score, Neoadjuvant rectal（NAR）score：It is based on the scoring criteria of preoperative treatment, within 10 days after surgery|OPR, organ preservation rate, immediately after surgery|ORR, objective response rate, within 10 days after surgery|immune-related adverse event rate, adverse event rate that is deemed to be associated with PD-1 inhibition, up to 30th day after surgery
This study included patients with locally advanced low rectal cancer as research subjects, and evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor (Sintilimab) and PCSK9 inhibitor (Tafolecimab) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with PD -1 (Sintilimab) for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The primary endpoints of the study are clinical complete response (cCR) (including imaging and endoscopic complete response) and pathological complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints are major pathological response rate (MPR), objective response rate (ORR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), organ preservation rate (OPR), and neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score, quality of life score (QoL), safety and tolerability.
