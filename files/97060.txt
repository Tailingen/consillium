Effect of SAR302503 on ECG Activity in Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

- To assess the effect of SAR302503 (500 mg) administered as 14-day repeated doses on the QTcF interval compared to 1-day placebo in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the effect of SAR302503 administered as 14-day repeated doses on heart rate (HR), QT, QTcB, and QTcN, PR and QRS compared to placebo.
* To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of SAR302503
* To document the plasma concentrations of SAR302503 at the time of ECG investigation.
* To explore the Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic relationship between SAR302503 concentration and QTcF
* To explore antitumor activity
