Pilot Study of IFN α2b for Melanoma Patients
The presence of malignant cells in lymph nodes is a critical parameter in the staging of melanoma cancer patients. Assessment of lymph nodes is currently done by histopathology alone. The long-term survival of melanoma cancer patients who have Stage IB disease (no known lymph node involvement with a tumor greater than 2 cm) is lower than patients who are Stage IA (no known lymph node involvement with a tumor less than 2 cm). Likewise, the survival rates of patients who are judged to be Stage II based on histologically positive level-one lymph nodes is often no better than that of higher stage patients who have level-two lymph node involvement. These observations suggest that micrometastases are often present in lymph nodes that are not detectable by histological assessment.

The collection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLN) and non SLN material outlined in this proposal will permit both targeted and exploratory studies, without compromising the patient's diagnosis, on specimens that represent central engines of the immune response and whose function in the context of tumor progression is largely unknown.

With the advent of an array of new methodologies that utilize minimum material for both molecular and cellular assessments, acquiring up to 20% and in general the investigators anticipate the use of 5% on average of SLN and/or non SLN tissue for research purposes, may prove to be critical to understanding the impact of nodal tumor involvement on patient outcome and survival.
