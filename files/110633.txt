Assessment of Supersonic Imagine Aixplorer for the Detection and Localisation of Prostate Cancer Foci
The primary aim of the study is to assess the elasticity (Young's modulus) of cancerous tumor foci, of normal peripheral zone, and of normal transition zone in the prostate. Images obtained with the Supersonic Imagine Aixplorer scanner prior to radical prostatectomy are compared to whole-mount histology.
