S8516-S8736-S9125-S9240 Research Study of Genes in Tissue Samples From Patients With B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at genes in tissue samples from patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Lymphoma
GENETIC: polymorphism analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacogenomic studies
Association of polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes with overall survival and/or progression-free survival, retrospectively|Association of polymorphisms in these genes with rate of grade 4-5 hematologic toxicity, retrospectively
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if toxicity following treatment for lymphoma varies according to genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes (i.e., SOD2, CAT, GPX1, GSTM1, and GSTP1).
* To assess whether these genetic polymorphisms are associated with progression-free survival and/or overall survival in these patients treated for lymphoma.

OUTLINE: Previously collected samples are used for biomarker analysis.
