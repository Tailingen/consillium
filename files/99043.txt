Neuromodulation of Cardiovascular Risks Associated With Cardiotoxic Chemotherapy
This study is to determine if low level vagus nerve stimulation will lead to improvement in heart function, heart rate variation, and in the levels of certain chemical markers of inflammation in study participants' blood.

Effects of low-level tragus stimulation (LLTS) on global longitudinal strain (GLS), An echocardiogram will be performed on patients at baseline and at follow up (14 days after start of intervention). The percentage change of GLS and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be compared at baseline and follow up in patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy., 2 weeks
Effects of LLTS on autonomic tone, Measure change in autonomic tone by 15-minute Heart Rate Variability at baseline and follow up. (2 week) HRV has time and frequency domain numbers that are continuous variables from 0-100 and more., 2 weeks|Effects of LLTS on oxidative stress, Analyze markers of oxidative stress in serum collected from patients at baseline and at follow up. Serum will be analyzed for oxidative stress before and after use of the TENS device. Results are expressed in Units - continuous variable., 2 weeks
Patients will be asked to use a handheld electrical unit (stimulator) at home to deliver vagus nerve stimulation (low level stimulation) to one ear for a period of 1 hour for 14 days.
