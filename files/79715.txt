Multifaceted Comparison of Ultrasound-guided Ablation and Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy for Aldosterone-producing Adenoma
The purpose of this study is to retrospectively and prospectively analyze the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation and laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the treatment of aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). It is planned to retrospectively collect 30 patients with adrenal radiofrequency ablation for APA and 15 patients with age - and sex-matched laparoscopic adrenalectomy for APA in our hospital from January 2020 to June 2024, and continue to follow up for 3 years.

Primary aldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension, and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) is a benign adrenal tumor, accounting for about 35% of primary aldosteronism. According to clinical guidelines, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred treatment for unilateral APA. Recently, radiofrequency ablation, as a new technique, has been applied to the treatment of APA. However, there are few relevant studies, the sample size is generally small, and basically belong to retrospective studies, lacking the comparison of long-term postoperative effects. Our hospital is the first to carry out ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation of APA in Guangdong, China, with satisfactory results. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively and prospectively analyze the efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided radiofrequency elimination and laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the treatment of APA. It is planned to retrospectively collect 30 patients with adrenal radiofrequency ablation for APA and 15 patients with age - and sex-matched laparoscopic adrenalectomy for APA in our hospital from January 2020 to June 2024, and continue to follow up for 3 years.
