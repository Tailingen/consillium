Study of AVE0005 (VEGF Trap) in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Platinum- and Erlotinib- Resistant Non-small-cell-lung Adenocarcinoma
This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of aflibercept in the treatment of participants with advanced chemoresistant non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLA).

Primary objective:

* To determine the overall objective response rate (ORR) of AVE0005 (ziv-aflibercept, aflibercept, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP®) 4.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks in participants with platinum- and erlotinib-resistant, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLA.

Secondary objective:

* To assess duration of response (DR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in this participant population
* To evaluate the safety profile of IV AVE0005 (ziv-aflibercept, aflibercept, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP®).

This study employed an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for radiological tumor assessments. For all tumor assessment-related efficacy variables, two analyses were performed: the primary analysis was based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) reviewed data and the secondary analysis was based on Investigator evaluation.

In addition, both Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) were used to assess tumors. Where as RECIST criteria only consider the longest diameter of the tumors for calculations pertaining to changes in tumor size, mRECIST assessments also account for the differences in the cavities of lesions observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Responses based on RECIST and mRECIST are reported.
Pulmonary Diseases|Neoplasms, Lung
DRUG: Aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP®)
Confirmed Objective Response (OR) Based Upon Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)., OR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST or modified RECIST. CR was the disappearance of all target/nor-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD (According to modified RECIST, to calculate LD for cavitated lesions, the longest cavitation diameters were subtracted from the LD of cavitated target lesions).

Assessments were made by the IRC, and confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks after documentation of the initial response., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment|Confirmed Objective Response Based Upon Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Assessed by the Investigator., OR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST or modified RECIST. CR was the disappearance of all target/nor-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD (According to modified RECIST, to calculate LD for cavitated lesions, the longest cavitation diameters were subtracted from the LD of cavitated target lesions).

Assessments were made by the Investigator, and confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks after documentation of the initial response., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment
Duration of Response (DR), DR was the time interval from the first complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the date of tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. The duration of response was calculated only for those participants who achieved CR or PR., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS time was interval from the date of registration to the date of tumor progression (by RECIST or modified RECIST), or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots.

Progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of tumors, compared to smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new tumors.

If a participant did not progress or die, the date was censored to the date of last valid tumor assessment or the date of data cut-off, whichever was earlier., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Assessed by the Investigator, PFS time was interval from the date of registration to the date of tumor progression (by RECIST or modified RECIST), or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. If a participant did not progress or die, the date was censored to the date of last valid tumor assessment or the date of data cut-off, whichever was earlier. Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots.

Progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of tumors, compared to smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new tumors., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment|Overall Survival (OS), OS was the time interval between registration to the date of death from any cause. The median time for OS was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots.

A participant was to be censored for the OS analysis if the participant was alive by the study cut-off date. The censoring date was either the date that the participant was last known to be alive or the date of study cut-off, whichever came earlier., up to 2.5 years from initial treatment|Heath-related Quality of Life (QOL) Measured Via the Lung Cancer Subscale, HRQL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire, which was completed by the participants on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only (for baseline value), then on Day 14 of each even-numbered cycle to evaluate the participants symptoms.

The questionnaire scored 7 symptoms: shortness of breath, weight loss, clarity in thinking, coughing, appetite, chest tightness, ease of breathing, on a 0-4 scale. The total FACT-LCS score ranged from 0-28 (where 28 was related to the worst outcome). To calculate a change, the baseline score was subtracted from the score obtained after treatment. A negative value implied an improvement in HRQL., Baseline to 2.5 years|Overall Safety - Number of Participants With Adverse Events, All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, spanning from the first administration of study treatment until 60 days after the last administration of study treatment, were recorded, and followed until resolution or stabilization. The number of participants with all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), serious adverse events (SAE), TEAE leading to death, and TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are reported., up to 60+/-5 days after treatment discontinuation, or or until TEAE was resolved or stabilized (Collected till 18 July 2008)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Participants with abnormal laboratory results for
