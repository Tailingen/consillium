Central Obesity and Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Recurrence and metastases after microwave ablation(MWA) of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) are the major factors that influence the survival. Obesity has been reported was significantly correlated with increased risk of developing HCC.

In this study, we will analysis the association of multiple obesity index(waist circumference,waist-hip ratio and body mass index) with the prognosis of HCC treated by MWA.
