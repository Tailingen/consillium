A Trial of MB-6 for Reduction of Neutropenia Induced by Chemotherapy in Patients With Stage III Colorectal Cancer.
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center phaseⅢstudy to evaluate efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus MB-6(320 mg/capsule, 6 capsules tid) in patients with stage 3 colorectal cancer who underwent surgical excision of their primary tumor.

The investigational new drug, MB-6, in the proposed clinical trial is to be used as an adjuvant therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients. All of six extracts have been used in human with a long history, and many literatures reported the medicinal use either individually or as ingredients of formulations. MB-6 may provide its therapeutic benefits via inhibition of tumor induction or enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.
