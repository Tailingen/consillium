The purpose of this study is to evaluate PTK787/ZK 222584, a drug that blocks new blood vessel growth, in the treatment of patients with non-metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of PTK787/ZK 222584, and evaluate serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.

DRUG: PTK787
Time To Progression (TTP) in Weeks, 12 Months
Number of Toxicities in Patients Treated with PTK787, 30 Days After Last Dose|Overall Survival, 12 Months
This is an open-label, phase II trial of PTK787/ZK 222584. Patients will receive 750 mg daily for one week, 1000 mg daily for the second week, and then 1250 mg per day thereafter.
