A Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of SAR245409 Tablets in Patients With Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of SAR245409 tablets once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.
* To evaluate the effect of food on blood levels of SAR245409 after administration of SAR245409 tablets in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.
* To evaluate the effect of SAR245409 on the body after administration of SAR245409 tablets once or twice a day in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.
* To obtain information on how SAR245409 administered once or twice a day to patients with solid tumors or lymphoma affect disease symptoms and study treatment side effects as reported by the patients on a questionnaire.
* To explore the antitumor activity of SAR245409 tablets administered once or twice a day to patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

The total study duration per patient will be 58 to 128 days and will include a screening period (1 to 28 days), a food interaction investigation period (when applicable; 4 to 11 days), two 28-day treatment cycles (56 days), an end-of-treatment visit (within 7 days after the last SAR245409 administration) and a follow-up visit (within 30 Â± 3 days after the last SAR245409 administration).
