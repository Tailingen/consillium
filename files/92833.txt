Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmocodynamics and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of AT-1965 in Patients With Advanced, Refractory or Recurrent Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion Phase 1/2 study to determine the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to characterize DLTs of AT-1965 as well as to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of AT-1965 in patients with advanced, refractory or recurrent solid tumors (nonresectable and/or metastatic) including mTNBC.
