A Study of ASP8273 vs. Erlotinib or Gefitinib in First-line Treatment of Patients With Stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Tumors With EGFR Activating Mutations
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), based on independent radiologic review (IRR), of ASP8273 compared to erlotinib or gefitinib in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable stage IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations.

This study also assessed Overall survival (OS); Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by IRR; PFS as assessed by the investigator; Disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by IRR; Duration of Response (DOR) by IRR; Safety of ASP8273; and Quality of Life (QOL) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) parameters.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: naquotinib mesilate|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Gefitinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Independent Radiologic Review (IRR), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiological disease progression or until death due to any cause, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by IRR. Results are based Kaplan-Meier estimate. If a participant had neither progressed nor died, who received any further anticancer therapy for the disease before radiological progression, the participant was censored at the date of last radiological assessment. If progression or death occurred after missing 2 scheduled radiological assessments, the participant was censored at the date of last radiological assessment or at the date of randomization if no post-baseline radiological assessment was available., From date of randomization up to data cut-off date 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)
Percentage of Deaths, All events of death after the first study drug administration were included., From date of randomization up to data cut-off date 21 Dec 2017 (approximately 22 months)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR was defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) without confirmation based on the RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the blinded IRR. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm from baseline measurement. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of diameters., From date of first dose of study drug up to data cut-off date 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|PFS as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiological disease progression or until death due to any cause, based on RECIST V1.1, as assessed by local investigator. Results are based Kaplan-Meier estimate. If a participant had neither progressed nor died, who received any further anticancer therapy for the disease before radiological progression, the participant was censored at the date of last radiological assessment. If progression or death occurred after missing 2 scheduled radiological assessments, the participant was censored at the date of last radiological assessment or at the date of randomization if no post-baseline radiological assessment was available., From date of randomization up to data cut-off date 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control, Percentage of participants with disease control was defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response was rated as CR, PR or stable disease (SD) among all analyzed participants based on RECIST V1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm from baseline measurement. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study drug., From date of first dose of study drug up to data cut-off date 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first response CR/PR (whichever was first recorded) as assessed by IRR to the date of radiographical progression or date of censoring. If a participant had not progressed, the participant was censored at the date of last radiological assessment or at the date of first CR/PR if no post-baseline radiological assessment was available. Results are based Kaplan-Meier estimate., From date of first response up to data cut-off date 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Safety was assessed by AEs, which included abnormalities identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram, etc.) if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if the AE resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug taken up to data cut-off 09 May 2017|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - EGFR Inhibitors Subscale (FACT-EGFRI-18) Questionnaire, ACT-EGFRI-18 is an 18-item Likert-scaled questionnaire, used to assess the effect of EGFR inhibitors on quality of life (QoL). The questionnaire is arranged in three HRQL dimensions: physical (seven items), social/emotional (six items), and functional well-being (five items). The response scores ranged from 0 to 4, and the response categories include "not at all", "a little bit", "somewhat", "quite a bit", and "very much." Negatively worded items (e.g., "My skin bleeds easily "or "My skin condition affects my mood") are reverse-scored, so that participants who experience a higher impact of symptom burden on HRQL receive a lower score (range 0-72)., Day 1 of each cycle up to data cut off 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC-QLQ-LC13), The EORTC-QLQ-LC13 is a validated module of the EORTC-QLQ-Core 30, which includes module items that evaluate symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, sore mouth or tongue, dysphagia, tingling hands or feet, hair loss and pain. The total score for the questionnaire ranges from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Day 1 of each cycle up to data cut off 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-LC30 is a 30-item cancer-specific questionnaire with multitrait scaling was used to create five functional domain scales: Physical, Role, Emotional, Social and Cognitive; two items evaluate global QoL; in addition, three symptom scales assess Fatigue, Pain and Emesis; and six single items assess other symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with a high score for a functional scale representing a high/healthy level of functioning and a high score for a symptom scale or item representing a high level of symptomatology or problems., Day 1 of each cycle up to data cut off 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)|EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D is a generic preference-based measure that indirectly measures the utility for health that generates an index-based summary score based upon societal preference weights. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 6 items that cover 5 main domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a general visual analog scale (VAS) for health status. Each item has 5 response levels ranging from level 1 (no problem or none) to level 5 (unable to perform activity). The VAS ranges from 0 (worst health status) and 100 (best health status)., Day 1 of each cycle up to data cut off 09 May 2017 (approximately 15 months)
