This observational trial is designed to assess the safety profile and tolerability of bevacizumab when combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Unresectable Malignant Neoplasm

It is an observational study for the safety and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic and recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We try to evaluate the safety of bevacizumab in real life population with lung cancer. For patients with performance status 0-1 platinum based chemotherapy was recommended and acceptable doses of bevacizumab was either 7.5 or 15 mg/kgr. Safety profile was evaluated with Common Toxicity criteria v 3.0. Especially for bevacizumab we evaluate specific situations as thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, hypertension, albuminuria, and gastrointestinal disorders.
