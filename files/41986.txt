Study of Changes of Lymphocyte Subsets in Chemotherapy Course of Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of lymphocyte subsets in chemotherapy course of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
the changes of patients' lymphocyte subsets in chemotherapy courses., up to cycle 4 day 9
