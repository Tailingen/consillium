A Trial of Comparing the Pathology Status of Lymphoseek®-Identified Sentinel Lymph Nodes Relative to the Pathological Pathology Status of Nonsentinel Lymph Nodes in Nodal Staging of Subjects With Known Cancer of the Cervix Who Are Undergoing Lymph Node Dissection
Prospective, open-label, within-patient, multi-center study of Lymphoseek in the detection of lymph nodes in subjects with known cancer of the cervix. All subjects will receive a single dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 2 mCi (74 MBq) Tc 99m.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
DRUG: Tc99m tilmanocept
Per-subject False Negative Rate, Proportion of subjects with pathologically negative Lymphoseek-identified SLNs and at least one pathologically positive non-SLN, 1 day
Per-subject Sensitivity, Proportion of subjects with at least one pathologically positive Lymphoseek-identified SLN that have at least one pathologically positive lymph node, 1 day|Per-subject Negative Predictive Value, Proportion of subjects with pathologically negative Lymphoseek-identified SLN(s) with no pathologically positive lymph nodes, 1 day|Per-subject Accuracy, Proportion of subjects accurately indentified by Lymphoseek, 1 day|Proportion of Lymph Nodes Identified Intraoperatively by a Dye That Are Also Identified by Lymphoseek, 1 day|Number of Lymph Nodes Per-subject Identified by Lymphoseek, 1 day|Number of Lymph Nodes Per-subject Identified by Other Dyes, 1 day|Per-subject Concordance, Subjects whose lymph nodes were determined to be dye positive that were also identified by Lymphoseek, 1 day|Per-subject Reverse Concordance, Number of subjects whose lymph nodes that were identified by Lymphoseek were also all identified by dye, 1 day|Incidence of Adverse Events, 7 days
