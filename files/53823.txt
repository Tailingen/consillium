Quality of Life in Lymphoma Patients One Year Post-chemotherapy
Malignant lymphomas are considered as among the most chemo-sensitive cancers. ML are cured in more than 85% of patient, the majority with complete response. After this active phase of treatment, patients are in "after cancer period". Toulouse University Hospital developed since 2006 the Ambulatory Medical Assistance for After Cancer program on lymphoma patient. Ambulatory Medical Assistance for After Cancer is very efficient for detecting physical and psychological complications which impact quality of life. The investigators identified 22% of lymphoma patients who had a reduced quality of life one year after the end of chemotherapy. The present study aims to investigate the evolution of observed complications and identify cancer care pathway which decrease the quality of life reduction risk in patients one year after lymphoma chemotherapy.
