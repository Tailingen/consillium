A Study of BB-1701 in Previously Treated Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive or HER2-low Unresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of the Dose Optimization (Part 1) of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BB-1701 and to determine the recommended dose (RD) of BB-1701 for Dose Expansion (Part 2). The primary purpose of Dose Expansion (Part 2) is to assess the antitumor activity of BB-1701 at RD in the selected population(s) of breast cancer (BC).
