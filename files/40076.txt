A Study of JS009 Monotherapy and JS009 as a Triple Combination Therapy in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
The study is being conducted to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy JS009 as a monotherapy and JS009 as a Triple Combination Therapy in Combination with Toripalimab and JS006 in Patients with Advanced Malignancies, also to explore the RP2D of JS009.
Primary Condition: Advanced Tumors
DRUG: JS009 as a monotherapy and JS009 as a Triple Combination Therapy in Combination with Toripalimab and JS006
Incidence of DLT, The Incidence of subjects with adverse event meeting the criteria of dose-limiting toxicity（DLT） in 42 days during dose escalation phase, Within the DLT window of the first 2 cycles(42 days) in dose escalation phase|Incidence and severity of AE as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE), Approximately 2 years.|MTD, The highest dose at which no more than 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 and 2 during dose escalation phase., Approximately 2 years.|RP2D, Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for JS009 monotherapy and combination therapy, Approximately 2 years.
Drug concentration in plasma, Drug concentrations including JS009， JS001 and JS006 in individual subjects at different time points after dosing, Approximately 2 years.|Immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and/or neutralizing antibody (Nab), titer of ADA positive samples, Approximately 2 years.|ORR, Overall Response Rate (ORR) was assessed based on RECIST V1.1 criteria, Approximately 2 years.
This is an open-label, Phase I study contains dose escalation phase, dose expansion phase and indication expansion phase.

The dose escalation phase will be following the accelerated titration design and the classic 3+3 design, with a planned enrollment of 13 to 30 patients with advanced tumors.

The dose expansion phase will be used safe and tolerable doses, with a planned enrollment of 9 to 24 patients with advanced tumors.

The indication expansion phase will selecte different primary malignancies for investigation of anti-tumor activity. Each Cohort planned to enrollment 20-50 patients with advanced tumors.
