Clinical Study of Oral IGF-1R Inhibitor in Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
Clinical study of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with advanced refractory solid tumors. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity (ies) of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with advanced refractory solid tumors.
Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
DRUG: PL225B
Maximum tolerated dose, Subjects will receive study drug on a daily basis for twenty-one (21) days according to the dose and schedule specified for a particular cohort of therapy.Toxicity profile of the drug will be assessed during Cycle 1 of subject treatment in each cohort for determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., End of Cycle 1 (i.e. 21 Days)
Number of subject with adverse events, The toxic effects of the drug would be assessed from adverse events, vital signs and by clinically significant changes in the laboratory evaluations., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Pharmacokinetic profile(Cmax,Tmax and AUC), The following PK parameters will be calculated: Cmax (peak plasma concentration), Tmax (time to peak plasma concentration), AUC0-t (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero to time of last quantifiable concentration), AUC0-12, AUC0-inf (area under the plasma concentration curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity), percent AUC extrapolated, kel (elimination rate constant), t1/2 (elimination half-life), CL/F (oral clearance), Vz/F (oral apparent volume of distribution) and Racc (accumulation ratio)., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Activity of PL225B based on selected biomarkers, Plasma samples will be used for analysis of circulating exploratory biomarkers which are likely to change in response to PL225B administration., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Objective response, Evaluation of Response: Clinical responses will be presented patient wise for different dose levels., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)
An open label multicentre Phase 1 study of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with advanced refractory solid tumors. This is a dose-finding trial using the modified Accelerated Titration Design with 3 new subjects per cohort and 100% dose increments in the accelerated phase followed by standard phase with 40% dose increments.Subjects will receive study drug on a daily basis for twenty-one (21) days according to the dose and schedule specified for a particular cohort of therapy. Toxicity profile of the drug will be assessed during Cycle 1 of subject treatment in each cohort for determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) according to the schedule given below.
