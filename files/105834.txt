The Effects of Sex and Age Differences on Gastric Cancer : a Retrospective Study
Gastric cancer (GC) is more prevalent in males than in females. One of these differences could be the effect of sex hormones such as estrogens. However, few reports have been reported regarding sex and age differences of incidence and survival of GC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex and age on the incidence and survival of GC. And we would like to further analyze single GC and synchronous multiple GC, EBV, etc.
