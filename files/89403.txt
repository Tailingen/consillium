First-in-human Interleukin-15-transpresenting Wilms' Tumor Protein 1-targeting Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate a new type of dendritic cell vaccine in patients with refractory or advanced solid tumors of the esophagus, liver, pancreas and ovaries. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* is it feasible to produce and administer these dendritic cell vaccines?
* is treatment with these dendritic cell vaccines safe?

Participants will first need to undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect the cellular starting material for the dendritic cell vaccine production. The treatment consists of 6 vaccines, administered at biweekly intervals. Participants will be followed-up until 90 days after the last vaccine.

Indicators of clinical efficacy: Best Overall Response (BOR), BOR will be determined per patient as the best response designation during IL-15-transpresenting WT1-targeting DC vaccination, according to the latest version of iRECIST. The response categories are: immune complete response (iCR), immune partial response (iPR), immune stable disease (iSD) and confirmed immune progressive disease (iCPD)., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months|Indicators of clinical efficacy: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be determined per patient as the time between the date of the first documented tumor response (iPR or iCR) and the subsequent date of the objectively documented disease progression (i.e. date of immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD)) providing that iCPD is confirmed at the next assessment), or death, whichever occurs first. If iUPD occurs, but is disregarded because of later iSD, iPR or iCR, that iUPD date should not be used as the progression event date. At the time of analysis, patients without a recorded event will be censored at the time of the last objective disease assessment., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months|Indicators of clinical efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients whose confirmed BOR is either iCR or iPR, where the denominator is the total number of patients in the efficacy evaluable population., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months|Indicators of clinical efficacy: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with iCR, iPR or iSD, where the denominator is the total number of patients in the efficacy evaluable population., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months|Indicators of clinical efficacy: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS will be determined per patient as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis/study entry and the first date that progression criteria are met (i.e. date of iUPD, providing that iCPD is confirmed at the next assessment). If iUPD occurs, but is disregarded because of later iSD, iPR or iCR, that iUPD date should not be used as the progression event date. At the time of analysis, patients without a recorded event will be censored at the time of the last objective disease assessment.

If progression is not confirmed and there is no subsequent iSD, iPR or iCR then the iUPD date should still be used in the following scenarios:

* if the patient stops study treatment because he/she was not considered to be clinically stable or no further response assessments are done (patient refusal or protocol non-compliance or patient death),
* the next disease assessments are all iUPD and iCPD never occurs., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months. PFS may be updated after study completion.|Indicators of clinical efficacy: Overall Survival (OS), OS will be determined per patient as the time (in months) between diagnosis/study entry and death due to any cause. At the time of analysis, patients without a recorded event will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive., over the entire study duration (i.e. from inclusion (baseline) to end of follow-up, which lasts until 90 days after the last DC vaccine), on average 7 months.

The investigational medicinal product concerns dendritic cells that were engineered to target the tumor antigen Wilms' Tumor-1 (WT1) and in addition transpresent the cytokine IL15 on their cell surface. By inclusion of the IL15-transpresentation mechanism, the intention is to render the dendritic cell more immunogenic (i.e. they have a higher capacity to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack WT1-expressing cancer cells).
