TTS Esophageal HILZO Stent: A Safety and Feasibility Study
A multicenter non-randomized prospective clinical study assessing the safety and feasibility of the esophageal through-the-scope HILZO Covered self-expandable metal stent placement for palliation of malignant dysphagia
Esophagus Cancer
DEVICE: HILZO esophageal stent
Incidence of treatment associated adverse events during follow-up (safety), Short term (within 7 days after treatment) and long term (after 7 days) major complications and minor complications. Major complications are defined as life threatening and severe complications such as perforation, haemorrhage, fistula formation and severe pain. Minor complications are defined as non-life threatening or moderately severe pain and gastroesophageal reflux., 1 year|Through-the-scope stent placement (feasibility): (1) ease of deployment at intended esophageal location, Technical success is defined as ease of through-the-scope deployment and placement of the stent at the required esophageal location., 1 day|Through-the-scope stent placement (feasibility): incidence of device related adverse device events at moment of stent placement, Device related adverse events are defined as all adverse events that take place during the through-the-scope stent placement. The incidence of the device related adverse events will be recorded., 1 day
Dysphagia, measured with the Ogilvie Dysphagia score (functional outcome), Ogilvie dysphagia score measured at: baseline, 2 weeks and every 4 weeks until death/stent removal, or until a maximum of 6 months follow-up., 6 months|Retrosternal pain related to esophageal stent, measured with the Visual Analog Scale (functional outcome), Retrosternal pain related to esophageal stent, measured with the Visual Analog Scale. Measurements will take place at 2 weeks and every 4 weeks until death/stent removal, or until a maximum of 6 months follow-up, 6 months
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of placement of the esophageal HILZO Covered stent with the TTS method in patients with non-operable malignant obstruction of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction, extrinsic malignant compression, or recurrent malignant dysphagia after esophagectomy.

Other (secondary) objects are to assess the effect of the stent on the presence of hyperplastic reaction after implantation, the functional complications and survival.
