Dose Escalation Study of UCART19 in Adult Patients With Relapsed / Refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
The study is in two parts: a dose escalation then a safety dose expansion. The purpose of the dose escalation part is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of UCART19 (dose-escalation part) given as a single infusion in patients with relapsed / refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended dose and the lymphodepletion regimen. The purpose of the safety dose expansion is to assess the safety and tolerability of the RD for UCART19.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: UCART19
Dose escalation part: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occurence. Dose expansion part: AE throughout the study., Dose Escalation: Up to day 28 post first UCART19 infusion. Dose Expansion: From inclusion to Month 12
Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From inclusion to Month 12|Objective Remission Rate, Proportion of patients in whom a response among molecular complete remission (mCR), morphologic complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), At Day 28, Day 84, Month 4, Month 6, Month 9 and Month12|Duration of remission, From the time that response criteria are first met until the date of progression or death (whatever the reason of death), whichever occurs first, assessed up to Month 12|Time to remission, From the date of UCART19 administration until the date that response criteria are met, assessed up to Month 12|Progression Free Survival (PFS), From the date of UCART19 administration until the date of progression or the date of death (whatever the reason of death), whichever occur first, assessed up to Month 12|Overall Survival (OS), From the date of UCART19 administration to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to Month 12
