Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions \>=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Baseline up to approximately 10 months

The AESIs were graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 criteria. The grading is as follows: Grade 1=Mild AE, Grade 2=Moderate AE, Grade 3=Severe AE, Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE., Baseline up to approximately 2.5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to iRECIST, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions â‰¥4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Modified RECIST v1.1 (iRECIST)., Baseline up to approximately 2.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) According to iRECIST, Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants who have a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD), as determined by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1.1 (iRECIST)., Baseline up to 2 years and approximately 5 months|Duration of Objective Response (DOR) According to iRECIST, Duration of objective response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause whichever occurs first, as determined by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1.1 (iRECIST)., Baseline up to approximately 2.5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to iRECIST, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1.1 (iRECIST)., Baseline up to approximately 2.5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months According to iRECIST, Progression-free survival (PFS) rate is defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first at 12 months, as determined by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1.1 (iRECIST)., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Time to Deterioation (TTD) Using EORTC, Time to deterioration (TTD) using European Organization for Research and treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ C30) and its Lung Cancer Module (QLQ LC13) is defined as the time from baseline to the first time the patient's score shows a \>=10 points increase above baseline in any of the following EORTC-transformed symptom subscale scores (whichever occurs first): cough, dyspnoea (single item), dyspnoea (multi-item subscale), chest pain, or arm/shoulder pain, whichever occurred first. Scores ranged from 0-10. A higher score represented more severe symptoms., Baselsine up to approximately 1 year|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Health Status, The 30-item EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 is composed by five multi-item function scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), six single-item symptom scales (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties), and a two-item global quality of life scale. All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for the functional and general health areas represent better functional status and quality of life. Higher scores for the symptom scales represent more symptoms or problems (poor quality of life). A participant was classified as improved if a decrement of 10 points or worse was observed in the change from baseline scores. A participant was classified as worsened if a 10-point or greater increase was observed in the change from baseline scores., Baseline up to approximately 1 year|Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Related Symptoms, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a specific module for lung cancer. It consists of 13 items covering lung cancer symptoms (dyspnoea, coughing, hemoptysis, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder and pain in other parts) and the side effects of chemo- and radiotherapy (alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia), which are divided into 10 fields, all are symptom types. All EORTC symptom scores are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A participant was classified as improved if a decrement of 10 points or worse was observed in the change from baseline scores. A participant was classified as worsened if a 10-point or greater increase was observed in the change from baseline scores., Baseline up to approximately 1 year
