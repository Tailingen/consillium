ABSOLUTELY: A Temporary Uterine Blood Supply Occlusion for Laparoscopic Myomectomy in Patients With UTErine LeiomYoma
A phase 3 multicenter unblinded randomized controlled trial comparing the temporary uterine blood supply occlusion with conventional approach during laparoscopic myomectomy in patients with uterine leiomyoma.

Primary endpoints

â€¢ Assess the volume of blood loss

Secondary endpoints

* Compare the rates of intra- and postoperative complications, the necessity of blood transfusion, length of surgery, length of hospital and ICU stay, and leiomyoma symptoms relief
* Determine the procedure impact on fertility by evaluating the level of anti-mullerian hormone, pregnancy rates, pregnancy complications, and the way of delivery

Patients who meet study inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: 1) laparoscopic myomectomy preceded by temporary uterine blood supply occlusion or 2) laparoscopic myomectomy with a conventional approach.

Sixty patients will undergo laparoscopic myomectomy preceded by temporary uterine blood supply occlusion performed by gynecologists at Mother and Child Clinic Saint-Petersburg and other institutions participating in the study. Sixty patients will undergo conventional laparoscopic myomectomy performed by gynecologists at Mother and Child Clinic Saint-Petersburg and other institutions participating in the study.

Patients eligible for inclusion, after signing an informed voluntary consent to participate in the study, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment groups using stratification by age, size, and leiomyoma nodes location.
