Chest Imaging, Breath, and Biomarkers in a Screening Trial
The investigators would like to see if lung cancer screening with chest x-rays,computer aided detection (CAD)and a lose dose CT scan can detect lung cancer in early stages when it is more responsive to treatment. The investigators would also like to see if early detection will reduce the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung cancer compared to no screening in former and current smokers with or without a family history of lung cancer who are 40-75 years old.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: chest x-ray with or without CAD, lose dose CT scan
The sensitivities of chest x-ray with CAD and chest CT, The false positive rates of chest x-ray with CAD and chest CT will be compared. The analysis will be based on the study subjects from this prospective study who test positive with chest x-ray and/or CT and who are determined not to have lung cancer during the follow-up period., One year after scan

The fight against lung cancer is waged on three major fronts: prevention, detection and treatment. Our goal is to determine if chest x-rays,computer aided detection (CAD)and a CT scan can detect disease earlier when treatment is more effective. If we improve the detection of disease, we will see if screening reduces the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung cancer relative to no screening in people at high risk to develop lung cancer.
