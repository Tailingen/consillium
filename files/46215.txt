Efficacy Evaluation of Dotarem®-Enhanced MRI Compared to Gadovist®/Gadavist®-Enhanced MRI in the Diagnosis of Brain Tumors
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Dotarem®-enhanced MRI as compared to Gadovist®/ Gadavist®-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of brain tumors in terms of overall lesion visualization and characterization (off-site assessment).

270 patients will be randomized between 2 arms defining the sequence of administration of the contrast agents at the dose of 0.1mmol/kg, with a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 14 days in between.

Each patient will, therefore, receive two MRI during his/her participation in the study.

The two arms consist in :

* Dotarem® in the first MRI, then Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the second MRI.
* Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the first MRI, then Dotarem® in the second MRI.

Contrast-enhanced MRIs will be performed on 1.5 or 3 Tesla systems.

MRI examinations will be evaluated centrally by blinded independent readers for the main evaluation criterion.
Primary Brain Tumor
DRUG: Dotarem®|DRUG: Gadovist®/Gadavist®
Percentage of Patients With Overall Lesion Visualization and Characterization Scored as Good or Excellent, Overall lesion visualization and characterization, based on assessment of the primary or largest lesion if there is more than one lesion present, was assessed by 3 independent off-site readers on a 4-point scale:

0. Poor: does not allow adequate visualization and characterization of the lesion; 1. Fair: allows partial visualization and characterization of the lesion ; 2. Good: allows adequate visualization and characterization of the lesion; 3. Excellent: allows excellent visualization and characterization of the lesion., Up to 15 days after randomization
