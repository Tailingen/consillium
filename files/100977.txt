Sequence 1 was a retrospective study, which collected pathological tissue samples (continuous cut white slices, 10 slices per case, 2 of which were HE stained slices) and clinical data (including clinical diagnostic information, laboratory examination results, imaging findings, and prognosis information) from 100 patients with pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis was performed on the samples. Sequence 2 was a non-intervention prospective study, which would collect pathological tissue samples (continuous cut white slices, 10 slices per case, 2 of which were hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) stained slices) , blood (4ml ) and urine (5mL) samples from 100 subjects with pancreatic cancer before medication. The pathological samples and clinical information of the subjects were collected for proteomic analysis. Sequence 3 was a non-intervention study, which would collect blood (4ml ) and urine (5mL) samples from 20 healthy subjects (as control samples for proteomic analysis)
