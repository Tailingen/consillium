Phase II Study of Asciminib for Second-line Treatment of Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open label, phase 2 study investigating asciminib in patients previously treated with one line of TKI therapy.
Malignant Solid Tumors
DRUG: Asciminib
Major molecular response (MMR) rate by 12 months, MMR rate at 12 months with the 95% confidence interval will also be estimated., at 12 months of therapy
Primary Objectives:

1. To determine the rate of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To estimate the proportion of patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR) and molecular response 4 and MR4.5 (MR4.5) by 3, 6, 12 (except for MMR as primary endpoint), 18 and 24 months.
2. To estimate the time to CCyR, MMR, MR4.0 and MR4.5.
3. To determine the safety and tolerability profile of asciminib in the second line setting.
4. To determine the event-free survival (EFS), survival free from transformation to accelerated and blast phase (TFS), and overall survival (OS).
5. To evaluate the rate of adverse events (AEs)

Exploratory Objectives:

1. To describe patient reported outcomes using the MDASI-CML instrument
2. To evaluate development of resistance mutations and their impact on outcomes
