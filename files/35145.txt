Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Amid Abnormal Lipid Metabolism
This research project investigates the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and colorectal cancer (CRC). We are building a comprehensive database of CRC patients, incorporating clinical data, body composition measurements, imaging findings, and biomarkers related to lipid metabolism and inflammation. Our goal is to identify how these factors contribute to CRC development, progression, and perioperative outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to develop a digital, personalized "three-tier prevention" strategy encompassing early risk prediction, targeted interventions, and comprehensive rehabilitation for improved CRC patient care.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies worldwide, accounting for approximately 8% of all cancer cases \[1\]. Numerous epidemiological studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for CRC \[2\]. Abnormal fat distribution and lipid metabolism dysregulation contribute to a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state and increased oxidative stress, potentially triggering mutations, carcinogenesis, and tumor cell proliferation \[3\]. Research suggests that adipose tissue and its associated inflammatory factors may play a key role in the obesity-cancer link.

Regarding fat distribution, visceral adipose tissue exhibits higher metabolic activity compared to subcutaneous fat \[4\]. Excess visceral fat promotes insulin resistance and inflammatory pathways \[5\], potentially increasing CRC risk. Abnormal visceral fat distribution is also associated with postoperative complications, survival time, and the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in CRC patients \[6\]. Furthermore, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), potentially representing a specific type or hepatic manifestation of abnormal fat distribution, is considered a risk factor for CRC.

Our research group previously conducted a retrospective study involving 93 patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery (including CRC). We found that, compared to the group without perioperative weight loss, patients experiencing perioperative weight loss exhibited decreased serum albumin, elevated blood glucose, and elevated serum cholesterol. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that serum cholesterol was a risk factor for perioperative weight loss, showing a positive correlation.

Currently, we are conducting a small-scale study specifically focusing on CRC patients. By collecting perioperative data, including body composition, fat distribution, BMI, abdominal CT scans, inflammatory markers, and obesity-related indices, we aim to elucidate the roles of lipid metabolism, fat distribution, and related inflammatory factors in the development and progression of CRC, as well as their impact on perioperative adverse clinical outcomes. We have obtained promising preliminary results, establishing a foundation for digitizing our overall research findings.

This project aims to establish a research system correlating lipid metabolism, inflammation, and CRC. A CRC patient lipid metabolism database will serve as a platform to expand our previous study's sample size. By integrating and analyzing data from this platform, we will develop a digital, visualized "three-tier prevention" network for CRC, integrating a "digital vaccine" (predictive screening model), "digital drug" (intervention model targeting associated pathogenic mechanisms), and "digital rehabilitation" (preventive system combining early warning and treatment).
