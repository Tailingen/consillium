Phase I Clinical Study of BL-M07D1 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Digestive Tract Tumors and Other Solid Tumors
Evaluation of BL-M07D1 for injection in Phase I clinical study of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic Characteristics, and initial efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic digestive tract tumors and other solid tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Digestive Tract Tumors|Other Solid Tumors
DRUG: BL-M07D1
Phase Ia: Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT), The incidence and severity of adverse events (TEAE) during treatment were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v5.0)., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase Ia: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), In the dose increment stage, the highest dose whose estimated DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate but does not exceed the upper bound of the equivalent interval of DLT rate is selected as MTD., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: Recommended Dose for Phase II Clinical Studies (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of BL-M07D1., Up to 21 days after the first dose
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-B07D1 . The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M07D1 ., Up to approximately 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|AUC0-t, AUC0-t is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration., Up to 21 days after the first dose|CL(Clearance), To study the serum clearance rate of BL-M07D1 per unit time., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Ctrough, Ctough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of BL-M07D1 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency and titer of anti-BL-M07D1 antibody (ADA) will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib:Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of BL-B07D1 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Overall Survival(OS), The time between the start of study medication and death., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ia: To observe the safety and tolerability of BL-M07D1 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic digestive tract tumors and other solid tumors, determine the MTD and DLT of BL-M07D1, and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of BL-M07D1. Phase Ib: To further observe the safety and tolerability of BL-M07D1 at the Phase Ia recommended dose and determine RP2D. To evaluate the initial efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of BL-M07D1.
