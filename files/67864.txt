A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pemigatinib Versus Chemotherapy in Unresectable or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy in first-line treatment of participants with unresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 rearrangement.
