Regorafenib Treatment Patterns and Survival Outcomes in Advanced Colorectal Cancer: A Real-world Study
This is a multi-center, retrospective, real-world study. The purpose of this study is to observe the effectiveness and safety of regorafenib in Chinese advanced colorectal cancer patients.

The main observational goals include overall survival(OS), 6 month OS rate, 1 year OS rate, and treatment time failure (TTF), other study goals include objective response rate( ORR)、Disease control rate（DCR）and adverse event(AE) of regorafenib.
