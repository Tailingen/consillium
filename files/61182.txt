Study of Copanlisib in Hepatic or Renal Impairment
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of copanlisib in subjects with impaired hepatic or renal function in comparison to healthy subjects
Hepatic Insufficiency, Renal Insufficiency
DRUG: Copanlisib (ALIQOPA, BAY80-6946)
Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Copanlisib in Plasma., Cmax refers to the highest measured drug concentration which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., before copanlisib administration as well as 10 min and 1 h (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion|Area Under the Concentration vs. Time Curve From Zero to Infinity (AUC) of Copanlisib in Plasma., AUC refers to area under the concentration vs time curve from 0 to infinity which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., before copanlisib administration as well as 10 min and 1 h (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Copanlisib in Plasma Over the Time Interval From 0 to 168 h., AUC(0-168) refers to AUC from time 0 to 168 hr which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., before copanlisib administration as well as 10 min and 1 h (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion
Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Metabolite M-1., The morpholinone derivative M-1 is a minor copanlisib metabolite in plasma. The PK of metabolite M-1 is routinely analyzed in addition to the PK of the parent compound, although M-1 is not considered to be a major metabolite. Cmax refers to the highest measured drug concentration which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., before copanlisib administration as well as 10 min and 1 h (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Metabolite M-1 in Plasma Over the Time Interval From 0 to 168 h., The morpholinone derivative M-1 is a minor copanlisib metabolite in plasma. The PK of metabolite M-1 is routinely analyzed in addition to the PK of the parent compound, although M-1 is not considered to be a major metabolite. AUC from time 0 to 168h which is obtained by collecting a series of blood samples and measuring the concentrations of drug in each sample., before copanlisib administration as well as 10 min and 1 h (end of infusion), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion|Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse events are considered to be treatment-emergent if they have started or worsened after first application of study medication up to 30 days after end of treatment with study medication., Up to 30 days after end of treatment with study drug|Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in Different Severity., Adverse events are considered to be treatment-emergent if they have started or worsened after first application of study medication up to 30 days after end of treatment with study medication., Up to 30 days after end of treatment with study drug
