Phase 1/2a Study of Belantamab Mafodotin in Relapsed or Refractory AL Amyloidosis
The goal of this study is to test the safety of drug, Belantamab Mafodotin, and see what effects (good and bad) it has on people who take it and amyloidosis, and to determine the most effective dose of the drug.

The study will have 2 phases (parts). The first phase of the study will test different doses of Belantamab Mafodotin. The second phase will test Belantamab Mafodotin at the dose level found to be safe and effective in phase 1

Progressive disease is defined using this criteria., From time of documented evidence of PR or better until PD or death due to PD in participants with confirmed PR or better, assessed up to 2 years after the last dose|Time to Response (TTR) (Phase 2), Time to Response (TTR), defined as the time between the start of therapy and the first documented evidence of response (PR or better) among participants who achieve confirmed PR or better., From time of start of therapy to the first documented evidence of response (PR or better), assessed up to 2 years after the last dose|Time to Best Response (TTBR) (Phase 2), Time to Best Response (TTBR), defined as the time between the earliest date of achieving best response among participants with a confirmed PR or better., From time of earliest date of best response with confirmed PR or better, assessed up to 2 years after the last dose|Time to Progression (TTP) (Phase 2), Time to Progression (TTP), defined as the time from the start of therapy until the earliest date of documented hematological progression, or death due to hematologic progression, where hematologic progression is defined as one of the following: From complete hematological response (CHR), abnormal free light chain ratio (light chain ratio must double) or from CHR/VGPR/PR, 50% increase in serum M-protein to \>0.5 g/dL or 50% increase in urine M-protein to \>200 mg/day (a visible peak must be present) ; Involved Free light chain (iFLC) increase of 50% to \>100 mg/L, From time of start of therapy to the earliest date of documented hematological progression or death due to hematological progression, up to 2 years after the last dose|Duration of Cardiac Response (DocR) (Phase 2), Duration of Cardiac Response (DocR), defined as the time from first documented evidence of a 30% reduction, or better, in plasma NT-proBNP until cardiac progression as defined as a \> 30% \& \> 300 ng/L increase in plasma NT-proBNP; Or, \> 75% increase in high-sensitivity (hs) cardiac troponin-T (cTnT)., From time of first documented evidence of a 30% reduction, or better, in plasma NT-proBNP until cardiac progression, up to 2 years after the last dose|Time to Cardiac Response (TTcR) (Phase 2), Time to Cardiac Response (TTcR), defined as the time between the date of starting treatment and the first documented evidence of plasma NT-proBNP cardiac response., From date of starting treatment and the first documented evidence of plasma NT-proBNP cardiac response, up to 2 years after the last dose|Time to Cardiac Progression (TTcP) (Phase 2), Time to Cardiac Progression (TTcP), defined as the time from the date of starting treatment until the earliest date of documented cardiac disease progression as defined above, or death due to progressive cardiac disease., From date of starting treatment until the earliest date of documented cardiac disease progression or death due to progressive cardiac disease, up to 2 years after the last dose
Amyloid light chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis, ALA) is a rare plasma cell dyscrasia with an incidence ranging from 9.7-14.0 cases per million person-years. 75% of patients have cardiac involvement at diagnosis as evaluated by plasma cardiac biomarkers. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality is cardiac dysfunction.

Belantamab mafodotin has not been evaluated previously in patients with AL amyloidosis. Although Belantamab mafodotin has previously been or is currently being evaluated in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), these MM studies do not enroll participants with clinically significant cardiac dysfunction.

ALA represents a new patient population and therapeutic indication where patients invariably will have clinically significant cardiac, renal or other organ dysfunction at study enrollment. Therefore, the Phase I/IIa RRAL study will be comprised of two parts:

Part 1 - Dose Exploration (Escalation) this will be conducted to identify and select an appropriate dose of Belantamab mafodotin in regard to safety, as well as a preliminary evaluation of hematological and organ response. Part 1 will enroll a minimum of 3 to maximum of 18 patients, per dose cohort, and will be guided using the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design.

Part 2 - Dose Cohort Expansion this will be an expansion cohort to further define the depth and durability of both hematological and organ response in 19 additional patients for a total of up to 37 patients.
