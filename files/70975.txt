Study to Assess the Long-term Safety of Lenvatinib Monotherapy, a Lenvatinib Combination Regimen, or a Comparator Treatment Arm to Cancer Participants in Eisai Sponsored Lenvatinib Trials
This study will be conducted to assess the long-term safety of study drug(s) in participants who are enrolled in Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib studies.

Number of Participants With Any Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), A treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event (AE) that emerged during the treatment in the current roll-over study, having been absent prior to the time the participant signed the current roll-over study informed consent form (ICF), or re-emerged during treatment in the current roll-over study after having been present but resolved before signing the ICF or worsened in severity during treatment in the current roll-over study relative to the pre-ICF state, when the AE was continuous. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; life threatening condition; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically important due to other reasons than the mentioned criteria., Up to 58.8 months in current study|Number of Participants With Any Non-Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerged during the treatment in the current roll-over study, having been absent prior to the time the participant signed the current roll-over study in ICF, or re-emerged during treatment in the current roll-over study after having been present but resolved before signing the ICF or worsened in severity during treatment in the current roll-over study relative to the pre-ICF state, when the AE was continuous. A non-serious TEAE was any AE that was not considered a serious adverse event., Up to 58.8 months in current study|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related TEAEs, A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerged during the treatment in the current roll-over study, having been absent prior to the time the participant signed the current roll-over study ICF, or re-emerged during treatment in the current roll-over study after having been present but resolved before signing the ICF or worsened in severity during treatment in the current roll-over study relative to the pre-ICF state, when the AE was continuous. Related TEAE was defined as AE with causal relationship between the study drug and the TEAE., Up to 58.8 months in current study|Number of Participants With Any TEAE, A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerged during the treatment in the current roll-over study, having been absent prior to the time the participant signed the current roll-over study ICF, or re-emerged during treatment in the current roll-over study after having been present but resolved before signing the ICF or worsened in severity during treatment in the current roll-over study relative to the pre-ICF state, when the AE was continuous., Up to 58.8 months in current study
This is an open-label extension study to roll-over eligible participants from Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib studies. The participants may roll-over no sooner than the primary completion dates in their parent study or after all study data for the primary outcome measure have been collected for the parent study. The parent study is defined as the Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib clinical study in which the participant was receiving lenvatinib either as monotherapy or as combination therapy or was receiving any other comparator therapy. The participant can be enrolled in the current study for the purpose of long-term safety data collection if all the selection criteria for the current study are met. The intention is that the participant will not be without study drug during the transition from the parent study to the rollover study.
