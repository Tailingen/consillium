Targeted Therapy Selection Based on Tumor Tissue Kinase Activity Profiles for Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies, an Exploratory Study
The purpose of this study is to select targeted treatment based on ex vivo kinase activity inhibition profiles to targeted agents of tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for whom no standard treatment is available.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Inoperable|Metastasis
DRUG: desatinib or sunitinib or erlotinib or everolimus or lapatinib or sorafenib
The clinical benefit rate (CBR) of this therapy selection approach., The clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined by the number of patients demonstrating either a complete or partial response or stable disease after 12 weeks of treatment., 12 weeks
Specific signalling proteins that are important for tumor growth can be targeted by agents. These are called targeted agents or targeted treatment. Thus far, it is unclear which patients will respond to these targeted agents. It is assumed that responses to these agents depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities in tumor tissues. The investigators propose that kinase activity profiling may be a potential clinical diagnostic tool to predict tumor response to targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

The investigators will determine ex vivo kinase activity inhibition profiles of tumor tissue to different targeted agents. Tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for whom no standard treatment is available will be used.

Patients will be treated with the selected targeted agent and the clinical benefit will be determined.
