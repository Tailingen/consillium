Feasibility of Endoscopic Thyroidectomy for Thyroid Carcinoma
Endoscopic thyroidectomy has been used to treat thyroid diseases in China. However, whether this technique is rational to treat thyroid carcinoma is still in controversy. The diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma is predominantly made according to intra-operative frozen section pathological examination in China. In this research, the investigators want to compare clinical index (blood loss, operation duration, number of lymph nodes dissected, complication rates, etc) between patients underwent endoscopic thyroidectomy ( total thyroidectomy) and those underwent conversion to open procedure. The investigators want to evaluate the technical feasibility of endoscopic thyroidectomy for treating thyroid carcinoma.
Thyroid Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: thyroidectomy
to evaluate the completeness of thyroid resection and clearance of lymph nodes in the central compartment, and to observe the complications such as RLN palsy and hypocalcemia, 1 year after operation
intra-operative diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma is usually considered the indication of conversion to open surgery. with accumulation of experience of endoscopic thyroidectomy, the investigators want to evaluate the technical feasibility, completeness and safety of endoscopic thyroidectomy.
