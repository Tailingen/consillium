PSMA-PET Guided Radiotherapy
PSMA PET/CT has demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting metastases than current imaging standard of care (CT and bone scan). \[18F\]DCFPyL is a promising high-sensitivity second generation PSMA-targeted urea-based PET probe. The hypothesis is that definitive radiotherapy (RT) informed by PSMA-PET findings will lead to improved cancer control outcomes compared to RT guided by conventional staging only. This study utilizes cmRCT design in companion to PERA (Partnership initiative for the Evaluation of technological innovation in Radiotherapy).
