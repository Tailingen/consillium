Comparing Chidamide+Sintilimab+Bev With Standard Second-line FOLFIRI+Bev in Advanced MSS/pMMR mCRC
This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter phase â…¢ study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of chidamide + sintilimab + bevacizumab versus standard second-line FOLFIRI + bevacizumab therapy in subjects with advanced microsatellite stable colorectal cancer who have failed first-line oxaliplatin-containing standard therapy. The primary purpose is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of chidamide + sintilimab + bevacizumab versus standard second-line FOLFIRI + bevacizumab therapy for colorectal cancer, with a planned enrollment of 176 subjects with advanced microsatellite stable colorectal cancer who have failed first-line oxaliplatin-containing standard therapy.

DRUG: Experimental drug|DRUG: Control Rx
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause, Around 4 years
Objective Response Rates (ORR), The percentage of subjects whose therapeutic effect evaluation is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1., Around 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), Time from randomization to death from any cause, Around 4 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of subjects whose therapeutic effect evaluation is complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1., Around 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from achievement of a response to disease progression., Around 4 years|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Quality of life is assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30. It will be evaluated at Screening, Tumor Assessment Visit (Week 8 and 12) and End of Treatment visit. The higher score means the worse quality of life., Around 4 years|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CR29 (EORTC QLQ-CR29), Quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer is assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) CR29. It will be evaluated at Screening, Tumor Assessment Visit (Week 8 and 12) and End of Treatment visit. The higher score means the worse quality of life., Around 4 years
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the chidamide + sintilimab + bevacizumab group or the standard second-line FOLFIRI + bevacizumab therapy group. The treatment option for the chidamide + sintilimab + bevacizumab (study group) is 200 mg of sintilimab IV Drip Q3W, 30 mg of chidamide PO BIW, and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg IV Drip Q3W, with a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. The treatment option for the standard second-line FOLFIRI + bevacizumab therapy group (control group) is bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV Drip Q2W, irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV Drip Q2W, calcium folinate 400 mg/m2 IV Q2W or calcium levofolinate 200 mg/m2 IV Drip Q2W, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 IV +2400 mg/m2 CIV Q2W, with a maximum treatment duration of 2 years.

The primary endpoint of this study is the progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from random assignment of the subject to disease progression or death from any cause.

All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the trial or control group in a 1:1 ratio based on the following stratification factors: Whether the primary focus is located in the right-sided colorectum; Whether bevacizumab has been administered in the first-line treatment.
