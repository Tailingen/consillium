Metabolic Tumor Volumes in Radiation Treatment of Primary Brain Tumors
* Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV), identified by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is different from the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) used for radiation dose delivery in the treatment of brain tumors.
* If MTV \> CTV, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in volumes (cc) is related to worse clinical outcome. Furthermore, in case of local recurrence, the lesion is located in the MTV area that is outside of the CTV.
* Alternatively, if CTV \> MTV, then the difference in volumes is related to higher treatment toxicity.

Difference between Metabolic Tumor Volumes and Clinical Tumor Volumes in Patients with Brain Tumors, To evaluate the extent to which tumor volumes, determined by spectroscopic imaging (MTV) differ from the traditionally prescribed clinical treatment volumes (CTV) for radiation therapy, 2 years
