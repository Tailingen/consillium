Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Combined With Adjuvant Chemotherapy Treated Advanced Cervical Cancer
This study carried out a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study under the background of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and three-dimensional afterloading therapy. By comparing simultaneous intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and simultaneous intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone, based on the 2018 FIGO staging The clinical efficacy of locally advanced cervical cancer further clarifies the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, but there are still many patients with local recurrence or metastasis after treatment, and the 5-year survival rate is low. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer is still controversial in improving disease-free survival and overall survival, and previous studies were mostly based on traditional two-dimensional radiotherapy techniques, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three-dimensional afterloading in dosimetry and radiotherapy. Compared with traditional radiotherapy, it has more advantages in terms of biological effects. In addition, after the adjustment of the new 2018 FIGO staging, it is possible to change the impact of the original treatment mode on overall survival. Therefore, more evidence-based medical evidence is needed to clarify the clinical value of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. Therefore, this study carried out a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study under the background of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and three-dimensional afterloading therapy. By comparing simultaneous intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and simultaneous intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemotherapy alone, based on the 2018 FIGO staging The clinical efficacy of locally advanced cervical cancer further clarifies the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.
