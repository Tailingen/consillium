This study includes a dose escalation part (Part 1) in which the MTD or OBD and RDE(s) will be determined. This trial includes an expansion part (Part 2) to evaluate efficacy and safety of BYON4228 in combination with pembrolizumab in specific patient cohorts.

BYON4228 is a humanized IgG1 mAb directed against SIRPα. BYON4228 binds SIRPα expressed on innate immune cells, especially monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. BYON4228 blocks binding of SIRPα to CD47 and inhibits signaling through the CD47-SIRPα axis.
