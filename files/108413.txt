Atezolizumab Plus Etoposide and Platinum in Small Cell Bladder Cancer
This is a single arm, Phase II trial involving the use of atezolizumab plus platinum and etoposide for patients with locally advanced urothelial cancer. The primary goal of this trial is to assess the pathologic complete response rate at cystectomy in patients after being treated with a combination therapy of atezolizumab, platinum, and etoposide.

Pathologic complete response (ypCR) at cystectomy, The number of participants with pathological complete responses (ypCR) at cystectomy. Pathologic complete response is defined as post-treatment cystectomy tumor stages N0 and M0, with T-stage T0., up to 18 months
Number of participants with non-muscle invasive disease, Non-muscle invasive disease is defined as \<ypT1N0 at cystectomy., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability of combination chemotherapy and cystectomy as assessed by number of participants experiencing adverse events, Number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicities and treatment-related adverse events, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., 4.5 years|Incidence of brain metastases in follow-up, Number of participants who develop brain metastases during follow-up, up to 5 years|1-year overall survival rate (1-yr OS), Number of participants alive 1 year after last dose, up to 4 years|2-year overall survival rate (2-yr OS), Number of participants alive 2 years after last dose, up to 5 years|Disease Free Survival, Number of participants without disease recurrence, up to 5 years|Feasibility of atezolizumab administration with platinum and etoposide chemotherapy prior to surgery, Number of participants during the first stage of the study (first 15 patients) proceeding to surgery without extended treatment related delays., up to 18 months
The study population will include male and female patients over the age of 18 with invasive (cT1-cT4) small cell / neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder (MIBC), with or without urothelial cancer component, who are eligible for platinum based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. All patients will be fit to undergo surgical resection of their cancer by cystectomy. Patients with resectable N1 disease within the true pelvis are eligible.

Participants will receive:

Atezolizumab 1,200 mg IV Day 1 Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1-3 Carboplatin AUC 5 IV on Day 1 or Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 (Patients can be switched at investigator's discretion between cisplatin and carboplatin between cycles. Rationale must be provided.) Repeat q 21 days x 4 cycles

Atezolizumab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg Day 1 of every 21 day cycle with chemotherapy x 4 cycles. Following cystectomy, Atezolizumab maintenance Q 21 days will continue until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, local biopsy results (if available), and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease), or up to 1 year (e.g., 16 cycles).
