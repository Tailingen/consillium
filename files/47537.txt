Study of Frontline Dasatinib Plus Chemotherapy in Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (PH+ALL)
The current standard treatment approach for young patients with Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ALL) is the combination of a chemotherapy protocol employing four to five cytotoxic agents typically used for ALL together with imatinib. It is recommended to propose allogeneic Standard Induction and Consolidation Therapy (SCT) to all eligible patients with a suitable donor and to continue imatinib with or without additional therapy in patients not undergoing SCT.

This protocol is a study for newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients aged 18 to 55 years.

The objective of this strategy is to improve the overall results in the treatment of adult ALL with the addition of specific molecules to the common chemotherapeutic schedule.
Philadelphia Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib
Treatment-related discontinuation of study treatment (Proportion of Patients), Day 120
Molecular complete remission rate (CR), Day 120|Hematologic complete remission rate, Day 120|Grade III and IV txicity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3, Day 120
In the present study, the potent ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib will be added to standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy for the Philadelphia positive chromosome sub-group of ALL patients aged 18 to 55 years.

The Study hypothesis is, that Dasatinib in combination with standard chemotherapy according to GMALL protocol 07/2003 is feasible and induces cytologic and molecular remission rates comparable to chemotherapy in combination with imatinib without increased treatment-related mortality.
