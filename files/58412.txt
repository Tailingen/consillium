A Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of SHR6390 in Advanced Melanoma Patients
SHR6390 is a small molecular,oral potent, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety/tolerability and the pharmacokinetic profile of SHR6390 in Chinese advanced melanoma patients by using a "3+3" dose escalation.Preliminary efficacy will be also investigated in this study.
