Prospecitve Observational Study on a Risk Adaptive Scheme for SBRT for Thoracic Nodes Metastases
Oligometastatic patients with inoperable thoracic nodes metastases from any primary, except for hematologic malignancies, will undergo a risk adaptive scheme of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
Thoracic Nodes Metastases
PROCEDURE: Inoperable thoracic nodes metastases
Local control of disease, Local control of the thoracic nodes stereotactic radiation therapy schedules for medically inoperable oligometastatic patients, 7 years
Progression-free survival for patients, A measure of the activity of the SBRT treatment on the disease by statistical methods, 7 years|Overall survival for patients, Percentage of patients who are alive after a length of time, 7 years|Quality of life evaluated by EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaires, At the end of the treatment and during the first follow-up appointment patients will complete the EORTC QLQ C30, 7 years|Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, 7 years
The observational study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of a risk adaptive scheme of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRT) in oligometastatic patients with thoracic nodes metastases, medically inoperable, using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of this technique is the ability to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumour's target while reducing doses to normal tissue, optimizing the therapeutic window.
