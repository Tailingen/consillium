The First-line Combined Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Prospective Observational Clinical Study
This prospective cohort study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the first-line combined chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer(AGC) in Chinese population.
Gastric Cancer
Overall survival(OS) . overall survival Overall survival(OS), From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months
Progression-free survival(PFS), From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Objective response rate(ORR), The sum of complete remission (CR) rate and partial remission (PR) rate. Response will be measured through first-line treatment completion, up to 1 year|Disease control rate(DCR), The sum of CR rate, PR rate and stable disease(SD) rate. Response will be measured through first-line treatment completion, up to 1 year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Through first-line treatment completion,up to 24 weeks.
1. Establish a clinical database for the advanced gastric cancer patients treated with first-line combined chemotherapy in Tongji hospital.

   1.1.Data including age, gender, smoking state, karnofsky performance score（KPS）, disease history, clinical stage, primary tumor site, metastasis site, surgery, first-line chemotherapy, therapy after failure of first-line treatment, radiotherapy, toxicity, survival time, the time of free of progress, response were collected.

   1.2.The peripheral blood samples were collected for further biomarker reserch.
2. Kaplan-Meier and Cox model will be used to analyze the overall survival(OS) and progression-free survival(PFS) of advanced gastric cancer.
3. Extract Deoxyribonucleic acid（DNA） from the the peripheral blood and research biomarkers related to the first-line combined chemotherapy for AGC.
