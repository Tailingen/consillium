Accelerated Fractionation Radiotherapy (AFRT) Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (Crt) In Locally Advanced Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The aim of this trial is to compare the accelerated fractionation radiotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in terms of loco-regional control, toxicities and quality of life.
HEAD AND NECK CANCER
DRUG: CISPLATIN|RADIATION: EXTERNAL BEAM RADIOTHERAPY
TO COMPARE THE LOCO-REGIONAL TUMOR CONTROL RATE BETWEEN AFRT & CRT IN LOCALLY ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS., To compare the loco-regional tumor control rate clinical assessment after 3months of treatment completion will be done.CECT of face and neck at 3 months post treatment completion will be done., 5months(2months treatment period followed by 3 months observation)|TO COMPARE THE TOXICITY BETWEEN AFRT AND CRT IN LOCALLY ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS, To compare toxicity weekly and at 1month post treatment completion hemogram will be done and assessed by CTCAE V3.0. Assessment of acute morbidity clinically will be done by CTCAE V-3.0 scoring system weekly, and post-RT 1 month., 3 months(2 month treatment periods followed by 1month observation)
TO COMPARE POST-THERAPY QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN AFRT AND CRT IN LOCALLY ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA., TO COMPARE THE POST-THERAPY QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN AFRT AND CRT IN LOCALLY ADVANCED HNSCC.Assessment of quality of life in patients in both arms will be recorded prior to start of treatment(for base-line record) and subsequently at 1month and 3months after treatment completion using European organization for research and treatment in cancer, Belgium quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 \& QLQ-H\&N35)., 5months(2months treatment period followed by 3months observation)
Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is a common and conventional method of treating locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In locally advanced HNSCC it has been proved to be superior to radiotherapy alone. On the other side accelerated fractionation radiotherapy (AFRT) is a proven practice to improve cure rate in head and neck cancers. Yet it has not been compared with Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced HNSCC and hence this study is aiming to compare CRT versus AFRT.
