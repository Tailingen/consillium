New Approach of Assessing Drug Response for Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Cancer
The combination of pEBV DNA (half-life) and PET-CT following 1 course of chemotherapy allow earlier and more detection of drug response in advanced NPC than RECIST method, in patients with previously untreated advanced NPC who will receive platinum-based chemotherapy. This study will also determine if this new method can predict survival in these patients. This study may have far-reaching impact on drug development in NPC as it may offer a more optimal way of evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials and also in clinical management.
