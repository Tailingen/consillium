Primary objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GB5005 in patients with CD19-positive relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

Secondary objectives: To assess the preliminary efficacy of GB5005 in patients with CD19-positive B-NHL; To describe the pharmacokinetic profile of GB5005 and observe its proliferation and persistence in the body; To explore the correlation between the pharmacokinetic characteristics of GB5005 and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as well as neurological events.
