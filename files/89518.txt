Cisplatin, Capecitabine, and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and capecitabine, work in different ways to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin together with capecitabine and radiation therapy is more effective with or without cetuximab in treating esophageal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving cisplatin together with capecitabine, radiation therapy, and cetuximab works compared with giving cisplatin, capecitabine, and radiation therapy without cetuximab in treating patients with esophageal cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine whether the addition of cetuximab to definitive chemoradiotherapy comprising cisplatin, capecitabine, and radiotherapy shows evidence of enhanced overall survival in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.
* To determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.
* To determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-84. Beginning in week 7 patients also undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks (weeks 7-11). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 in weeks 1-12. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life and health economics are assessed at baseline, during treatment, and at pre-specified time points during follow-up.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then annually for a minimum of 5 years.
