Cadonilimab Combined With Chemotherapy as First or Second Line Treatment in Recurrent or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The prognosis of recurrent and metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is poor, and chemotherapy is still the main treatment for TNBC. Some studies have shown that combination therapy of antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) significantly improves clinical benefit over PD-1 antibody alone. However, broad application of this combination has been limited by toxicities. Cadonilimab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. It mutates to eliminate Fc receptor and complement-mediated cytotoxic effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy as a first or second-line treatment of recurrent and metastatic TNBC. This study is a multicenter, single arm, phase II, non randomized, open label, Simon two-stage design. It is planned to enroll 27 late stage TNBC patients.
