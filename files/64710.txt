Iberdomide (Cc220) Maintenance After Asct in Newly Diagnosed MM Patients
This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of iberdomide continuous therapy as maintenancetreatment after transplant.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Iberdomide
Efficacy: rate of improvement in response with iberdomide maintenance after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), Response improvement rate within 6 months will be measured as the number of subjects that improve response according to IMWG criteria (from PR to ≥VGPR; from VGPR to ≥CR; from CR to \>sCR) within the end of sixth cycle of treatment., 6 months of treatment|Rate of dose reductions/discontinuations with iberdomide maintenance after ASCT, Dose reductions/discontinuation rate within 6 months will be measured as the number of subjects that discontinued treatment or have a dose modification within the end of sixth cycle of treatment, 6 months of treatment
Rate of next-generation flow (NGF ) minimal residual disease (MRD) conversion from positive to negative., Rate of NGF Minimal residual disease (MRD) conversion from positive to negative.The MRD conversion rate at 6 months is determined as the proportion of subjects with MRD negativity (\*10-5 sensitivity level, by NGF) after 6 months converted from status as Positive at screening., 6 months of treatment|Rate of next-generation flow (NGF ) minimal residual disease (MRD) conversion from positive to negative., The MRD conversion rate at 12 months is determined as the proportion of subjects with MRD negativity (\*10-5 sensitivity level, by NGF) after 12 months converted from status as Positive at screening. Subjects who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before post 12 months MRD evaluation, the best MRD assessment will be considered, 12 months of treatment|Rate of next-generation flow (NGF ) minimal residual disease (MRD) conversion from positive to negative., The best MRD conversion rate within 12 months is determined as the proportion of subjects with MRD negativity (\*10-5 sensitivity level, by NGF) within 12 months converted from status as Positive at screening. Subjects who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before MRD evaluation, the best MRD assessment will be considered., 12 months of treatment|Rate of adverse events, The analysis of safety as defined by type, frequency and severity will be done primarily by tabulation of the incidence of AEs as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. In the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once.

AEs will be summarized by worst CTCAE grade, approximately 60 months|Safety in different subset of subjects with different prognostic features, Determine whether rate of adverse events may change in subgroups with different prognosis according to current prognostic factors, approximately 60 months|Efficacy in different subset of subjects with different prognostic features, Determine whether tumor response in terms of response and survival may change in subgroups with different prognosis according to current prognostic factors, approximately 60 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP will be measured by protocol from the date of start of therapy and according to ITT from the date of eligibility confirmation to the date of first observation of PD, or deaths for PD. Subjects who have not progressed or who withdraw from the study or die from causes other than PD will be censored at the time of the last disease assessment. Subjects lost to FU will also be censored at the time of last complete disease assessment., approximately 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be measured by protocol from the date of start of therapy and according to ITT from the date of eligibility confirmation to the date of first observation of PD, or death from any cause as an event. Subjects who have not progressed or who withdraw from the study or who were lost to FU will be censored at the time of the last disease assessment., approximately 60 months|Time to next therapy (TNT), TNT will be measured by protocol from the date of start of therapy and according to ITT from the date of eligibility confirmation to the date of next anti-myeloma therapy. Death due to any cause before starting therapy will be considered an event. Subjects who have not progressed or who withdraw from the study, approximately 60 months
This is a phase II study with two parallel cohorts of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients in at least partial response (PR) after induction with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) plus IMIDs and single or double ASCT Subjects will receive two dose levels of Iberdomide, they will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. In case, in one cohort will be registered unacceptable toxicity, a third cohort will be opened. Subjects will receive treatment until progression, intolerance or unacceptable toxicity. Subsequently subjects will be followed for 24 months. The maximum number of subjects is 130 for cohort 1 and 2, 160 in case a third cohort will be opened.
