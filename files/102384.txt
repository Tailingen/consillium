Spiritual Health Scale in Chinese Pediatric Cancer Patients
Pediatric cancer patients experience spiritual concerns such as meaningless, hopeless of life, fear of death and losses at all stages of illness. The availability of a valid and reliable instrument that accurately assesses the level of spiritual health among pediatric cancer patients is crucial before any appropriate interventions to solve their spiritual concerns can be appropriately planned and evaluated.
