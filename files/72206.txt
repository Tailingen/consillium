Phase 2 Trial of Obinutuzumab and CC-99282 for Patients With Previously Untreated High Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma
To learn if obinutuzumab in combination with CC-99282 can help to control previously untreated, high tumor burden FL
Follicular Lymphoma|Tumor
DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: CC-99282
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Objectives:

Primary Objectives:

• To determine the efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with CC-99282 as determined by complete response (CR) rate after six cycles of combination treatment for patients with previously untreated, high tumor burden follicular lymphoma (FL).

Secondary Objectives:

• To determine best overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), time to next treatment, CR rate at 30 months (CR30), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and evaluation of safety of obinutuzumab and CC-99282 as treatment for previously untreated patients with FL.

Exploratory Objective:

* To determine the biomarkers that correlates with response and mechanisms of resistance to obinutuzumab and CC-99282 in FL.
* To determine the quality of life in patients with FL receiving obinutuzumab and CC-99282
