Overall Survival, The survival of patients till 12 weeks after induction chemotherapy, the day of 12 weeks after induction chemotherapy|Non-relapse Mortality, The outcomes of non-relapse mortality: The incidence of death without a previous relapse or progression, The day of 12 weeks after induction chemotherapy
