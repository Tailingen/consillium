Yoga for Psychological Distress in Gynecologic, Gastrointestinal, or Thoracic Cancer
This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga program for women with gynecologic, gastrointestinal (GI), or thoracic malignancies. This study will pilot an integrative yoga intervention that combines Western psychotherapeutic approaches with classic yogic philosophy to reduce emotional distress among women undergoing treatment for gynecologic, gastrointestinal (GI), or thoracic cancer and provide a comprehensive approach to stress management across the cancer care continuum.

Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR), This measure will access participants' Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR), which includes cognitive, behavioral, and emotional experiences related to worries that their cancer will return., Pre-Intervention (Baseline) to Post-Intervention (Ten Weeks After Baseline)|Cancer-Related Distress, The Distress Thermometer will be used to assess cancer-related distress. This measure is designed to assess self-efficacy regarding distress and symptom management while facing a cancer diagnosis. Domains assessed include maintenance of activity and independence, seeking and understanding medical information, stress management, coping with treatment side effects, maintaining a positive attitude, engaging in emotion regulation, and seeking support., Pre-Intervention (Baseline) to Post-Intervention (Ten Weeks After Baseline)|State and Trait Anxiety, Anxiety will be assessed with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Assesses state /trait anxiety symptoms on 4 pt. likert scale. Medium: May indicate anxiety disorder, Pre-Intervention (Baseline) to Post-Intervention (Ten Weeks After Baseline)|Depressive Symptoms, Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-2) - high score Suicidal Behavior, Pre-Intervention (Baseline) to Post-Intervention (Ten Weeks After Baseline)
Gynecologic cancers are malignancies of the female reproductive tract that affect over 70,000 women per year. Treatments for gynecologic cancer often result in numerous physical and emotional side effects that affect long-term adjustment, such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, difficulties with fertility, and surgically-induced menopause. Even when initial treatments are successful, gynecologic cancers have a high recurrence rate that can reach nearly 80% among those with ovarian cancer. Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) is described as one of the largest unmet psychological needs among gynecologic cancer patients and is associated with psychological distress, increased health care utilization, and functional impairment. Few studies have examined interventions designed to manage symptoms of FCR, which leaves a significant gap in the literature regarding treatment of this prominent psychosocial problem. Cancer patients report growing use of integrative medicine therapies (e.g., yoga, acupuncture, massage) to manage unmet physical and emotional needs related to their disease and treatment. The current study will take advantage of this trend in supportive oncology to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention program created specially to address FCR among women with gynecologic cancer. Patients will be recruited from the UF Health/Shands Hospital Gynecology Oncology Clinic and Medical Oncology clinic and invited to participate in a 10-week, manualized, small group yoga course. Psychoeducation modules, meditation training, and gentle yoga poses will be integrated into a comprehensive program focused on managing the psychosocial concerns of newly diagnosed gynecologic cancer patients. Findings from this research will contribute to the existing literature on FCR and knowledge regarding the use of integrative medicine techniques for addressing unmet psychological needs among gynecologic cancer patients. If the intervention is deemed feasible and acceptable, future research may explore ways in which this manualized yoga program compares to other psychosocial treatments for managing FCR and other forms of emotional distress in women with cancer.
