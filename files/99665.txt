CD7 CAR T-cell for R/R CD7+ T Cell Lymphoma
This is a prospective, open-label, multiple center and single arm phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T cells expressing humanized CD7 chimeric antigen receptors treatment for patients with refractory/relapsed CD7 positive T cell lymphoma.
Refractory and Relapsed T Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Humanized CD7 CAR-T cells
Overall response rate (ORR), Number of patients who achieved response (complete response and partial response ) after treatment of CD7 CAR-T cell. Response will be assessed using the Lugano criteria., 1 year|Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0, 1 year
Complete relapse rate(CR), Number of patients who achieved complete response after treatment by CD7 CAR-T cell., 1 year|Duration of overall response (DOR), Duration of overall response will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to progression, death or last follow-up., 1 year|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to progression, death or last follow-up., 1 year|Overall survival(OS), OS will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up., 1 year
