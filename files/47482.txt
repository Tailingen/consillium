DCE-MRI and DWI for Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
A type of magnetic resonance imaging called diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) will be tested to define cancerous from non-cancerous lesions in the breast.
Breast Cancer|BIRADS 3|BIRADS 4|BIRADS 5
PROCEDURE: DCE-MRI and DWI
Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), Whether the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), when used systematically in conjunction with conventional Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI), can reduce the biopsy rate by at least 20% while maintaining sensitivity., 1 year
Optimal ADC Cutoffs by Lesion Type, Whether optimal ADC cutoffs are different for mass and non-mass lesion types;, 1 year|Local and Central Review Comparison (ADC Value Differences), Whether site-generated ADC values differ significantly from those obtained by central review;, 1 year|Minimum B-Value for Differentiating Lesions, Whether the use of a nonzero minimum b-value to reduce perfusion effects in ADC calculation can increase the area under the curve (AUC) for differentiating benign and malignant lesions;, 1 year|ADC Measurements/Ratios to Define Subject Lesion Variations, Whether the use of a normalized ADC measure (tumor/normal ratio) to account for inter- and intra-subject variations in water content and other factors can increase the AUC for differentiating benign and malignant lesions;, 1 year|Combination Variables (ADC Nonzero Minimum B-Value and/or Normalized ADC), Whether ADC with nonzero minimum b-value and/or normalized ADC can reduce the biopsy rate while maintaining sensitivity., 1 year
For this study, the investigators plan to evaluate DWI scans performed in women with breast lesions identified by conventional breast MRI. The investigators will determine whether an ADC threshold can be defined for distinguishing benign and malignant lesions on DWI, assess the difference in ADC cutoffs for mass and non-mass lesions, and investigate the potential improvement in accuracy using techniques such as nonzero minimum b-value (to remove perfusion effects in the ADC measures) and normalized ADC measures (to account for variations in water content and other factors).
