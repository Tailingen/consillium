A Study of AK112 as Consolidation Treatment for Patients With Limited Stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Who Have Not Progressed Following Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy
This is a randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of AK112 to placebo as consolidation treatment for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer who have not progressed following concurrent chemoradiation therapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AK112|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival(PFS) assessed by Blinded independent center review(BIRC), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization or first dosing to death due to any cause., Approximately 6 years|PFS assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by BICR Per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|ORR assessed by investigator Per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|Disease control rate(DCR) assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|DCR assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|Duration of Response (DOR) assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|DOR assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 6 years|Number of participants with adverse event (AE), The number of participants experiencing an AE and the severity of AEs will be assessed. AE refers to any untoward medical occurrence or deterioration of existing medical event after the subject signed the ICF, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Approximately 6 years
