Compare the Quality of Life Between Patients With Conduit Diversions or Orthotopic Neobladders
The aim of this study is to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients underwent conduit diversion and orthotopic neobladder after radical cystectomy. The investigators plan to use validated HRQoL questionnaires to learn about how the different urinary diversion operations affect the HRQoL of people living with bladder cancer. The findings from this study may help doctors and patients choosing the proper operation type.
Bladder Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: validated health-related quality of life questionnaires
Change from baseline in HRQoL of bladder cancer patients with different types of urinary diversions, Preoperative baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively
Score differences between the two groups of patients in the relevant domains from three various validated tools of HRQoL, The aim is to compare three various validated tools of HRQoL to study their relative contributions in accounting for variance in prediction of patient HRQoL.

The three validated tools of HRQoL are EORTC-QLQ-C30/BLM (The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire/bladder cancer module), FACT-BL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder cancer) and BCI (Bladder Cancer Index).

The two groups are conduit diversion group and orthotopic neobladder group., Preoperative baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively|Score changes of each patient group during the follow-up, Longitudinally learn about the changes of each individual patient HRQoL after urinary diversion and compare the changes of two groups, i.e. conduit diversion group and orthotopic neobladder group., Preoperative baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively|Objective examination outcomes, Supplement the assessment by interviewing the patients with some lab and image examinations, such as renal function tests, liver function tests, urine culture, urine cytology, chest radiography, ultrasound of kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB) etc., Preoperative baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18 months postoperatively
