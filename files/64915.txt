A Clinical Study of Anetumab Ravtansine in Adults With Solid Tumors Who Have Been Treated in Previous Bayer-sponsored Anetumab Ravtansine Studies
The purpose of this study is to enable patients with solid tumors, who received anetumab ravtansine in a Bayer-sponsored clinical trial, to continue treatment after their respective study has been closed. The patients will be observed to collect information on how safe and efficient the drug is.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: BAY94-9343 (Anetumab ravtansine)
Number of Participants With TEAEs, TESAEs and Drug-related TEAEs and TESAEs, Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs starting or worsening during the treatment period. The treatment period extended from the first date of study treatment in this study until the safety follow-up (30 days after the last administration of study treatment). TESAEs: Treatment emergent serious adverse events., Approximately 3 years (from first study treatment until safety follow-up)
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from first treatment in this study until death from any cause. Data on survival were collected by the site. Time frame was reduced due to early termination of the study. Table reports Kaplan-Meier median with Brookmeyer-Crowley confidence intervals. Number (%) of participants with event: 5 (55.6%) and Number (%) of participants censored: 4 (44.4%)., Approximately 3 years (from first study treatment until safety follow-up)
The primary objective of the study is to collect long-term safety information on anetumab ravtansine and to enable patients, who received an anetumab ravtansine-containing treatment in any Bayer-sponsored anetumab ravtansine parent study, to continue the treatment. The secondary objective is to further investigate the efficacy of the drug.
