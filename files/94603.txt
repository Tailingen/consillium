A Study to Assess Safety of Relatlimab With Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma Who Progressed on Anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (Anti-PD-1) Treatment
The primary purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of relatlimab in combination with ipilimumab.
