Dalpicilib-Enhanced Vs. Standard Endocrine Therapy in ER+ HER2- Early Breast Cancer
This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of dalpicilib combined with endocrine therapy versus standard endocrine therapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative patients with risk factors, in order to further optimize the regimen for adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer.
