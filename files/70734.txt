Phase I Clinical Trial of TQB3915 Tablets in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
TQB3915 is a selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonist, by covalently binding to estrogen receptor, by changing the conformation of ERα, blocking intracellular signal transmission, thereby inhibiting the growth of tumor cells.
