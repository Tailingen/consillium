Analysis of the Modulation of the Tumor Microenvironment by MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) Using a Systems Biology Approach (PEMSYS)
This is a monocentric, prospective, interventional and translational phase II study. Metastatic melanoma (mMEL) patients who are naive to immune therapy in the metastatic setting, and for whom an anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) therapy is needed could be eligible.

The aim of the study is to identify biological markers which allow to better understand and predict the tumor response to pembrolizumab treatment, and thus to establish more efficient treatments for selected patients. Eligible patients will be registered (n=30) and will be treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy at 200 mg every three weeks for 2 years maximum until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first. Patients may be treated for up to one year of additional treatment with pembrolizumab via the Second Course Phase. Patients will be followed medically and radiographically during pembrolizumab treatment. Patients will be followed radiographically every 9 weeks (+/- 7 days) until progression and disease evaluation will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria. After progression, patients will be followed every 6 months for 5 years to collect survival data.
Metastatic Melanoma Naive to Immune Therapy in Metastatic Setting
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab - additional treatment
Identification of biomarkers using genomics and proteomics tools (single cell RNA analysis, exome sequencing, single cell profiling), multiplexed immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics., The origin of individual cells of the tumor microenvironment will be identified after single cell analysis at the transcriptional and protein level. Then gene expression from cells derived by tumor biopsies, and from peripheral blood samples, which are collected before and after exposure to MK3475 will be measured, and qualitative and quantitative data will be reported., 8 years
Efficacy, in order to define responder and non-responder patients and select translational findings that are associated to clinical outcome., Secondary outcomes will be derived from analyzes of the primary outcome measures. Tumor response will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., 8 years
