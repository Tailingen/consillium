Predicting Cancer Risk With Digital and Molecular Markers
The goal of this study is to identify new markers to predict the risk of developing cancer, primarily breast cancer. For this purpose, researchers will compare data obtained from cancer patients and healthy individuals. If characteristic differences are identified, e.g. in biomarkers, life style or family history, this may indicate a person's increased risk of developing cancer.

Assessment of breast cancer risk by polygenic risk score in combination with app-based self-reported health behavior in the study population, Polygenic cancer risk score (PRS) as a numeric value using BOADICEA/CanRisk as absolute 10-year breast cancer risk and as relative risk compared with avarage women at the same age, Baseline
