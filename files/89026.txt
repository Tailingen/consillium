Clinical and Prognostic Value of Sarcopenia in Patients Older Than 70 Years With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This clinical trial is a multicentric prospective study to assess the clinical and prognostic value of sarcopenia in patients older than 70 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Grade IIIB Follicular Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: anthropometric measurement
progression free survival, at 18 months
progression free survival, at 24 months|rate of over grade 2 toxicities, at the first and second courses of chemotherapy (day 21 and day 42)|determination of both molecular subtypes GCB and ABC, according DASL technology (c-DNA mediated annealing selection extension and ligation), at 24 months
Sarcopenia status is assessed by CT scan imaging on the overall survival at 18 months in patients older than 70 years with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated by R-CHOP.
