IONM During Radical Prostatectomy
At present, the preferred treatment for patients with prostate cancer is still radical prostatectomy. Postoperative patients often face some complications, the most common complications include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Urinary incontinence is caused by intraoperative injury of urinary control nerves or muscles. Erectile dysfunction is related to intraoperative injury of nerves that control erection. Therefore, intraoperative nerve preservation is a key measure to reduce postoperative complications, especially to prevent erectile dysfunction. This study intends to improve the nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy by monitoring the nerve during radical prostatectomy, locating the cavernous nerve and other related nerves, in order to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications such as erectile dysfunction.
