Liposomal Bupivacaine in Benign Soft Tissue Tumor Resection
Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) has been used as an adjunct to pain management in the perioperative setting. However, the efficacy of the drug has not bewen studied in patients with benign soft tissue tumor resections. The goal of the study is to see if Exparel controls pain and improves functional outcomes for patients after these procedures compared to the current standard Bupivacaine HCL.
Benign Neoplasm
DRUG: Liposomal bupivacaine|DRUG: Bupivacaine Hydrochloride
Opioid Use, Amount of morphine equivalents used for postoperative pain control, first 7 days postoperatively
Pain Score, VAS pain score, First 7 days postoperatively
Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score (MSTS score), MSTS score postop compared to baseline, First 7 days postoperatively
Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) has been used as an adjunct to pain management in the perioperative setting. However, the efficacy of the drug has not bewen studied in patients with benign soft tissue tumor resections. The goal of the study is to see if Exparel controls pain and improves functional outcomes for patients after these procedures compared to the current standard Bupivacaine HCL.

Patients will be randomly assigned Exparel or Bupivacaine HCL intraoperatively during the tumor resection. The amount administered is based on the size of wound after tumor resection. The patients are then provided a pain diary in which they record the amount of pain medications taken, VAS pain scores, and musculoskeletal and tumor society score (MSTS) for the first week postoperatively.

The study will end once 140 patients have been enrolled. Data will be analyzed comparing morphine equivalents, pain scores, and functional scores between the groups.
