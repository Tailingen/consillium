First-in-human Study of OVM-200 as a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine
OVM-200 will be tested in humans for the first time in Study OVM-200-100. Up to 52 patients aged 18-75 with prostate, lung or ovarian cancer will be enrolled in the Study to find out if OVM-200 is safe to continue studying it in patients with cancer. The Study consists of 2 parts: a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, up to 4 increasing doses of OVM-200 will be evaluated in small groups of cancer patients to find the recommended dose for the expansion part. The recommended dose of OVM-200 will then be given to cancer patients in the dose expansion part to confirm safety and understand how effective it is against their disease and if there are any side effects.

Patients who agree to participate in the Study and pass screening will receive 3 doses of OVM-200 in total at 2-week intervals as an injection under the skin. After completing treatment with OVM-200 patients will be followed up for side effects and to monitor changes in their cancer. Patients will stay on the Study for about 6 months in total during which they will have 10 hospital visits. The Study will run at around 5 sites in the UK.
