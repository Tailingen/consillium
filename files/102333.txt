Talimogene Laherparepvec and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Refractory Lymphomas or Advanced or Refractory Non-melanoma Skin Cancers
This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec and nivolumab work in treating patients with lymphomas that do not responded to treatment (refractory) or non-melanoma skin cancers that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) or do not responded to treatment. Biological therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving talimogene laherparepvec and nivolumab may work better compared to usual treatments in treating patients with lymphomas or non-melanoma skin cancers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the frequency of patients responding (response rate) to talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the local response rate to talimogene laherparepvec in injected tumors.

II. To determine the response rate to talimogene laherparepvec + nivolumab (NIVO).

III. To identify potential pre-treatment and on-treatment correlative biomarkers of local and systemic immune response.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally (IT) and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for cycle 1 then every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection and biopsies on study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years.
