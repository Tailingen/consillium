French Registry of First-line Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
The registry aims to compare the two first-line available treatment approaches in non-high-risk APL patients aged ≤ 70 years - ATRA plus chemotherapy and ATRA plus ATO - in terms of practitioner's choice between the two options, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, long-term outcome, and short- and long-term toxic effects.
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
Event-free survival, events are: no achievement of haematological complete remission after induction therapy; no achievement of molecular remission after the consolidation courses; relapse; death including early death, From date of induction until the date of first documented event, assessed up to 60 months
Rate of hematological complete remission, from date of inclusion until end of induction therapy, up to 30 days|Rate of overall survival, at 5 years
* Collection of epidemiological data on non-high-risk APL patients aged ≤ 70 years: age and sex distribution, medical history, prognostic factors (time to treatment start, severity of coagulopathy at presentation, Performance status...).
* Documentation of clinical and biologic effectiveness of the two first-line treatment approaches available for non-high-risk APL patients.
* Documentation of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD).
* Correlation of clinical outcomes with the chosen therapy.
* Validation of published prognostic factors and identification of new prognostic factors
