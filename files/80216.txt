Iyengar Yoga for Chemotherapy-induced Fatigue in Breast Cancer Patients
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and is associated with profound restrictions of health-related quality of life and psychosocial health. More than three-quarters of women with breast cancer suffer from fatigue during cancer treatment. While exercise interventions can improve fatigue in breast cancer patients, many patients request complementary treatment approaches. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of yoga in women with breast cancer compared to aerobic exercise and usual care.

It is hypothesized that yoga is more effective than usual care and equally effective as aerobic exercise.
