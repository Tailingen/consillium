Fast Track Diagnosis of Skin Cancer by Advanced Imaging Technologies and Tumour Tapestripping
In this clinical feasibility study the investigators will test and compare two advanced optical imaging technologies, lipid and RNA tape stripping with regards to diagnostic accuracies for fast bedside diagnosis of pigmented skin tumours.
Skin Cancer|Malignant Melanoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and tape-strippng of RNA and lipids
Diagnostic accuracy. The primary objective i to test and compare two advanced optical imaging technologies, lipid and RNA tape stripping with regards to diagnostic accuracies for fast bedside diagnosis of pigmented skin tumours., Will be presented as sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Tumor thickness measurements using MSOT will be measured and reported in millimeters. The blood flow in dermal blood vessels will be measured quantitatively by MSOT and vascular morphology will be described qualitatively. RCM images will be evaluated qualitatively regarding cellular changes, skin micromorphology and characteristic malignant melanoma features., All patients will be scanned by an experienced examiner in a 30 minutes to 1 hour session.
Analysis of RNA molecules of surface cells from tape stripping, Examination of the expression of a total of 22 selected RNA molecules in suspicious skin tumours will be investigated by quantitative reverse-transcription methods with the use of the TaqMan method (Thermo Fisher Scientific)., Up to 6 months|Lipid analysis from tape-stripping, We will analyze lipids obtained by tape-stripping from surface cells in pigmented lesions by ex vivo spectroscopic near-infrared optical coherence tomography (OCT), performed at DTU: Dept of Photonics Lab Facilities., Up to 6 months
This original clinical research project utilizes cutting-edge medical imaging technologies for diagnosis of pigmented skin tumours, combined for the first time in Denmark, with molecular RNA and lipid analysis of superficial tumours cells. The scanning technologies are reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), which is a microscope applied directly to the skin surface, and photoacoustic imaging, also termed multispectral optoacoustic imaging (MSOT), which is an imaging technology actually listening to the skin for immediate bedside diagnosis of pigmented skin tumors. The hypothesis is that treatment guided by diagnostic bedside skin scanning, combined with tumour tape-stripping and RNA and lipid analysis can increase diagnostic accuracy compared to visual inspection of the skin tumour and thus decrease time delay from diagnosis to efficient treatment
