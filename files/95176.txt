Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response or better., Up to 73 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed partial response or better., Up to 73 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed minimal response (MR) or better, Up to 73 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as time from first documented evidence of partial response or better until first documented progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 73 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as time from the date of randomization and the first documented evidence of response (PR or better) among participants who achieve partial response or better., Up to 73 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as time from the date of randomization until the earliest date of documented date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 73 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 73 months|Progression-free Survival on Subsequent Line of Therapy (PFS2), Progression-free survival on subsequent line of therapy is defined as time from randomization to disease progression after initiation of new anti-myeloma therapy or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. If disease progression after new antimyeloma therapy cannot be measured, a PFS event is defined as the date of discontinuation of new anti-myeloma therapy, or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., Up to 73 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate, Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity rate is defined as the percentage of participants who are MRD negative status by next generation sequencing (NGS)., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Hematology Parameters, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of hematology parameters., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Clinical Chemistry, Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Urine Dipstick, Urine samples will be collected for the urine dipstick analysis., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Abnormal Ocular Findings on Ophthalmic Examination, Up to 73 months|Plasma Concentrations of Belantamab Mafodotin (Total Antibody) at Indicated Time Points, Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 73 months|Plasma Concentrations of Belantamab Mafodotin (ADC) at Indicated Time Points, Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 73 months|Plasma Concentrations of Monomethyl Auristatin-F With a Cysteine Linker (Cys-mcMMAF) at Indicated Time Points, Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of belantamab mafodotin., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) Against Belantamab Mafodotin, Serum samples collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays. All samples will be tested in screening assay, and positive samples will be further characterized for antibody titers., Up to 73 months|Titers of ADAs Against Belantamab Mafodotin, Serum samples collected for the analysis of the presence of ADAs using validated immunoassays. All samples will be to be further tested in screening assay, and positive samples will be further to be characterized for antibody titers., Up to 73 months|Number of Participants With Maximum Post-baseline Change From Baseline in Individual Items of Patient-Reported Outcome Version of the Common Term Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in participants on cancer clinical trials. The PRO-CTCAE includes an item library of 124 items representing 78 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE., Up to 73 months|Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured by EuropeanOrganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core Module (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These included five functional scales (physical functioning \[PF\], role functioning \[RF\], cognitive functioning \[CF\], emotional functioning \[EF\] and social functioning \[SF\]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting \[N/V\]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhoea, insomnia, dyspnoea, appetite loss \[AL\] and financial difficulties \[FD\]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores were averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represent better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represent significant symptomatology. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1) with a non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value., Up to 73 months|Change From Baseline in HRQoL as Measured by EORTC IL52, The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 20-item Multiple Myeloma module (QLQMY20) is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. For the EORTC IL52, disease symptoms domain of the QLQ-MY20 will be used for bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest pain, and pain increasing with activity. The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A high score represents a high/healthy level of functioning., Up to 73 months
