HAIC With FOLFOX Versus Systemic Chemotherapy With GP for Unresectable ICC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin compared systemic chemotherapy of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

DRUG: oxaliplatin , fluorouracil, and leucovorin|DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin
Overall survival, OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., 12 months
Progression free survival, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first., 12 months|Time to progression, TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)., 12 months|Number of adverse events., Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 30 days
