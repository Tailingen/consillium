SL-279252 (PD1-Fc-OX40L) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-279252 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

This is a Phase 1 first in human, open label, multi-center, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-279252 in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. The study design consists of Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Cohorts. In the dose escalation phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels. During dose escalation, two possible schedules for administration of SL-279252 may be explored. The MTD or MAD may be determined for either schedule. Based on accumulating data from the dose escalation phase, including safety, PK, pharmacodynamic and anti-tumor activity, up to two dose expansion cohorts may be opened. The primary objective of the expansion phase is to further refine the safety and tolerability of SL-279252. The expansion cohorts will evaluate one or two doses of SL-279252 using one selected schedule. At the end of dose escalation and dose expansion, safety, PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic data will be reviewed to identify the RP2D.
