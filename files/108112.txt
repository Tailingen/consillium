LDCT-SC-FI Low-dose CT Screening for Lung Cancer
This is a randomized phase II trial investigating different smoking cessation methods in study subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT). The study also evaluates feasibility and outcomes of LDCT screening and potential biomarkers and AI-based evaluation on CT-scans. The study subjects fulfilling I/E-criteria are randomized in 1:1 fashion to yearly LDCT for two rounds with standard smoking cessation (control) or same LDCT approach combined to mobile application based smoking cessation (intervention).
