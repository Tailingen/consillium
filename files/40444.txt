Photodynamic Diagnosis for Malignant Brain Glioma With 5-Aminolevulinic Acid（5-ALA）
This trial is an open-label, multicenter, phase III clinical study，conducted in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant high-grade (WHO grades 3\~4) glioma, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) oral solution powder for fluorescence-guided tumor resection and photodynamic diagnosis.
