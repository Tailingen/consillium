A Study Of SU011248 As Therapy In Patients With Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if SU011248 (sunitinib) provides additional benefit when it is given after treatment with two chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel and also if sunitinib is safe for patients with locally advanced and metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: sunitinib
Proportion of Subjects Surviving at One Year, Proportion of those surviving at the end of one year from the first dose of study treatment. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the last date the subject was known to be alive. Patients lacking data beyond the day of first dose had their survival time censored at Day 1 of treatment., From start of treatment until 1 year or death
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective disease progression or to death on study due to any cause, whichever was first. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. PFS (in weeks) was calculated as (first event date - first paclitaxel/carboplatin dose date +1)/7.02., From start of treatment until Day 21 of Cycles 2 and 4 (Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel), Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and even cycles thereafter (Sunitinib) or death|Time to Tumor Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective disease progression. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, the first date was used. TTP (in weeks) was calculated as (first event date - first paclitaxel/carboplatin dose date +1)/7.02., From start of treatment until Day 21 of Cycles 2 and 4 (Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel), Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and even cycles thereafter (Sunitinib)|Duration of Response (DR), DR=time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) that was subsequently confirmed to first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever was first. CR=disappearance of all target lesions. PR=a \> = 30% decrease in sum of longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference baseline sum longest dimensions. If tumor progression data included more than 1 date, first date was used. DR (in weeks) was calculated as (the end date for DR - first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed +1)/7.02., From start of treatment until Day 21 of Cycles 2 and 4 (Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel), Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and even cycles thereafter (Sunitinib) or death|Number of Subjects With Overall Confirmed Objective Disease Response, Objective disease response = subjects with confirmed CR or PR according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.0).
