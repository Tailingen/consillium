Effects of PG2 on Fatigue-Related Symptom Clusters
This study is for an "add-on" study to the "main" study (Protocol No.: PH-CP012). The information of patients from main study will be collected by questionnaire survey and actigraphy measurement to evaluate the relationship between fatigue, depression and sleep disorder and the efficacy of PG2 after treatment.The association between symptom cluster and circadian rhythm will be also further explored.
