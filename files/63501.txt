Colorectal Cancer Legal and Administrative Burden Support: A Pilot Clinical Trial
This is a single center single-arm, pilot study of proactive and early connection with free legal care services for persons with advanced colorectal cancer to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of this intervention in improving financial and psychosocial outcomes. Participants will receive free, personalized legal care services from Cancer Legal Care (CLC), a nonprofit organization located in the Twin Cities of Minnesota. The duration of study participation is 6 months, however, participants may continue to access free personalized legal care services beyond this period. All participants continue to receive standard of care as prescribed by their treating physician.
