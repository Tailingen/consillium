A Comparative Study in Chinese Subjects With Chemotherapy Na√Øve Stage IV Melanoma Receiving Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) vs. Dacarbazine
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Ipilimumab will extend the life of chinese patients with Chemotherapy Naive Stage IV Melanoma more than Dacarbazine as well as to examine safety in this patient population.
