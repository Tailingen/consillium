A Phase II Trail of Chidamide ,Rituximab and Methotrexate in Lymphoma Patients
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and patient reported outcomes of chidamide 20 mg biw PO day1-14 and rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV given on day 1 and methotrexate 3.5g/m2 IV given on day 2 of every 21-day cycle for 6 cycles in untreated patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.

The primary study endpoint will be complete response (CR) rate as assessed by the investigator. The hypothesis is previously untreated patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma could achieve a CR rate of 80% with C-R-HDMTX.

CR rate, CR rate of the lesion of previously untreated patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma according to the international collaborative evaluation criteria for central nervous system lymphoma （2005）with Enhanced MRI every 2 cycles, up to 18 weeks
