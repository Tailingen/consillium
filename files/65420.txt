Mechanism Investigation of Selinexor Combined With Lenalidomide and Rituximab in the Treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is a retrospective observational study of the therapeutic mechanism and resistance mechanism of the treatment of Selinexor combined with lenalidomide and rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. By detecting the immune cells in peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients before and after treatment, the key immune cell subsets and immune molecules linked to the action and resistance of the treatment of Selinexor combined with lenalidomide and rituximab, so as to provide the basis for the optimization of the treatment or the combination of other immunotherapies.
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: Selinexor combined with lenalidomide and rituximab
Tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for DNA sequencing after quality control., Tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for DNA sequencing after quality control. On the one hand, the difference of tumor mutations will be analyzed in pre-treatment biopsy samples of patients grouped by efficacy; on the other hand, the changes of tumor mutations will be analyzed between pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy samples of patients., 2023/06/30-2025/06/30|Tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for RNA sequencing after quality control., Tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for bulky RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing after quality control. On the one hand, the difference of characteristics of tumor microenvironment will be analyzed in pre-treatment biopsy samples of patients grouped by efficacy; on the other hand, the changes of characteristics of tumor microenvironment will be analyzed between pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsy samples of patients., 2023/06/30-2025/06/30|Peripheral blood collected before each cycle and at the point of progression if available for Mass Cytometry., Peripheral blood collected before each cycle and at the point of progression if available for Mass Cytometry to analyze the changes of immune celltypes and chemokines and cytokines., 2023/06/30-2025/06/30
