Phase III Study of Abiraterone Acetate (II) Versus Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with MCRPC
Acetate abiraterone tablets (II) is a modified new drug launched in China, prepared using nanocrystal technology and supplemented with SNAC as an absorption enhancer, working together to promote the gastrointestinal absorption of Abiraterone, improve its oral bioavailability, and reduce its pharmacokinetic variability within individuals, as well as the impact of food on its pharmacokinetics. According to preliminary research results, the exposure to 300mg acetate abiraterone tablets (II) under fasting conditions is not less than the exposure to the original Zeke® 1000mg, and the food effect of acetate abiraterone tablets (II) is small, allowing for medication without dietary restrictions. The registration study uses steady-state serum testosterone levels as the primary pharmacodynamic indicator, comparing the efficacy of 300mg acetate Abiraterone tablets (II) and 1000mg Zeke® in mCRPC patients to be equivalent, with a safety advantage.This study is a non-inferior phase III, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter trial. The study planned to enroll 400 mCRPC subjects and randomly assign them to the experimental group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The experimental group was treated with abiraterone acetate tablets (II.) combined with prednisone, and the control group was treated with abiraterone acetate tablets combined with prednisone, and the primary endpoints were PSA50 response rate and safety.To assess whether the efficacy (PSA50) of Abiraterone Acetate Tablets (II) is statistically non-inferior to that of Abiraterone Acetate Tablets, and whether there is a significant reduction in the incidence of grade 3 and above TEAEs.

PSA50 response rate, The main analysis of the PSA50 response rate will be performed based on the ITT set and the sensitivity analysis based on the PPS set. The number and percentage of participants achieving PSA50 response in each treatment group will be pooled, and the Clopper-Pearson method will be used to estimate the two-sided 95% confidence interval for PSA50 response rate in each treatment group. The difference in overall PSA50 response rate and rate stratification according to prior treatment modality (CAB vs. NHA vs. chemotherapy) between the two treatment groups will be pooled, and a two-sided 95% confidence interval for estimating the rate difference between groups using the Miettinen-Nurminen method will be used., 24 months
ORR, RECIST1.1 criteria were used to assess tumor ORR, including cases of CR and PR. Definition of evaluable subjects: All subjects who meet the following criteria, i.e., presence of at least one measurable soft tissue lesion (according to criteria RECIST1.1) on baseline CT/MRI, at least 1 episode of study therapy, and at least 1 prior CT/MRI examination after initiation of study treatment. If the efficacy reaches CR and PR, the subject must be re-examined 4 weeks after the first evaluation. ORR is the number of subjects with an overall efficacy rating of CR or PR divided by the number of evaluable subjects., 24 months|PSA response rate, Evaluate the situation of PSA90 and PSA≤0.2ng/ml throughout the entire study period, 24 months|The incidence of ALL Adverse events, Safety analysis will be based on the SS set, with the following data summarized descriptively separately based on the overall population and treatment group (only treatment-emergent adverse events \[TEAEs\] will be described): AEs, SAEs, ≥ Grade 3 AEs, Grade ≥3 SAEs, Drug-Related AEs, Drug-Related SAEs, AEs with an incidence of ≥5%, SAEs with an incidence of ≥5%, AEs leading to dose adjustments, AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment., 24 months|rPFS, rPFS (Radiographic Progression-Free Survival) time is defined as the time from the randomization date to the occurrence of radiographic disease progression (radiographic disease progression is based on the date of imaging examination, according to RECIST 1.1 and adjusted PCWG3 criteria) or death from any cause, calculated as the time of first occurrence., 24 months|OS, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death from any cause., 24 months|Time to PSA progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to first PSA progression;PSA progression is judged according to PCWG3 criteria, PSA level changes within the first 12 weeks of treatment are not included in this evaluation, and others are as follows:

1. If PSA at the end of week 12 after randomization is lower than baseline, PSA progression is defined as an increase of ≥ 50% and an absolute increase of ≥ 1 ng/mL from the nadir level (nadir in PSA at the end of week 12 and thereafter);
2. If PSA at the end of 12 weeks after randomization is not lower than baseline, PSA progression is defined as an increase from baseline ≥ 50% and an absolute increase ≥ 1 ng/mL;
3. PSA progression on initial evaluation should be confirmed ≥ 3 weeks later., 24 months|Time to pain progression, Time to pain progression: the time from randomization to the date of 30% or greater improvement from baseline in pain severity score (using BPI-SF). or 2 consecutive assessments from the start of treatment to an interval ≥of 4 weeks to observe a 2-point increase from baseline in the most severe pain intensity of BPI-SF (scale point 3) or the time to initiation of chronic opioids, whichever occurs first., 24 months
