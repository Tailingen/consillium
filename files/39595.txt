An Observational Study of Perioperative Immunotherapy in MSI-H Gastrointestinal Tumors
Gastrointestinal cancer like Gastric cancer and colorectal cancer are high-incidence tumors worldwide. Surgery is the only curable way. Perioperative treatment can improve the survival of patients. Microsatellite instability-high（MSI-H）are a special subtype of gastrointestinal tumors, accounting for about 15-22%. According to current research, patients with this type of gastrointestinal tumors cannot benefit from traditional perioperative chemotherapy, which directly affects the long-term survival of patients. Because patients with MSI-H have a unique tumor immune microenvironment, thus they are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Current studies have confirmed that the use of immunotherapy during palliative care can prolong the survival of patients with MSI-H. In the neoadjuvant treatment stage, according to the previous clinical practice of our center, the use of immunotherapy can make some patients achieve complete postoperative pathological remission. However, in the perioperative treatment stage, the value of immunotherapy is still lack of powerful clinical evidence.

Based on this, our group intends to start an observational study to prospectively enroll patients with MSI-H gastrointestinal tumor using immunotherapy during the perioperative period.The primary endpoint is safety while survival outcomes as secondary endpoints. In order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of immunotherapy during the perioperative treatment stage in MSI-H gastrointestinal cancer
