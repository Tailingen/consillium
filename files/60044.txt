Immunomodulation Analysis of Radiation Therapy in Pediatric Malignant Brain Tumors
To investigate the effect of radiotherapy on peripheral blood immune cell composition and function in pediatric malignant brain tumor patients.
Brain Tumor, Pediatric
The changes of peripheral blood immune cells, The flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subtypes populations would be performed, 6 weeks (prior and post the radiation therapy )
Activation status of T cells, Activation status of peripheral IFN-γ-producing effector CD8+ T cells by Elispot., 6 weeks (prior and post the radiation therapy )|The changs of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, Human inflammatory cytokines and chemokines will be analyzed by ELISA during radiation therapy. The cytokines and chemokines are IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 6 weeks (prior and post the radiation therapy )
