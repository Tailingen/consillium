Bevacizumab + CHOP-Rituximab in Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Primary Objective

1. To evaluate the safety profile of Bevacizumab (Bevacizumab™)- Rituximab (Rituxan®)-CHOP (RA-CHOP) in patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

Secondary Objectives

1. To evaluate the response rate and time to disease progression of the RA-CHOP regimen in patients with newly diagnosed MCL.
2. To prospectively characterize the angiogenic profiles of MCL patients during RA-CHOP treatment.
Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: CHOP
Number of Participants With Toxicity, Number of patients with reversible myelosuppression (Primary toxicity was reversible myelosuppression) Toxicities were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., 38 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate measured using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis

Response criteria were those reported by Cheson et al. (1999), 38 Months (min 33 months, max 62 months)|Progression-Free Survival, The percentage of patients who have not progressed at the three year time point.

The 3-year PFS rate was estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis., 3 years|Overall Survival, The percentage of patients who have survived at the three year time point.

The 3-year OS rate was estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis., 3 years
Bevacizumab administered at 15 mg/kg on day 1 of each of 6 cycles

Rituximab administered 375 mg/m2 on day 3 of each of 6 cycles (with usual premedications)

Standard CHOP chemotherapy administered on day 3 every 21 days (full dose) for 6 cycles of treatment

Once completed six cycles of therapy (\~18 weeks), patients will be evaluated every 3 months for the first year post treatment, then every 6 months until disease progression or death for years 2 through 5 post treatment. Patients who have disease progression will be contacted every 6 months until death to assess for survival status.
