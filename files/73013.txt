Biodistribution Study With 186 Re-labelled Humanised Monoclonal Antibody BIWA 4 in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objectives of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenously (i.v.) administered 186 Rhenium-isotope (186Re)-labelled bivatuzumab and to investigate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 186 Re-labelled bivatuzumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: hMAb BIWA 4
Number of patients with adverse events, up to 6 weeks post infusion|Number of patients with abnormal changes in laboratory parameters, up to 6 weeks post infusion|Number of patients with clinically significant changes in vital signs, up to 6 weeks post infusion|Presence of Human-Anti-Human-Antibody (HAHA), up to 6 weeks post infusion|Biodistribution of 186Re-labelled hMAb BIWA 4 in tumour and normal tissue samples, assessed by radioimmunoscintigraphy expressed as no, low, medium or high, up to 96 hours post infusion|Uptake of 186Re-labelled hMAb BIWA 4 in tumour and normal tissue samples, Biodistribution assessed from biopsy sample as percentage of the injected dose per kg tissue (%ID/kg), after surgery on day 8|AUC0-∞ (Area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity), up to 6 weeks post infusion|Cmax (Maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma), up to 6 weeks post infusion|tmax (Time from dosing to the maximum concentration of the analyte in plasma), up to 6 weeks post infusion|t½ (Terminal half-life of the analyte in plasma), up to 6 weeks post infusion|MRT (Mean residence time of the analyte in the body), up to 6 weeks post infusion|Vss (Apparent volume of distribution under steady state conditions), up to 6 weeks post infusion|Vz (Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase), up to 6 weeks post infusion|CL (Total body clearance), up to 6 weeks post infusion
