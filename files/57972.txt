A Phase 3 Study of UGN-103 for Treatment of Patients With Low-grade Intermediate-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This Phase 3, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of UGN-103, a novel formulation of UGN-102, instilled in the urinary bladder of patients with low-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (LG-NMIBC).

DRUG: UGN-103
Complete response rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR at the 3-month Visit., 3 months
Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of evidence of CR at the 3-month Visit to the earliest date of recurrence or progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Up to 21 months|Durable complete response (DCR) rate, DCR rate at scheduled disease assessment time points, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR at the 3-month Visit and maintained CR (ie, no detectable disease) up to that particular follow-up disease assessment., Up to 21 months|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, TEAEs of special interest, and abnormal clinical laboratory test results (hematology and serum chemistry), The number of patients with each type of event will be summarized., Up to 21 months|Mitomycin plasma concentrations, Mitomycin plasma concentrations will be assessed in a subset of patients treated with UGN-103, 0 (pre-instillation), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after the first instillation of UGN-103.|Mitomycin maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Mitomycin Cmax will be assessed in a subset of patients treated with UGN-103, 0 (pre-instillation), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after the first instillation of UGN-103.
Eligible patients will be treated with UGN-103 once weekly for 6 weeks (a total of 6 doses).

Efficacy will be assessed by the complete response rate (CRR) at the 3-month Visit (approximately 3 months after the first instillation). Response will be determined based on visual observation (white light cystoscopy), histopathology of any remaining or new lesions by central pathology lab (if applicable), and interpretation of urine cytology by central pathology lab.

Patients who have a complete response (CR) at the 3-month Visit, defined as having no detectable disease (NDD) in the bladder, will enter the Follow-up Period of the study. During the Follow-up Period, patients will return to the clinic every 3 months for evaluation of response. Patients will remain on study until disease recurrence, disease progression, death, or the last patient completes 12 months of follow-up (ie, 15 months after the first instillation), whichever occurs first.

Patients who have a non-complete response (NCR) at the 3-month Visit will undergo investigator designated standard of care (SOC) and have a separate End of Study (EOS) Visit performed.
