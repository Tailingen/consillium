Phase 2 Study of Nivolumab in Solid Tumors Induced by Prior Radiation Exposure
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab is effective in the treatment of radiation-induced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors Induced by Prior Radiation Exposure
DRUG: Nivolumab
Best Objective Response Rate, Number of participants with response. Response will be assessed at baseline (within 4 weeks prior to starting nivolumab) and then every 8 weeks while on Nivolumab, up to 24 weeks. The best objective response will be assessed at 24 weeks. Response will be defined based on RECIST 1.1 criteria where complete response (CR)= disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., Up to 24 weeks
Percentage of Patients Progression-free at 24 Weeks From the Time of Enrollment, Disease status at 24 weeks will be compared to disease status at the time of enrollment, and response coded based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 24 weeks|Progression-free Survival, Number of participants alive without progression., Up to 22 months|Duration of Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response or Partial Response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, accessed up to 3 years., Up to 22 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as defined by CTCAE 4.0 criteria., up to 100 days post-intervention|Overall Survival, Overall survival was planned to be measured at 5 years post-intervention as the time from enrollment until death. Instead, due to early termination for low accrual, the number of participants alive at the time of study termination is reported., Up to 22 months
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab is effective in the treatment of radiation-induced solid tumors.
