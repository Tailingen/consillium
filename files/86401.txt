Genetic Risk Estimation of Breast Cancer Prior to Preventive Medication Uptake
The primary aim of this study is to determine if the addition of an individual polygenic risk score (PRS), in addition to the standard National Cancer Institute's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) or Tyrer-Cuzick (IBIS) score, will aid women at risk of breast cancer in making a decision to take (or not take) medications to prevent breast cancer
Breast Cancer
GENETIC: Polygenic Risk Score
Patient self-reported intention to take a breast cancer preventing medication, up to 6 months after initial consultation
Proportion of patients who are taking preventive medications at year 1, 1 year|Proportion of patients who are taking preventive medications at year 2, 2 years|Endocrine related quality of life scores at 1 year, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) - Endocrine Subscale Quality of Life Tool, 1 year|Endocrine related quality of life scores at 2 years, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) - Endocrine Subscale Quality of Life Tool, 2 years
This trial is a prospective pilot study looking to integrate a novel and retrospectively validated polygenic risk score (PRS), based on 77 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), into a standard breast cancer prevention consultation for non-BRCA women. In order to be eligible for trial participation, women will need to have a BCRAT estimate of â‰¥3% for the 5 year risk of developing breast cancer (which corresponds to the United States Preventative Services Task Force threshold for moderate to strong benefit from breast cancer preventing medications such as tamoxifen or raloxifene.

At the time of the breast cancer prevention consultation, women will be offered participation in this study by a clinical trials nurse and informed written consent will be obtained. For consenting patients, a single 7 to 10 ml blood sample will be taken and couriered to the MAYO clinic for sample analysis and several surveys will be administered. One of the surveys will assess the participants understanding and intention to take or not take breast cancer preventing medications. The decision to take or not take a breast cancer preventing medication will be deferred until a subsequent follow up visit.

On the second visit, the PRS test results will be reviewed with the patient and a recommendation regarding preventive medications will be made. The PRS score will risk stratify patients into one of three lifetime risk categories of developing breast cancer (low risk (\<15 % lifetime risk), above average risk (15 to \<40% risk) and high risk (\>40%)). Participants will then answer a second survey in which their understanding of their breast cancer risk and intention to take breast cancer preventing medications will be assessed.
