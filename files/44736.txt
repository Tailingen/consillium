Study of Zanubrutinib in Japanese Participants With B-Cell Malignancies
This is a Phase 1/2 study of zanubrutinib in Japanese participants with mature B-cell malignancies.

This study intends to assess the use of zanubrutinib as an investigational agent to develop new treatment options for Japanese participants with B-cell malignancies. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed given the small sample size.
