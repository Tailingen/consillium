Based on fair evidence, screening would result in no (or minimal) decrease in mortality from esophageal cancer in the U.S. population.
Description of the Evidence
Study Design
: Evidence from cohort or case-control studies.
Internal Validity
: Fair.
Consistency
: Multiple studies.
Magnitude of Effects on Health Outcomes

Natural History, Incidence, and Mortality
Risk Factors
Natural History, Incidence, and Mortality
In 2025,  an estimated 22,070 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal
cancer, and 16,250 will die of this disease. Of the new cases,  an estimated 17,430
will occur in men, and   4,640 will occur in women.[
1
]
Two histological types account for most malignant esophageal
neoplasms: adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma.  The epidemiology of
these types varies markedly.  In the 1960s, squamous cell cancers comprised
more than 90% of all esophageal tumors.  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas
has risen considerably for the past two decades, such that it is now more
prevalent than squamous cell cancer in the United States and Western Europe,
with most tumors located in the distal esophagus.[
2
]  Although the overall
incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is declining, this
histological type remains six times more likely to occur in Black men than in
White men.[
3
]  Incidence rates generally increase with age in all
racial and ethnic groups, but squamous cell cancer is consistently more common in
Black individuals than in White individuals.  Incidence rates are higher in White men compared with Black men in all age groups.  In women, the incidence rates are higher in Black women through age 74 years, at which point the rates become higher in White women.[

]
Risk Factors
While risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been
identified (such as tobacco, alcoholism, malnutrition, and infection with human
papillomavirus),[
5
] the risk factors associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma
are less defined.  The most important epidemiological difference between
squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, however, is the strong association
between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adenocarcinoma.  The results
of a population-based case-control study suggest that symptomatic
gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The
frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated
with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.[
6
-
8
]
Long-standing GERD predisposes to Barrett esophagus, the condition in which
an abnormal intestinal epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium
that normally lines the distal esophagus.[
9
]  The intestinal-type epithelium of
Barrett esophagus has a characteristic endoscopic appearance that differs
from squamous epithelium.[
10
]  Dysplasia in Barrett epithelium represents an 
alteration of the columnar epithelium that may progress to invasive
adenocarcinoma.[
11
]
An interesting hypothesis relates the rise in incidence of esophageal
adenocarcinoma to a declining prevalence of
Helicobacter pylori
infection in
Western countries.  Reports have suggested that gastric infection with
H.
pylori
may protect the esophagus from GERD and its complications.[
12
] 
According to this theory,
H. pylori
infections that cause pangastritis also
cause a decrease in gastric acid production that protects against GERD.[
13
] 
Patients whose duodenal ulcers were treated successfully with antibiotics
developed reflux esophagitis twice as often as those in whom infection
persisted.[
14
]
Past use of lower esophageal sphincter (LES)-relaxing drugs was positively
associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Among daily, long-term
users (>5 years) of LES-relaxing drugs, the estimated incidence rate ratio was
3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2–6.4) compared with individuals who had never used these
drugs.  Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
were not associated with use of LES-relaxing drugs.[
15
]
There exists a strong relationship between body mass index (BMI) and esophageal
adenocarcinoma.  The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 7.6 (95% CI, 3.8–15.2) among
individuals in the highest BMI quartile compared with individuals in the lowest.  Individuals with obesity (those with BMI >30 kg/m
2
) had an OR of 16.2 (95% CI, 6.3–41.4), compared with those with the leanest BMI (BMI <22 kg/m
2
).  Esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma was not associated with BMI.[

Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus
Squamous Cell Cancer
Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus does not have a highly prevalent
predisposing condition, although the incidence increases in individuals who have
had long-standing exposure to tobacco and alcohol,[
1
] achalasia,[
2
] head and
neck squamous cell cancer attributable most likely to long-standing alcohol
and/or tobacco exposure,[
3
] tylosis,[
4
,
5
] history of lye ingestion,[
6
] celiac
sprue,[
7
] and, in South America and China, hot liquid ingestion.[
8
]  The
etiological role of human papillomavirus infection in squamous cell cancer is
under study.[
9
,
10
]
Efforts at early detection of squamous cell cancer of the esophagus have
concentrated on cytological or endoscopic screening of populations in countries
where there is a high incidence.  While these programs have demonstrated
that it is possible to detect squamous cell cancers at an early asymptomatic
stage, a study from China assessed one-time endoscopic screening on the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer.  In this study, communities were chosen nonrandomly in Cixian County, Hibei Province; 14 villages in the north were intervention communities and ten villages in the south were control communities.  The intervention was one-time endoscopy, completed by experts, using Lugol’s iodine staining to identify dysplasia or occult cancer. After biopsy was obtained and read, dysplasia and occult cancers were treated by endoscopic mucosal resection or argon plasma coagulation.  Among the 6,827 participants aged 40 to 69 years in the intervention group, 3,319 volunteers were screened.  Among the 6,200 participants aged 40 to 69 years in the control group, 797 individuals were interviewed.  Outcome in each group was monitored to assess incidence and mortality of esophageal squamous cancer.  In a 10-year follow-up, there were 542 cases of fatal esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a reduction in cumulative mortality from 5.05% in the control group to 3.35% in the intervention group (
P
< .001), and lower incidence of ESCC in the intervention group (5.92% vs. 4.17%;
P
< .001).  Potential weaknesses of the study include the following:[
11
]
Participants were not randomly assigned but rather came from different villages, in which underlying rates may have differed geographically (northern vs. southern villages), and it was not clear what the baseline cancer rates were.
It was not clear whether cause of death (e.g., ESCC) or cancer incidence was assessed in a blinded manner, which might have been important for assignment of what is a subjective assessment.
Esophageal cytological screening studies have been reported from China,[
12
,
13
]
Iran,[
14
] South Africa,[
15
,
16
] Italy,[
17
] and Japan.[
18
]  In the United States,
such efforts have been focused on individuals perceived to be at higher
risk.[
19
,
20
]  Studies of primary endoscopic screening have been reported from
France [
21
] and Japan.[
22
]
Comparisons of both Chinese and U.S. cytological diagnoses with concurrent
histological findings showed low (14%  to 36%) sensitivities for the cytological
detection of biopsy-proven cancers.  Specificity ranged from 90% to 99% with a
positive predictive value of 23% to 94%.[
23
]  The development of uniform and
accurate cytological criteria will require formal cytological-histological
correlation studies of esophageal lesions.  Such studies should become more
feasible with the increasing availability of endoscopy in high-risk
populations.
The efficacy of surveillance cytology or endoscopy for high-risk patients with
tylosis or long-standing achalasia is not known.
Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus
Considerable debate has ensued concerning the risk of cancer in patients with Barrett 
esophagus.  Prospective studies have reported annual esophageal cancer
incidence rates ranging from 0.2% to 1.9%.[
24
]  Concern over publication bias
has led some authors to suggest that the risk may be lower than the literature 
suggests.[
25
]  A risk of 0.5% per year for development of adenocarcinoma is now
thought to be a reasonable estimate for Barrett  esophagus.[
26
]
Barrett   esophagus is strongly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD), and the changes of Barrett esophagus can be found in approximately
10% of patients who have GERD.  However, GERD is very common. Surveys have
found that approximately 20% of adult Americans experience symptoms of GERD,
such as heartburn, at least once each week.[
27
]  The likelihood of finding
Barrett esophagus on endoscopy is related to the duration of symptoms of
gastroesophageal reflux.  In a series of 701 individuals, 4% of those with 
symptoms for less than 1 year had Barrett   esophagus on endoscopy, whereas
Barrett esophagus was found in 21% of those with more than 10 years of
symptoms of GERD.  It has been estimated that physicians identify only
approximately 5% of the population who have Barrett esophagus.[
28
]      There is insufficient evidence that population screening for Barrett esophagus reduces cancer mortality.[
29
,
30
]
Surveillance of Barrett  esophagus involves the use of tests to identify
preneoplastic changes or curable neoplasms in patients who are known to have
Barrett   esophagus.  Certain factors are essential in the implementation of an
effective surveillance protocol, including low risk of the surveillance method,
correct histological diagnosis of dysplasia, proof that surgical resection for
high-grade dysplasia will decrease the risk of cancer, and successful resection
of cancer.  The interval between endoscopic evaluations is typically determined
by histological findings, in accordance with published guidelines by
gastroenterological committees.[
31
]  GERD  should be treated before
surveillance endoscopy to minimize confusion caused by inflammation in the
interpretation of biopsy specimens.  The technique of random, four-quadrant
biopsies taken every 2 cm in the columnar-lined esophagus for standard
histological evaluation has been recommended by some clinicians.  For patients
with no dysplasia, surveillance endoscopy at an interval of every 2 to 3 years
has been recommended.[
31
]  For patients with low-grade dysplasia, surveillance
every 6 months for the first year has been recommended, followed by annual
endoscopy if the dysplasia has not progressed in severity.  For patients with
high-grade dysplasia, two options have been recommended: surgical
resection or repeated endoscopic evaluation until the diagnosis of intramucosal
carcinoma is made.  Although widely adopted in clinical practice, these
practices are based on uncontrolled series and the opinion of expert
gastrointestinal endoscopists and pathologists.
Other techniques to potentially identify dysplastic epithelium that could then
be sampled extensively include chromoendoscopy [
32
] and laser-induced
fluorescence spectroscopy.[

Evidence of Harm
Screening for esophageal cancer  by the use of blind nonendoscopically directed balloon cytological sampling for squamous cell carcinoma is minimally inconvenient and uncomfortable. Endoscopic screening for esophageal adenocarcinoma is expensive, inconvenient, and usually requires sedation.
Complications such as perforation and bleeding can occur. The incidence of complications, including perforation, respiratory arrest, and myocardial infarction, has been estimated to be 0 to 13 cases per 10,000 procedures with an associated mortality of 0 to 0.8 cases per 10,000 procedures.[

Individuals who are informed they have Barrett esophagus may consider themselves to be ill even though their risk of developing cancer is very low.
