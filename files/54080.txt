Quantification of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in the Detection of Prostate Cancer
With Contrast Enhanced UltraSound (CEUS) cancer induced neovascularisation can be visualised with the potential to improve ultrasound imaging for prostate cancer detection and localisation significantly. The past years numerous studies have been performed with CEUS, all basing their results on subjective judgement of the investigator. CEUS image interpretation is difficult and requires a well-trained expert. To overcome these difficulties CEUS quantification techniques can be of use. The techniques used in this protocol have been developed in cooperation with the Technical University in Eindhoven (TU/e) and BRACCO, Geneva.

The investigators hypothesize improvement of the PCa detection rate with quantification, compared with subjective CEUS interpretation and known numbers in literature.

Also a comparison between quantification results and tumour differentiation grade (Gleason score) will be made, the investigators hypothesize a positive correlation.
