A Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Intratumoral VCL-IM01 Followed by Electroporation in Metastatic Melanoma
To evaluate the safety of intratumorally injected VCL-IM01 at doses of 0.5 mg (1 tumor), 1.5 mg (1 tumor), 5 mg (1 tumor), 10 mg (2 tumors, 5 mg per tumor) and 15 mg (3 tumors, 5 mg per tumor) followed by electroporation.
Metastatic Melanoma
GENETIC: VCL-IM01 (encoding IL-2) with Electroporation
Safety of intratumorally injected VCL-IM01 followed by electroporation in subjects with recurrent metastatic melanoma, After all subjects have been enrolled
Overall response rate, duration of response, treated tumor response rate, assessment of injected tumor(s) for induration, inflammation, and erythema, and serum levels of IL-2., After all subjects have been enrolled
Eligible subjects will receive intratumoral injections of VCL-IM01 followed by electroporation of the injected tumor(s).

Subjects will be enrolled to receive one course of treatment. A course of treatment is two cycles, each cycle consisting of four weekly injection/electroporation administrations followed by an observation period of two weeks.

Subjects' tumors will be evaluated at Screening, at the end of Cycle 2, and at six months (Week 26) from the initial drug administration.
