Study of Safety and Tolerability of VLX600, an Iron Chelator, in Patients With Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.
Refractory Cancer
DRUG: VLX600
Assessment of adverse event (AE) profile, AEs are assessed from first treatment day through at least 30 days after last treatment.|Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600, MTD will be determined during dose escalation phase of study, up to one year.|Determination of the recommended Phase II dose (RPTD) of VLX600, Determination of RPTD will be based on adverse event profile, up to one year.
Description of the tumor response to VLX600 treatment, Tumor response will be determined using CT scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at pre-treatment, Cycle 2 Day 28, at every 8 weeks thereafter, and at off-study (if a scan has not been performed within the last prior 4 weeks). Patients in the MTD confirmation cohort only will have a pre-treatment baseline positron emission tomography- computerized tomography (PET-CT) scan and then at Cycle 2 Day 28. Tumor response will be determined by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In patients with disease not measurable by RECIST 1.1, blood samples for biomarkers of tumor response will be collected at pre-treatment baseline and then after every 8 weeks., Tumor response will be evaluated by CT scans or MRI at pre-treatment baseline and on Cycle 2 Day 28, then after every 8 weeks, and then at off-study (if greater than 4 weeks since prior tumor assessment).|Description of progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is calculated from date of first treatment until date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 200 days (through 6 treatment cycles).|Description of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of VLX600, Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis at the specified time points in Cycle 1 only., PK assessed in Cycle 1 only. Day 1: pre-dose, 15, 30, 60 min, and 2, 4, 4.25, 4.5, 5, 8 hrs post start of infusion. Day 2: 24 hr post-start of infusion. Day 8: pre-dose, Day 15 (same as Day 1), Day 16: 24 hr post-start of infusion, and Day 22: pre-dose|Description of overall survival., Overall survival will be determined from date of first study treatment until death due to any cause, up to 72 weeks (duration of study).
This Phase I, open label dose escalation study of VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors will determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600 when administered by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Dose escalation will proceed according to the standard "3 + 3" design using doubling doses. The doses are: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600.
