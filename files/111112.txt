Study of MK-8242 Alone and in Combination With Cytarabine in Participants With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (P07649)
This is a study of MK-8242 alone and in combination with cytarabine in adult participants with refractory or recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The study will have 2 Arms. Arm A is for participants with refractory or recurrent AML who are considered ineligible for standard chemotherapy. In Part 1 of Arm A, participants will receive MK-8242 monotherapy in escalating doses to determine the recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]. In Part 2, participants will receive monotherapy with MK-8242 to confirm the RP2D and assess preliminary efficacy. Arm B is for participants with recurrent AML following an initial complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) of 6 to 12 months duration. In Part 1 of Arm B, participants will receive MK-8242 in escalating doses + cytarabine to determine the RP2D in combination with cytarabine. In Part 2, participants will receive MK-8242 + cytarabine to confirm the RP2D and assess preliminary efficacy. The pharmacokinetics of MK-8242 will be studied in both arms. With Amendment 4 (22 August 2013) a 21-day dosing cycle is added, with MK-8242 being given on Days 1-7 of each 21-day cycle in both the monotherapy and combination therapy arms; data from Arm A will be used to determine whether a participant receives 21-day or 28-day therapy in Arm B.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: MK-8242
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were identified using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0 for toxicities attributable to the study drug. Hematologic DLTs were defined in the absence of morphological evidence of acute leukemia in the marrow if 1) bone marrow: aplastic marrow with \<5% cellularity without erythroid, myeloid, or megakaryocytic precursors and 2) peripheral blood: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<100/µL, platelet count \<10,000/µL, and transfusion-dependent anemia. Non-hematologic DLTs were defined as any ≥Grade 3 toxicity with the following exceptions/clarifications: 1) infection, fatigue, anorexia, or alopecia are not included in determination of the DLT 2) Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration occurring in a setting of inadequate treatment 3) any abnormal non-hematological laboratory value ≥Grade 3 will be considered a DLT after 72 hours of appropriate medical intervention if not related to an underlying disease or not attributable to another event., Up to 28 days (Cycle 1) for non-hematologic toxicities and 42 days (Cycle 1) for hematologic toxicities|Number of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) at RP2D, Clinical activity of MK-8242 given as monotherapy in participants with refractory or recurrent AML measured as participants who achieved CR according to Cheson (2003) criteria at the RP2D.

Number of Participants With CR at Dose Levels Other Than RP2D, Clinical activity of MK-8242 given as monotherapy in participants with refractory or recurrent AML measured as participants who achieved CR according to Cheson (2003) criteria at dose levels other than RP2D. CR is defined as a morphologic leukemia-free state with a neutrophil count ≥1,000/µL, a platelet count ≥100,000/µL, no extramedullary disease, and RBC transfusion independence.
