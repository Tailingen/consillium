INCMGA00012 in Combination With Chemoradiation in Participants With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (POD1UM-301)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of INCMGA00012 in combination with chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in participants with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will randomize approximately 360 participants in a 2:1 ratio into the INCMGA00012 in combination with CRT followed by consolidation therapy with INCMGA00012 treatment group and placebo in combination with CRT followed by consolidation therapy with placebo treatment group.
