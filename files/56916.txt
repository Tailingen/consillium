Analysis of Screen-detected Lung Cancers' Genomic Traits
Prospective, observational cohort study of patients undergoing surgical resection for low dose CT (LDCT) screen-detected lung cancer (detected through the SUMMIT study- ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03934866/ lung screening programmes), in which translational research is a fundamental aspect.
Lung Cancer
Genomic exploratory research, Measuring the differences in chromosomal instability between fast- and slow-growing screen detected cancers, quantified by weighted genome integrity index (WGII) derived from whole exome sequencing (WES) data, 4 years
The ASCENT study seeks to examine the genomic signatures of screen-detected cancers, in order to categorise the biological behaviour of such lesions and correlate this against non-invasive biological and radiological parameters. From these data, the plan is to explore strategies to characterise LDCT-detected cancers through non-invasive means, which the researchers believe may prove key in mitigating potential screening-associated harms.
