Precision Cancer Therapy in Rare Cancers
Some rare cancers are hard-to-treat and patients have a poor prognosis. It is known that some of these patients have targetable molecular alterations, and some benefit from targeted drugs. However in many cases these drugs are not approved for the rare cancers.

In this study the aim is to do advanced molecular diagnostics to identify possible targets for therapy, and to treat accordingly.
Rare Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Dabrafenib
Radiological response evaluation at 16 weeks of treatment, Standard radiological response evaluation, like RECIST criteria., 16 weeks
Molecular analyses predicting responses, Sequencing of tumor material and blood samples, 2 years
All patients will have the tumour cells diagnosed with a large genepanel, analyzing more than 500 genes on DNA / RNA level. Patients will be treated based on the molecular characteristics of the tumor cells.
