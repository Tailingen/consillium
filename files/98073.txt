Id and Rd Maintenance Regimens After Induction of Remission in Multiple Myeloma.
Newly Diagnosed Myeloma Patients, who achieved efficacy above VGPR (very good PR)after initial treatment were enrolled. Patients were then randomly assigned to Id and Rd groups for maintenance treatment. Therapeutic effectiveness will be reviewed monthly until intolerant side effect or disease progression appear . The follow-up period is approximately 2 years.
Progression Free Survival|Overall Survival|Maintenance
DRUG: Ixazomib DX/Lenalidomide DX
the percentage of 2 year PFS(progression-free survival), the percentage of the patients whose disease do not appear progression at the end of 2years maintenance from each group., from randomization to the end of 2years maintenance.
OS(overall survival), OS of the either group patients, from duration from the randomization to the end of 2years maintenance
side effect, side effect of each group within 2 years of maintenance, from randomization to the end of 2years maintenance
Newly Diagnosed Myeloma Patients, who achieved efficacy above VGPR after initial treatment were enrolled. Patients were then randomly assigned to Id and Rd groups for maintenance treatment. Therapeutic effectiveness will be reviewed monthly until intolerant side effect or disease progression appear . The follow-up period is approximately 2 years. Progression-free survival (PFS)was defined as the duration from randomization to the first evidence of disease progression or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration from the randomization to death from any cause. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to plot the survival curves, with the log-rank test to assess the differences.
