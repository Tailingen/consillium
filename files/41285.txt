Study of Capecitabine In Patients With Solid Tumors
Hypothesis:

Patients with TYMS 2R/2R or 2R/3R appear to be more sensitive to fluoropyrimidines, conferring a higher risk of grade 3-4 fluoropyrimidine related toxicity and a higher response rate compared with 3R/3R. The genotype 3R/3R is more common in East Asia and is associated with greater tolerability to fluoropyrimidine as measured by lower toxicity but also lower response rates. As sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine appears to be affected by TYMS genotype, we hypothesise that patients with TYMS 3R/3R are more tolerant to standard doses of capecitabine and require higher doses to overcome fluoropyrimidine resistance. We designed this study to develop TYMS genotype specific dosing of capecitabine.

Aims:

1. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine twice a day for two weeks followed by one week rest period (intermittent schedule) in patients with the advanced/ and or metastatic cancer based on TYMS genotype.
2. To determine a suitable phase II dose of intermittent schedule capecitabine.
3. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen.
4. To perform plasma pharmacokinetics of capecitabine.
5. To determine the relationship between genes of relevance in the fluoropyrimidine pathway with pharmacokinetics and toxicity.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Capecitabine
To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine twice a day for two weeks followed by one week rest period (intermittent schedule) in patients with the advanced/ and or metastatic cancer based on TYMS genotype., 4 weeks
Plasma concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites, Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed during cycle 1 on days 1 and 14 at the following time points:

Baseline (predose), and 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr and 6 hr after dosing. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 1500 g and 4oC for 10 min and supernatant plasma removed and stored below -20oC until analysis. Plasma concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites will be quantified by a validated liquid chromatography with mass-spectrometry detection (LC-MS-MS) method, 3 weeks
