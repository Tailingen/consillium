Phase 1-2 Study of Low Dose ASTX727 (ASTX727 LD) in Lower Risk MDS
Multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to assess safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic response in subjects with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS. This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase 1 subjects will be randomized into 3 cohorts in a 28-day cycles. Phase 2, 80 new subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 doses/schedules.

A Phase 1-2, multicenter, open-label study of various ASTX727 LD doses and schedules to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and hematologic response in subjects with IPSS risk category of low-risk or Intermediate-1 MDS. The study will be conducted in 2 phases.

Phase 1: In Stage A, subjects will be randomized into 3 cohorts of 6 subjects each testing different doses of oral decitabine with cedazuridine in 28-day cycles. When safety has been established in Phase 1 Stage A, Phase 1 Stage B will open, wherein additional 30 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 cohorts of 10 subjects.

Phase 2: Using 2 doses/schedules one of which will be selected from Phase 1, 40 additional subjects per dose/schedule will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The selected doses/schedules will be evaluated for safety (drug-related AEs), efficacy (including hematologic response), PD (long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1 methylation, and fetal hemoglobin as fraction of total hemoglobin), and PK.
