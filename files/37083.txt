CD123-Targeted CAR-T Cell Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CD123 CAR-T cells may have an attractive and permanent effect on anti-tumor. This study purpose to estimate the safety and efficiency of CD123 CAR-T cells to patients with relapse/refractory AML.

CD123 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is a ideal target for CAR-T. Some researches have revealed that CD123 is a marker of leukemia stem cells, which indicates that the eradication of CD123 cells may prevent relapse of leukemia. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting CD123 in patients with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease status after treatment.
