Proton Boost in Prostate Cancer
This study uses photon radiation with a proton boost to treat prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if proton therapy as a boost following photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) produces decreased toxicity as compared to conventional photon IMRT alone in the treatment of prostate cancer. Our secondary objective is to determine the effectiveness of this treatment regimen. Effectiveness will be determined by length of time to progression or recurrence of disease and overall survival. Patients on this study will be treated with a course of photon radiation therapy followed by a boost course of proton radiation.
