Safety Study of DNA Vaccine Delivered by Intradermal Electroporation to Treat Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a CEA DNA immunisation approach in patients with colorectal cancer. The DNA plasmid, tetwtCEA, encodes wild type human CEA fused to a tetanus toxoid T helper epitope. The vaccine will be delivered using an intradermal electroporation device, Derma Vax (Cyto Pulse Sciences). The following will be assessed:

* The efficiency of priming immunological responses to CEA by intradermal administration of CEA DNA in combination with electroporation.
* The efficiency of boosting immunological responses to CEA by intradermal administration of CEA DNA in combination with electroporation in subjects already vaccinated with CEA DNA.
* GM-CSF will be administered to half of the subjects primed with CEA DNA in combination with electroporation and any possible adjuvant effects of GM-CSF will be evaluated.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: tetwtCEA DNA (wt CEA with tetanus toxoid Th epitope)|DEVICE: Derma Vax (electroporation device)|BIOLOGICAL: GM-CSF|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA immunisation approach where tetwtCEA DNA will be administered in combination with electroporation., Within 72 weeks after immunisation
To assess the efficiency of boosting immunological responses to CEA by intradermal administration of tetwtCEA DNA in combination with electroporation in subjects already vaccinated with CEA DNA, Within 72 weeks after immunisation|To compare effects (safety and immunogenicity) of additional adjuvance with GM-CSF, Within 72 weeks after immunsation
