Study of TF2 Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) Antibody in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study is being done to select an appropriate TF2 bsMAb dose suitable for pretargeting the 111In/90Y-labeled hapten-peptide (IMP-288). Eligible patients will receive a fixed dose of 90Y-IMP-288 4 days after the TF2 antibody injection. Two different dose levels of TF2 will be studied in the first part.

Once an appropriate TF2 dose is selected based on information learned from the first 2 dose levels, patients will be enrolled onto several different increasing dose levels of 90Y-IMP-288.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: TF2/IMP288
Determine the number of adverse events, Safety will be assessed by determing the number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability., Safety will be measured routinely during the 3 weeks of administration and afterwards during follow-up for up to 5 years
Efficacy will be evaluating using CT scans and possibly PET imaging., CT scans will primarily be used to assess tumor response and to assess the change in tumor size from baseline for up to 2 years., Efficacy will be measured at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment and every 3 months for up to 2 years.
