To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of QL1206 and Xgeva in Patients With Bone Metastases From Solid Tumors
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparative study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of QL1206 and Xgeva® in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
Bone Metastases
DRUG: QL1206|DRUG: Xgeva
uNTx/uCr, Compare QL1206 and Xgeva® for percentage change in bone conversion index (BTM) - urinary type I collagen cross-linked peptide (uNTx) adjusted for urinary creatinine (uCr) in Chinese subjects with solid tumor bone metastasis (uNTx/uCr from baseline to week 13), from baseline to week 13
uNTx/uCr, Compare the percentage change in QL1206 and Xgeva® for bone conversion indicator uNTx/uCr among subjects with solid tumor metastasis (from baseline to weeks 25 and 53)., from baseline to weeks 25 and 53|S-BALP, Compare the changes of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (S-BALP) from baseline to weeks 13, 25, and 53., from baseline to weeks 13, 25, and 53|SRE, SRE occurrence, from baseline to weeks 53
This is A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial.

The primary objective is to evaluate whether the clinical efficacy of QL1206 and Xgeva® are similar in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.

The secondary objective are to evaluate whether the clinical safety and immunogenicity of QL1206 and Xgeva® are similar in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
