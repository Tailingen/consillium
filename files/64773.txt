Placebo-controlled Evaluation of Ropivacaine Efficacy by Local Infiltrations
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and impact on morphine consumption of ropivacaine administered by local per and post hepatic surgery infiltration.

Patients will be randomized to either ropivacaine or physiological serum, with equivalent administration modalities in both arms.

Patients will be followed during 4 days after the surgery. They will also come back for a follow-up visit one month later.

It is necessary to enrol 100 patients. The estimated period of inclusion is 24 months.

This is a prospective, comparative, monocentric, double-blind randomized study.
