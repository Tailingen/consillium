A Study to Evaluate Lucitanib in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With a Solid Tumor
This is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the recommended dose of lucitanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with an advanced solid tumor (Phase 1b); followed by evaluation of the safety and efficacy of lucitanib and nivolumab in patients with an advanced gynecological solid tumor (Phase 2) and evaluate the effects of dosing under fasting or fed state (Food Effect)
