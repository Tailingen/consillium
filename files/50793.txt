Test of CD47-SIRPα Inhibitors on the Immune Microenvironment Colon Cancer
Our goal is to create novel CD47-SIRPα inhibitors using small molecules to reverse TAM-mediated immune suppression and restore anti-tumor immunity in CRCs. Our program uses structure-based drug design to create selective and potent small molecule inhibitors of SIRPα-CD47 to target the tumor microenvironment with greater efficacy and lower toxicity than CD47-targeting antibodies. .

In order to study the activity of CD47-SIRPα inhibitors on the immune microenvironment of tumors, we propose to use organoids derived from biopsies of patients with colon cancer. Tumoroids preserve the patient's tumor stroma (including myeloid cells) and provide an accurate in vitro model of complex tumor immune interaction for the evaluation of immunotherapies.
Cancer of the Colon
PROCEDURE: BLOOD AND TUMOR
Establishment of patient derived organoids (minimum n=30) resembling the primary tissue sample, the capacity to establish patient-derived organoids from tumor and adjacent normal tissue will be evaluated using a histology score evaluating and comparing primary and organoid sample characteristics., 18 months from study launch
Establishment of a validated cryobank of patient derived organoids (minimum n=30), the capacity to establish a cryobank of patient-derived organoids from tumor and adjacent normal tissue will be evaluated using a growth score evaluating and comparing organoid sample characteristics pre- and post-cryopreservation and amplification through 4 passages., 18 months from study launch|Generate a T cell biobank by FACS isolating T cells using the CD3 surface marker directed against the human form, 48 month|To assess the effect of immunotherapy on the antitumor activity of autologous T cells from peripheral blood samples using tumor viability measurements (cell titer glo, FACS), 48 month
