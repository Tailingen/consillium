68Ga-PSMA PET-CT Scan for Diagnosis and Management of Prostate Cancer
This is a phase II clinical trial study to show how well the 68Ga-PSMA-11 (ProstaMedixâ„¢) PET-CT scan works in detecting tumor location and size in patients with suspected or confirmed prostate cancer, as well as prostate cancer that may have come back in patients with elevated PSA ( a prostate-specific antigen tumor marker) after initial treatment.

68Ga-PSMA-11 is a radioactive imaging contrast agent for use in PET CT scan that seeks to identify prostate cancer cells that have a specific protein target called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on their surface. PET and CT make computerizing pictures of areas inside the body where the radioactive substance is lighting up. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET / CT may be able to see smaller tumors than standard imaging and may help determine whether prostate cancer has come back and where it is in the body.

A 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET / CT scan may help doctors to better detect the location, extent, and characteristics of the tumor, allowing improved planning of subsequent therapy
