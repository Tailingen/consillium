A Study of Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Combination With Fulvestrant Compared to Chemotherapy in Women With HR Positive, HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
The reason for this study is to compare the efficacy of abemaciclib, in combination with fulvestrant, to that of physician's choice of chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer that has spread to internal organs. Your participation in this trial could last up to 31 months, depending on your cancer type and how you and your tumor respond.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Standard Chemotherapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of participants randomized to the corresponding treatment arm \[intent-to-treat (ITT) population\], based on investigator-assessed tumor responses.CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking in reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Confirmations of CR and PR are not required., Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease (Up to 12 Months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the first occurrence of documented disease progression per Response Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause in the absence of progressive disease. Progression-free survival will be based on investigator-assessed tumor responses; there will not be an independent central review of imaging data., First Dose Date to Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 12 Months)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from first dose date until the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., First Dose to Date of CR or PR (Up to 12 Months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or documented disease progression is observed, per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of documented disease progression or recurrence., Date of CR or PR to Date of Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 12 Months)|Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS 2), PFS 2 is defined as the time from first dose date to the disease progression date on next line (first line of post-discontinuation treatment), or starting date of the second line of post-discontinuation treatment or death from any cause, whichever is earlier, or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., Randomization to Second Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 12 Months)
