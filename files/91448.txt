A Phase I Study of Lyso-thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin and MR-HIFU for Pediatric Refractory Solid Tumors
This study is looking to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD) administered in combination with MR-HIFU in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors, which may include but are not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.

Maximum tolerated dose of LTLD, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LTLD administered in combination with MR-HIFU ablation in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors by examining blood samples collected from participants, 3 weeks|Toxicity profile of LTLD, To define and describe the toxicities of LTLD administered in combination with MR-HIFU as measured by reportable adverse events of participants as per the CTCAE v 4.0, up to 18 weeks|Pharmacokinetics of LTLD, Analyze blood samples of participants to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of LTLD administered in combination with MR-HIFU, 8 days|Feasibility of treatment, To determine the feasibility of LTLD administered at the recommended dose in combination with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia (MHT) as determined by patient outcomes and adverse events, up to 18 weeks
Antitumor Activity of the Treatment, To preliminarily determine the antitumor activity of LTLD with MR-HIFU within the confines of a phase 1 study by examining the response of target lesions using RECIST criteria v1.1, up to 18 weeks|Social Impact of the Treatment on Participants, To determine changes in symptoms and quality of life in children treated with LTLD and MR-HIFU by administering the Symptom Distress Scale and Peds QL v4.0 to participants, up to 18 weeks|Determine the Changes in Pharmacodynamic Immune Markers in Participants, To determine the changes in immune markers in children treated with LTLD and MR-HIFU by examining blood samples from participants, 3 weeks
This is phase 1 trial of LTLD with MR-HIFU induced heating in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.

Part A of the trial will be a traditional dose escalation study to determine the pediatric MTD/RP2D of LTLD combined with MR-HIFU ablation which allows for release of doxorubicin in the ablation zone and peri-ablation margins.

Part B of the trial will combine LTLD at the MTD/RP2D with MR-HIFU induced mild hyperthermia (MHT) in an expanded cohort.
