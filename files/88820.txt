QUILT-3.034: Non-Myeloablative TCRa/b Deplete Haplo HSCT With Post ALT-803 for AML
This is a phase II multi-institutional therapeutic study of a non-myeloablative T cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta depleted haploidentical transplantation with post-transplant immune reconstitution using ALT-803 for the treatment of high-risk myeloid leukemia (AML), treatment-related/secondary AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
