An Observational Study to Assess the Effectiveness and Safety of a Cemiplimab in Adult Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Routine Clinical Practice Settings in Europe
This study is focused on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and have been prescribed a cemiplimab (LibtayoÂ®) based treatment regimen under standard care.

The goal of this study is to learn more about the use, benefits, and safety of cemiplimab based treatment regimens in participants with NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Platinum-based chemotherapy
Overall survival (OS), Date and primary cause of death, Up to 72 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial as the physician-reported best overall response., Up to 72 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined among responders (patients with a complete response or partial response) as the time from the date of the first response after cemiplimab treatment initiation until the first date of disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 72 months|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the time from the first cemiplimab dose until the date of first response observed for that patient. Patients who die during the study will be censored using the date of the last valid disease assessment)., Up to 72 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first dose of cemiplimab until the date of the first documented tumour progression or death due to any cause., Up to 72 months|Time to first subsequent anti-NSCLC treatment (TTST), Defined as the time from the first cemiplimab dose until the date of the first subsequent anti-NSCLC treatment., Up to 72 months|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TR-AEs) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with a cemiplimab-based regimen in routine clinical practice, Number of patients with treatment related adverse events occurring during treatment, Up to 72 months|Incidence of treatment-related serious adverse events (TR-SAEs) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with a cemiplimab-based regimen in routine clinical practice, Number of patients with serious treatment related adverse events occurring during treatment, Up to 72 months|Incidence and severity of immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with a cemiplimab-based regimen in routine clinical practice, Number of patients with immune-mediated adverse events and serious immune-mediated adverse events occurring during treatment, Up to 72 months|Incidence and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with a cemiplimab-based regimen in routine clinical practice, Number of patients with infusion related reactions and serious infusion related reactions adverse events occurring during treatment, Up to 72 months
Originally registered as OBS17104 by Sanofi; transitioned to REGN 05Jul2023.

The recruitment period will be 48 months. Data will be collected during routine clinical visits approximately every three months while the patient is on cemiplimab treatment and then approximately every six months for up to 24 months after cemiplimab discontinuation. Patients will be followed from cemiplimab treatment initiation until death, loss to follow-up, study withdrawal, or to the end of the study period (72 months after study launch), whichever occurs first.
