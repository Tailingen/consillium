A Study of SHR6390 in Combination With Letrozole or Anastrozole or Fulvestrant in Patients With HR Positive and HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a phase IB/II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR6390 in combination with Letrozole or Anastrozole or Fulvestrant. Patients who have HR positive and HER2 negative recurrent/metastatic breast cancer and have not received systemic anticancer therapy are eligible for study.
