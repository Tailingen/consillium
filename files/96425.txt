The Efficacy and Safety Study of Tung's Acupuncture for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
This study evaluates the efficacy and safety in improving ovarian function of polycystic ovarian syndrome in adults. Half of patients will receive Tung's acupuncture therapy, while the other half will receive Diane-35(CPA/EE) as the control group.

Both Tung's acupuncture therapy and Diane-35(CPA/EE) could improve the symptom of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but until now there is no definite evidence to indicate acupuncture could play the same role in improving ovarian function. So we design this study to observe the change of follicular development, ovary size and sex hormone( testosterone, follitropin, luteinizing hormone) before and after the treatment, and evaluate the efficacy and safty of acupuncture.
