Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With Toripalimab and Lenvatinib in the Treatment of Short-term Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
This study is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, open-design phase II clinical study, mainly to explore the clinical effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency ablation combined with anti-PD-1 antibody toripalimab and lenvatinib in patients with short-term recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Recurrent Hepatocellular Cancer
DRUG: toripalimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DEVICE: Radiofrequency ablation
RFS, Recurrence-free survival time, up to 36 months
safety, Adverse event rate, 24 months|TTR, time to recurrence, up to 36 months|1-year RFS%, 1-year recurrence-free survival rate, 12 months|OS, overall survival, 2025|1-year OS%, 1-year overall survival rate, 12 months|2-year OS%, 2-year overall survival rate, 24 months
Primary endpoint: Recurrence-free survival time (RFS). Secondary endpoints: safety (incidence of adverse events); time to recurrence (TTR); time to local recurrence (TTLR); 12-month recurrence-free survival rate; overall survival (OS); 12 months and 24 Month overall survival rate.

Treatment plan: Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation, 3-5 days after radiofrequency ablation, lenvatinib 12 mg (body weight â‰¥ 60 kg) or 8 mg (body weight \<60 kg) orally, once a day; toripalimab is a fixed dose of 240 mg, once every 3 weeks, intravenous infusion on the first day of each cycle, the infusion time is no less than 60 minutes.Combination therapy until tumor recurrence, disease progression, death or intolerable toxicity occurs.
