Capecitabine, Tucatinib, and Intrathecal Trastuzumab for Breast Cancer Patients with Leptomeningeal Disease
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tucatinib and capecitabine in combination with intrathecal trastuzumab on overall survival rate at 12 months in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with proven leptomeningeal evolution and requiring intrathecal therapy.

overall survival rate at 12 months, 12-month overall survival will be defined as the proportion of patients alive 12 months after treatment initiation., 12 months
Clinical neurological symptoms relief, Clinical neurological symptoms relief will be defined as complete or partial diminution of symptoms associated to leptomeningeal metastasis using the neurologic assessment in neuro-oncology (NANO) scale, a standardized questionnaire designed to measure neurological function in oncology.

The questionnaire includes 5 domains scored 0-3 (gait, strength, visual fields, language, and level of consciousness) and 4 domains scored 0-2 (ataxia of upper extremities, sensation, facial strength, and behavior). Scores are sum up to a maximum of 23 points with high-scale values representing impaired neurological performances., At baseline, every week during treatment up to 18 months then every 9 weeks up to 42 months|Progression free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival (PFS) is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From inclusion to disease progression or death, up to 42 months|Overall survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) is the length of time from inclusion in the study that patients are still alive., From inclusion to death from any cause; up to 42 months|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, every 3 weeks during treatment up to 18 months then every 9 weeks up to 42 months|Quality of Life Questionnaire - Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN20), This EORTC brain cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The QLQ-BN20 contains 20 items organized into four scales (three items each: future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, and communication deficit), and seven single items (headaches, seizures, drowsiness, hair loss, itchy skin, weakness of legs, and bladder control). All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms., At baseline, every 3 weeks during treatment up to 18 months then every 9 weeks up to 42 months|Intra-cerebrospinal fluid response at 4 weeks, Intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) response at 4 weeks will be defined by absence, evaluated by the cytologist, of tumor cells in the intra-cerebrospinal fluid of the patient., 4 weeks|Duration of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) response, Duration of LM response is the length of time from first intracranial objective response and disease progression.

For this outcome, disease progression is defined as the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the leptomeningeal metastases but they does not get worse., From inclusion to disease LM progression or death, up to 42 months|Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used screening assessment for detecting cognitive dysfunctions.

The test is a 30-point test assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration (5 points), executive functions (4 points), memory (2 points), language (5 points), visuospatial skills (4 points), conceptual thinking (1 point), calculations (3 points), and orientation (6 points). MoCA scores range between 0 and 30, a score of 26 or over is considered normal., At baseline, every 3 weeks during treatment up to 18 months then every 9 weeks up to 42 months|Toxicity during the study, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 42 months
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of tucatinib and capecitabine in combination with intrathecal trastuzumab on overall survival rate at 12 months in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with proven leptomeningeal evolution and requiring intrathecal therapy.
