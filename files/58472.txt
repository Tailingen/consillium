Hormonal Therapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Prostatectomy in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This is a study for men who have locally-advanced prostate cancer and are eligible to undergo prostatectomy. Standard treatment is prostatectomy alone, but there is a chance that cancer may spread to other organs in the future, even after the prostate is removed. If this were to occur, standard treatment would be androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; hormone therapy that blocks testosterone) plus chemotherapy. Clinical trials suggest that neoadjuvant treatment (treatment given before primary therapy) may prevent a recurrence. The purpose of this research study is to assess the safety and benefit of ADT plus chemotherapy given before prostate removal.

DRUG: Degarelix|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Ketoconazole|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Estramustine
Efficacy as Measured by Pathologic Response, Pathologic response is defined by percentage of tumor burden remaining at time of prostate removal. Percentage of tumor burden is measured based on a pathologist's assessment of the prostate tissue removed and visual estimate of how much tumor there is in the prostate., Day of prostate removal, which is about 5 months following the day participant signed consent.
Efficacy as Measured by Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Levels, Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood., baseline|Efficacy as Measured by Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Levels, Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland.

This is an open-label, single-arm study of neoadjuvant ADT and chemotherapy in subjects with non-metastatic, locally-advanced prostate cancer who are eligible for radical prostatectomy.

Patients will be treated with 4 monthly injections of degarelix along with two 8-week cycles of chemotherapy. Each cycle of chemotherapy will consist of 6 weeks of chemotherapy and 2 weeks of rest. In the absence of toxicity or disease progression, patients will receive 2 cycles of treatment prior to radical prostatectomy.

The primary endpoint will be complete or near-complete pathologic response.

Safety will be assessed on any patient receiving at least one dose of study drug by the reporting of adverse events, vital signs and by the assessment of findings on physical exam and routine safety laboratory determinations. The severity of adverse events and certain abnormal laboratory findings will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE V4.03.

Laboratory-based studies will evaluate the following:

* Complete metabolic profile

  o BUN, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/AST, total bilirubin, LDH, calcium, albumin, glucose, magnesium, uric acid, phosphorous
* Electrolytes

  o Sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2 content
* Hematology

  * CBC with differential, platelet count
  * PT, INR, PTT
* Testosterone
* Biomarkers

  * PSA
  * CTCs
