A Phase I Study of LFA102 in Japanese Patients
This study will evaluate safety and tolerability to determine the MTD/RD.
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer, Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: LFA102
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Frequency and severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 1st treatment cycle (28 days)
Frequency, duration and severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Frequency, duration and severity of all AEs will be collected., at informed consent, until 28 days after treatment discontinuation|Serum Concentration, cycle 1 day 1 until disease progression|Objective Response Rate, Assessed based on RECIST/PCWG2 criteria, every 8 week or 12 weeks, until disase progression|Antibodies against LFA102, Serum concentration of antibodies against LFA102, day 1 of each treatment cycle until disease progression|Progression Free Survival, Assessed based on RECIST/PCWG2 criteria, every 8 or 12 weeks until disease progression|PK parameters, Cmax, Tmax, AUC, T1/2, CL and V, cycle 1 day 1 until disease progression
This is a phase I open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study in Japanese patients with CRPC or advanced BC. LFA102 will be administered intravenously once every 4 weeks during the study. All patients will remain on treatment until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation (e.g. disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal) or study closure.

This study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LFA102. Each cohort will enroll a minimum of 3 patients. A two-parameter Bayesian logistic regression model employing the escalation with overdose control principle will be used during the escalation phase for dose level selection and for determination of the MTD or RD.
