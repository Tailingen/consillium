Safety and Efficacy of R-CMOP Versus R-CHOP in the Initial Treatment of DLBCL
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R-CMOP versus R-CHOP in the initial treatment of low-risk and medium-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
