Study of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging in Patients With Suspected Recurrence of Prostate Cancer
This study evaluates the diagnostic performance and safety of 18F-DCFPyL (PyL) PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected recurrence of prostate cancer who have negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging.

Correct Localization Rate (CLR), The Correct Localization Rate (CLR) will be defined as percentage of participants with a one-to-one correspondence between localization of at least one lesion identified on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and the composite truth standard. Within 60 days following PyL PET/CT imaging, either biopsy/surgery, conventional imaging, or locoregional radiation therapy of the PyL-suspected lesion(s) will be performed., Within 60 days following 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging.
Percentage of Participants With a Change in Intended Prostate Cancer Treatment Plans Due to 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging Results., The change in the intended prostate cancer treatment plan will be based on Medical Management Questionnaires completed prior to and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging., Pre 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and within 60 days following 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging.|The Change From Pre- to Post- 18F-DCFPyl Dosing in Blood Pressure (Safety Outcome Measure), The recorded values and their respective changes from the pre-dose values will be summarized using descriptive statistics., Measured at 2 intervals on the day of dosing; the first interval prior to receiving the 18F-DCFPyL dose and the second interval within 60 to 120 minutes after dosing.|The Change From Pre- to Post- 18F-DCFPyL Dosing in Heart Rate (Safety Outcome Measure), The recorded values and their respective changes from the pre-dose values will be summarized using descriptive statistics., Measured at 2 intervals on the day of dosing; the first interval prior to receiving the 18F-DCFPyL dose and the second interval within 60 to 120 minutes after dosing.|Collection of Concomitant Medications (Safety Outcome Measure), Medications will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary. The medications are summarized by ATC level 4 category and presented as number and percentage of participants.

Results are presented where the percentage of participants within an ATC level 4 category is \>5.0., From the time of 18F-DCFPyL dosing to completion of the follow-up visit at 7 (±3) days after 18F-DCFPyL dosing.|Collection of Medical Procedures (Safety Outcome Measure), Procedures will be coded using the same version of MedDRA as for medical history. Medical procedures will be displayed as a listing by participant., From the time of 18F-DCFPyL dosing to completion of the follow-up visit at 7 (±3) days after 18F-DCFPyL dosing.
This study evaluates the diagnostic performance and safety of 18F-DCFPyL (PyL) PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected recurrence of prostate cancer who have negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging.
