A Randomized Phase II Trial of Surgery Plus Sorafenib vs. Sorafenib Alone for Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC) With Portal Vein Invasion
Patients with HCC with portal vein involvement not involving the bifurcation (vP1-vP3) and no evidence of extra-hepatic spread will be enrolled. Patients will be required to have Child's A liver function and no significant portal hypertension. Patients will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to either surgery followed by adjuvant sorafenib or sorafenib alone. Patients will be followed by serial imaging. The primary end-point is overall survival.
Hepatocellular Cancer
PROCEDURE: hepatic resection|DRUG: Sorafenib
overall survival, time from randomization to death, 2-3 year
progression free survival, time from initiation of intervention until progression as defined by RESIST, 3-12 months
Trial design

Surgery + sorafenib vs. sorafenib 100 patients per arm Centralized randomization by CRO Need to call CRO for treatment allocation Primary end-point - OS Secondary end-point Progression free survival (PFS) Randomized 1:1 Stratification Vp1-2 vs. Vp3 AFP â‰¤400 vs AFP \>400 Intention to treat Surgery aborted or R1-2 resection will remain in surgical arm No cross over CT scan chest/abdomen 4 weeks after surgery as post-operative baseline Will not alter treatment allocation Will allow for PFS measurement in surgical arm CT scan chest/abdomen pelvis Q 12 weeks after initiation sorafenib Patients progressing on sorafenib allowed 2nd line treatment Regorafenib or lenvatinib - if approved in China Dose reduction sorafenib as per protocol
