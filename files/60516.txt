Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers of Standard Anti-microtubule Drugs as Assessed by Early Tumor Biopsy
Eligible subjects will be assigned to study treatment arms by their treating oncologist, rather than by the study. The drug, dose, and schedule of administration will be determined by the treating physician per NCCN guidelines for standard of care chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Study treatment arms include: Taxane (nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel), Eribulin, Vinorelbine, Ixabepilone, or the control arm (non-microtubule targeted chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine).

Feasibility of measuring biomarkers in advanced breast tumors at 20 +/- 2 hours after chemotherapy, Advanced breast tumors safely sampled and analyzed from 35 subjects.

In order to successfully test the hypothesis that chromosomal instability in part governs the effect of antimitotic therapies, advanced breast tumors samples must be collected, preserved, and analyzed at 20+/- 2 hours after chemotherapy in order to characterize the effect of the drug on the tumor. A primary question becomes is this process safe and feasible within these time constraints in our clinical setting., Up to 22 hours
Measure intratumoral drug levels at 20 +/- 2 hours after chemotherapy, Tumor tissue and plasma samples taken at 20 hours will be assessed for drug levels by the University of Wisconsin 3P Lab., Up to 22 hours|Measure serum drug levels at 20 +/- 2 hours after chemotherapy, Tumor tissue and plasma samples taken at 20 hours will be assessed for drug levels by the University of Wisconsin 3P Lab., Up to 22 hours|Measure PBMC pharmacodynamics at 20 +/- 2 hours after chemotherapy, Tumor tissue and plasma samples taken at 20 hours will be assessed for drug levels by the University of Wisconsin 3P Lab., Up to 22 hours|Assess effects of mitosis and DNA damage response at 20 +/- 2 hours after chemotherapy, Mitotic index will be analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and liquid chromatography and ctDNA, Up to 22 hours|Correlate drug levels and cellular effects with response by RECIST 1:1 to chemotherapy, Summary statistics will be used to describe drug levels and cellular effects by response to chemotherapy, Up to 2 months following completion of study treatment OR upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later)|Assess genomic profile of metastatic breast cancer, This sequencing is measured to understand how changes in treatment response correlate to genomic profile., Up to 2 months following completion of study treatment OR upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later)|Feasibility of quantifying circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) 20 +/- 2 hours after administration of chemotherapy., This measurement is taken to understand if changes in ctDNA over the stated interval can be correlated to the treatment response and genomic profile from the 35 subjects., Up to 2 months following completion of study treatment OR upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later)|Explore differences in progression free survival (PFS) between chemotherapy arms., PFS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and measured from C1D1 until documented progression on imaging scan or death. Patients who do not experience documented progression during the study and are alive at last follow-up will be censored on the date of last imaging scan. Small sample statistical methods will be used to compare PFS curves by chemotherapy arm., Up to 2 months following completion of study treatment OR upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later)|Explore differences in response rate (RR) between chemotherapy arms., Response rate (RR) will be summarized by chemotherapy arm including 95% confidence intervals., Up to 2 months following completion of study treatment OR upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later)
During the screening visit, the following will be taken: medical history; physical exam; ECOG performance status; a pregnancy test if indicated per physician (confirmation of the clinical testing result or assessment of the treating physician whether or not the subject is capable of pregnancy); AST, ALT, CBC (per oncologist); 15 mL blood sample for drug level assessment; 15 mL blood sample for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); follow up assessments of cancer; RECIST 1.1 response measurements; and an archived FFPE sample (8 slides) will be obtained.

While enrolled on study, subjects will have the following procedures:

* 15 mL blood sample for drug level assessment on C1D2
* 15 mL blood sample for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) on C1D2 and at progression or end of study for a total of 30 mL
* Adverse events related to study procedures (research biopsy \& blood draws) will be assessed on C1D2 and at progression or end of study
* Toxicity evaluations will occur throughout the study per the treating MD
* Follow-up assessments of cancer will occur throughout the study per the treating MD
* RECIST 1.1 response measurements will be taken at standard of care imaging
* Fresh biopsy or tumor sampling (4 cores) for analysis of intratumoral drug levels and biomarkers including: markers of proliferation (mitotic index), aneuploidy, and sequencing analysis (ctDNA) on C1D2.

The tests being performed on the samples as part of this study are not investigational.

Subjects will be followed with imaging scans and tumor markers as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Follow-up scans will be recommended every \~3 cycles as per standard of care. Subjects will be followed for the duration of treatment initiated while taking part in this study. Follow-up will discontinue either 2 months following completion of planned breast cancer treatment or upon the systemic imaging following therapy completion (whichever is later).
