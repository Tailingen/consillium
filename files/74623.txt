A Phase I Study to Examine the Toxicity of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Relapsed or Therapy Refractory Ewing Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to examine the toxicity of using allogeneic stem cell transplantation for treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory Ewing Sarcoma (ES). Donors will consist of either Human Leukocyte Antigen identical (HLA)or 9/10 (A, B, C, DR, DQ \[A, B, C, are Class I markers for HLA and DR and DQ are Class II markers for Matching for Transplant for Donors to match with recipient\]) matched related or unrelated donors. Specifically, we will examine:

* The toxicity of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in this patient population, as related to incidence of grade 3-4 acute Graft Verse Host Disease (GVHD).
* The incidence of transplant related mortality at 100 days.
