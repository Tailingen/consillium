Molecularly Target Therapy With FORFIRINOX in Advanced or Recurrent Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of target therapy according to genomic and proteomic profiling combined with FORFIRINOX in advanced or recurrent extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma of the Extrahepatic Bile Duct|Gallbladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: conventional chemotherapy(FORFIRINOX) combined with target agents|BIOLOGICAL: conventional chemotherapy(FORFIRINOX)
Progression Free Survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year. The progression is defined consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria for solid tumors., up to 1 year
Genomic profiling studies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a tumor to detect genetic changes or abnormalities. immuno-histochemistry tests reveal the abnormal activation status of signal pathways involved in study.These information will be used to recommend target therapy which may be more likely to result in a beneficial response.Patients will receive target anti-tumor agents according to the result of genomic and proteomic profiling.
