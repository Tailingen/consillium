Comparison of ASCT and Conventional Chemotherapy in High Risk Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether autologous stem cell transplantation will improve the survival of patients with high-risk Waldenström macroglobulinemia, compared with conventional chemotherapy.
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
OTHER: autologous stem cell transplantation|OTHER: conventional chemotherapy
progress-free survival, up to 36 months
complete remission rate, up to 12 months
WM patients with partial response after introduction chemotherapy will be recommended to adopt autologous stem cell transplantation or receive conventional chemotherapy (dependent on patient's choices). After transplantation or conventional chemotherapy, maintenance therapy with rituximab or thalidomide plus prednisone will be given for less than two years.
