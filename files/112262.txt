A Study Evaluates the Safety and Efficacy of WX-0593 in ALK -Positive, or ROS1-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of WX-0593 oral tablets in ALK -positive, or ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: WX-0593 Tablets
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed By An Independent Review Committee, ORR is defined the percentage of the participants who are confirmed to have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per an Independent Review Committee (IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 after the initiation of study treatment., From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed By Investigators, ORR is defined the percentage of the participants who are confirmed to have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 after the initiation of study treatment., From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from baseline to first observed disease progression or death from any cause., From frist administration of WX-0593 until firstly recorded disease progression or death (whichever occurs earlier), or to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD)., From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first response CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) to the date on which progressive disease (PD) is first noted or date of death., From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks .|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to Progression, From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.|Confirmed Intracranial Objective Response Rate (iORR), Confirmed iORR is defined as the proportion of the participants who have achieved CR or PR in the brain per a modification of RECIST version 1.1, after the initiation of study treatment, in participants with intracranial brain metastases at baseline., From frist administration of WX-0593 to the date that the last patients observed for 18 weeks.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from the start of study treatment to the date of death., From frist administration of WX-0593 until death due to any cause, withdraws informed consent, is lost to follow-up or refuses phone visits, or study completion（up to 2.5 years）|Incidence of Adverse Events, Incidence of All Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by CTCAE v4.03, the date of written informed consent signed until at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug was administered.|Cssmin, Minimum value of steady plasma-drug concentration for WX-0593, Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 7, Cycle 1 Day 21, Cycle 2 Day 21, and Cycle 4 Day 21 (each cycle is 21 days)
The clinical study is a single-arm, phase II, open label, multicenter design in patients with crizotinib-resistant ALK -positive, or crizotinib-resistant/crizotinib-naive ROS1-positive NSCLC.
