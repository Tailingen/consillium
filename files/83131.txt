Proteomic Analysis of Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery
The expression of proteins in the blood of obese individuals is different from the expression of proteins in healthy individuals, and is also different in individuals after bariatric surgery. Therefore, this research aims to better understand protein expression in patients indicated for surgical treatment of obesity, evaluating the pre-operative and post-operative status. The objective of this research is to better understand protein expression in patients indicated for surgical treatment of obesity, evaluating the pre-operative and post-surgery status.

PROCEDURE: bariatric surgery
Number of patients with reduced initially upregulated oncogenic proteins, reduction of proteins potentially involved in oncogenic metabolic pathways, initially upregulated in the context of obesity, 1 year after bariatric surgery
The objective of this study is to analyze the Proteomics of obese patients in the preoperative context of bariatric surgery to evaluate which are the up-regulated proteins - potentially related to oncogenic metabolic pathways - and also the down-regulated proteins in the context of obesity - potentially protective in the context of cancer. As well as, evaluate the variation of these proteins, as well as the metabolic pathways with which they are associated, after weight loss promoted by bariatric surgery, in the period of 01 year after this intervention.

The proteomic study will be carried out based on the formation of pools organized based on the patients' pre- and postoperative similarities. Proteomic analyzes will be carried out on a high-performance liquid chromatography system (nanoUPLC) model Acquity Mclass, Waters. Coupled to a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer-Time of Flight (QToF) Model Sunapt Xs, Waters. Finally, the raw data (raw mass spectra) will be analyzed by the PROGENESIS QI software (Waters) to identify the proteins.
