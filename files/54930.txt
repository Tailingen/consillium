sleep quality, The primary objective is to compare postoperative sleep quality, as measured using a bispectral index-Vista monitor during the first night after surgery., first postoperative night
regional cerebral oxygen saturation, physiological parameter of regional cerebral oxygen saturation of all patients during the operation will be recorded.Regional cerebral oxygen saturation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy in the frontal lobe has been used previously to evaluate overall cerebral blood flow. The normal range of cerebral oxygen saturation is 55-80%., In the operation
This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled (randomized, parallel group, concealed allocation), double-blinded trial.
