Study of ImmunoPet Imaging of PD-L1 in Tumors Using 89Zr-DFO-REGN3504 in Adult Participants With Advanced PD-L1 Positive Malignancies
The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 89Zr-DFO-REGN3504.

The secondary objectives of the study are:

Study Part A only:

* To establish adequate mass dose and activity dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504 and optimal post-infusion imaging time, as assessed by imaging and blood draw after tracer infusion

Study Part B only:

* To establish test/re-test reliability of positron emission tomography (PET) measures as assessed on 2 separate tracer infusions at adequate mass dose and optimal imaging time point as determined in Part A
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504 based on tracer plasma activity concentration
