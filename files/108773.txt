Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Using Infusional Gemcitabine Followed by Surgery for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Phase II Study of Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy using infusional Gemcitabine followed by Surgery for Locally Advanced (T3 and T4 or Node positive) Rectal Adenocarcinoma.
Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: XRT|DRUG: capecitabine
Estimate the rate of pathological complete response following neoadjuvant combined-modality therapy using weekly Gemcitabine and radiation therapy in rectal cancer., PCR will be assessed during the course of study, "3 years"
Estimate the incidence of hematologic and non-hematologic grade 3-4 toxicity with the above regimen, Toxicity will be evaluated for 3 years and beyond, "3 years"|Predictive value of positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, To assess the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of positive PET and negative PET for pathological complete response. In addition we will correlate the decrease of SUVmax by 50% with survival in patient treated with neo-adjuvant radiotherapy and Gemcitabine in for locally advanced rectal cancer, within 2 month of finishing pre-operative chemoradiotherapy|R0 resection rate, To assess the adequacy of R0 resection for tumors following down staging using the pre-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy with Gemcitabine., at the time of surgery ( 2.5 months) from completion of pre-operative chemoradiotherapy
Results of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiation for advanced rectal cancer have plateaued with pathological complete response rates of 10-20% in spite of the addition of new cytotoxic agents and/ or molecular targeted therapies. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and radiation produces effective sensitization but further improvements require assessment of other sensitizers to increase the pathological complete response rates. Gemcitabine has been used in combination with radiation for several GI cancers but few studies have examined its role in rectal cancer. This study will examine a combination of Gemcitabine and radiation as neo-adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal cancer to increase the pathological complete response (pCR) rate from the investigators traditional 6% to \> 40 %.
