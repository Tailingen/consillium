Safety and Clinical Activity of KT-253 in Adult Patients with High Grade Myeloid Malignancies, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Lymphoma, Solid Tumors
This Phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), and clinical activity of KT-253 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) high grade myeloid malignancies, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), R/R lymphoma, myelofibrosis, and R/R solid tumors. The study will identify the pharmacologically optimal dose(s) (MTD) of KT-253 as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), based on all safety, PK, PD, and efficacy data.

This is an open-label Phase 1 (dose escalation) first-in-human study (FIH) of KT-253 in adult patients. This study will be initiated in patients with lymphomas, and solid tumors and then subsequently in patients with advanced high grade myeloid malignancies and ALL. Therefore, the study is comprised of two arms to characterize the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of KT-253 in each arm. Arm A will consist of patients with lymphomas and advanced solid tumors and Arm B will consist of patients with high grade myeloid malignancies and ALL.
