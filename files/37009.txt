The Impact of Pentoxifylline and Vitamin E on Radiotherapy-induced Toxicity in Head & Neck Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether pentoxifylline and vitamin E are effective in prevention of radiotherapy- induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: Pentoxifylline|DRUG: Vitamin E|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiation therapy
Incidence and severity of radiotherapy-induced toxicity, weekly follow-up for recording radiotherapy-induced toxicity occurrence.weekly reported toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, 90 days since start of treatment
Duration of grade 3 or 4 radiotherapy-induced toxicity, 90 days since start of treatment|Patients' response to concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (objective response rate), the effect of pentoxifylline and vitamin E on the, 63 days since start of treatment|incidence and grade of pentoxifylline and vitamin E- related adverse events (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03), Adverse events induced by intervention drugs will be assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, 90 days since start of treatment|Number of patients with unplanned breaks in radiotherapy, 49 days since start of treatment|Total dose of opioid analgesics required, 90 days since start of treatment|Functional oral intake score, 90 days since start of treatment|Patients' quality of life assessed using the validated Arabic version of the EuroQol-5D-3L questionnaire, 90 days since start of treatment
This is a randomized controlled prospective study of pentoxifylline and vitamin E given on daily basis throughout the period of concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with carcinoma of the head and neck. All patients will be followed up to 90 days since the first day of treatment. The incidence and severity of adverse events will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.
