A Pilot Study Evaluating a Ketogenic Diet Concomitant to Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess objective response rate (partial and complete response) of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab concomitant to a special diet (ketogenic diet, continuous or discontinuous) or standard diet with or without BHB according to RECIST v1.1 at 8 weeks.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Continuous ketogenic diet|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Discontinuous ketogenic diet|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation
Objective response rate, Preliminary activity will be assessed by measuring objective response rate (ORR) (partial/complete response) of Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab concomitant to a special diet (KD continuous or discontinuous) or standard diet (SD) with or without (BHB) according to RECIST v1.1 at 8 weeks., at 8 weeks after diet initiation.
Safety of Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab concomitant to a special diet, the safety of Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab concomitant to a special diet (ketogenic diet, continuous or discontinuous) or standard diet (SD) with or without BHB will be measured by the rate of all and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAEv4, and compare the rate to historical data., Events reported from the first day of diet and up to and including 100 days following the last day of diet could be included in estimating this incidence rate.|Assessment of weight, Assessment of weight in kilograms by baseline test and follow up in order to evaluate the impact of the diet concomitant to immunotherapy on nutritional status, muscle mass, and sarcopenia., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Assessment of albuminemia, Assessment of albuminemia in g/L in order to evaluate the impact of the diet concomitant to immunotherapy on nutritional status, muscle mass, and sarcopenia., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Assessment of prealbuminemia, Assessment of prealbuminemia in g/L in order to evaluate the impact of the diet concomitant to immunotherapy on nutritional status, muscle mass, and sarcopenia., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Assessment of C reactive protein, Assessment of C reactive protein in mg/L in order to evaluate the impact of the diet concomitant to immunotherapy on nutritional status, muscle mass, and sarcopenia., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Assessment of sarcopenia, Sarcopenia will be assessed according to SliceOmatic software V5.0 and preestablished thresholds of skeletal muscle tissue (-29 to +150 Hounsfield units). Axial L3 sections will be used to measure the total muscle area (TMA) and calculate skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm²/m²). Sarcopenia is defined as SMI lower than a sex-based threshold (\<55.4 in men and \<38.9 in women)., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Assessment of Quality of Life (QoL), explore the evolution of Patient Reported Outcomes using EORTC QLQ 30 file in all treated patients., At screening and 9 weeks after diet initiation|progression-free survival assessment, PFS is specified as the time between the date of the starting of the diet and the first date of documented progression, based on assessments (as per RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Sarcopenic event-free survival (SFS), SFS will be estimated from intervention starting., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation|Overall survival (OS), OS is specified as the time between the date of the starting of the diet and the date of the death whatever the cause., from the first day of diet and up to 2 years from diet initiation
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving informed consent will undergo a 10 days screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. At week1day1, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be enrolled in to :

* Arm A : continuous ketogenic diet for 3 months
* Arm B : discontinuous ketogenic diet (15 days on, 15 days off) for 3 months
* Arm C : oral liquid ketone supplement BHB monoester, 15 days-on 15 days off during 3 months.
* Arm D : standard diet (without any diet restrictions). and follow up as in arms A, B, C.

All patients will receive Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab according to practical routine.
