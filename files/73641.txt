Study of Sotorasib, Panitumumab and FOLFIRI Versus FOLFIRI With or Without Bevacizumab-awwb in Treatment-naïve Participants With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With KRAS p.G12C Mutation
The aim of this study is to compare progression free survival (PFS) in treatment-naïve Participants with KRAS p.G12C mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving sotorasib, panitumumab and FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab-awwb.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI Regimen|DRUG: Sotorasib|DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab-awwb
PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), Up to Approximately 3 Years
Overall Survival (OS), Up to Approximately 5 Years|Objective Response (OR) per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1, up to Approximately 3 Years|Time to Response (TTR) per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 3 Years|Depth of Response per RECIST v1.1, Depth of response is measured as the percentage of tumor shrinkage calculated as the best percentage change from baseline in lesion sum diameters., Up to Approximately 3 Years|Time to Early Tumor Shrinkage (ETS) per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|PFS Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 years|DOR Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, up to Approximately 3 Years|DCR Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|TTR Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Depth of Response Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Time to ETS Based on Investigator's Assessment per RECIST v1.1, Up to Approximately 3 Years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious AE is defined as any AE that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect or important medical events that do not meet the preceding criteria but based on appropriate medical judgment may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above., Up to Approximately 3 Years|Pre-dose (Ctrough) Concentrations of Sotorasib, Day 1 (pre-dose) to week 4 (post dose) on cycle 2 (one cycle = 28 days)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Sotorasib, Day 1 (pre-dose) to week 4 (post dose) on cycle 2 (one cycle = 28 days)
