Radiation Therapy in Preventing Liver Metastases in Patients With Uveal Melanoma Who HaveMonosomy 3 or DecisionDx Class 2 Disease and Are More Likely to Develop Liver Metastases
This clinical trial studies giving radiation therapy to the liver in patients with uveal (eye) melanoma who have a specific chromosome loss (monosomy 3) or are DecisionDx Class 2 and therefore more likely to have their disease spread from the eye to the liver. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Early radiation to the liver may reduce the development of tumors in the liver and the overall risk of disease recurrence.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Progression free survival in patients treated with prophylactic hepatic irradiation.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Acute and late term toxicity and overall survival.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy daily over 20 minutes on Monday-Friday for 10 fractions over approximately 2 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
