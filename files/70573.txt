A Trial of Cadonilimab With Adriamycin in Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This is a single-arm, multicenter trial of cadonilimab (AK104) with adriamycin in patients with first-line advanced soft tissue sarcoma. the primary objective is to evaluate objective response rate of cadonilimab with adriamycin.
Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Cadonilimab|DRUG: Adriamycin
objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with best response of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and iRECIST, from the first drug administration up to two years
Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR, PR, or SD, from the first drug administration up to two years|Duration of response (DOR), Time from first documented response (CR or PR) until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, from the first drug administration up to two years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, from the first drug administration up to two years|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death due to any cause, from the first drug administration up to two years|Adverse event (AE), To assess the safety and tolerability of cadonilimab plus adriamycin in participants with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, From the subject signs the ICF to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or initiation of other anti-tumor therapy, whichever occurs first
In this study, the screening period does not exceed 28 days, and subjects who are qualified after completion of the screening examination and evaluation entered the treatment period and undergo study treatment and visits as specified in the protocol. In particular, tumor imaging assessments are performed every 2 cycles during the first 16 cycles; thereafter, tumor imaging assessments are performed every 4 cycles.
