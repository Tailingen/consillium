Phase 1 Trial of Interleukin 12 Gene Therapy for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer
The primary purpose of this phase 1 study is to determine the dose-dependent toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oncolytic adenovirus-mediated cytotoxic and IL-12 gene therapy in men with locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiotherapy
