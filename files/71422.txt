AMG 595 First-in-Human in Recurrent Gliomas
This is an open-label, sequential dose exploration study of single agent AMG 595 administered in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and/or anaplastic astrocytomas (AA). The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 595, and also to evaluate the objective response rate in subjects receiving AMG 595. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will explore doses of AMG 595 in subjects with recurrent GBM and/or AA. Part 2 (dose expansion) will examine the MTD established in Part 1 in subjects with recurrent GBM.

This study of AMG 595 will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (dose exploration) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Part 1 of the study is in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and/or anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), and Part 2 is examining the MTD in subjects with recurrent GBM. Approximately 30-40 subjects may be enrolled in Part 1, and up to 36 subjects may be enrolled in Part 2. The dose of AMG 595 utilized in Part 2 will be dependent upon data obtained in Part 1 of the study.
