a Clinical Research of Sequential CAR-T Bridging HSCT in the Treatment of Relapse/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect and evaluate the safety of anti-CD19 or anti-CD20 CAR-T cells briging HSCT in the treatment of relapse/refractory B cell malignancies.

The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Recently the anti-CD20 CAR T cells has been used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL and exhibited good clinical outcomes.

However, patients treated with CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 or CD20 mutation. Therefore we attempt to maintain and relieve patients by sequential therapy of the HSCT and hope to combine their advantages.
