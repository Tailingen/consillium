1-year Disease-free survival rate, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of the first cancer-related event, second cancer, or death from any cause., Up to 2 years
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Disease-free survival（DFS）, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of the first cancer-related event, second cancer, or death from any cause., Up to 2 years
STUDY DESIGN/ Evaluation criteria Main criterion: efficacy. The main criterion is the 1-year disease-free survival rate. Disease-free survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of the first cancer-related event, second cancer, or death from any cause. Patients without event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit.

Secondary criteria include Overall survival. OS is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Patients who are still living at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit.

Secondary criteria also include the Disease-free survival.

Tolerance Patients evaluable for toxicity must have received one investigational drug.
