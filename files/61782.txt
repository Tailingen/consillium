NGS MRD-Guided Blinatumomab Treatment for Pediatric B-ALL
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients with negative deep minimal residue disease (MRD) can benefit from blinatumomab treatment.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Whether the application of blinatumomab can improve the long-term survival of next generation sequence (NGS) MRD-positive B-ALL children after consolidation therapy?
2. Whether the application of blinatumomab can benefit the NGS MRD-negative B-ALL children after consolidation therapy?
