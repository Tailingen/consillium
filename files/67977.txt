Adaptative Radiotherapy to Decrease Xerostomia in Oropharynx Carcinoma (ARTOME)
Standard treatment for oropharynx cancer is radiotherapy by intensity modulation with only one planification before treatment. Adaptative radiotherapy integrates one or several planifications during treatment radiotherapy in order to take into account anatomic modifications that occurs.

Adaptative radiotherapy is very expensive, complex and is consuming human resources as well as equipment.

ARTIX study (NCT01874587) entitled "Phase III trial testing the benefit of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with weekly replanifications versus intensity modulated radiotherapy with only one planification in locally advanced oropharynx carcinoma for decreasing xerostomia" is completed and clinical data from this study are used to analyse if xerostomia is decreased when adaptative radiotherapy is used.

ARTOME study will assess cost-efficiency and cost utility between standard treatment (one pretherapeutic planification) and experimental treatment (weekly replanifications during treatment). Clinical data from ARTIX study will be used for ARTOME study.
