A Study of FluzoparibÂ±Apatinib Versus Chemotherapy Treatment of Physician's Choice in HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA Mutation
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fluzoparib alone or with Apatinib versus Physicians Choice Chemotherapy, as treatment, in patients with a Germline BRCA Mutation and HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer. The study contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of Fluzoparib+Apatinib will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
