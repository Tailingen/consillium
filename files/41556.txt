Efficacy of Preparation in Self-Hypnosis by Anchoring Versus Conversational Hypnosis, Used Alone or Combined, in Patients Undergoing Breast Macrobiopsies
The incidence of breast cancer and its mortality are reduced thanks in particular to early detection.

Often performed after a screening test, stereotactic macrobiopsies are used to characterize abnormalities detected on mammography. This anxiety-inducing and painful examination leads to significant physiological and psychological modifications for these women who logically apprehend the realization of this act.

Faced with this observation, investigators wondered what could be done to improve the experience of the patients during this examination.

Investigators were interested in hypnosis because its effectiveness as a complementary practice has been validated by numerous studies with benefits on pain and stress management.

However, today, there are no convincing results confirming which hypnosis method would be the best to manage patients' anxiety and pain during this examination.
