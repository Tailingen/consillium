Treatment Response Assessment Maps to Delineate Necrosis From Tumor After Stereotactic Radiation in Brain Metastases
This research study is investigating the value of an imaging study of the brain called an MRI (which stands for magnetic resonance imaging), utilized in unique way, to delineate whether the tumor has recurred or whether radiation changes have occurred after a brain metastasis treated with focused radiation has enlarged.
Brain Tumor
DEVICE: MRI
Sensitivity, The sensitivity along with 95% exact binomial confidence interval of pre-operative treatment response assessment maps for the identification of viable tumor relative to the gold standard of pathologic review, Within 3 months of study enrollment
Specificity, The specificity along with 95% exact binomial confidence interval of pre-operative treatment response assessment maps for the identification of viable tumor relative to the gold standard of pathologic review, Within 3 months of study enrollment|Positive predictive value, The positive predictive value along with 95% exact binomial confidence interval of pre-operative treatment response assessment maps for the identification of viable tumor relative to the gold standard of pathologic review, Within 3 months of study enrollment|Negative predictive value, The negative predictive value along with 95% exact binomial confidence interval of pre-operative treatment response assessment maps for the identification of viable tumor relative to the gold standard of pathologic review, Within 3 months of study enrollment
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

In this research study, the investigators are utilizing MRIs of the brain with additional post-imaging processing (called Treatment Response Assessment Maps or TRAMs) to try to delineate tumor recurrence from radiation changes. The investigators hope to understand whether such a test may allow future patients to avoid resection entirely.
