Neoadjuvant Treatment Modalities in Esophageal Cancer
Esophageal cancer is the most prevalent cancer globally with poor survival outcome. The prognosis with surgery alone is poor, accounting for 30-40% of overall survival at 5 year. Either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) or chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has been shown as efficatious therapy to improve patients outcomes in esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer as compared with surgery alone. The purpose of this study was to explore the optimal neoadjuvant treatment modalities including PD-1/PD-L1 antibody or targeted drug for patients with esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer.

Overall survival, 5 year
Progression free survival, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 5 year|Number of participants with Acute and late toxicities of radiotherapy,chemotherapy and immunotherapy, Acute and late toxicities are evaluated by NCI-CTC version 5.0, 3 months|Pathological response rate, Pathological response were classiﬁed into three grades.Grade I signiﬁes that there is little shrinkage in the tumor; only mild regression in the tumor cells is observed under themicroscope. Grade II shows gross reduction in size of the tumor and marked regression in the cancer cells microscopically, yet viable nests of cancer tissue are still visible. Grade III implies complete or almost total resolution of the tumor on exploration, and disappearance of the tumor tissue microscopically; only remnants of degenerated cancer cells can be seen (so-called ghost cancer cells)., 3 months|R0 resection rate, 3 months|Locoregional recurrence free survival, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 5 year|Distant metastasis free survival, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 5 year
