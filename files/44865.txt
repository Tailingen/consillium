Pharmacokinetics of Single and Repeat Oral Doses of Trametinib in Chinese Subjects With Solid Tumours
Present clinical study will be conducted in China to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single and repeat oral doses of trametinib, the safety profile and the clinical activity in Chinese subjects with solid tumor. Approximately 10 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study, Subjects will receive trametinib 2 mg once daily (QD). Study treatment will continue until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The study will be completed after all subjects have discontinued from study treatment or last enrolled subject has had at least 16 weeks of follow-up, whichever occurs first.
