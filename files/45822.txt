A Trial of the Safety and Immunogenicity of the COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) in Participants With Hematologic Malignancies and Various Regimens of Immunosuppression, and in Participants With Solid Tumors on PD1/PDL1 Inhibitor Therapy
Background:

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection. It has spread rapidly across the globe. It has overwhelmed health systems. Researchers are concerned that it may undo years of progress in the reduction of cancer-specific death. They want to test a vaccine that might protect people with cancer from COVID-19.

Objective:

To test the safety and efficacy of a vaccine using messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-1273 that may protect people with cancer from COVID-19.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older who have a solid tumor or blood cancer and who may benefit from a vaccine that might prepare their immune system for fighting and preventing infection from COVID-19. Patients with solid tumors must be receiving treatment with an immunotherapy agent.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history, medicine review, and physical exam. They will have blood tests. They will have a pregnancy test if needed.

Participants will get 2 doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine if they have not been vaccinated already. It will be injected into a muscle in the arm on Days 1 and 29. They will be followed for 12 months after the second dose.

Participants will have study visits at the Clinical Center on Days 1, 29, 36,57, 209, and 394. Some visits will last about 4-6 hours. Patients will be able to get up to 3 doses of mRNA-1273 as a booster on trial if they have already completed a primary series of a vaccine. Participants who have already received a booster dose of vaccine will be able to enroll to receive additional boosters. It will be injected into a muscle in the arm on Day 1. Participants will be followed for 12 months after their last booster injection. Participants who receive booster doses will have study visits at the Clinical Center on Days 1, 29, 57, 180 and 360.

Participants will give blood and saliva samples for research.

Participation will last about 16 months.

Design of the Study:

This is an open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and primary immunogenicity of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-1273 vaccine administered in 2 doses, 28 days apart, in participants who have hematological malignancy and are immunosuppressed due to their disease and/or treatment or receiving a Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) inhibitor for treatment of a solid tumor can be associated with appropriately high rates of development of neutralizing antibodies of mRNA-1273. The trial will also evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity after administration of additional booster doses of the vaccine.

Study Phase:

Study Population:

For the vaccine-na(SqrRoot) ve cohorts, up to 80 participants will be enrolled.

* 20 participants with solid tumor malignancies who have initiated PD1/PDL1 inhibitor therapy as part of standard of care and are deemed to have a stable regimen without the need for any immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids.

Description of Study Product or Intervention:

mRNA-1273 Injection (Drug Product) is an lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) dispersion containing a single mRNA sequence (Drug Substance) that encodes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) S glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The mRNA-1273 Drug Substance is combined with a mixture of 4 lipids common to the Moderna's mRNA vaccine platform: SM-102 (a custom-manufactured, ionizable lipid) and 3 commercially available lipids, cholesterol, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000-DMG) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020- 00807-1). mRNA-1273 Injection is provided as a sterile solution for injection, white to off white dispersion in appearance.
