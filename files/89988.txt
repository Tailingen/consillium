A Prospective Epidemiologic Study of ALK-Positive NSCLC in China
This is a post-marketing, observational, non-interventional, multi-central study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with data collected prospectively from medical records at inclusion. The primary objective is to obtain the epidemiologic data of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive in unselected Chinese patients with NSCLC.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
the frequency of ALK rearrangement in unselected Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer, one and half years
demographic, socioeconomic,clinical and pathological features of ALK-positive NSCLC patients, one and half years
prognosis patterns associated with crizotinib treated patients when efficacy data are available non-interventionally., one and half years
Archived paraffin-embedded and fresh frozen NSCLC tumor tissue will be obtained via the Department of Pathology. ALK positive status will be detected by Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. and Roche Diagnostics International, Inc). When ALK positive patients are detected, crizotinib will be administrated by various solutions based on physician's desecration and patients' willingness.

The secondary objectives include: 1.To obtain the epidemiologic data of ALK positive in unselected Chinese patients with NSCLC.2.To describe demographic, socioeconomic \[such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic location (including rural/urban area), pathologic parameters, education, family income, National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) or Provincial Reimbursement List (PRDL)\], and clinical characteristics of NSCLC patients with ALK positive.

The exploratory objective is to describe prognosis patterns associated with crizotinib treated patients when efficacy data are available non-interventionally.
