Combination Study of Urelumab and Cetuximab in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Colorectal Cancer or Advanced/Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of Urelumab in combination with Cetuximab in patients with Advanced/Metastatic Colorectal Cancer or Advanced/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.
Colorectal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Urelumab|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence, potential significance, and clinical importance of adverse events, As determined by medical review of adverse event reports, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and results of physical examination and laboratory tests During a 3 week cycle, safety labs are done on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 15. Starting on Cycle 3, Day 1, Chemistry (excluding Liver function test (LFTs)) are to be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle thereafter. Physical exams are done on Day 1 of each cycle. Vital signs are done on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 at Cycle 1 and then on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle thereafter. Adverse events are collected from screening to 60 days after last dose of Urelumab, Approximately 2 years
