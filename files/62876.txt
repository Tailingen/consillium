Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Resistance to Treatments in Ph-negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The aim of this study is to evaluate the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers as predictive for response to hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET).
Polycythemia Vera|Essential Thrombocythemia
BIOLOGICAL: RNA sample of total leukocytes before start of treatment
To correlate endoplasmic reticulum stress (defined as splicing of XBP1 above 30%) to the rate of complete response after 6 months according to the 2009 ELN criteria, After 6 months of treatment
The recent discovery of calreticulin mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms point to the unexpected role of the endoplasmic reticulum biology in the pathophysiology in these diseases. Otherwise, the association of endoplasmic reticulum stress with solid cancers, in particular in resistance to chemotherapy, is well documented, contrary to hematological malignancies. The study aims to evaluate endoplasmic reticulum stress markers as predictors for the response to hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia patients. The main objective is to correlate endoplasmic reticulum stress (defined as splicing of XBP1 above 30%) to the rate of complete response after 6 months according to the 2009 ELN criteria. This is an observational retrospective study.
