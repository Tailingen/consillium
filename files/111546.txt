Evaluation of Diagnostic Accuracy of CEUS for HCC Diagnosis
This study aims to compare the diagnostic accuracy of Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with that of gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using non-invasive diagnostic criteria (American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD or Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 and Korean Liver Cancer Study Group- National Cancer Center Korea (KLCSG-NCC) v2018).
