Study of PXD101 Alone and in Combination With 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a study to assess the combination of PXD101 and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)in patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary goal of the study is to understand the safety, anti-tumor activity, and how the study drug behaves within the body when given with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU).
