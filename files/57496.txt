Dose Escalation Trial of Intra-Tumoral Injection of NIS Measles Virus in Combination With Atezolizumab
This a Phase 1 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of attenuated Measles virus (MV-NIS) combined with Atezolizumab in patients with recurrent and metastatic NSCLC.
Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: MV-NIS|BIOLOGICAL: Atezolizumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MV-NIS in Combination With Atezolizumab, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the intra-tumoral administration of an Edmonston strain MV genetically engineered to produce NIS (MV-NIS), in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, 28 days after MV-NIS administration for each dose cohort
Phase 1, dose escalation study of the combination of intra-tumoral MV-NIS and systemic atezolizumab in patients with recurrent and metastatic NSCLC. After the dose escalation phase of the trial, a dose expansion cohort was planned to further investigate safety, clinical and immune responses at the MTD. A standard 3+3 design was to be used for the dose escalation part of the study. Starting at dose level 1, three patients were to be treated per dose level. MV-NIS was to be administered once intra-tumorally (IT) on Day 1 of treatment in 3 escalating dose cohorts, starting at dose level 1 x 10e8
