Vaccine Therapy and Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus and a person's dendritic cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vaccine therapy together with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with celecoxib works in treating patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease for ≥ 14 weeks) in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) transduced with AD5F35 expressing LMP-1 and LMP-2 when administered in combination with celecoxib.

Secondary

* To evaluate the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.
* To evaluate the specific T-cell response against LMP-1 and LMP-2 as measured by HLA tetramer technology, ELISPOT assay, and delayed-type hypersensitivity in patients treated with this regimen.
* To evaluate the surrogate tumor marker response plasma EBV DNA by real-time PCR in these patients.
* To evaluate and characterize immunological cell types and tumor characteristics in biopsy specimens of patients treated with this DC vaccine and compare it with pre-vaccine biopsy specimens.
* To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival of patients who show initial clinical benefit to DC vaccine.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood collection for the preparation of the autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. Immature DCs are transduced with latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) and latent membrane protein-2 (LMP-2) using the adenoviral vector 5F35. Beginning 1 week after blood collection, patients receive vaccination with autologous DCs transduced with AD5F35-LMP-1/LMP-2 intradermally every 2 weeks for a total of 5 vaccinations. Patients also receive celecoxib twice a day beginning 1 week before the first vaccination and continuing for up to 6 weeks after completion of the last vaccination.

Patients who demonstrate clinical benefit after completion of 5 courses of vaccination may continue to receive the DC vaccine alone off study every 2 weeks until disease progression (based on CT scan findings) or at the investigator's discretion.

Patients undergo blood and tumor tissue sample collection periodically for laboratory studies. Blood samples are analyzed using MHC tetramer analysis; enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis; EBV DNA titers to assess response; and flow cytometry to assess lymphocyte kinetics. Tumor tissue samples are used for immunological studies. Delayed-type hypersensitivity is also assessed.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for up to 1 year.
