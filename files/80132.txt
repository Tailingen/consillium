Randomized Trial of ARCON in Larynx Cancer
TITLE:

A multicentre, randomised, phase III clinical trial comparing accelerated radiotherapy with accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen and nicotinamide (ARCON) in clinical stage T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

Does the addition of carbogen and nicotinamide to a schedule of accelerated radiotherapy in patients with clinical stage T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma improve local primary tumour control? Definitive analysis will be performed on local control rates at two years after completion of radiotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

Does the addition of carbogen and nicotinamide

* increase the larynx preservation rate?
* increase the regional control rate?
* increase the toxicity of accelerated radiotherapy?
* improve the overall quality of life?
* improve the disease-free survival?
* improve the overall survival?

STUDY DESIGN:

An open-label, randomised clinical trial assigning patients in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms:

* accelerated radiotherapy
* accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen and nicotinamide

PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND NUMBER:

344 patients with clinical T2-4 laryngeal carcinoma

MEASUREMENTS:

* time to local failure
* time to regional failure
* survival with functional larynx
* overall and disease-free survival
* frequency and severity of complications related to radiotherapy and carbogen and nicotinamide
* quality of life assessment
