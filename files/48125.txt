RADVAXâ„¢: A STRATIFIED PHASE I/II DOSE ESCALATION TRIAL OF HYPOFRACTIONATED RADIOTHERAPY FOLLOWED BY IPILIMUMAB IN METASTATIC MELANOMA
The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated hypofractionated radiotherapy dose (MTD) to a solitary metastatic focus ('index lesion') when followed by ipilimumab, in metastatic melanoma patients without brain involvement The secondary objectives are to determine late toxicity, immune-related clinical responses and immune pharmacodynamic changes after hypofractionated radiotherapy followed by ipilimumab
