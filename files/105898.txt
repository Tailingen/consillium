A Study of ZN-c5 in Subjects With Breast Cancer
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ZN-c5 administered orally in subjects with advanced estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. ZN-c5 will be evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib (IBRANCE®).

DRUG: ZN-c5|DRUG: Palbociclib
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) for ZN-c5 as a Monotherapy, CBR is defined as the number of participants who have at least 1 confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (only if participant has measurable disease), or stable disease (SD) \>= 24 weeks (or non-CR/non-progressive disease (PD) \>=24 weeks for participants with non-measurable disease) prior to any evidence of progression., 24 weeks|Best Overall Response (BOR) for ZN-c5 as a Monotherapy, Best overall response was summarized categorically based on the four RECIST categories: CR, PR, SD and PD., 24 weeks
Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 2 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 2 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 2 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 4 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 4 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 4 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 6 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 6 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 6 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 8 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 8 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 8 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 10 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 10 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 10 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 12 Months, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dosing until the date of objective PD (as defined by RECIST version 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), whichever occurs earlier. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 12 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 12 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival (OS) at 2 Months, OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier estimates at 2 months and their confidence intervals are calculated with the log-log transformation methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice., 2 months|Monotherapy Only: Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival at 4 Months, OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause.
