Improving Safety and Accuracy of Stereotactic Brain Biopsies in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma.
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive extranodal non- Hodgkin lymphoma exclusively localized into the nervous system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the MRI imaging characteristics of the peritumoral area (PTA) and to correlate this information to pathological findings.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive extranodal non- Hodgkin lymphoma exclusively localized into the nervous system. It is a relatively rare disorder, accounting for only 3% of all primary brain tumors but due to its anatomical localization represents an important clinical and diagnostic challenge in onco-hematology. different MRI patterns of the peritumoral area (PTA) might correlate with different histopathological sensitivity regarding diagnostic potential out of contrast-enhanced region (CER). Improvements in the understanding of PTA diagnostic potentials is of great help in diagnosing patients with deep-seated lesions, who would otherwise be not eligible for stereotactic biopsy and therefore for a consequent adequate treatment.
