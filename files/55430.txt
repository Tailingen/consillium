The Role of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen) in Surgery Guidance in Prostate Cancer
Obtain PSMA-PET imaging preoperatively and calculate performance for predicting extra-prostatic extension based on whole-mount pathology (gold standard).

Quantify the frequency of proper treatment changes directed by PSMA-PET, focusing on appropriate preservation of surrounding structures important for genito-urinary function including: 1) Bladder neck, 2) Nerve bundles, 3) Urethral Sphincter (Figure 4).

Directly compare PSMA-PET performance for predicting extra-prostatic extension to standard-of-care assessments.

Assess quality of life changes from preoperative baseline.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Scan
Sensitivity of PSMA-PET and MRI Imaging Preoperatively for Predicting Extra-prostatic Extension, Sensitivity detecting extra-prostatic extension of cancer at the nerve bundles, The patients underwent a 60minute PET exam. The surgery was generally performed within 1month of the PET scan. The pathology was done 5-10 days after the surgery.|Specificity of PSMA-PET and MRI, Specificity of PSMA-PET and MRI to detect Extra-prostatic extension prior to prostatectomy. Whole mount pathology is used as the reference standard., Pre-surgery prediction.
