FDG PET/CT and Directed Metabolic Core Needle Biopsy in the Management of Lymphoma
FDG-PET/CT is an established modality in various stages of management of lymphoma but definitive information regarding the diagnosis, prognostication, and further management is provided by histopathological examination. Combining the two modalities may provide an incremental benefit by identifying better sites for targetting biopsy and for better verification of sites and causes of FDG uptake seen during PET/CT.

PROCEDURE: FDG PET/CT guided metabolic core needle biopsy
The yield of FDG PET/CT guided metabolic biopsy in lymphoma, Percentage of biopsy procedures that yielded a sample sufficient for diagnosing the presence or absence of a specific pathology among the patients undergoing the biopsy. Negative biopsy procedures were followed up for a period of one year to confirm the negative findings., 1 year
Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants for PET/CT-guided biopsy. The procedure details, related risks, and benefits were explained to all the participants. A multidisciplinary team including hemato-oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and pathologists were involved in the project. A hemato-oncologist decided the biopsy indication after discussing it with the nuclear medicine physician. FDG avid lesions in a clinically suspected case of lymphoma or a suspicious, residual FDG avid lesion detected at the time of follow-up PET/CT imaging in a patient with a prior diagnosis of lymphoma were sampled. The per and post-procedural complications and management were maintained in the institutional PET data registry and the final histopathological diagnosis obtained was also collected.
