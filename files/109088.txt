Clinically Relevant Pancreatic Fistula After Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Patients who are diagnosed with periampullary cancer will be performed pancreaticoduodenectomy with 3 types of pancreatic-jejunal anastomosis reconstructions. The investigator will analysis the complication of pancreatic fistula about: the clinical symptoms, laboratory test changing, intra-operative morphology, the risk factors
Pancreatic Fistula
PROCEDURE: Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Pancreatic fistula, The investigator will describe the day that appears pancreatic fistula, the clinical symptoms, intra-operative morphology if being indicated to re-operate. The measurement tool to diagnose pancreatic fistula is fluid amylase on the POD3 (fluid amylse is 3 times compared to serum's amylase), 30 days of post-operative period|Risk factors relate to pancreatic fistula, The investigator will analyse some of the risk factors that relate to pancreatic fistula, including pre-operative factors (BMI, albumin, bilirubin, biliary drainage), intra-operative elements (pancreatic duct 's diameter, pancreatic textile, blood transfusion, portal vein reconstruction), and post-operative factors (abdominal drainage's volume, fluid amylase, abdominal abscess..). The investigator will use the multivariable regression model to determine the risk factors (p-value\<0.05), 30 days of post-operative period
Short-term result in treatment of post-operative pancreatic fistula, The investigator will describe the result of pancreatic fistula treatment: intra-operative morphology, re-operative success ratio, morbidities., 30 days of post-operatvive period
This study will conduct at two centers at the same time: University of Medicine and Pharmacy Center and Cho Ray Hospital. The patients will be consulted to participate to this research from September, 2021 to April, 2023.

Plan for conducting study:

* The investigator consults and gets consensus form of the patient with periampullary cancer.
* The patient will be prepared for pancreaticoduodenectomy: pre-operative laboratory test, pre-operative biliary drainage, anesthetic checking.
* The investigator collected intr-operative data, include type of pancreatic-duodenal reconstruction, type of pancreatic duct's drainage, quantity of blood loss and blood transfusion.
* The investor follows post-operative period.
* If there are pancreatic fistula appear, the investigator will collect the clinical signs, laboratory test changing, re-operative morphology.
* The investigator analysis the risk factors of pancreatic fistula.

Data analysis:

* To determine the incidence of pancreatic fistula, the morphology of pancreatic fistula, descriptive statistics will be used.
* To determine the risk factors of pancreatic fistula, logistic regression will be used.

Sample size:

* The investigator plans to collect 145 patients in the research period.

Plan for missing data:

* Any case that miss information will be removed from the study.
