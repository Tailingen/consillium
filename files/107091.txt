Thoracotomy Closure Technique and Postoperative Pain Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial
The purpose of this study is to examine pain associated with thoracotomy (incision made during surgery to obtain access to your thoracic cavity) and how the closure technique may influence postoperative pain. Two types of routinely selected thoracotomy closure techniques will be examined; pericostal and intracostal sutures. The investigators hypothesize that intracostal sutures will result in less postoperative and chronic pain as a result of less compression of the intercostal nerve.
