Evaluation of Lasofoxifene Combined With Abemaciclib in Advanced or Metastatic ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer With an ESR1 Mutation
This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm safety study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the lasofoxifene and abemaciclib combination for the treatment of pre- and postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer who have disease progression on first and/or 2nd lines of hormonal treatment for metastatic disease and have an ESR1 mutation.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lasofoxifene and abemaciclib (VERZENIO (R)).
Safety and tolerability of the combination of lasofoxifene and abemaciclib as measured by number of adverse events (AEs), severity of AEs and mortality due to AEs at every scheduled visit., AEs will be assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., All subjects enrolled in the study will be treated until documented disease progression or until withdrawal for any reason. Safety and tolerability will be assessed from enrollment up to 24 months.
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of entry into the study to the earliest date of first documented progression or death due to any cause., Up to 24 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), 24 weeks or longer|Objective response rate (ORR), All subjects enrolled in the study will be treated until documented disease progression or until withdrawal for any reason. ORR will be assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression of disease or death due to any cause., DoR will be assessed up to 24 months.|Time to response, From the date of entry into the study to the date of first documented response (CR or PR)., Time to response will be assessed up to 24 months.|Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling for lasofoxifene and abemaciclib concentrations as well as abemaciclib's 3 major metabolites, Baseline and pre-dose at every visit starting at Visit 0 (Day 1) through Visit 4 (Week 8) and at the Final/ET visit if this occurred prior to Week 8
