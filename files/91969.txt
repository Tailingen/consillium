Adjuvant Therapy Based on Pathologic Response After Neoadjuvant Encorafenib Binimetinib in Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess rate of disease relapse and hazard rate of disease relapse after neoadjuvant therapy based on the statuses of pathologic complete response or non-pathologic complete response, and postoperative adjuvant therapy.
Melanoma Stage III|Melanoma Stage IV|BRAF V600 Mutation
DRUG: Encorafenib Pill|DRUG: Binimetinib Pill|DRUG: Nivolumab
Rate of Disease Relapse, Investigators will estimate the rate of disease relapse after neoadjuvant therapy based on pathologic complete response status and postoperative adjuvant therapy within each arm., After surgery up to 24 weeks
Relapse Free Survival, Relapse free survival is defined as time from surgery until disease relapse, After surgery up to 24 weeks|Rate of Pathologic Complete Response, Investigators will measure the rate of pathologic complete response after surgery., At 26 weeks|Rate of Non-Pathologic Complete Response, Investigators will measure the rate of non-pathologic complete response after surgery., At 26 weeks|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate will be measured after neoadjuvant therapy (for participants who have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 at start of neoadjuvant therapy)., Up to 26 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured from time of surgery to death from any cause., After surgery, up to 5 years
The purpose of this study is to assess rate of disease relapse and hazard rate of disease relapse after neoadjuvant therapy based on the statuses of pathologic complete response or non-pathologic complete response, and postoperative adjuvant therapy.
