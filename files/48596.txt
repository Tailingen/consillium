Anlotinib Plus Benmelstobart and AG in First-line Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (ALTER-PA-001)
This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with benmelstobart and AG (nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine) as first-line treatment compared with AG (nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine) in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. We plan to recruit 104 subjects and randomly assign them in a 2:1 ratio to either the experimental group receiving Anlotinib plus Benmelstobart plus Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel, or the control group receiving Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel as initial treatment. Each cycle of the aforementioned drugs will last three weeks, with tumor efficacy assessments conducted at the end of cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8. After 8 cycles of treatment, patients in the experimental group who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will continue with maintenance therapy using Anlotinib plus Benmelstobart plus Gemcitabine. Similarly, after 8 cycles of treatment, patients in the control group who achieve CR, PR, or SD will continue with maintenance therapy using Gemcitabine monotherapy. Efficacy will be evaluated every 3 cycles (9 weeks) during the maintenance phase until disease progression or intolerability. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinib and Benmelstobart with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in treating metastatic pancreatic cancer, providing a new treatment option for first-line therapy in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer.
