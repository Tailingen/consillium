A Study of BMS-986340 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Nivolumab or Docetaxel in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose(s) of BMS-986340 as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab or docetaxel in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study is a first-in-human (FIH) study of BMS-986340 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
