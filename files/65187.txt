A Phase I Study of AZD1480 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies and Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Escalation Phase,Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC) and Non-smokers With Lung Metastasis and Gastric Cancer and Solid Tumour in the Expansion Phase.
This is Phase I, open-label and dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD1480(JAK2 inhibitor) in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors (Part A and C) and in patients with advanced HCC (Part B) in the escalation phase, EGFR or ROS mutant NSCLC and non-smokers with lung metastasis and gastric cancer in the expansion phase and to evaluate daily and BID dosing.
Solid Tumour|Advanced Solid Malignancies|Child-Pugh A to B7 Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma|EGFR and/or ROS Mutant NSCLC|Lung Metastasis Carcinoma|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: AZD1480 Daily|DRUG: AZD1480 BID
To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD1480, Safety and tolerability monitoring will proceed for whole study period. Screening, Cycle1Day1, Cycle1Day5 (only for Part B), Cycle1Day8, Cycle1Day15, Cycle2Day1, Cycle2Day8 and Day1 of further Cycles, IP discontinued visit and 30-days follow up
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD1480 following single dose and multiple doses, Part A and Expansion - 12 times during Cycle 1, 11 times during Cycle 2. Part B and C - 11 times during Cycle 1, 10 times during Cycle 2. *1 additional PK sample in Cycle 1 will be collect for optional biopsy sample collected patients.|To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumour activity of AZD1480, Tumour response assessment by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) version 1.1 every 6 weeks
This is Phase I, open-label and dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD1480(JAK2 inhibitor) in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors (Part A and C) and in patients with advanced HCC (Part B) in the escalation phase, EGFR or ROS mutant NSCLC and non-smokers with lung metastasis and gastric cancer in the expansion phase and to evaluate daily and BID dosing.
