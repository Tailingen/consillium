COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium Registry
In this study we will collect granular information on cancer patients infected with COVID-19, as rapidly as possible. The mechanism for collection of this information is a de-identified centralized registry housed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, with data donations from internal and external health care professionals.
COVID-19|Invasive Malignancy (Any Type)
OTHER: Web-based REDCap survey
Web-based REDCap survey, The survey includes five parts: 1) basic demographics about the patient, including performance status and comorbidities; 2) initial COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical course; 3) cancer and cancer treatment details; 4) respondent details; 5) long-term COVID-19 outcomes., Approximately 18 months
The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry prospectively collects anonymized data about patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and cancer. The goal of the registry is to generate hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-supporting findings that are generalizable to the population at large. Specifically:

I. Characterize patient factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, baseline medication exposures, cancer type, status, and treatment, and demographic factors that are associated with short- and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 (laboratory-confirmed or presumptive), including severity and fatality, in patients with cancer.

II. Describe cancer treatment modifications made in response to COVID-19, including dose adjustments, changes in symptom management, or temporary or permanent cessation.

III. Evaluate the association of COVID-19 with cancer outcomes.
