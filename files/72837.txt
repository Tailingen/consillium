VA Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory AML and High-risk MDS
The efficiency and safety of PD-1 inhibitor in combination with venetoclax and hypomethylation agent in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome remain uncertain. In this study, the investigators aimed to assess safety and response to a new PD-1 inhibitor-based triple-drug combination regimen (venetoclax + hypomethylation agent + PD-1 inhibitor) in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients, or who had positive minimal residual disease.
