A Real-world Study in Participants With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the real-world characteristics and outcomes of participants with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) overall and by high-risk and non-high-risk SMM according to (AQUILA study criteria \[NCT03301220\], Mayo 20-2-20 and international myeloma working group (IMWG) 2020 risk classification models), and to evaluate the risk of progressing of SMM to multiple myeloma (MM) and outcomes in participants after progressing to MM.
