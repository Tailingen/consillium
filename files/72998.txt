Omission of Surgery and Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Clinically Low-risk HER2positive Breast Cancer With High HER2 Addiction and a Complete Response Following Standard Anti- HER2-based Neoadjuvant Therapy (ELPIS Trial)
This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, exploratory study in women with primary operable HER2-positive, HER2-enriched(HER2-E)/ERBB2-high breast cancer according to PAM50 intrinsic subtype and a ERBB2 pre-defined cutoff (high vs low ERBB2 expression), to evaluate the omission of surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with HER2-E and ERBB2 high breast cancer who achieving a complete response following standard anti-HER2-based neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab.

To estimate the loco-regional invasive disease-free survival of patients who achieve a complete response, To estimate the loco-regional invasive disease-free survival at 3-year of patients who achieve a complete response based on imaging and a stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and omit loco-regional surgery. 3-years loco-regional invasive disease-free survival rate is defined as time from the first date of no disease (i.e., date of stereotaxic guided biopsy) to loco-regional recurrence. Loco-regional recurrence is defined as recurrence of breast cancer in the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion, the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast., 3 years
