Sym024 Monotherapy and in Combination With Sym021 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym024 is safe and tolerable as monotherapy and in combination with Sym021 in patients with solid tumor malignancies.
Metastatic Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: Sym021|DRUG: Sym024
Part I: To evaluate the incidence, severity and relationship of (S)AEs to establish the MTD/MAD of Sym024 monotherapy., Assess the safety and tolerability of Sym024 monotherapy on a Q2W schedule (every two weeks). Assessment based on the occurrence of AEs meeting DLT criteria measured during Cycle 1, 28 days|Part II: To evaluate the incidence, severity and relationship of (S)AEs to establish MTD/MAD of Sym024 in combination with Sym021., Assess the safety and tolerability of the sequential escalating doses of Sym024 in combination with Sym021 on a Q2W schedule. Assessment based on the occurrence of AEs meeting DLT criteria measured during Cycle 1, 28 days|Part III: To evaluate the incidence, severity and relationship of (S)AEs to further assess safety of Sym024 when administered alone or in combination with Sym021., Assess the safety and tolerability of Sym024 and/or Sym021+Sym024 on a Q2W schedule. Assessment based on the occurrence of AEs, 12 months
Evaluation of the immunogenicity of Sym024 as a single agent and in combination with Sym024, Serum sampling to assess the potential for anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation, 24 months|Evaluation of objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD), Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and Immunotherapeutics Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), 24 months|Time to progression (TTP) of disease, Based on time of enrollment to first evidence of progression on imaging studies, as assessed by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 24 months|Area under the concentration-time curve in a dosing interval (AUC), Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual timepoints, 24 months|Maximum concentration (Cmax), Will be derived from observed data, 24 months|Time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax), Will be derived from observed data, 24 months|Trough concentration (Ctrough), Will be derived from observed data, 24 months|Terminal elimination half-life (TÂ½), Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual timepoints, 24 months|Clearance (CL), Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual timepoints, 24 months
Part 1 of this study will assess the safety and tolerability to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or the maximum administered dose \[MAD\]) and/or the selected dose(s) of Sym024 in patients with solid tumor malignancies.

Part 2 of this study will assess the safety and tolerability to establish the MTD (or the MAD) and/or the selected dose(s) of Sym024 when administered in combination with Sym021 in patients with solid tumor malignancies.

Part 2a of this study will assess the safety and tolerability of Sym024 when first administered as a single agent during Cycle 1 (safety lead-in) followed by administration in combination with Sym021 during Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles.

Part 3 of this study will assess the safety of Sym024 when administered alone or in combination with Sym021 in expanded cohorts of patients with solid tumor malignancies.

April 2024: The above was the study design at trial start. Per protocol, implementation of a part 3 would require an amendment. However, this was never done as it was decided not to include a part 3.
