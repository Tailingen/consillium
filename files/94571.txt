This is a multicenter, single-arm, open study. Thirty patients with stage IV nsqNSCLC with BMs confirmed by histopathology or cytology and reported negative driver genes within three months were enrolled. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Serplulimab combined with bevacizumab and first-line chemotherapy in driver negative nsqNSCLC subjects with brain metastases.

Qualified subjects were selected and entered into the study in sequence. The trial was divided into combination chemotherapy period (C1-C4/C6) and maintenance treatment period (C5/C7-C32). In combination chemotherapy period, all subjects were treated with Serplulimab combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy agents after entering the study, and in maintenance treatment period, Serplulimab combined with bevacizumab and pemetrexed. The efficacy was evaluated every 3 weeks (Q3W), every 2 cycles in combination chemotherapy and every 3 cycles in maintenance treatment. All subjects received treatment until subjects withdrew their informed consent, disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator judgment that medication must be discontinued, loss of follow-up, death, or 2 years of use of Serplulimab, whichever occurred first; At the end of treatment, patients were followed up for survival until death.
