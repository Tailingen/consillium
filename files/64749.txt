PALbociclib Endocrine Therapy Followed by Talazo Vs. Talazoz-Atezo Study
This study is a prospective, two-arm, randomized phase II study of talazoparib versus talazoparib plus atezolizumab in ER+ premeonopausal women with metastatic breast cancer harboring HRD scar

1st line treatment: GnRH agonist + Aromatase Inhibitor(AI) + Palbociclib 28 days after the last treatment of 1st line treatment(., randomization for 2nd line treatment is conducte to arm A(Talazoparib+Atezolizumab) and arm B(Talazoparib monotherapy)
Premenopausal HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pabociclib, Endocrine(or ET + CDK4/6 inhibitors), Talazoparib, Atezolizumab|DRUG: Pabociclib, Endocrine(or ET + CDK4/6 inhibitors), Talazoparib,
2nd Progression free survival (PFS), To assess measures of clinical efficacy. It is a measure of the period of survival without disease progression by Kaplan-Meier method., The time until the time of the first event(the progression of a recorded disease of breast cancer or death from all causes) in 2nd line treatment. Up to 72months
Composite PFS (1st PFS + 2nd PFS), To assess measures of clinical efficacy. It is a measure of the period of survival without disease progression by Kaplan-Meier method., The time from the day 1 of first therapy to the time of first event (documented disease progression of breast cancer or death due to any cause) in 1st and 2nd line therapy. Up to 72months|Overall survival (OS), To assess secondary measures of clinical efficacy., Survival will be measured as the time from the randomization occurs after Progression of 1st line to the date of death. Up to 72months|Toxicity assessment, Clinical and laboratory toxicity/symptomatology will be graded based on the NCIC CTG v5.0, from the date of informed consent signature to 28 days after last drug administration|Quality of Life (QoL), The QoL will be evaluated using EQ5D, from the date of informed consent signature to 28 days after last drug administration
