Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of ARI0002h, for the Initial Treatment of Patients With Primary Plasma Cell Leukaemia
Phase II, pilot, open-label, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARI0002h (cesnicabtagene autoleucel) in 20 patients with newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL).

The study population is patients between 18 and 75 years of age with newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), with a life expectancy of more than 3 months.

The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of CARTBCMA ARI0002h (cesnicabtagene autoleucel) after initial treatment to induce response in patients with newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukaemia.
