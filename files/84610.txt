Screening for Endometrial Abnormalities in Overweight and Obese Women
The purpose of this study is to develop an endometrial biopsy screening program for endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in overweight and obese women.

There is a BMI threshold at and above which optimal screening parameters exist for identifying endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in overweight and/or obese women. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in overweight and/or obese women offers substantial health benefits.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endometrial Biopsy
A BMI cut-point will be identified at and above which an endometrial biopsy yields optimal sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value to screen for endometrial cancer and abnormal pathologies, up to 1 year
