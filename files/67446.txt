DECAMP 1 PLUS: Prediction of Lung Cancer Using Noninvasive Biomarkers
DECAMP 1 PLUS aims to improve the efficiency of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (8-25 mm). Molecular biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis measured in minimally invasive and non-invasive biospecimens may be able to distinguish between malignant or benign indeterminate pulmonary nodules in high-risk smokers. Ultimately, this study aims to validate molecular as well as clinical and imaging biomarkers of lung cancer in individuals with indeterminate lung nodules.

The Detection of Early lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP) consortium is a multidisciplinary and translational research program that previously initiated the DECAMP-1 and DECAMP-2 studies for lung cancer early detection. Now, with the support of Johnson and Johnson, 3 Veterans Administration Hospitals (VAH), 3 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and 12 academic hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories, along with Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores, we are expanding our work in lung cancer early detection.
