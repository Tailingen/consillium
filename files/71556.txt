68Ga-P3 PET/CT Imaging in Prostate
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of 750 amino acids. It is highly expressed on most prostate cancer cells and neovascular endothelial cells of tumors, making PSMA a highly specific and significant imaging target for malignancies.

\[68Ga\]P3, a novel molecular probe of PET imaging agent that targets PSMA, can be used in the diagnosis and research of a wide variety of PSMA high-expression malignanciesr.
