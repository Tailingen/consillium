Surgical Outcome of Dorsolumbar Intradural Extramedullary Spinal Cord Tumors
Primary spinal cord tumors constitute 2-4% of all central nervous system neoplasms; they are classfied as extradural, intradural extramedullary (IDEM: 65%), and intramedullary The most commonly seen IDEM tumors are schwannomas, neurofibromas, and meningiomas. \[1\] The less frequently encountered IDEM tumors include ependymomas, lipomas, hemangiomas, metastatic deposits, paragangliomas, nerve sheath myxomas, and vascular tumors.\[2\] Spinal cord tumors can cause different signs and symptoms, especially as tumors grow. The tumors may affect spinal cord or the nerve roots, blood vessels or bones of spine. Signs and symptoms may include: Pain at the site of the tumor due to tumor growth Back pain, often radiating to other parts of body Feeling less sensitive to pain, heat and cold Loss of bowel or bladder function Difficulty walking, muscle weakness .

MRI is the investigation of choice,however other investigation such CT or X ray are important to ensure stability of the vertebral column and the optimal management is gross total excision for symptomatic lesions.\[3,4\] Over the years, there has been no significant change in the clinical symptoms and pathology of IDEM tumors. However, there have been dramatic improvements in the diagnosis and treatment with the advances of radiological and surgical techniques. Despite advances in operative techniques and neuroimaging, the morbidity associated with the resection of IDEM tumors continues to be significant \[5,6\].

Here, we examined the surgical outcomes of 20 patients with IDEM spinal cord tumors operated in Neurosurgery department at Sohag university Hospital
