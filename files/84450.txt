Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, Dose Escalation Phase：Dose-limiting toxicities will be reviewed as a subset of adverse events that occur within the first 28 days of dosing and meet protocol-specified criteria., Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled|Incidence of adverse events, Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to causal relationship., Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled; Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Dose Expansion Phase: Objective Response Rate (ORR) which is defined as the percentage of patients whose efficacy is confirmed as complete response(CR) or partial responses(PR), Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Duration of Response(DOR), Dose Expansion Phase: DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression, for subjects who achieve CR or PR., Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled.
Area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to the last measurable concentration AUC (0-t), Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase: AUC (0-t) = Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last measurable concentration., Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled; Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled; Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase: Time to Cmax (Tmax), Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled; Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Terminal elimination half life, Dose Escalation Phase and Dose Expansion Phase: Terminal elimination half life, Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled; Approximately 26 months since the Expansion first subject enrolled|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Dose Escalation Phase: Objective Response Rate (ORR) which is defined as the percentage of patients whose efficacy is confirmed as complete response(CR) or partial responses(PR), Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled|Duration of Response(DOR), Dose Escalation Phase: DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression, for subjects who achieve CR or PR., Approximately 24 months since the escalation first subject enrolled

This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of NB003 which comprised of a dose escalation phase to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD), and the RP2D and a dose expansion phase to further explore the safety, PK and efficacy of NB003.

The dose escalation phase will enroll patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have progressed on or had an intolerability to imatinib and other standard of cares (SoCs) or refused other SoCs, and patients with advanced malignancies other than GIST that harbors KIT or PDGFRα gene alterations who have relapsed or have refractory disease without an available effective therapy. The number of patients to be enrolled during the dose escalation part will vary depending on the underlining dose-toxicity curve and the number of dose levels tested prior to reaching MTD or MAD. After the MTD or MAD has been determined, based on emerging safety/PK data, one or more putative RP2D(s) will be explored in dose escalation phase with approximately 15 patients for each provisional RP2D(s) to establish the RP2D for dose expansion phase. This step will be regarded as RP2D confirmation part of dose escalation phase.

In the dose expansion phase, additional patients will be enrolled to further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and biological activity of NB003 in specific disease cohorts, including GIST and other malignancies harboring genomic alterations of KIT or PDGFRα. Dose expansion phase is planned to investigate NB003 at the RP2D determined from dose escalation phase.
