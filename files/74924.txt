The Cxbladder Monitoring Study
The aim of this trial is to determine the performance characteristics of the Cxbladder test for the detection of recurrent urothelial carcinoma (UC) in patients with a recent history of urinary tract UC, who have been treated according to standard practice and are undergoing routine investigative cystoscopy.

The gold standard for determination of clinical truth is cystoscopy, plus any follow up investigations relating to the current visit.
Urothelial Carcinoma
OTHER: Cxbladder
Proportion of participants with bladder cancer who are correctly identified as having cancer (true positives) and no cancer (true negatives) by the Cxbladder test., The Cxbladder test results will be compared to that of cystoscopy, which is the gold standard method for diagnosing urothelial cancer; the true positive and true negative rates will be measured, along with the false positive and false negative rates of the test. The results will be reported as sensitivity and specificity of the Cxbladder test for detecting urothelial cancer in patients with recurrent disease., The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.|Probability that patients identified as having cancer and no cancer by the Cxbladder test truly have cancer (positive predictive value; PPV), and truly have no cancer (negative predictive value; NPV) respectively., The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.
Comparison of the Cxbladder test's sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV with that of Cytology., Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) of the Cxbladder test for detecting recurring urothelial cancer will be compared to urine cytology, in addition to the gold standard test (cystoscopy). All comparator tests will be carried out on the same voided urine sample used for Cxbladder tests., The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.|Comparison of the Cxbladder test's sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV with that of NMP22 ELISA Assay., Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) of the Cxbladder test for detecting recurring urothelial cancer will be compared to NMP22 ELISA, in addition to the gold standard test (cystoscopy). All comparator tests will be carried out on the same voided urine sample used for Cxbladder tests., The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.|Comparison of the Cxbladder test's sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV with that of NMP22 BladderChek Assay., Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) of the Cxbladder test for detecting recurring urothelial cancer will be compared to NMP22 BladderChek, in addition to the gold standard test (cystoscopy). All comparator tests will be carried out on the same voided urine sample used for Cxbladder tests., The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.
