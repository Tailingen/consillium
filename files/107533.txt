Study of Outcomes After Surgery/Treatment to Treat Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to create a registry of older patients undergoing surgical and/or medical treatment for bladder cancer. The registry will record side-effect and outcomes related to the treatment using different surveys and biological measures.
Bladder Cancer
OTHER: Collect Blood and Survey Instruments
To collect the number of changes in functional status, surgical complications and survival status collected in a prospective database of patients undergoing a radical cystectomy with or without chemotherapy, To collect the number of changes in functional status, surgical complications, and survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder following radical cystectomy with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a prospective database (to be called the PORCH database- "Prospective Outcomes of Radical cystectomy with or without Chemotherapy")., 1 Year
To measure associations between baseline measures with post-surgery and 90 day outcome measures, Measure the association of all baseline measures with the outcomes of complications post-surgery and 90 day mortality for the 25 patients entered into the database who complete the GA and FACT-Bl questionnaires., 2 years|To count changes over the course of treatment for components of the GA, the FACT-Bl, p16, and other clinical characteristics., 2 years
The primary purpose of this protocol is to create a registry of elderly patients with high-risk invasive bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with or without preoperative chemotherapy.

Secondary objectives will include an exploration of the association between functional status, surgical complications, and laboratory markers with complications and survival. In addition, exploratory analyses may evaluate the association of expression of the senescence marker p16INK4a and the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment.

Patients will be asked to complete a Geriatric Assessment (GA) and FACT-Bl serially over the course of the study in order to evaluate their functional status and quality of life during the course of treatment. Additionally, complications will be tracked in an inpatient and outpatient setting using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) complications grading system.
