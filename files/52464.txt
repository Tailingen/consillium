Phase II Trial Of Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel +/- OGX-427 In Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the overall survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus OGX-427 or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus placebo.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: OGX-427|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival, Overall survival defined as the time, in months, from date of randomization until date of death or date last known alive whichever comes first, assessed up to 2 years., Up to 2 years
Progression-Free Survival, The time (in months) that patients are progression-free, assessed from date of randomization to date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression is defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Every 8 weeks up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate defined as the percent of patients having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR=complete disappearance of all target lesions. PR=decrease in baseline of 30% or more of the diameter(s) of all target lesions., Every 8 weeks for up to 2 years
Patients with pancreatic cancer usually present with inoperable disease and systemic therapy becomes the primary form of treatment. The combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel represents an appropriate front-line standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, poor outcomes with this disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that OGX-427 has shown promising activity in pancreatic cancer. In this trial, we will compare the overall survival of patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer using OGX-427 with either gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or a placebo with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.
