In Vivo Proof-of-principle Study of Raman Spectroscopy in Trial Participants With Bladder Tumours
The purpose with this clinical investigation is to perform Raman spectroscopy inside the vivid bladder and to acquire Raman spectra of normal and tumour bladder tissue, and in a post-processing step to determine the grade of the tumor.
Endoscopic Bladder Cancer Diagnosis With Raman
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Raman Spectrometry
Diagnosis of tumor grade by Raman spectometry, To achieve a clinical useful concordance between gold standard histo/cytopathological diagnosis and the information provided through Raman spectroscopy., 4 weeks
To evaluate feasibility of handling the diagnostic optic equipment (MIB RAMAN SYSTEM), the Raman probe and the software, when the urologist examines the bladder for lesions., Examine results on the sensitivity and specificity for "diagnosis" (normal tissue/tumour) in 30 trial participants using the developed MIB RAMAN SYSTEM., 4 weeks
The purpose with this clinical investigation is to perform Raman spectroscopy inside the vivid bladder and to acquire Raman spectra of normal and tumour bladder tissue, and in a post-processing step to determine the grade of the bladder tumor.

The recordings and overall results will be compared to standard histo/cytopathological examination of urological tissue to achieve a clinical useful concordance between gold standard histo/cytopathological diagnosis and diagnostic information established by Raman.

The MIB RAMAN SYSTEM in combination with a Raman probe will be used in the operating theatre at Herlev/Copenhagen hospital urology department, where the rigid resectoscopes will be used while the trial participant is under general anesthesia. Each measurement takes about 1-5 seconds and the whole procedure with the fiber optic probes is expected to prolong the operation with 10-15 minutes.
