* Primary objective: use ORR to evaluate the effectiveness of ZPR in treating R/R DLBCL patients
* Secondary objective: Evaluate the safety of ZPR treatment for R/R DLBCL patients
* The subjects received 6 cycles of ZPR regimen, one cycle every 21 days. Then Zanubrutinib alone will continue to be used until Zanubrutinib has been used for 1 year or the disease progresses or the adverse effects, death, withdrawal of informed consent or study termination.
