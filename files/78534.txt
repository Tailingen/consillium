FOLFOX + Immunotherapy With Intrahepatic Oxaliplatin for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
In this trial chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX with intrahepatic administration of oxaliplatin is combined with immunotherapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab) for the group of patients with multiple liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Investigators hope to increase the disease-free survival after 3 years from 10 % to 30%.

Exploratory analysis of immunological response in tumor tissue, Composition of immune infiltrates in order to define the immune cell subsets present within FFPE tumor tissue before and after exposure to therapy., Tumor tissue samples taken at baseline and week 16|Explorative analysis of biomarkers predictive of response to the combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab in combination with FOLFOX, Biomarker analyses include, but are not limited to a range of molecules with different characteristics such as DNA, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs), RNA, microRNA, proteins and metabolites, Blood samples are drawn at baseline through study completion (up to 3 years)
