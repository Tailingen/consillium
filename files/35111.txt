Darbepoetin Alpha in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
This is an evaluation of the effectiveness of darbepoetin alpha in treating anemia of MDS patients with an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score of low or intermediate 1.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Darbepoetin
Erythroid response at 12 weeks according to IWG 2000 (major and minor hematologic improvement) and IWG 2006 criteria
Tolerability and safety of darbepoetin alpha|Rate of progression to more severe MDS, with higher IPSS (int 2 or high), or to AML during the treatment and follow-up periods|Overall survival|Quality of life during the study, using the FACT-An and SF36 questionnaires by comparison to pre-treatment values|Overall physical performance as measured by VO2max, 6 minute walk test and the "short physical performance battery" test
Inclusion of MDS with IPSS low or int-1 and hemoglobin \< 10/dL.

Study drug: Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) 500 microg every two weeks subcutaneously during 12 weeks, combined to filgrastim 300 microg twice weekly for an additional 12 weeks in non responders.

Response will be evaluated at 12 weeks. Patients with major or minor erythroid response (HI-E major or minor according to IWG 2000 criteria) will be continued on Aranesp. In non-responders, an additional 12 weeks of Aranesp at the same dosing, combined to Filgrastim (300 ug twice weekly, then adjusted to maintain WBC between 5000 and 10000/mm3) will be proposed. In case of response, the treatment will be continued for a total duration of 24 months. If Hb level reaches levels \> 13 g/dl at any time, Aranesp should be discontinued until Hb levels are less than 12 g/dl. Aranesp should then be resumed at 500 Âµg/injection every 3 weeks. Intervals between injections should be further increased by one week every time they lead to Hb levels \> 13 g/dl. The purpose of this dose adjustment is to reach the Aranesp schedule allowing a maintenance Hb level between 11 and 12 g/dl.
