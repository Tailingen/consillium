This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of E-602 in subjects with advanced cancers.

Phase 1 of the study consists of dose escalation cohorts of E-602 as a monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab. Dose escalation will utilize a modified 3+3 design. Any Phase 1 cohort may be backfilled, up to a total of 15 subjects to obtain additional safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data at a particular dose level. Phase 1 will treat subjects with melanoma, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, gastric/esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer, head and neck cancer, or urothelial cancer. The safety and pharmacodynamic data will be evaluated to identify the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose level for E-602 as monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab.

Phase 2 consists of dose-expansion disease cohorts in subjects with 3 types of advanced tumors: melanoma, NSCLC, and a third type to be determined (ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, breast, gastric/EGJ, head and neck, or urothelial) based on available data. Phase 2 includes cohorts of E-602 as monotherapy and E-602 in combination with camiplimab. For each cohort in Phase 2, Simon's minimax 2-stage design will be used.

The study is seeking to enroll a total of up to 273 subjects (up to 87 in Phase 1 and up to 186 in Phase 2). Subjects will participate in the study for about 16 months.
