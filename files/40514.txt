Electrochemoterapy With Bleomycin for the Treatment of Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
Electrochemotherapy is a type of electroporation that allows the delivery of drugs to the cells through the local creation of pores in the cell membrane. The electric pulses can be applied directly to the neoplastic cells, allowing for the local concentration of a possible chemotherapeutic agent administered through the bloodstream. This technique does not use heat nor other thermal energies and it is performed using special needles/electrodes linked to a generator ("porator").

In this study this technique will be applied on unresectable pancreatic cancer, already submitted to neoadjuvant treatment and still unresectable, through laparotomy. Bleomycin will be the chemotherapeutic agent.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: Electrochemotherapy with Bleomycin
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Number of adverse events related with electrochemotherapy (within 12 months after treatment) are registered and analyzed according to the CTCAE version 4.0. Complications are distinct in early (during hospitalization) and late (bile duct stenosis) that may appear during follow-up, through study completion, 1 year
