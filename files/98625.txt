Open-label Extended Access Program on Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone in Chinese Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Who Participated in CC-5013-MM021 for at Least 1 Year
CC5013-MM024 is a multicenter, open-label, Extended Access Program (EAP) of lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone regimen in Chinese subjects with relapsed or refractory MM who participated in Study CC-5013-MM-021. For subjects who remained progression free under Rd treatment of Study CC-5013-MM-02 1, this LAP offers the option to continue lenalidomide treatment for subjects who have shown therapeutic benefit.

DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the electronic case report form (eCRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. An overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate terms., approximately 4 years

After subjects who are still on treatment have completed at least 1 year of therapy in Study CC-5013-MM-021 (from the start date of lenalidomide treatment), the EAP will allow consented subjects who (1) have remained progression free under Rd treatment in Study CC-SO I3-MM-02 I to roll over to the Treatment Phase of the LAP to continue Rd treatment, and (2) have discontinued Rd therapy and are currently in the Long-Term Follow-up Phase in Study CC-5013-MM-021 to roll over to the Safety Follow-up Phase of the EAP for survival and SPM outcomes. The maximum duration of this LAP program is at least 5 years from the time the last on-study
