ST1968 Intravenous (Weekly) in Solid Tumors
ST1968 is a novel camptothecin derivative which interacts with topoisomerase I-DNA complex, inducing S-Phase specific cytotoxicity. It is endowed with a potent antitumor activity and an increased Therapeutic Index with respect to the clinically used analogues (i.e.irinotecan and topotecan) in some xenograft models (ovary, colon, head \& neck, cervix). Anti-tumor activity has been also noted in platinum resistant ovarian cell xenografts and in topoisomerase I mutant prostate cell lines. The acceptable toxicity profile in animals and the activity in camptothecin-resistant cell lines make ST1968 a good candidate for clinical trials.

DRUG: ST1968
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ST1968 given I.V. once every week for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks and MTD of ST1968 given I.V. once every 3 weeks, 2/6 patients with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) at the first cycle (21 days), 21 days
Adverse events, physical examination and laboratory tests (hematology and biochemistry) as a measure of safety and tolerability, safety assessments (routine physical examinations and laboratory evaluations) and severity of adverse events based on the NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V. 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE), 21 days of each cycle of therapy|Tumor response, objective tumor response based on RECIST criteria, 4 weeks|Tmax, Cmax, AUC0-24, AUC-last, T1/2,CL, full blood and urine PK, 21 days
Multicenter, open label, uncontrolled Phase I pharmacokinetic trial to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ST1968 given intravenously (I.V.) once every week for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks and the MTD of ST1968 given I.V. once every 3 weeks. A starting dose of 1.5mg/m2 given as a flat dose of 2.5mg is defined, given once on Day 1, Day 8 every 21 Days (D1, D8 Q21D schedule), over 2 h. Starting dose for the Day 1 every 21 Days (D1 Q21D schedule) has to be determined from the MTD of D1, D8 Q21D schedule.

Plasma, urine pharmacokinetics in all patients (minimum of 3 pts for each cohort) during the first cycle of treatment and in at least 6 patients at the Recommended Dose (RD).

During the study any hints of anti-tumor activity will also be evaluated by RECIST criteria.
