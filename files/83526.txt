Role of Fibirnogen Like Protein 2 as Aprognostic Factor in High Grade Glioma
The study population was selected from high grade glioma pateints attending the Department of Clinical Oncology, Assiut University hospital during the period from December 2018 to September 2020, we analyzed human high grade gliomas paraffin block for FLG2 expression

Rple of FGL2in high grade glioma as aprognostic factor, Correlation between FLG2 expression and progression free survival and overall survival, baseline
Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, and despite aggressive treatment, it is incurable Patient prognosis differs considerably within the different World Health Organization (WHO) grades, poorest prognosis for patients with the grade IV tumour- the glioblastoma multiform (GBM).

Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2),regulates both innate and adaptive immunity. FGL2 is a 439 amino acid secreted protein that is similar to the β- and γ-chains of fibrinogen.

Secreted FGL2 (sFGL2) is the key regulator in immunosuppression may play important role in malignant transformation of low to high by inhibiting the proliferation of T cell Study the role of fibrinogen-like protein2 on Immunosuppression and progression ，free survival and overall survival in high grade glioma
