Evaluating Race Specific AGE Accumulation As a Behavioral Biomarker Prostate Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to show that reduction in advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) is associated with the beneficial regulation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) mediated tumor response which may correlate with improved quality of life in PCa survivors. AGEs are produced by the body and are affected by lifestyle, weight and diet.
