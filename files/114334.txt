A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of JCAR017 to Standard of Care in Adult Subjects With High-risk, Transplant-eligible Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center trial in adult subjects with Relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to compare safety and efficacy between the standard of care (SOC) strategy versus JCAR017 (also known as lisocabtagene maraleucel or liso-cel). Subjects will be randomized to either receive SOC (Arm A) or to receive JCAR017 (Arm B).

All subjects randomized to Arm A will receive Standard of care (SOC) salvage therapy (R-DHAP, RICE or R-GDP) as per physician's choice before proceeding to High dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Subjects from Arm A may be allowed to cross over and receive JCAR017 upon confirmation of an EFS event.

Subjects randomized to Arm B will receive Lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy followed by JCAR017 infusion.

Event-free survival (EFS), Time from randomization to death from any cause, progressive disease (PD), failure to achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or start of new antineoplastic therapy due to efficacy concerns, whichever occurs first, Approximately 3 years

This scale addresses symptoms and functional limitations (15 item) that are important to lymphoma patients., Approximately 3 years|Reasons for hospital resource utilization, Will be assessed based on reasons for hospitalization, Approximately 3 years|Rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), Rate of completion of HDCT and HSCT, Approximately 3 years|Frequency of hospital resource utilization, Will be assessed based on frequency of hospitalizations calculated as, inpatient days, intensive care unit (ICU) days, outpatient visits days, Approximately 3 years|Hospital resource utilization (HRU), Will be assessed based on frequency of hospitalizations calculated as, inpatient days, intensive care unit (ICU) days, outpatient visits days and reasons for hospitalization, Approximately 3 years
