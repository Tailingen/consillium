Trial Involving Subjects Over 70 Years of Age With Non Small-cell Lung Cancer of Stage IV and Comparing a "Classical" Strategy of Treatment Allocation, With an"Optimized" Strategy Allocating the Same Treatments
This is a phase III randomized multicenter study involving subjects over 70 years of age with non small-cell lung cancer of IV and a PS of 0, 1 or 2, who have not previously received chemotherapy. The aim is to validate the use of a simplified geriatric scale (SGS) as a screening tool. If the SGS results are normal, the patient will be treated with dual-agent therapy based on platinum (carboplatin + pemetrexed if the histology is non epidermoid, carboplatin + gemcitabin if the histology is epidermoid), with no further geriatric assessment. When the SGS reveals abnormalities, a comprehensive geriatric evaluation (CGE) will be used to define two subpopulations on Balducci's fragility scale, who will receive either monotherapy (docetaxel) or best supportive care.

The strategy based on the SGS will be compared with a treatment algorithm based on standard criteria (PS and age), with no specific geriatric assessment. The main endpoint is the time to treatment failure. The SGS is composed of the Charlson co-morbidity scale, functional assessment based on PS, Katz' ADL scale, Lawton's simplified IADL scale, simplified cognitive assessment with the mini-MMSE according to Schultz-Larsen, a geriatric depression scale (GDS 5), and screening for a geriatric syndrome defined by the existence of dementia, repeated falls, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The SGS will be validated by comparison with the CGE, that will be administered systematically at enrollment. All the SGS items are included in the CGE.

Secondary endpoints will be quality of life (measured with the LCSS and EuroQoL questionnaires), overall survival, the objective response rate, and toxicity. The investigators will also study the predictive power of nutritional indices such as the PINI and the Buzby score with respect to survival, the treatment response, and tolerability.
Non Small-cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Dual-agent therapy or docetaxel alone or best supportive care
Time to failure Defined from the date of inclusion to the date of documented progression Or death of any cause Or trial exit for toxicity considered unacceptable by the patient or by the investigator Or withdrawal of consent, date of documented progression up to 6 months
