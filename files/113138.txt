ORR as assessed by investigator per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with measurable disease at baseline who achieved a BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Duration of Response as assessed by investigator per RECIST version 1.1, Duration of Response is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the date of the first documentation of objective PD, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Disease Control Rate as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1, Disease Control Rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a Best Overall Response of confirmed complete response, confirmed partial response, or stable disease., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Progression-free Survival as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Progression-free Survival is defined as the time interval from the date of the start of study treatment to the earlier of the dates of the first documentation of objective PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Time to Response as assessed by investigator per RECIST Version 1.1, Time to Response is defined as the time from the date of the start of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of objective response (confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response), At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Best percentage change in the Sum of Diameters of measurable tumors, The best percentage change in the Sum of Diameters of measurable tumors is defined as the percentage change in the smallest Sum of Diameters from all postbaseline tumor assessments, taking as reference the baseline Sum of Diameters., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of the start of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause, At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Plasma/Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Dato-DXd, Total anti-TROP2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a. Serum concentrations of durvalumab and MEDI5752, AZD2936, MEDI5752 and AZD7789., Cmax = Maximum concentration, At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Plasma/Serum Concentration (Tmax) of Dato-DXd, Total anti-TROP2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a., Tmax = time to reach maximum concentration., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of Dato-DXd, Total anti-TROP2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a., Area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to last quantifiable time (AUClast) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during dosing interval (AUCtau) will be assessed., At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Prevalence of Dato-Dxd, durvalumab, AZD2936, MEDI5752 and AZD7789 ADA, ADA prevalence is defined as the proportion of all participants having ADA at any point in time (including pre-existing ADA at baseline and treatment-emergent ADA), At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).|Incidence of Dato-DXd, durvalumab, AZD2936, MEDI5752 and AZD7789 ADA, ADA incidence is defined as the proportion of participants having treatment-emergent ADA during the study period, At the time of the final analysis (when all participants have either discontinued the study or the last participant enrolled in the study has completed at least 9 months of follow-up, approximately 60 months).
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of Dato-DXd in combination with immunotherapy with or without 4 cycles of carboplatin in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

Two dose levels of Dato-DXd will be studied in combination with immunotherapy (durvalumab, AZD2936, MEDI5752, or AZD7789) with or without 4 cycles of carboplatin in 15 study cohorts

Each cohort will start with Part 1 (dose escalation or confirmation), where 3 to 9 participants will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first cycle of treatment. if the DLT incidence rate meets the criteria based on the modified toxicity probability interval-2 (mTPI-2), then Part 2 (dose expansion) may be opened.
