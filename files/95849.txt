Study Comparing Conventional and Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment Interventions for Colorectal Cancer
A new notion"Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" for colorectal cancer is thought with several benefits such as shorter hospitalization stay and less costs. This randomized study aims to compare the differences between conventional and Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment for colorectal cancer in hospitalization day, complications, costs and quality of life.
Length of Stay|Complications|Adverse Drug Event|Quality of Life|Hospital Costs
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer|DRUG: XELOX Chemotherapy|DRUG: mFolfox6 chemotherapy|OTHER: Fast Track Perioperative Treatment|OTHER: Conventional Perioperative Treatment|PROCEDURE: Open Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
hospitalization day, The overall hospitalization stay during treatment from the first day in hospital to leave hospital when finish adjuvant chemotherapy or surgery (for patients who don't need chemotherapy)., 6-month post surgery
surgical complications, Surgical complications include injury of ureter, intraoperative transfusion, infection of incision and anastomotic leakage etc., 3-month post surgery|chemotherapy related adverse event, Chemotherapy related adverse event, according to NCI CTCAE Version 3.0, include nausea, vomit, diarrhea and neutropenia etc., 6-month post surgery|quality of life, Quality of life will be measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionaire., preoperation, 3-month post surgery and 6-month post surgery|hospitalization costs, The overall hospitalization costs from the first day in hospital to day that adjuvant chemotherapy finished., 6-month post surgery
Laparoscopic Surgery, Fast Track Treatment and XELOX Chemotherapy have been introduced in the treatment of colorectal cancer. All of these procedures are contributed to reduce the hospitalization stay. However, the most economical mode for combination of these procedures is still unclear. This is a randomized controlled study, a new notion"Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment" is proposed, which is the combination of the Laparoscopic Surgery, Fast track perioperative treatment during perioperative period and XELOX Chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to compare the Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment with the conventional treatment(Open Surgery with conventional treatment during perioperative period and mFolfox6 chemotherapy) for colorectal cancer on several aspects like the average hospitalization day, complications, costs and quality of life.The focus of the study will be to investigate whether the Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment reduces hospital stay with similar complications compared with conventional perioperative treatment. Moreover, the trial will clarify whether laparoscopic surgery is essential for Fast Track Multi-Discipline Treatment.
