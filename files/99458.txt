Phase I Study VG2025 as a Single Agent and in Combination Therapy With Nivolumab in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial using standard 3+3 dose-escalation design in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. All patients within a given dose level cohort will be treated with the same dose schedule of VG2025, administered as intratumoral injections at Day 1 and Day 15 biweekly at each treatment cycle (monotherapy cohorts 1-4 and combination cohort 1) and on day 1 and either day 2 or day 3 at the first 2 cycles followed by day 1 only at subsequent cycles (combination cohort 2). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period is for 4 weeks, from the start of treatment, Day 1, through Day 28.

There are two parts to this study a monotherapy arm and a combination therapy arm. In the monotherapy arm the patients will receive VG2025 only. In the combination therapy arm the patients will receive VG2025 and Nivolumab
