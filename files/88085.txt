CTLA-4 and PD-1 Antibodies Expressing MUC1-CAR-T Cells for MUC1 Positive Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a single-arm, open-label, one center clinical study, to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express immune checkpoint antibodies (CTLA-4 and PD-1) and chimeric antigen receptor targeting MUC1 in adult patients with MUC1 positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 expressing MUC1-CAR-T
Safety of infusion of autologous CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-targeted CAR-T cells, Determine the toxicity profile of CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-targeted CAR-T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 2 years
The efficacy of the treatment using CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-CAR-T cells for advanced solid tumors, The efficacy of the treatment is assessed according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor version 1.1 (RECIST1.1), which is defined as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD)., 2 years
Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which tumor progresses or the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years|Change of life quality, Life quality is assessed before and after the treatment., 2 years|Proliferation and persistence of MUC1 specific CAR-T cells in peripheral blood of the patients after treatment, CAR-T proportion in peripheral blood of the patients is detected by flow cytometry assay to study the proliferation and persistence of MUC1 specific CAR-T cells., 6 months|CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies level in peripheral blood of the patients after treatment, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies level are detected by ELISA assay to asess the expressing level of CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies from CAR-T cells., 6 months
This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the safety and efficacy of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing MUC1-CAR-T for patients with MUC1 positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MUC1-CAR-T can specificly and effectively kill the MUC1 positive cancer cells, CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies are secreted from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, and then activated and engineered to express CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor targeting MUC1. Cells are proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion. A total of 40 patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months.
