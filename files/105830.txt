Chidamide + Regorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This open-label, phase Ib/II, multicenter study evaluated the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of chidamide in combination with regorafenib in patients with HCC. Chidamide, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, functions as a tumor inhibitor. Regorafenib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved as second-line systemic treatment for HCC patients.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: Regorafenib
Adverse event (AE), To analyze the frequency, percentage of patients with study medications of adverse events, From the first day of treatment until progressive disease or death, assessed up to 12 months|Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) / maximum feasible dose (MFD), To assess tolerability/feasible of study medications dose, From start of treatment Cycle1 Day1 until completion of one cycle of treatment (maximum 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics profiles - (AUC0-t), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time t(AUC0-t), Blood samples collected on Days 1-4 and 18-21 of Cycle 1, pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose (28 days/cycle)|Pharmacokinetics profiles - (AUC0-∞), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity(AUC0-∞), Blood samples collected on Days 1-4 and 18-21 of Cycle 1, pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose (28 days/cycle)|Pharmacokinetics profiles - (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration(Cmax), Blood samples collected on Days 1-4 and 18-21 of Cycle 1, pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose (28 days/cycle)|Pharmacokinetics profiles - (Tmax), Time to maximum plasma concentration(Tmax), Blood samples collected on Days 1-4 and 18-21 of Cycle 1, pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose (28 days/cycle)|Pharmacokinetics profiles - (T1/2), Half-life(T1/2), Blood samples collected on Days 1-4 and 18-21 of Cycle 1, pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose (28 days/cycle)|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with CR and PR of total number of analysis set, Objective Response Rate is assessed every 8 weeks from start of treatment until progressive disease is documented (approximately 6 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from first day of dosing until the date of first objective disease progression or death, From the first day of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months
Overall survival (OS), The time from the first day of dosing until the date of death, 1 year|Time to progression (TTP), The time from the first day of dosing until the date of progression, 1 year
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase Ib/II study, which includes a Part I (phase Ib) and a Cohort Expansion part (Part II; phase II). Part I of the study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK profiles, efficacy, and PD biomarkers of the study medications in patients with HCC. Part II of the study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and PD biomarkers.
