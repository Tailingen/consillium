A Study of Pevonedistat and Venetoclax Combined With Azacitidine to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Adults Unable to Receive Intensive Chemotherapy
The main aim is to see how the combination of pevonedistat + venetoclax + azacitidine compares to venetoclax + azacitidine in adults recently diagnosed with AML who are unable to be treated with intensive chemotherapy.

Participants will receive either pevonedistat + venetoclax + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine in 28-day treatment cycles. Bone marrow samples (biopsy) will be collected throughout the study. Pevonedistat will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion and Azacitidine will be given through IV or subcutaneous (under the skin).

Study treatments may continue as long as the participant is receiving benefit from it. Participants may choose to stop treatment at any time.

The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to treat people who have AML. This study will compare the improvement in EFS in Arm A: Pevonedistat + Venetoclax + Azacitidine combination arm group when compared with Arm B: Venetoclax + Azacitidine.

The study will enroll approximately 164 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles and which will remain disclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study:

* Pevonedistat 20 mg/m\^2 + Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400mg) + Azacitidine 75 mg/m\^2
* Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400 mg) + Azacitidine 75 mg/m\^2

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 3 years. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner.
