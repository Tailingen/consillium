Everolimus in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: everolimus
Rate of non-progression after 3 months of treatment with everolimus as assessed by RECIST criteria, 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Estimate the rate of non-progression after 3 months of treatment with everolimus in patients with relapsed or metastatic endometrial cancer.

Secondary

* Evaluate the partial and complete response rate after 3 months of treatment with everolimus in these patients.
* Evaluate the duration of response in these patients.
* Evaluate the clinical benefit after 6 months of treatment with everolimus in these patients.
* Evaluate the time to progression in these patients.
* Evaluate the progression-free and overall survival of these patients.
* Evaluate the nature, frequency, and severity of side effects of everolimus in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral everolimus daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.
