A Phase I/II Trial of the MUC1 Inhibitor, GO-203-2C in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This research study is studying a targeted therapy known as GO-203-2C as a possible treatment for with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) both alone and in combination with decitabine. GO-203-2c targets cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unaffected.This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, in Relapse|Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: GO-203-2c|DRUG: GO-203-2c + Decitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose of GO-203-2c, Phase I, 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose of GO-203-2c in combination with decitabine, Phase 1, 28 days
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 2 years|To investigate whether GO-203-2c alone and in combination with decitabine is effective in targeting MUC1-C overexpressing AML progenitor cells in the lab, 2 Years|To assess whether in vitro response to GO-203-2c alone and in combination with decitabine is associated with clinical response, 2 Years|To determine if therapy with GO-203-2c alone and in combination with decitabine results in decreased engraftment potential of AML progenitor cells in an NSG mouse model, 2 Years|To determine if therapy GO-203-2c in combination with decitabine results in at least 20% of patients achieving a clinical response, To determine if therapy GO-203-2c in combination with decitabine results in at least 20% of patients achieving a clinical response (blast response, minor response, partial response, or complete response)., 2 years
* Phase I

  * The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in the phase I section of the trial.
  * Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to GO-203-2c.
  * After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study. The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.
  * A subsequent dose escalation will evaluate the combination of GO-203-2c and decitabine.
* Phase II

  * The primary goal is to determine if the combination of the two drugs results in clinical response
