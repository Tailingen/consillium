TraMel-WT: A Trial of Trametinib in Patients With Advanced Pretreated BRAFV600 Wild-type Melanoma
This phase 2 trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib and dabrafenib in patients with advanced BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) wild-type melanoma (stratified according to BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS (neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog) mutant and BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma patients) that have been pretreated and progressed following treatment with PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitors. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with trametinib will result in objective antitumor activity. In order to improve the tolerability and optimize the dose intensity of trametinib, a minimal dose of dabrafenib will be added to prevent and manage trametinib-related skin toxicity.

This will be a non-randomized stratified dual-arm open-label two-stage single-centre phase 2 trial.

Patients are eligible if they are diagnosed with BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) wild-type unresectable AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage III or IV melanoma and are documented with progression of disease following treatment with a PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitor or who have a contraindication for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Patients will be considered for study participation not earlier than 4 weeks after the last dosing of the prior therapy.

Patients will be stratified according to their NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog) mutation status: arm A involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS mutant melanoma; arm B involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma.

All patients will be treated with trametinib 2 mg once a day and dabrafenib 50 mg twice a day. Throughout their study participation, patients will be continuously monitored for safety and evaluated for tumor response every 8 weeks or sooner if there is clinical suspicion of progressive disease. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

The primary endpoint of the study is the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.
