A Study of Androgen Receptor (AR) Antagonist Apalutamide in Chinese Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single dose and multiple dose treatment and the safety of apalutamide in Chinese participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at dose of 240 milligram (mg).
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Apalutamide
Plasma Concentration of Apalutamide, Plasma concentration of apalutamide will be reported., Predose; postdose up to 168 hours (hrs) (Cycle1 Day 7), Cycle 2 (pre-dose; on Day 1 and 15 of cycle 2) and Cycle 3 (pre-dose; up to 24 hrs post-dose). Each cycle is of 28 days|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Up to 30 days of last study treatment (approximately 18 months)
Change from Baseline in Serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) at Weeks 4 and 12, Change from baseline in serum PSA levels will be determined., Baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 or earlier for those who discontinue therapy (up to approximately 4 months).|Maximal Decline in Prostate Specific Antigen, Maximal decline in PSA levels will be determined., Up to 30 days of last study treatment (approximately 18 months)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single dose and multiple dose treatment and the safety of apalutamide in Chinese participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at dose of 240 milligram (mg).
