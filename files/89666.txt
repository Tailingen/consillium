The Safety and Efficacy of Specific TIL-TCM Cells for Advanced Relapse-refractory or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of specific TIL-TCM cells for advanced relapse-refractory or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Adoptive TIL-TCM transfer therapy
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of specific TIL-TCM cells in the Treatment of patients with advanced relapse-refractory or metastatic pancreatic cancer, Baseline up to 28 days after TIL-TCM cells infusion|Maximum Tolerated Dose（MTD）, To evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of specific TIL-TCM cells in the Treatment of patients with advanced relapse-refractory or metastatic pancreatic cancer, Baseline up to 28 days after TIL-TCM cells infusion|incidence of adverse events( AE )and Serious adverse events(SAE), Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria., up to 72 weeks after TIL-TCM cells infusion
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a clinical response (objective tumor regression).ORR is computed by: the sum of the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) and number of patients with Partial Response (PR) / total number of patients. The total number of patients is the sum of the number of patients with CR, PR, stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) is used as the criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears (CR), shrinks (PR), stays the same (SD) or gets bigger (PD)., 18 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is the time between the initial response to treatment per RECIST v1.1 and subsequent disease progression among patients achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). RECIST v1.1 is used as the criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears (CR) or shrinks (PR)., 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is the length of time from the date patient enrolled in to the date on which tumor progresses or the patient dies for any cause., 18 months
This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study.This study is indicated for advanced relapse-refractory or metastatic pancreatic cancer.The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
