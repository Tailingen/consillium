Tumor-agnostic Precision Immuno-oncology and Somatic Targeting Rational for You (TAPISTRY) Platform Study
TAPISTRY is a Phase II, global, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or in rational, specified combinations in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors determined to harbor specific oncogenic genomic alterations or who are tumor mutational burden (TMB)-high as identified by a validated next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. Participants with solid tumors will be treated with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their NGS assay results at screening. Participants will be assigned to the appropriate cohort based on their genetic alteration(s). Treatment will be assigned on the basis of relevant oncogenotype, will have cohort-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, and, unless otherwise specified, will continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue, or death, whichever occurs first.
