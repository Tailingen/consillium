Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation in Children
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol is being designed to offer ovarian tissue cryopreservation to female pediatric patients (birth-17 years of age) with fertility threatening medical diagnoses or facing surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may cause loss of reproductive potential. Because this procedure is currently considered experimental, the establishment of an IRB protocol under which this opportunity can be offered is needed.
