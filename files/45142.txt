Psychoeducation for Patients Who Have Undergone Mastectomy|Mastectomy
BEHAVIORAL: Psychoeducation program
Breast Cancer Body Image Scale (BCBIS), The scale comprises 43 items (32 positively worded and 11 negatively worded) divided into two sections. Section 1 uses a five-point Likert scale: "Strongly disagree" (1), "Disagree" (2), "Neutral" (3), "Agree" (4), and "Strongly agree" (5). Section 2 also employs a five-point Likert scale: "Never" (1), "Rarely" (2), "Sometimes" (3), "Usually" (4), and "Always" (5). Negatively worded items are reverse-scored. The total score ranges between 43 and 215, and there is no established cutoff point; higher scores indicate a higher level of body image disturbance. The scale consists of six subdimensions. The Cronbach's α for the overall scale was reported to be 0.67., 12 weeks|Female Sexual Life Quality Scale (SQoL-F), This 18-item scale has a six-point Likert format and was designed to be self-administered by women aged 18 and older. Participants are instructed to respond based on their sexual experiences during the past four weeks. Items are scored as follows: "Completely agree" (1), "Mostly agree" (2), "Somewhat agree" (3), "Somewhat disagree" (4), "Mostly disagree" (5), and "Completely disagree" (6). Before computing the total score (ranging from 18 to 108), responses to items 1, 5, 9, 13, and 18 are reverse-scored. The final score is converted to a scale out of 100, and a higher score indicates better sexual quality of life. The Cronbach's α for the overall scale is 0.83., 12 weeks
Method: This randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups was conducted between October 2023 and January 2025 in the general surgery clinic of a university hospital. The sample consisted of 63 patients (31 in the psychoeducation group and 32 in the control group). Data collection was conducted using the Patient Information Form, the Breast Cancer Body Image Scale (BCBIS), and the Sexual Quality of Life-Female (SQoL-F) questionnaire. Following the pretest administered to all participants, patients in the psychoeducation group received a 6-week psychoeducation program (90 minutes per week). After the completion of the 6-week intervention, a 4-week waiting period was implemented, after which the posttest was administered to all participants. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square test, t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, ANOVA, and Bonferroni post hoc tests.
