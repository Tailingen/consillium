Disease progression will be determined as per response criteria., From Start of the Study up to Study Termination (approximately up to 18 Months).|Overall Survival Time, Overall survival time is defined as the time from the treatment start to the date of death due to any reason., From Start of the Study up to Study Termination (approximately up to 18 Months).|Time to Peak Concentration (Tmax) of Panobinostat, Tmax is defined as the time at which the Cmax occurs. It will be obtained from the Tmax parameter calculated by WinNonlin®. If there is no measurable Cmax in the subject's Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, then Tmax will be missing for that subject. Tmax will be reported in units of h., Pre-dose, 0.25, 1-2, and 3-4 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Panobinostat, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed drug concentration observed in plasma over all PK sample concentrations. It will be obtained from the Cmax parameter calculated by WinNonlin®. If there is no measurable concentration in the subject's PK profile, then Cmax will be missing for that subject. Cmax will be reported in units of ng/mL., Pre-dose, 0.25, 1-2, and 3-4 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Area Under the Plasma Concentration (AUC0-24) of Panobinostat, Area under the curve (AUC) is defined as the area under concentration-time curve as a measure of drug exposure. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours., Pre-dose, 0.25, 1-2, and 3-4 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Last Observed Plasma Concentration (Clast) of Panobinostat, Clast is defined as the Last observed (quantifiable) plasma concentration (Clast), in units of ng/mL. Blood samples were collected to assess Clast., Pre-dose, 0.25, 1-2, and 3-4 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 8|Time of Clast (Tlast) of Panobinostat, Time of Clast (Tlast) will be obtained from the Tlast parameter calculated by WinNonlin®. If there is no measurable concentration in the subject's PK profile, then Tlast will be missing for that participants. Tlast will be reported in units of h., Pre-dose, 0.25, 1-2, and 3-4 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 8|QT Interval (QTc) in Participants Receiving Oral Panobinostat at Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value, QTc monitoring was performed on specified days (Cycle1: Day1, 5 and 26), as well as a single pre-dose ECG once weekly during Cycle1: Week2 and Week3, Cycle2, and all subsequent cycles. Patient eligibility was ensured by a screening QTcF interval calculated by eResearchTechnology(eRT) prior to the baseline assessments. Treatment decisions were based on QTc determined by the automated reading at the investigational site (commonly used the Bazett's correction,QTcB) or measured and calculated by trained personnel at the site. Dosing relied on the investigator's assessment of the 6 baseline ECGs (the average of the 6pre-dose QTc intervals) performed prior to Cycle1/Day1 dosing, of the 3pre-dose ECGs during Cycle1:Day5 and 26, and of the single pre-dose ECGs performed once weekly for the remaining weeks of Cycle1 and subsequent cycles. The Baseline and Change From Baseline to Extreme Value QTcF interval for analysis was calculated by eRT based on the 6 baseline ECGs obtained on Cycle1/Day1., From Start of the Study up to Study Termination (approximately up to 18 Months).|Safety and Tolerability of Panobinostat, Adverse Events (AE) are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards, From Start of the Study up to Study Termination (approximately up to 18 Months).
study was designed to assess the hematologic response associated with treatment of oral panobinostat. Hematologic response is defined as the overall of complete hematologic response (CHR), and of no evidence of leukemia (NEL) and of the return to chronic phase (RTC). Hematologic responses were to be confirmed after 4 weeks, and all criteria listed below for each type of response were to be concomitantly met to result into a response.
