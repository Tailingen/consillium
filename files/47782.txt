Study of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Cabozantinib in Patients With Cutaneous Melanoma
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and progression free survival of the triplet combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab + cabozantinib in patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractory metastatic cutaneous melanoma.
Refractory Cutaneous Melanoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Cabozantinib
Progression Free Survival of the Triplet Combination of Ipilimumab + Nivolumab + Cabozantinib in Patients With Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Refractory Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma, Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time between the date of enrollment and the first date of documented progression (per iRECIST), as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 7 Months
Safety/Tolerability (CTCAE v5.0), Number of patients who reported incidence of grade â‰¥3 treatment related adverse events., 13 Months|Overall Survival, Number of patients who reached the 12 month overall survival timepoint., 12 Months
This is a phase II, single arm, single institution clinical trial. Eligible adults with anti-PD-1 refractory, unresectable/metastatic cutaneous melanoma will be treated with the triplet combination of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg + nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in addition to cabozantinib 40 mg/day. For cycles 5+, treatment will consist of nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks in combination with cabozantinib 40 mg/day. The total duration of therapy will be 24 months or until either disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable drug-related toxicity. Regular tumor assessments should be performed to determine if PD is present.
