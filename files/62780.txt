Evaluation of a Novel Optical Microscope With a Deep Depth of Field (DeepDOF) to Provide Histologic-quality Images on Cervical Biopsies and Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) Specimens at the Point-of-care
All patients will be enrolled in Mozambique and Brazil. They will provide informed consent to use their cervical biopsy and/or LEEP specimens for imaging with DeepDOF prior to sending for standard of care processing and interpretation.
Cervical Cancer|HIV
DEVICE: DeepDOF Images
Primary Out Measures, Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

1. Evaluate the diagnostic performance of the DeepDOF digital histopathology platform compared with standard histopathology in cervical biopsies and/or LEEP specimens.
2. Compare performance characteristics between WLWH and HIV-negative women.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Evaluate the ability of pathologists to provide a diagnostic evaluation of cervical biopsies and LEEP margins using digital DeepDOF images.
2. Develop DeepDOF algorithms for automated diagnostic evaluation of cervical biopsies and LEEP margins.
