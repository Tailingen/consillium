A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Mosunetuzumab in Combination With Lenalidomide in Comparison to Rituximab in Combination With Lenalidomide With a US Extension of Mosunetuzumab in Combination With Lenalidomide in Participants With Follicular Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mosunetuzumab in combination with lenalidomide (M + Len) compared to rituximab in combination with lenalidomide (R + Len) in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least one line of prior systemic therapy.
