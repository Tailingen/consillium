Mass Balance, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Study of Alisertib
The purpose of this study is to assess the mass balance (i.e. cumulative excretion of total radioactivity \[TRA\] in urine and feces) of alisertib and pharmacokinetic (PK) of alisertib in plasma and urine, and of TRA in plasma and whole blood.

Percentage of Alisertib Metabolites in Plasma Following a Single Dose of [^14C]-Alisertib Oral Solution, Total radioactive peak distributions of metabolites in 0 to 192 hours pooled plasma samples from participants., Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose (0 to 192 hours)|Percentage of Alisertib Metabolites in Urine Following a Single Dose of [^14C]-Alisertib Oral Solution, Total radioactive peak distributions of metabolites in 0 to 192 hours pooled urine samples from participants., Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose (0 to 192 hours)|Percentage of Alisertib Metabolites in Feces Following a Single Dose of [^14C]-Alisertib Oral Solution, Total radioactive peak distributions of metabolites in 0 to 192 hours pooled fecal samples from participants., Predose and multiple timepoints post-dose (0 to 192 hours)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was defined as any AE at any dose that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (Up to 117 days)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes or Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Values Reported as AEs, An abnormal laboratory was assessed to be an AE if the value lead to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or was considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change from Baseline., Part A: Day 1 and End of Study (EOS) Day 31 if not continuing to Part B, Part B: Days 8 and 15 of each cycle and EOS (Up to 117 days)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes or Abnormalities in Vital Sign Measurements, Vital signs included body temperature, heart rate, and sitting blood pressure. The investigator determined if the changes were clinically significant., Part A: Day 1 and EOS (Day 31 if not continuing to Part B), Part B: Day 1 of each cycle and EOS (Up to 117 days)
The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib (MLN8237). Alisertib is being tested to treat participants who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. This study looked at mass balance, pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, elimination and safety of alisertib.

The study enrolled 3 patients. The study consisted of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Participants received:

* \[\^14C\]-alisertib 35 mg in Part A
* alisertib 50 mg in Part B

Participants were asked to take a single dose of \[\^14C\]-alisertib oral solution containing 80-100 μCi of total radioactivity (1.19-1.48 mCi/mmol) in Part A and alisertib 50 mg, orally, twice daily for 7 days in 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in Part B.

This single center trial was conducted in United States. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 117 days. Participants remained confined to clinic in Part A and made multiple visits to the clinic in Part B. Participants were contacted 30 days after last dose of alisertib in Part A (if not continuing in Part B), or were contacted by telephone or a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of alisertib in Part B for a follow-up assessment.
