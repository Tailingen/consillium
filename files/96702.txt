Oral Pazopanib Plus Oral Topotecan Metronomic Antiangiogenic Therapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (A) Without Prior Bevacizumab Exposure and (B) After Failing Prior Bevacizumab
Background:

Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor. The drug pazopanib is used to treat people with a type of kidney cancer. Topotecan is used to treat lung cancer. Both topotecan and pazopanib have individually been used to treat patients with glioblastoma and some anti-tumor activity has been found. Researchers want to see if these two drugs together may be able to help people with glioblastoma.

Objectives:

To learn if pazopanib with topotecan can help control glioblastoma. Also, to study the safety of this drug combination.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old whose glioblastoma has returned after treatment.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood and urine tests

Brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) For these, participants lay in a machine that takes pictures.

Chest CT scan or x-ray

Heart electrocardiogram (EKG)

A questionnaire about quality of life

Participants will be assigned to a study group.

Participants will take the study drugs for 28-day cycles for up to 1 year. They will take capsules of topotecan by mouth once every day. They will take tablets of pazopanib by mouth once every day.

Participants will write in a diary the times they take the study drugs.

Participants will have several study visits during each cycle. These may include

Blood pressure measurement

Blood and urine tests

EKG

Physical exam and/or neurological exam

Brain MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease

A symptom questionnaire

At the end of treatment, participants will have a physical exam. They may have blood drawn.

Participants will have follow-up calls once every 3 months to check.

Proportion of Patients That Have Progressive Survival (PFS) at Six Months From Patient Registration for Bevacizumab Naive Patients and PFS at 3 Months for Patients With Prior Bevacizumab Treatment, PFS was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival curve methodology. For participants with no prior bevacizumab exposure, PFS is defined as 2 or more participants who are progression free at 6 months. For participants with prior bevacizumab exposure, PFS is defined as 1 or more participants who are progression free at 3 months. Progression is a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) or clear worsening of evaluable disease or the appearance of any new lesions., six months from patient registration for bevacizumab naive patients, and 3 months from patient registration for patients with prior bevacizumab treatment
Overall Survival, OS was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival curve methodology and is defined as the time from date of registration to date of death due to any cause., From date of registration to date of death due to any cause, up to 5 years.|Mean Symptom Severity Score Between Responders and Non-responders at Baseline and by Cycle, Responders and Non-Responders symptom presence and severity were assessed by the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) questionnaire using an scale of (0-10); 0 being not present and 10 being the worst, and Responders were defined as patients with stable disease (SD) and partial response (PR) as their best response, and Non-responders were defined as patients with disease progression (PD) as their best response. Partial response is greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesion. Progressive disease is a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease). And stable disease does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression., Baseline, and Cycles 1-6|Mean Symptom Interference Score Between Responders and Non-responders at Baseline and by Cycle, Responders and Non-Responders symptom interference was assessed by the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) questionnaire that determined how much general activity, mood, work inside and outside the home, relations with other people, walking and enjoying life interfered with a participant's life rated on an scale (0-10); 0 being not present and 10 being the worst. Responders were defined as patients with stable disease (SD) and partial response (PR) as their best response, and Non-responders were defined as patients with disease progression (PD) as their best response. Partial response is greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesion. Progressive disease is a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease). And stable disease does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression., Baseline, and Cycles 1-6|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 20 months and 18 days for the first Arm/Group, and 28 months and 23 days for the second Arm/Group.
Background

* Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal treatment,consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective.
* Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months of 0%.
* Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-Kit, and was recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
* Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha inhibitor with reasonably high central nervous system (CNS)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration
* Recent pre-clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor vasculature (both existing capillary endothelial cells and circulating bone marrow derived endothelial cell precursors), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF-1 alpha inhibition, and the induction of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Further support for the combination comes from recent data tying drug-induced VEGF inhibition to the induction of HIF-1 alpha activity in GBM suggesting possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan
* The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in

animal models

Objectives

* 6 month progression free survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group A).

Design

This is a 2 arm phase II trial of the combination of topotecan and pazopanib in patients with recurrent GBM or GS. Patients will be enrolled into one of the following groups: (A) Glioblastoma or gliosarcoma with no prior bevacizumab exposure: (B) Glioblastoma or

gliosarcoma with prior bevacizumab exposure. Topotecan and pazopanib are administered orally daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) at six months from patient registration for bevacizumab na(SqrRoot) ve patients and progression free survival (PFS) at 3 months for patients with prior bevacizumab treatment.
