A Randomized Phase II/Genomic Trial of Two Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients With Resected Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Determine the relapse-free survival of resected pancreatic cancer patients following two novel regimens with activity in advanced disease.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Abraxane|DRUG: FOLFIRINOX|RADIATION: Chemoradiation
Number of Participants With Relapse-free Survival, In this small trial we will regard a median progression-free survival of 20 months as indicative of potential therapeutic benefit meriting additional study., 20 months
This trial is a randomized Phase II study of FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine/abraxane in patients with completely resected pancreatic cancer (Stages I-III). Patients will receive eight weeks of chemotherapy, then 5-FU/radiation, then another 8 weeks.
