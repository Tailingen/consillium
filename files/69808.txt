Place of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Patients ≥ 75 Years Care, With Breast Cancer, After Screening With FOG (Oncology Geriatric Filter)
The risk of diagnosis of cancer increases with age, especially breast cancer in elderly women. Elderly population is heterogeneous, regarding physiological reserves, comorbidities, disability and geriatric conditions. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional approach to determine geriatric profile, in helping the therapeutic strategy. In-patients with diagnosis of cancer are screened with the FOG (oncology geriatric filter), to identify vulnerable subjects who may benefit from CGA. This scale of ten questions includes geriatric domains such as functional status, nutrition, mood, cognitive abilities and comorbidities. In elderly patients with breast cancer considered as fit (FOG=0), CGA is not necessary before adjuvant treatment. In vulnerable patients (FOG ≤ 1 and \< 3), CGA is held in routine to discuss the adjuvant therapy feasibility. Patients with FOG ≥ 4 underwent CGA if palliative care is considered.

Patients in the intermediate group (FOG 1-3) are randomized to determine time of CGA, before or after surgery.

The aims of this study are to assess the outcomes regarding the time of CGA, in elderly female patients with breast cancer management, and to define the optimal place of CGA in care pathway.
