A Phase 1 of CTX-8371 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study of CTX-8371 administered as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

This Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic profile of CTX-8371 monotherapy. Preliminary anti-tumor activity of CTX-8371 will also be assessed. The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts: Dose escalation and Dose expansion. The Dose Escalation Cohort will utilize a 3+3 design to evaluate five dose levels (0.1-10 mg/kg) of CTX-8371 given as an IV infusion once every 2 weeks. Patients in the Dose Expansion Cohort will receive CTX-8371 as an IV infusion at a dose(s) based on data from the Dose Escalation Cohort.
