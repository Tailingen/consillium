A Phase I-II Study of HM781-36B Combined With Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in HER-2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
\[Phase I\] The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) of HM781-36B(Poziotinib)combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab

\[Phase II\] The main objective of this study is to evaluate anticancer activity through determination of response rate of HM781-36B(Poziotinib)combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer
HER-2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
DRUG: HM781-36B(Poziotinib)|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Safety evaluation(phase I), Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Maximum tolerance dose (MTD), DLT will be evaluated on Day 21 during cycle 1
Efficacy evaluation(Phase II), Efficacy evaluation; phase II (Simon's two-stage minimax design): Disease Control Rate (CR, PR, SD), PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of Overall Response), Efficacy will be evaluated every 6 weeks or 9 weeks
Besides the main objectives, there are other objectives as follows:

\[Phase I\]

1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab
2. To evaluate anticancer activity of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2 positive advanced gastric cancer
3. To evaluate PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of Overall Response)

\[Phase II\]

1. To assess the safety, tolerability of HM781-36B(Poziotinib) combined with Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab
2. To evaluate tumor response through determination of disease control rate , PFS(Progression-Free Survival), TTP (Time To Tumor Progression), and DOR (Duration of Overall Response)
