Pressurized Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) Applied to Platinum-Resistant Recurrence of Ovarian Tumor
Patients with first recurrent resistance ovarian cancer and disease progression with peritoneal carcinomatosis will undergo PIPAC procedure. The primary end point is to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of a pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with a combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin.
Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Recurrent|Platinum-resistant
DEVICE: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) according to RECIST/GCOG criteria after three cycles of PIPAC with PIPAC cisplatin and doxorubicin, Evaluation of target lesions will be done as follows:

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase, 12-18 weeks
The median time to progression according to RECIST criteria after three cycles of PIPAC with cisplatin, From the last chemotherapy cycle to the first clinical-radiological signs of disease relapse, 1 Year|Fagotti score, as assessed by laparoscopy, 1 Year|The degree of histological regression assessed by pathological review of repeated peritoneal biopsies, 1 Year|The proportion of women with a reduction of serum CA-125 of at least 50% after PIPAC, 1 Year|Evaluation of the Quality Of Life (QOL) on the basis of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaires, Quality of life will be assess using the EORTC quality of life questionnaire core-36 (QLQC-30) and the ovarian cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-Ov28).These will be complete before and after the first, second, and third PIPAC applications, 1 year
This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of PIPAC using cisplatin and doxorubicin in women with first recurrent resistance ovarian cancer and disease progression with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The primary objective of this study is to determine the Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) according to RECIST/GCOG criteria after three cycles of PIPAC with PIPAC cisplatin and doxorubicin
