7-Hydroxystaurosporine and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Solid Tumors or Triple Negative Breast Cancer (Currently Accruing Only Triple-negative Breast Cancer Patients Since 6/8/2007)
This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving 7-hydroxystaurosporine together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (currently enrolling only patients with triple-negative breast cancer since 6/8/2007). Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving 7-hydroxystaurosporine together with irinotecan hydrochloride may help kill more cancer cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) and irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) in patients with resistant solid tumors. (Part I \[closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007\]) II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (Part I \[closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007\]) III. Determine the types of toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. (Part I \[closed to accrual as of 6/8/2007\]) IV.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

PART I: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and 7-hydroxystaurosporine IV over 3 hours on days 2 and 23. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan hydrochloride and 7-hydroxystaurosporine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Blood samples are collected periodically during study treatment.

PART II: (treatment of triple negative recurrent breast cancer): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV and 7-hydroxystaurosporine IV as in part I at the MTD and undergo blood sample collection.
