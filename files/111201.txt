Phase II of Efficacy and Toxicity of Maintenance Sub. Rituximab After Induction in Relapsed MCL and Non-eligible HSCT
1. Primary endpoint: Time to relapse/progression (TTP) after achieving a complete or partial response with the (R-GemOxD)-induction therapy
2. Secondary endpoints:

   1. Quality of response obtained after subcutaneous Rituximab maintenance.
   2. Progression-Free Survival (PFS)
   3. Overall Survival (OS)
   4. Time to Next Therapy (TTNT)
   5. Value of MRD in the disease outcome
   6. Toxicity
Mantle-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: subcutaneous Rituximab
Time to progression, (Measured from achievement of response -partial or complete- to to disease progression), 2 years after last patient randomized in maintenance, 2 YEARS
This is a phase II trial evaluating the role of maintenance with subcutaneous Rituximab in patients with stage II-IV relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma with complete or partial response after the administration of a salvage regimen with R-GemOx-D.

Before the study start and in order to standardize the results, the same R-GemOx-D salvage regimen will be used: Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 on day 1, Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 on day 2 (over 30 minutes) and Oxaliplatin: 100 mg/m2 on day 2 (over 3 hours), Dexamethasone 20 mg on day 1-3. Cycles should be repeated every 14 days, up to 8 cycles.

Patients who present a complete or partial response, after the salvage therapy, will start the study receiving subcutaneous Rituximab maintenance at dose of: 1400 mg every 2 months for 2 years; the study treatment will start 6-8 weeks after finishing the salvage therapy.

Patients will be evaluated every 2 months during treatment study phase and every 4 months in the follow up phase. More details in Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)
