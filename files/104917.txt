Study of NUV-422 in Adults With Recurrent or Refractory High-grade Gliomas and Solid Tumors
At the time of study termination, NUV-422-02 was a first-in-human, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NUV-422. The study population comprised adults with recurrent or refractory high-grade gliomas (HGGs), metastatic breast cancer (mBC), with and without brain metastases, and recurrent or refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). All patients self-administered NUV-422 orally in 28-day cycles until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.
