A Randomized, Controlled Phase III Trial of Sorafenib With or Without cTACE in Patients With Advanced HCC
This is a randomized, multi-center, open-labeled, phase III study in patients with advanced HCC. A total of 338 patients will be randomized (1:1) into one of the two treatment arms, to receive sorafenib with (Arm Combination-treatment; Arm C) or without (Arm Sorafenib alone treatment; Arm S) cTACE.

All the patients will be initially given sorafenib within 72 hours after the randomization. Treatment should continue until the criteria for treatment discontinuation are met.

After the treatment period, patients will undergo follow up for survival every 12 weeks (±7 days) from the last dose, and the survival follow up will be performed for at least 1.5 years after the last patient's last treatment.
Advanced Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization (cTACE)
The overall survival (OS) of oral sorafenib given as monotherapy daily compared to sorafenib with combination cTACE in subjects, 3.5 years
Time to progression (TTP)in patients, 3.5 years|Tumor response rate (TRR)in patients, 3.5 years|Progression free survival(PFS)will be evaluated, 3.5 years|Evaluation of adverse events, 3.5 years
The superiority of the Arm C (cTACE+Sorafenib) over the Arm S (Sorafenib) in the OS period will be verified in the ITT set and FAS using a stratified log-rank test. Stratification factors consist of mUICC stage (III vs. IV), Vascular invasion (none and Vp1-2 vs. Vp3-4 and any other presence), Child-Pugh score (5 vs. 6-7), serum AFP level (≥200 ng/mL vs. \<200 ng/mL). The significance level is 5% (one-sided).
