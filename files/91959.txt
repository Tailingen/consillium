Cancer Stem Cells in Acute Leukemia
Descriptive study of acute leukemia patients. Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood samples will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing for novel gene signatures and variations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory elements such as ARID5B and SALL4 variants.
