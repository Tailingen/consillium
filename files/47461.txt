Pegzilarginase and Pembrolizumab for Extensive Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to determine the safety and efficacy of pegzilarginase in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with ED-SCLC who have relapsed or progressive disease on or within 6 months of platinum-based chemotherapy.
Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pegzilarginase|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
1. Phase 1: Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1. Number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., Estimated up to 6 months|Phase 2: Efficacy determined by Objective Response Rate (ORR:CR+PR) per RECIST 1.1., 1. Objective Response Rate (ORR:) per RECIST 1.1

â€¢ The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best objective response (BOR) is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR will be derived from the BOR according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator., Estimated up to 6 months
Objective Response Rate, Percentage of patients whose cancer achieves either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., At 9, 18, and 27 weeks after first dose and every 12 weeks thereafter up to 24 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD), lasting at least 8 weeks., At 18 and 27 weeks after first dose and every 12 weeks thereafter up to 24 months|Time to Response, Time (weeks) from first treatment to the first documented CR or PR., At 9, 18, and 27 weeks after first dose and every 12 weeks thereafter up to 24 months|Duration of Response, Time (weeks) from first documented CR or PR, until disease progression (PD)., At 18 and 27 weeks after first dose and every 12 weeks thereafter up to 24 months|Progression free survival, Time (weeks) from first treatment to first observation of PD or death from any cause., From first treatment up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Time (weeks) from first treatment to death due to any cause., From first treatment up to 24 months|Phase 2: Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., From first treatment up to 24 months
