OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the prevalence of insomnia, extent of sleep disturbance, and possible contributing factors to sleep disturbance in head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.

OUTLINE: Patients complete a demographic survey and a questionnaire packet comprising The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, The Head and Neck Symptom Survey, Profile of Mood States, Suspected Causes of Insomnia Survey, and a Quality of Life Survey on day 1 of chemoradiotherapy to obtain baseline data on sleep quality, possible causes of sleep disruption, head and neck symptoms, mood state, fatigue, quality of life, and patient demographics. Questionnaires are administered weekly thereafter during therapy visits for up to 6-7 weeks and take 15-30 minutes to complete.

Medical records are reviewed to obtain information regarding medications and tumor- and treatment-related variables.
