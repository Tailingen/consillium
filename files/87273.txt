Safety and Feasibility of Surgery After Conversion Therapy for Locally Advanced and Advanced NSCLC
Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide and the mortality ranks first in the world. In recent years, with the development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the overall survival of lung cancer patients has improved significantly. However, the inoperable advanced tumor remains the main reason for the poor prognosis of lung cancer. Thus, we aim to carry out this single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgery after conversion therapy for locally advanced and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Previous studies have shown that selective surgery after conversion therapy is feasible and safe in locally advanced or stage IV patients, and indicates potential benefits for these patients. However, surgery after conversion therapy is difficult and has high risk of postoperative complications which requires strict operation indications and patient screening. At present, there are only relevant retrospective studies and no prospective evidence. Therefore, our team plans to carry out this single-arm prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of surgery in patients with locally advanced and advanced non-small cell lung cancer after conversion therapy, so as to lay the foundation for further research and clinical application.
