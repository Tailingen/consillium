Sacituzumab Tirumotecan (MK-2870) in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab Alone in Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) â‰¥ 50% (MK-2870-007)
The primary objective of the study is to compare sacituzumab tirumotecan combined with pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab alone with respect to overall survival (OS). The primary hypothesis is that the combination of sacituzumab tirumotecan and pembrolizumab is superior to pembrolizumab alone with respect to OS.

All participants who have completed the first course of pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to an additional 9 cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy if there is blinded independent central review (BICR)-verified progressive disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) after initial treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
BIOLOGICAL: Sacituzumab tirumotecan|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to approximately 48 months
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 48 months|Objective Response (OR), The OR is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 48 months|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 48 months|Change from Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QOL) [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) 29 Items and 30] Score, Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 will be presented. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to Items 29 and 30 ("How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). A higher score indicates a better overall outcome., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change From Baseline in Dyspnea (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 8) Score, Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 8 will be presented. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant response to the question "Were you short of breath?" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates a worse level of dyspnea., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change From Baseline in Cough (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 31) Score, Change from baseline in the score of EORTC QLQ-C13 Item 31 will be presented. The EORTC QLQ-C13 is a lung cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant response to the question "Have you coughed?" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates more frequent coughing., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change From Baseline in Chest Pain (EORTC QLQ-LC13 item 40) Score, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer-specific supplemental questionnaire used in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Participant responses to the question "Have you had pain in your chest?" are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in chest pain (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 40) score will be presented. A lower score indicates a better outcome., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) Based on Change From Baseline in Global Health Status (GHS)/ QOL Score (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 29 and 30), The TTD in GHS/QOL score (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30) will be presented. Participant responses to Items 29 and 30 ("How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?") are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). A higher score indicates a better overall outcome. TTD as assessed based on a negative change (decrease in score) from Baseline in GHS/QOL score. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) Based on Change From Baseline in Dyspnea Score (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 8), The TTD in Dyspnea score (EORTC QLQ-C30 Item 8) will be presented. Participant response to the question "Were you short of breath?" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates a worse level of dyspnea. TTD is assessed based on the time to a negative change (increase in score) from baseline. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) Based on Change From Baseline in Cough Score (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 31)., The TTD in Cough score (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 31) will be presented. Participant response to the question "Have you coughed?" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates more frequent coughing. TTD is assessed based on the time to a negative change (increase in score) from baseline. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) Based on Change From Baseline in Chest Pain Score (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 40), The TTD in Chest Pain score (EORTC QLQ-LC13 Item 40) will be presented. Participant response to the question "Have you had pain in your chest?" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates a worse level of chest pain. TTD is assessed based on the time to a negative change (increase in score) from baseline. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome., Up to approximately 24 months|Percentage of Participants That Experience at Least 1 Adverse Event, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The percentage of participants who experience an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 27 months|Percentage of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, The percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented., Up to approximately 24 months
