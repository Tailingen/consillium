S0101 Gemcitabine and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer of the Esophagus
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent cancer of the esophagus.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
6-month survival rate, To assess the six-month survival rate in patients with esophageal cancer treated with a gemcitabine-irinotecan combination chemotherapy regimen., 6 months after registration
Toxicities, To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen in a Phase II study., Week 1 and Week 2 of each cycle
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the 6-month survival rate of patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with gemcitabine and irinotecan.
* Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
