The number of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities to find the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), of the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab plus fulvestrant and to confirm the AEs will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE Version v5.0. Investigators will decide the probability of the event being related to one, two or all three drugs as to whether dose modification of lenvatinib is required.MTD/RP2D of the triplet., 1 year
