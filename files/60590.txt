Postoperative Chemoradiation v.s Radiotherapy for Lymph Node Negative Cervical Cancer Patients
This phase III study is designed to examine if low-risk (lymph node negative), stage I a2-II b cervical cancer patients treated by paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiation have greater toxicities but similar survival rate as those treated by radiotherapy alone.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
disease-free survival, 3 years
overall survival, 5 years
Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria v3.0, 1 year
Cervical carcinoma is one of the most common gynecologic cancers worldwide. Concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients with high risk factors cervical cancer. However, the treatment modality in patients with low-risk (lymph node negative) is still disputable. It is not yet known whether cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy are more effective than radiotherapy alone in treating these patients.

Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone in lymph node negative patients with early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy.
