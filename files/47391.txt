Long Outcome of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Small Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (<2cm)
Data are currently insufficient to guide the management of very small gastrointestinal stromal tumors（GISTs）（\< 2 cm) discovered incidentally on endoscopy,this study is designed to collect the medical records of patients in different treatment group with long-term follow-up data,and attempts to evaluate the usefulness of regular endoscopic ultrasound（EUS）surveillance and the necessity,safety and feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection（ESD）for small GISTs,thus provide evidence for the revision of the guideline.
GIST
PROCEDURE: ESD
progression-free survival, It is the time that passes from a patient is enrolled in this clinical trial to the date on which disease "progresses" or the date on which the patient dies, from any cause., 5 years
tumor recurrence rate, The proportion of the total number of patients with recurrence of each grop, which confirmed by endoscopic and other imaging data during follow-up., 5 years|success rate of operations, The proportion of the total number of patients with GISTs been successfully resected of each group., At surgery|Tumor progression rates, The proportion of the total number of patients with tumor continuing to increase of each group., 5 years|Operation time, It is the time that passes from ESD beginning to complete resection of the tumors., At surgery|Peri-operative bleeding, The amount of bleeding during operation., At surgery|Complications rate, Complications including bleeding and perforation., At surgery|Duration of hospitalization and the total hospital costs, length of hospital stay and all costs related to the operations and examinations and the period of hospitalization., through the whole recovery, an average of 10 days|Histological curative resection, Histological curative resection is defined as complete tumor removal which confirmed by pathological assessment of resected tissue, At surgery|patient satisfaction scores, We administer questionnaires to each patients,and invite them to score for this treatment or examination., 5 years
OBJECTION:to evaluate the usefulness of regular endoscopic ultrasound（EUS） surveillance and the necessity,safety and feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection（ESD） for small GISTs(\<2cm),thus providing evidences for the revision of the guideline.

OUTLINE:This is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients are divided into 2 group with 45 in each.The experimental group undergo ESD for GISTs,while the investigators do no treatment to the control group.Then,the 2 groups will be follow up for 5 years.All data are analysed with the Statistical Product and Service Solutions（SPSS）statistical software.
