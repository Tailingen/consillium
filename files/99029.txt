Progression-free Survival, Kaplan Meier estimates of median progression-free survival according to the metastatic line of treatment, for a median follow-up of 18, 15 and 13 months, respectively, within 36 months
Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time between the treatment start (date of the first infusion of bevacizumab) and death from any cause. Kaplan Meier estimates of median overall survival were calculated for the metastatic lines of treatment, with a median follow-up of 18, 15 and 13 months, respectively., Up to 36 months|Quality of Life - Global Health Status, Participants rated their quality of life (global health status) on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C-30), with total scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)., Baseline, 6 and 12 months
