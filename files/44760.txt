Immunity Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Disease (COVID-19) in the Oncology Outpatient Setting
The COVIDOUT study will prospectively investigate the serological immunity of outpatient cancer patients to evaluate the prevalence of previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and dependency of serological immunity on systemic (chemo)therapy after COVID19 disease as well as after vaccination.
Cancer|Covid19|Immunity
Rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, 1 year|Rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity after 3, 6, 9, 12 months in previously SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, Up to 1 year|Rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity after 3, 6, 9, 12 months in previously SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated patients, Measured in percentage, Up to 1 year
Rate of unknown prior COVID19 disease in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, 1 year|Rate of cancer entities in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, 1 year|Rate of therapy modalities in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, 1 year|Subgroup analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity after 3, 6, 9, 12 months in previously SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated patients, Dependency of rate on cancer entity, therapy modality, age, sex and immune status \[Measured in percentage\], Up to 1 year|Rate of re-infection in SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive patients, Measured in percentage, 1 year
In this prospective observational study all cancer patients who are regularly treated in the Oncology Outpatient Clinic of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will be included in the study upon consent.

Data will be collected as follows:

(i) Serological antibody screening at study inclusion and every 3 months (ia) In case of vaccination monthly screening for 3 months (ii) Routine clinical data: demographic and biometric data, medical history, common laboratory parameters (iii) Patient questionnaire: assessment of past COVID-19 infection, past COVID-19 specific symptoms, social environment, vaccination

Recruitment is limited to a one-year period (December 2020 - December 2021)
