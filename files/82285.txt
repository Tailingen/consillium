DNA Methylation in Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: Analysis of Validated Biomarkers in Urine
This study explores the potential use of DNA markers in the detection of prostate cancer and patient perceptions of this screening approach and other current or future prostate cancer screening and diagnostic tests.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Prostate Carcinoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Accuracy of methylated DNA markers (MDMs) for detection of cancer of the prostate (CAP), Assessed by instances of CAP detected using MDMs assayed from urine (Phase I) and from urine and prostate fluid (collected following digital prostate massage for participants in Phase II) for detection of CAP., Baseline
Accuracy of CAP detection, Assessed by instances of CAP detected and confirmed using MDMs assayed from urine and prostate fluid., Baseline|Comparison of sample volumes, Variability of sample volumes will be assessed for DNA and MDM yield., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the accuracy of MDM candidates (individually and in combination) assayed from urine and prostatic fluid (collected following digital prostate massage) for detection of CAP.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

PHASE I: Participants undergo urine sample collection on study.

PHASE II: Participants undergo standard prostate massage and collection of prostatic fluid and urine samples on study.

All participants complete a questionnaire and have their medical records reviewed on study.
