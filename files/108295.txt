Prophylactic PEG-rhG-CSF During cCRT in LA-NSCLC
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) during definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) in patients with inoperable stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted on patients receiving definitive cCRT. The radiation therapy technique uses intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and involves field irradiation. It protects more normal tissue from exposure.Chemotherapy regimens included platinum-based doublet combinations: etoposide plus cisplatin (every 28 days), pemetrexed plus platinum (every 21 days), or paclitaxel plus platinum (weekly, only for control group) .

Patients were followed up at one month post-treatment, then every three months for the two year, and every six months thereafter until disease progression.

In the study group, patients received subcutaneous injections of PEG-rhG-CSF (6 mg for patients weighing ≥45 kg, 3 mg for patients \<45 kg) 48 hours after each chemotherapy cycle during cCRT. In the control group, patients received guideline-based supportive treatment. Radiotherapy was halted or chemotherapy was delayed when grade 3 or more (G3+) toxicities happened.

Endpoints:Primary endpoint was incidence of G3+ neutropenia during radiotherapy and one month post-radiotherapy. Complete blood counts were monitored weekly during cCRT and for one month post-treatment or as deemed necessary by the physician.

Following the completion of cCRT and the resolution of acute side effects, patients were followed up at one month post-treatment, then every three months for the first year, and every six months thereafter until disease progression.

Statistical Analysis:The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) algorithm was applied to balance differences between groups in terms of age, gender, smoking, clinical stage, KPS score, induction therapy received or not, ensuring the reliability of the study results. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (version 4.4.1). All tests were two-sided, with a P-value \<0.05 considered statistically significant.
