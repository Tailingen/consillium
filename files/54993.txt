Chemoimmunotherapy Plus Residual Lesion Irradiation for the Treatment of Extensive Stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase II trial studies the effect of chemoimmunotherapy sequential residual tumor irradiation in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Even though small cell lung cancer is initially highly responsive to first-line chemotherapy plus PD-L1 inhibitors, treatment resistance inevitably happens. Residual tumor irradiation my prolong drug resistance, and may help prevent the growth and spread of the tumor cells to other parts of the body.

RADIATION: residual tumor irradiation
progression-free survival (PFS), PFS: time to disease progression or patient death, 24 months
Overall survival (OS), OS: time to patient death, 36 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of chemoimmunotherapy sequential residual tumor irradiation in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity in extensive stage SCLC patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy squential residual tumor irradiation
