Pancreatic cancer is a devastating malignant disease with a median survival of 3-6 months and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. It is necessary to explore more treatment mode to pancreatic cancer especially advanced stage patients. This study is a prospective, randomized, open, single center phase II study. The investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment mode.
