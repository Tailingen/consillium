NLA101 in Adults Receiving High Dose Chemotherapy for AML
Phase 2 open-label, multi-center, randomized, controlled, dose-finding study of safety and efficacy of NLA101 to reduce the rate of infections associated with CIN in adult subjects with AML.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
BIOLOGICAL: NLA101|DRUG: Standard of Care (SOC) chemotherapy
Recurrent Event Rate of Grade 3 or Higher Bacterial or Fungal Infection, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later
Event rate of grade 3 or higher documented bacterial and fungal infections per cycle of chemotherapy, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later|Incidence and duration of filgrastim (or biosimilar) administration, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later|Overall Response Rate, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later|Incidence and duration of complications due to infections, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later|Incidence and duration of febrile neutropenia, From randomization through follow-up of 84 days post randomization, 30 days post last infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post last infusion of chemotherapy for Control Arm, whichever is later
Phase 2 open-label, multi-center, randomized, controlled, dose-finding study of safety and efficacy of NLA101 to reduce the rate of infections associated with chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) in adult subjects with AML.

Eligible subjects with untreated de novo or secondary AML and per local institutional standards planned to receive at least two cycles of chemotherapy with curative intent will be enrolled into the study and randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 3 Investigational Arms (Standard of Care \[SOC\] chemotherapy + low, medium, or high dose NLA101) or a Control Arm (SOC chemotherapy).

Subjects randomized to an Investigational Arm will be eligible to receive a single fixed assigned dose of NLA101 after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and up to 2 additional identical cell doses after subsequent chemotherapy cycles (one NLA101 infusion per cycle). Subjects randomized to the Control Arm will be followed for up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy.

All subjects will be followed for 84 days following randomization, or 30 days post final infusion of NLA101, or 30 days post the day after the last chemotherapy infusion for Control Arm, whichever is longer.
