Clinical and Molecular Findings in Patients With Cervical/Supraclavicular Metastasis From Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Despite the availability of highly effective endoscopy-based and computed tomography (CT)-based biopsy procedures, up to 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer potentially eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapy do not have access to a diagnosis or to a thorough molecular profiling for different reasons. Enlarged and/or positron emission tomography (PET) positive cervical/supraclavicular lymph nodes (CSLs) are ideal targets for a minimally invasive diagnosis of lung cancer through a percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy (US-NAB). However, the prevalence of metastatic involvement of CSLs in patients with advanced lung cancer was never specifically assessed. Furthermore, the possible association of malignant CSLs involvement with molecular status was never investigated, unlike what was done for several other metastatic sites.
Lung Cancer Metastatic
PROCEDURE: Needle or forceps biopsy of cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes|PROCEDURE: Needle, forceps or surgical biopsy of any lesion other than cervical and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes
Prevalence of KRAS mutation, Number of participants with KRAS mutation in the 2 groups (patients with and without cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis), 2 months
Prevalence of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET, NTRK, Number of participants with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET, NTRK mutation in the 2 groups (patients with and without cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis), 2 months|Tumor proportion score of PD-L1, Number of participants with a tumor proportion score of PD-L1 \< 1%; 1-50%; \>50% in the two groups (patients with and without cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis), 2 months|Prevalence of cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, Number of participants with cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in the whole cohort of patients with stage IV lung cancer, 2 months|Predictors of cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, Association between the presence of cervical/supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and the following factors: age, sex, smoking habit, tumor histologic type, central vs peripheral primary tumor, enlarged and/or PET positive N2 or N3 lymph nodes in the middle mediastinum, and molecular profile., 6 months
