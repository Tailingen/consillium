One-step Nucleic Acid Amplification for Detecting Lymph Node Metastasis of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The investigators main objective is to show that OSNA technique is as accurate as pathological analysis (frozen section / HE staining and immunochemistry) to detect occult lymph node metastasis (micro and macrometastasis).
