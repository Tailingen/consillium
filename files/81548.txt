Role of Senescence in the Development of Endometrial Cancer
Several molecular studies showed chromosomal alterations in patients with endometrial cancer, with gains in 1q, 19p, 19q, 8q, 10q and 10p and loss of 4q, 16q and 18q. Several genes of interest have been identified (P53, PTEN, PIK3CA, ÃŸ-catenin, K-ras ...).

A study has already been carried out at the Reims University Hospital with inclusion of patients with endometrial cancer and patients with endometrial hyperplasia. It identified specific alterations of nosologic continuum of pathology and characterize areas of interest on the genome.
