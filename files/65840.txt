Novel Listeria Vectors Secreting Gut Flora-Altering Agents to Prevent Colon Cancer and Treat Colitis
This is a simple tissue collection study with no therapeutic intent. Colon tissues will be taken from standard of care procedures. Tissues will be tested for their functions, expression of immune co-signaling molecules and reactions to transduction with recombinant Listeria vectors to assess effects on expression of B7-H1 and cytokines.
