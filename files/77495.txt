Evaluation of Neoadjuvant Xaluritamig in Localized Prostate Cancer
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of xaluritamig administered in the neoadjuvant setting followed by radical prostatectomy and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a radical prostatectomy following xaluritamig administered in the neoadjuvant setting.
