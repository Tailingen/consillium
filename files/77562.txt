Is Ibrutinib-related Atrial Fibrillation Dose Dependent
Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), has recently revolutionized the treatment of various chronic B-cell malignancies and particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Atrial fibrillation (AF) has early emerged as a cardiovascular adverse effect (CVAE) of ibrutinib but underlying mechanisms of IRAF are not fully understood.

While a dose-reduction or an interruption of ibrutinib is mentioned in the summary of product characteristics of ibrutinib, any beneficial effect on IRAF management of such a management is unclear.

The main aim of this study is to determine if IRAF is a dose-dependent CVAE in chronic B-cell malignancies patients by studying the association between ibrutinib dose and IRAF reporting in Vigibase®, the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database.

to determine the influence of ibrutinib dosing on IRAF reporting. Results were expressed as 2-by2 comparisons against the lowest dosing regimen (140mg/day)., Disproportionality estimates will be perform using both univariate and multivariate analyses and a global p-value will measure the difference between dosing regimen, Cases reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to 26th July 2023

Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), has recently revolutionized the treatment of various chronic B-cell malignancies and particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Atrial fibrillation (AF) has early emerged as a cardiovascular adverse effect (CVAE) of ibrutinib. In phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCT), ibrutinib exhibits a ≈4-fold increase-risk of AF compared with controls (pooled relative-risk (RR) 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): (2.0-7.5); p\<0.0001). The annualized incidence rate of ibrutinib-related AF (IRAF) reporting in clinical trials is estimated to 4.9 (95% CI: 2.9-8.3) per 100 person-years. IRAF risk persists throughout ibrutinib exposition and seems to be cumulative with the extension of follow-up and cardiac monitoring.

Underlying mechanisms of IRAF are not fully understood. Ibrutinib potently inhibits multiple off-target kinases at therapeutic concentrations.

While a dose-reduction or an interruption of ibrutinib is mentioned in the summary of product characteristics of ibrutinib, any beneficial effect on IRAF management of such a management is unclear.
