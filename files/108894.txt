Effect of Antineoplaston Therapy on the QT/QTc Interval In Subjects With Diffuse, Intrinsic, Brainstem Glioma
The primary objective of this protocol study is to investigate the effect of Antineoplaston therapy on the QT/QTc interval in study subjects age 3 to 21 years with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma. This investigation is to be conducted in parallel with a phase 3 efficacy and safety study of combination Antineoplaston therapy + radiation vs. radiation alone (BRI-BT-52).

Number of Participants with an Increase in the QTc interval, The mean maximum increase in QTc interval, as determined by repeated ECGs, for the Antineoplaston therapy + Radiation study group and the Radiation only study group., 6 weeks
Number of participants with Alterations in T and U Wave Morphology, Alterations in T and U wave morphology, as determined by repeated ECGs, for the Antineoplaston therapy + Radiation study group and the Radiation only study group., 6 weeks
QT/QTc interval prolongation is investigated during the first two weeks of subject participation in the parallel phase 3 study. The pre-cordial leads and lead II will be utilized to determine QT/QTc prolongation. Descriptive information is provided on changes in T and U wave morphologies. The percentage of subjects in each therapy group who have worsening of the T and U wave morphology is documented. Discrete U waves are excluded from the QT/QTc interval measurement. Except for the pre-therapy ECGs, all ECGs are performed during one ANP therapy infusion daily, that being an afternoon infusion to account for diurnal variation in the QT/QTc interval. The study subject is at rest in the supine position for 30 minutes prior to the ECG study. The baseline QTc is derived from 3 ECGs taken on day 1 during the hour preceding the first Antineoplaston therapy infusion or the first radiation session.
