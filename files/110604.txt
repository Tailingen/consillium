Study of Tisagenlecleucel in Combination With Pembrolizumab in r/r Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients
A multi-center, open-label, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the administration of tisagenlecleucel in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with r/r DLBCL who have received 2 or more lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 and anthracycline based chemotherapy and having failed to or are not candidates for ASCT. The study will consist of 2 parts: dose timing selection part and expansion part.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Tisagenlecleucel|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Percent of participants recieving pembrolizumab per protocol schedule, 21 days after first pembrolizumab infusion|Dose Timing part: Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 21 days after first pembrolizumab infusion|Expansion part: Overall response rate (ORR), 3 month post tisagenlecleucel infusion
Duration of Response (DOR), 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), 24 months|In vivo cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and other tissues by qPCR and flow cytometry, 24 months|Impact of pembrolizumab dosing strategy on the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel by qPCR and flow cytometry, 24 months|Immunogenicity measured by antibody titres specific to tisagenlecleucel molecule and by the presence of T lymphocytes activated by the tisagenlecleucel protein, 24 months
