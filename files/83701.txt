Local Ablative Therapy for Patients With Multiple (4-10) Brain Metastases
To observe the quality of life (QOL) and to report on toxicity and outcome parameters after the (repeated) use of local ablative therapy (LAT) i.e. stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for patients with multiple (4-10) brain metastases
Brain Metastases, Adult
RADIATION: Stereotactic radiotherapy

Phase IV prospective non-randomized observational trial (registry trial) for patients with a DS-GPA \> 1.5 or an estimated life expectancy of \>3 months and an established diagnosis on dedicated brain MRI of 4-10 BM of any solid primary tumor.

We plan to deliver a local ablative therapy (LAT) i.e. SRT in 1 to 5 fractions on visible BM and post-surgical cavities if applicable.

Our primary aim is to provide quality of life (QOL) data and our secondary aim is to report on several toxicity and outcome parameters for this patient cohort.
