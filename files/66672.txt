CD7-CAR-T Cells in Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory CD7+ T-ALL/LL
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, to establish the recommended dose, and to evaluate the antitumor effect of CD7-CART01 in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL).
T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD7-CART01
Safety (Phase I) and definition of the recommended dose (Phase I), To evaluate the safety of the infusion of CD7-CART01, explore the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the cellular product and define the recommended dose of CD7-CART01, defined as the maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose (MTD/RD), to be evaluated for efficacy in the phase II extension, 28 days|Antitumor effect of CD7-CART01 (Phase II), To evaluate the portion of patients achieving either BM, PB and CSF morphological complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) and with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at day 28, 28 days
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, In the phase II portion of the study, the treatment-related adverse events will be recorded, 28 days|Antitumor effect of CD7-CART01 (Phase I and II), To assess the Overall Response Rate (ORR) at day 28, 28 days|In vivo persistence of CD7-CART01 (Phase I and II), To assess the in vivo persistence of the infused T cells using immunoassays and transgene detection (flow-cytometry and Real Time qPCR), 3 years|Relative proportion and phenotype of CD3+CAR+ T cells/CD3+CAR- T cells/NK cells (Phase I and II), To assess the relative proportion and phenotype of CD3+CAR+ T cells/CD3+CAR- T cells/NK cells at day +28 and whenever it will be the case at subsequent time points, 3 years|Assessment of cumulative incidence of relapse, To assess the cumulative incidence of both molecular and morphological relapse (defined as an MRD \>10\^-4 and a BM blast percentage \> 5%, respectively), 3 years|Assessment of cumulative incidence of overall survival, To assess the cumulative incidence of overall survival at 1 and 3 years post cell infusion, 3 years|Assessment of cumulative incidence of disease-free survival, To assess the cumulative incidence of disease-free survival at 1 and 3 years post cell infusion, 3 years
This is an in-human, open-lable, single-arm, single-agent, Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients with R/R T-ALL/T-LL who have failed at least one standard frontline chemotherapy or relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The study will consist of two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. During the Dose Escalation portion of the trial (Phase 1) up to 12 patients will receive CD7-CART01, in up to 2 dose levels until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. If 2 DLTs are observed in the dose level 1 an additional DL0 will be explored. The dose escalation phase will enroll successive cohorts of 3 up to 6 patients guided by a standard dose-finding 3 + 3 design. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined, the phase 2 portion of the study will enroll at the MTD/RD identified in the phase I up to 26 pediatric patients (for both phases) and the study protocol will be amended to include additional, international centers.
