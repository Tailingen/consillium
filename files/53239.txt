Breast Cancer|Cognitive Impairment|Cognition
OTHER: no intervention
Cognition, A series of computer-based cognitive tasks will be administered via the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, Baseline
Physical Activity, Physical activity will be measured by a waist-worn accelerometer, Baseline|Diet Quality, Diet will be assessed by completion of the online-administered 2005 Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, Baseline|Body Composition (objectively measured), Body composition will be evaluated by BOD POD assessment, Baseline|Inflammatory Markers, A fasted blood sample will be collected for measurement of inflammatory markers, Baseline
Medical History, Self-reported medical history, Baseline|Quality of Life, Series of questionnaires assessing various aspects of quality of life including physical and mental health, Baseline
The current study will examine the potential relationships between physical activity, dietary intake, body composition and cognition in breast cancer cancer survivors and age-matched women without a previous cancer diagnosis. Additionally, we will measure blood inflammatory markers to explore the relationship between lifestyle factors and inflammation.

The study involves two, 1hr appointments at Texas State University. The first visit will include cognitive testing and body composition assessment. Participants will be given an activity monitor to wear for one week and a packet of questionnaires to complete at home. At the second visit, a fasted blood sample will be collected, and participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire.
