Postoperative Chemotherapy and Chemo-radiotherapy for Resected Gastric Cancer
This study will determine the feasibility of adjuvant chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy for patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastro-esophageal junction.

Patients with localized gastric cancer often relapse either locally or systemically. A strategy to reduce relapses at common sites would be beneficial. Our prior trial has proved the feasibility of administering FOLFIRI regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy combined with adjuvant chemoradiation in patients with excised with curative intend gastric cancer. It would be important to improve the treatment involving active regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and optimizing chemoradiation by introducing capecitabine as a radiosensitizer.
