Risk Factors for AKI in Patients Undergoing VATS for Pulmonary Resection
This study aims to investigate the potential factors contributing to the development of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in patients undergoing pulmonary resection with Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for lung malignancy. The study will focus on demographic data, laboratory parameters, perioperative fluid management, and haemodynamics.

The research will be conducted at SBÜ Ankara Atatürk Sanatorium Training and Research Hospital. The study will involve patients who have given informed consent and will undergo VATS with standard anaesthesia monitoring. Anaesthesia management will follow our routine protocol in our clinic.

Patients will be divided into two groups based on whether they have a more than 25% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (t-GFH) and/or a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine and/or a 6-hour urine volume of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h. The patients will be divided into two groups based on this definition, and the risk factors between these groups will be analysed.

The preoperative routine blood values, demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, and BMI), ASA physical status, smoking and alcohol habits, comorbidities, and regular medication use will be recorded. Intraoperative urine output and haemodynamic parameters will also be monitored. Routine blood gas analysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chlorine, and magnesium will be measured and recorded, along with urine output and t-GFH. Patients will be evaluated in the hospital on the day the surgeon calls for a postoperative check-up and on the 30th postoperative day to see if there are any complications.

Glomerular Filtration Rate, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time., 1 day|Serum Creatinine, The creatinine blood test measures the level of creatinine in the blood. This test is done to see how well your kidneys are working. Creatinine in the urine can be measured with a urine test. A measurement of the serum creatinine level is often used to evaluate kidney function., 1 day|Amount of Urine, The amount of urine produced per hour according to the patient's weight, 1 day
