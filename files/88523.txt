Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Very Low Risk Wilms Tumors
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from young patients with very low risk Wilms tumors.

Utility of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 mRNA expression and 11p15 methylation to define a population of pediatric patients with very low risk Wilms tumor (VLRWT) that have virtually no risk of relapse|Utility of WT-1 mutation and 11p15 loss of heterozygosity analysis to determine a population of VLRWT that have a higher risk of relapse when not treated with chemotherapy|Utility of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 mRNA expression to predict relapse in VLRWT|Feasibility of broadening the definition of VLRWT through analysis of stage I and II epithelial differentiated tumors registered on clinical trial COG-Q9401 (NWTS-5) for CUGBP2, HMGA2, MEIS2, and 11p15 methylation
OBJECTIVES:

* To validate the utility of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 mRNA expression and 11p15 methylation to define a population of pediatric patients with very low risk Wilms tumor (VLRWT) that have virtually no risk of relapse.
* To validate the utility of WT-1 mutation and 11p15 loss of heterozygosity analysis to determine a population of VLRWT that have a higher risk of relapse when not treated with chemotherapy.
* To validate the utility of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 mRNA expression to predict relapse in VLRWT.
* To investigate the feasibility of broadening the definition of VLRWT through analysis of stage I and II epithelial differentiated tumors registered on clinical trial COG-Q9401 (NWTS-5) for CUGBP2, HMGA2, MEIS2, and 11p15 methylation.

OUTLINE: Previously banked tumor tissue samples are analyzed for mRNA expression of CUGBP2, HMGA2, and MEIS2 via reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and are classified as loss of heterozygosity (LOH), loss of imprinting, or neither via 11p15 analysis. Samples are also analyzed for WT-1 mutation via quantitative PCR and 11p LOH using 11p15 methylation analysis and expression of NFYA, STRA6, TOB2, PDCD4, and SP3 via quantitative RT-PCR
