64Cu-LLP2A for Imaging Hematologic Malignancies
This phase of the protocol (protocol part B), seeks to evaluate the new formulation in healthy normal volunteers to confirm the new formulation provides comparable human dosimetry to which was seen and published in protocol part A. Additionally, the new formulation will be studied utilizing an expanded patient population to include patients with confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM), low-grade lymphoma, or MM and lymphoma patients who are status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) with negative imaging and suspected recurrence.

DRUG: 64Cu-LLP2A|DEVICE: PET/CT
Organ dosimetry of participants, Confirm organ dosimetry in healthy subjects and in patients with various hematological malignancies is consistent with prior formulation of 64Cu-LLP2A (all of Cohort 1 + up to 10 cohort 2 subjects). Average organ activity concentration will be measured, and decay corrected by utilizing regions of interest (ROIs) drawn around all organ visible on 64Cu-LLP2A images. Activity organ residence times will be calculated by numerical or analytical integration of the time-activity curves. Uptake/clearance functional fits of mono- or bi-exponential functions will be performed and analytical integration, accounted for physical decay, will be performed. The calculated residence times will be used with the program OLINDA/EXM for 64Cu and using the adult human (female and male) model to calculate the individual organ radiation dose, the whole-body dose and the effective dose., Through completion of PET/CT scans (estimated to be up to 2 days)|Safety and tolerability of new formulation of 64Cu-LLP2A as measured by number of participants with adverse events, Follow-up telephone call or in person visit to assess for self-reported adverse events associated with injection of 64Cu-LLP2A or PET/CT imaging. Additional chart review can be performed as needed., From beginning of administration of 64Cu-LLPA2A through last phone call assessment (up to 7 days total)
Evaluate the quality of PET images with new formulation 64Cu-LLP2A as measured by overall quality of PET images, Overall, PET image quality will be graded visually (using 4-point scale with 1 being the worst and poor quality, not acceptable for diagnostic interpretation and 4 being good image quality, similar to routine clinical studies), Through completion of PET/CT scans (estimated to be up to 2 days)|Evaluate the quality of PET images with new formulation 64Cu-LLP2A as measured by bone marrow uptake, As measured by placing ROI and calculating SUVmax where SUVmax is a mathematical measurement of tumor burden seen on images and calculated by the following equation SUVmax= r / (a'/w) where r= radioactivity concentration in tumor (kBq/ml) as measured by the PET scanner within a defined region of interest, a'=the decay corrected amount of injected 64Cu-LLP2A and w= weight of the patient in grams, Through completion of PET/CT scans (estimated to be up to 2 days)|Evaluate the quality of PET images with new formulation 64Cu-LLP2A as measured by tumor/background ratio, As measured by placing ROI and calculating SUVmax, Through completion of PET/CT scans (estimated to be up to 2 days)
