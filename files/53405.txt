A Study to Evaluate the Relationship of Lenalidomide With Tumor Flare Reaction and High Tumor Burden in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to investigate and characterize the association of lenalidomide with tumor flare reaction and high tumor burden in participants with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell
DRUG: Lenalidomide
To quantify and characterize the event of TFR by tumor burden in R/R MCL patients treated with lenalidomide in a real-world setting., To quantify and characterize the event of TFR by tumor burden (assessed based on the last CT scan performed within a maximum of 2 months prior to initiation of administration of lenalidomide) in R/R MCL patients treated with lenalidomide in a real-world setting., Approximately 8.5 years
To quantify and characterize the proportion of early deaths by tumor burden in R/R MCL patients treated with lenalidomide in a real-world setting, To quantify and characterize the proportion of early deaths (defined as deaths within 20 weeks of initial administration of lenalidomide) by tumor burden in R/R MCL patients treated with lenalidomide in a real-world setting., Approximately 8.5 years
This is a European multinational, retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL). Potential sites will be identified where R/R MCL participants have been treated with lenalidomide. Site inclusion will be limited to countries where lenalidomide is reimbursed for this indication.
