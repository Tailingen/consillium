LymphoVenous Anastomosis to Prevent Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema
Lymphedema is defined as a chronic condition, caused by lymphostasis. A major part in the Western world consists of iatrogenic lymphedema caused by surgery to the lymph nodes of the axilla or groin. Prophylactic lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) could be beneficial in the prevention of lymphedema of the extremities.
Lymphedema, Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Axilla dissection + Lymphovenous anastomosis
The volume via circumferential measurements: swelling < 5%, Comparing the volume of the arm at each study visit via circumferential measurements: swelling \< 5%, 2 years
The investigator is performing a blinded randomized prospective study on 80 patients undergoing an axilla dissection for their breast cancer treatment. One group will receive a LVA at the time of their axilla dissection. Other group will receive standard of care. Follow-up is 2 year.
