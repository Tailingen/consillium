Gastric Cancer Patient
Collection of data, The main objective of the study is to create a collection of clinical and laboratory data that will allow us to describe the incidence of gastric cancer in our center and to identify risk factors associated with the disease (H. pylori infection, smoking, alcohol, diet and BMI)., 2016-2020
Data interaction in the developement of gastric cancer, The secondary objective of the study is to know, analyze and describe the data collected in order to evaluate their possible interaction on the development of gastric neoplastic pathology, and to design a future prospective case-control study., 2016-2020
The corresponding medical records will be analyzed to derive information on the socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors of the included subjects. Each case will be paired with two controls chosen from patients who have performed a gastric biopsy with relative histological examination during an endoscopic examination carried out at the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Bologna.
