The Efficacy and Safety of Docetaxel Combined With Platinum for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer
This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Docetaxel combined with Platinum-based drugs compared with Docetaxel alone for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients carrying DNA repair mutation.
Hormone Sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer|DNA Damage Repair Deficiency|Chemotherapy Effect|Chemotherapeutic Toxicity
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisolone Acetate|DRUG: Platinum-based drugs
Time to Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), Time from treatment initiation to Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Patients with metastatic prostate cancer develop PCa progression during androgen deprivation therapy (or after bilateral orchiectomy), meet any of the following criteria was defined as mCRPC. 1)PSA progression (defined as elevated PSA levels(≥1ng/ml) for no less than 2 measurements at least 1 week apart); 2) Radiographic progression in soft tissues, with or without PSA progression, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; 3) Bone progression (defined as 2 or more new bone lesions on bone scans) with or without PSA progression, according to PCWG., up to 3 years
Overall survival, The survival rate of participants during follow-up time., up to 5 years|rPFS, Radiographic progression-free survival. The survival of participants without radiographic progression., up to 5 years|Time to PSA progression, PSA progression is defined as elevated PSA levels(≥2ng/ml) for no less than 2 measurements at least 1 week apart., up to 5 years|Time to subsequent anti-tumor therapy, Time from end of treatment to the time when subsequent anti-tumor therapy is needed., up to 5 years|Adverse events, All grades of adverse events will be recorded according to NCI CTCAE (v.5.0), up to 3 years
