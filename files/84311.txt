Study of Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine With or Without SBP-101 in Pancreatic Cancer
The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of standard treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine with or without SBP-101 in subjects previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), including subjects who have received prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.

This trial will enroll approximately 600 patients to evaluate the effect of SBP-101 on Overall Survival when administered with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and a placebo. Secondary endpoints include Progression-free survival, radiologic responses to treatment, and Quality of Life measures. An independent, external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety and efficacy and a planned futility analysis.
