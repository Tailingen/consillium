Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death. Up to a maximum of 32 months.
Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment related adverse events regardless of dose are reported by CTCAEv4 term and grade., AEs have been recorded from the time of consent until 30 days after treatment discontinuation of study drugs or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first, up to a maximum of 13 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.The CBR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a confirmed complete response, partial response or stable disease based on RECIST v1.1., Up to maximum of 32 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. PFS is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause.

PFS at 6 months is defined as the percentage of patient who was progression free at 6 months from the initiation of treatment., 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death or date of last contact., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 52 months.
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

The phase Ib dose escalation will evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG for subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The phase II trial will test whether addition of Imprime PGG to pembrolizumab will increase median progression-free survival (PFS) in second line therapy setting in NSCLC.

PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive

* Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 for Cycles 1-4
* Imprime PGG 2 mb/kg IV on Day 1 for Cycles 5-16
* Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)

Cohort 2 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive

* Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 8, 15 for Cycles 1-4
* Imprime PGG 2 mb/kg IV on Day 1 for Cycles 5-16
* Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 (cycle = 21 days)

If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of therapy, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all subjects in dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be enrolled into dose level 2 to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no further escalation beyond dose level 2.

PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

Pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle after Imprime PGG, and the RP2D dose of Imprime PGG will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will continue up to 16 cycles, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes.

Life expectancy: of 6 months or greater

The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for protocol therapy:

Hepatic:

* total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels \> 1.5 x ULN (except subject with Gilbert's Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin \< 3.0 mg/dl)
* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases
* alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic metastases

Renal:

* Serum creatinine ≤ 3 mg/dL OR
* if serum creatinine \> 3mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 20 mL/min

Hematopoietic:

* hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, subjects requiring transfusion will not be eligible to start study
* and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10\^9/L
* and platelet count ≥ 100 × 10\^9/L

Coagulation:

* INR \< 1.5 × ULN OR
* for subjects receiving anticoagulant, the subjects must, in the investigator's opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving anticoagulant therapy. The INR for subjects on warfarin should be in the therapeutic range. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is allowed.
