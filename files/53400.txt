Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of ATB-320 in Participants With Progressive or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATB-320 in patients with progressive or metastatic solid tumors
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ATB-320
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed for the DLT Analysis Set for each cohort until Cycle 1 Day 28 (C1D28) and will be discussed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)., First dose to Cycle 1 Day 28 (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose (cohort) at which no more than one out of three to six participants in a cohort experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Safety, Number of participants with AE, with abnormal physical examination findings, abnormal vital signs, abnormal ECG readings, abnormal clinical laboratory tests results, At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 28 days) and up to 14 days from the last dose of ATB-320
1. Primary objective: to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of ATB-320 in patients with progressive or metastatic solid tumors.
2. Secondary objective: to evaluate safety and tolerability of ATB-320 in patients with progressive or metastatic solid tumors.
3. Exploratory objective: to evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of ATB-320 in patients with progressive or metastatic solid tumors.
