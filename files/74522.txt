A Study of Runimotamab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Expressing Cancers
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Runimotamab administered intravenously as a single agent and in combination with Trastuzumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancers.
