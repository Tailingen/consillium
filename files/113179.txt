Multi-pronged Ethanol Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation of Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of percutaneous ethanol ablation using a multi-pronged needle (QFEA) with that of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: multi-pronged ethanol ablation|PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation
Local treatment responses, 2 years
Disease-free survivals and overall survivals, 3 years
Patients with early-stage (single tumor no more than 5 cm or up to 3 tumors each no more than 3 cm in size) primary hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomized into two percutaneous ablation treatment arms, including radiofrequency ablation and multi-pronged ethanol ablation. The local treatment responses, complications,and long-term disease-free survivals and overall survivals are analyzed.
