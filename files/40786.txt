Tumor Microenvironment Mechanism of LY007 for r/r B-NHL and the Exploration of Novel CAR-T Translational Research
The T cell characteristics of 12 patients treated with CD20 CAR-T (LY007 cell injection) were analyzed to study their relationship with CAR-T anti-tumor activity, tumor killing, and in vivo proliferation, and to explore the mechanisms: before single harvesting, before bridging, before pretreatment, D0, D7, D14, D21, D28, and at the time of follow-up evaluation (plus time points if taking BTKi inhibitors: Peripheral blood specimens were collected before BTKi and 48h after BTKi discontinuation, and peripheral blood cells from patients before and after treatment were analyzed by mass spectrometry flow and single-cell sequencing.

Tumor tissue specimens were collected from patients at different time points (before pretreatment, during CAR-T expansion, and at PD) and subjected to single-cell sequencing.
Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Expression levels of genes (known to be possible driver genes in lymphoma) analyzed from tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for DNA sequencing after quality control., Tumor tissues collected before treatment and at the point of progression if available for DNA sequencing after quality control.
