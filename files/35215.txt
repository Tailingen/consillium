Duration of one cycle is 28 days|Change in Vital Signs-ear temperature, Change in vital signs-ear temperature will be measured after the subject has been fully rested., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Change in Vital Signs-pluse rate, Change in vital signs-pluse rate will be measured after the subject has been fully rested., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Change in Vital Signs-blood pressure, Change in vital signs-blood pressure will be measured after the subject has been fully rested., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-RR interval, RR interval of 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after the patients are fully rested at each timepoint for once. RR is the standard heart rate which calculated by 60 divided by heart rate., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-QT interval, QT interval of 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after the patients are fully rested at each timepoint for once., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-QRS duration, QRS duration of 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after the patients are fully rested at each timepoint for once., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Incidence of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Test Results-hematology, Number of participants with incidence of abnormal clinical lab test results like hematology will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Incidence of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Test Results-Biochemistry, Number of participants with incidence of abnormal clinical lab test results like Biochemistry will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Incidence of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Test Results-Urinalysis, Number of participants with incidence of abnormal clinical lab test results like Urinalysis will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061|Incidence of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Test Results-Coagulation test, Number of participants with incidence of abnormal clinical lab test results like Coagulation test will be assessed., Baseline (Week 0) through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM061
7. Area under the serum concentration versus time curve within one dosing interval (AUCtau), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061 Single dose: pre-dose (within 30 minutes before administration), and 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h after administration on C0D1; Multiple dose: pre-dose (within 30 minutes before administration) on C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15; pre-dose (within 30 minutes before administration), and 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, 24 h after administration on C1D22;

The timepoints of PK sample may be adjusted base on the human PK data. The blood samples for PK analysis will be collected as much as possible if the subjects end of treatment/early withdraw., Up to 1 year|Volume of distribution (Vd), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061 For AML, the efficacy will be evaluated by using the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 criteria. The complete blood count and bone marrow will be evaluated at screening visit and every 4 weeks ± 1 week (relative to C1D1) after the start of multiple administrations until the progressive disease judged by investigator or initiate new anti-tumour therapy or subject withdraw. The assessment results are divided into complete remission (CR), CR without minimal residual disease (CRMRD-)，CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia-free state (MFLS), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD)., Up to 1 year|Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Trough concentration before the next dose is administered (Ctrough), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Time to reach maximum serum concentration (Tmax), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Clearance (CL), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Terminal half-life (T1/2), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Dose proportionality, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM061, Up to 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of LM102,The ORR, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) at any time during the study, based on Investigator assessment., Up to 1 year|Best of response (BOR), To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of LM061, Up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of LM061, Up to 1 year
This is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of LM-061 in subjects with advanced tumors.

The study schedule includes screening visit (28 days prior to accept the investigational medicinal product (IMP)), treatment visit (accept IMP for the first time to the end of treatment (EOT)/early withdrawal), and follow-up visit (28 days after the EOT/early withdrawal).
