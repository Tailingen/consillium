A Phase 3 Study of 99mTC-EC-DG SPECT/CT Versus PET/CT in Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the images of the primary lesions of lung cancer and any metastatic lesions seen from the investigational SPECT/CT 99mTC-EC-DG scans are the same as the PET/CT 18F-FDG scans.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: (99m Tc) ECDG (Ethylenedicysteine-Deoxyglucose)|DRUG: 18 F FDG followed by PET/CT imaging
Efficacy:Comparison of 99mTc-EcC-DG SPECT/CT images to 18F-FDG PET/CT images of primary lung cancer lesion and metastatic lesions, To demonstrate that SPECT/CT (99mTc EC DG) is not inferior to PET/CT (18F FDG PET/CT) for sensitivity or specificity measures when image interpretation of primary and metastatic lesions are compared against a truth standard in patients with a high likelihood of lung cancer., Images will be compared at the core image lab at approximately every 4 to 6 weeks
Safety:Through Adverse Event Collection, From 99m-Tc-EC-DG injection up to 90 days post-injection
1. To demonstrate that SPECT/CT (99mTc EC DG) is not inferior to PET/CT (18F FDG PET/CT) for sensitivity or specificity measures when image interpretation of primary and metastatic lesions are compared against a truth standard in patients with a high likelihood of lung cancer.
2. To expand the patient safety experience using 99mTc EC DG.
