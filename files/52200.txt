Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Dinaciclib (MK-7965) in Hematologic Malignancies (MK-3475-155/KEYNOTE-155)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) used in combination with dinaciclib (MK-7965) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (rrCLL), multiple myeloma (rrMM), or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL).
rrCLL|rrMM|rrDLBCL
BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: dinaciclib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs consisted of the following if observed during treatment Cycles 1 or 2 and assessed by investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to pembrolizumab or dinaciclib: grade 4 non-laboratory nonhematologic toxicity; grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting \>7 days (except thrombocytopenia); grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; grade 3 thrombocytopenia if associated with bleeding; any grade 3 non-laboratory nonhematologic toxicity, except grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, which was not considered a DLT unless lasting more than 3 days despite optimal supportive care; Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic laboratory abnormality that required medical intervention, led to hospitalization, or persisted for \>1 week; grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; any drug-related AE that caused participant to discontinue treatment during Cycles 1 or 2; grade 5 toxicity; treatment-related toxicity that caused a \>2-week delay in initiation of treatment Cycle 2 or 3. Each cycle was 21 days., Up to 42 days|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who experienced an AE was presented., Up to approximately 582 days|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Due to an Adverse Event, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study drug due to an adverse event is presented., Up to 492 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined in participants with CLL as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) guidelines (2008) as assessed by the investigator; in participants with DLBCL as the above definition but per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007) as assessed by the investigator; and in participants with MM as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed Stringent Complete Response (sCR), CR, PR, or Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR) per the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (2006) as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 26 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the time from initial response to Progressive Disease (PD) or death, whichever occurred first. A response was: in participants with CLL, a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) guidelines (2008); in participants with DLBCL, as above but per the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007); and in participants with MM, a confirmed Stringent Complete Response (sCR), CR, PR, or Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR) per the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (2006). The above guidelines also define PD by disease. Assessments were by investigator. Data were censored at last disease assessment documenting absence of PD for participants who: had no PD and were still on the trial; received antitumor treatment other than that of the trial; or were removed from trial prior to PD. DOR was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 26 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD evaluations were done based on the cancer-specific criteria of: the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) guidelines (2008) in participants with CLL; the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007) in participants with DLBCL; and the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (2006) in participants with MM. Assessments were by investigator. PFS data were censored for participants with no PD or death at their last disease assessment, or at their last disease assessment prior to starting new anticancer treatment for those who did so. PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 26 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause. Data were censored at the date of a participant's last follow-up. OS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 44 months
