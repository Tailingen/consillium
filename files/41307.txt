The ROC platform therefore represents a multicenter database and a growing source of data and information regarding cancer patients in the Campania region. The need for multicenter databases is supported by the results obtained with both retrospective and prospective studies. Many retrospective studies have led to changes in some of the available guidelines. Important advantages of this study include representativeness of the analyzed cohort to all patients with a specific cancer and a large sample size that provides sufficient statistical power to detect differences across different patient groups. The data extracted from the ROC have the potential to produce knowledge, to guide decision-making, and to manage more effectively the challenges of fighting cancer in our region. The Campania region counts more than 6 million people, and it is characterized by a worst oncological outcome compared to the average data of other Italian region: the ROC platform has the potential to analyze the effect of a public intervention in the field of oncology care. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to create a retrospective-prospective registry of all cancer patients entering the ROC platform and in a GOM path describing the primary and secondary endpoints.
