The Application of Somatosensory Interactive Pelvic Floor Muscle Training for Stress Urinary Incontinence in Men Underwent Radical Prostatectomy
The study aims to compare the efficacy of different pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) modes on improving urinary incontinence (UI) recovery in prostate cancer (PCa) patients after radical prostatectomy (RP). The methods being compared include standard PFMT (S-PFMT) , a somatosensory interactive PFMT (SI-PFMT, an enhanced PFMT) , and a standard PFMT combined with pelvic floor muscle magnetic stimulation (S-PFMT+MS). Eligible participants are randomized into either of the groups to receive different modalities of post-operative PFMT.

Subjects in the S-PFMT group received traditional verbal instructions and paper-based educational materials. For the SI-PFMT group, an interactive experiential education model was adopted. First, an educational video introduced the importance and basic information of postoperative PFMT. Then, synchronized PFMT guidance through a combination of audio and video would be used. Subjects assigned to the S-PFMT+MS group, on the basis of traditional verbal and paper-based education, pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy was applied using a pelvic floor magnetic stimulator, operated by the same experienced rehabilitation physician.

Self administered questionnaires and 1-hour pad test would be used to assess the treatment outcomes at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.
Prostate Cancer (Post Prostatectomy)
BEHAVIORAL: somatosensory interactive pelvic floor muscle training|PROCEDURE: pelvic floor magnetic stimulation therapy|BEHAVIORAL: standard pelvic floor muscle training
International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF), A higher score indicates a more severe urinary incontinence and thus a worse outcome. Reduction in score is expected for subjects with clinical improvement.

Range of score: 0 - 21 Severity of urinary incontinence: slight (1-5), moderate (6-12), severe (13-18) and very severe (19-21), 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.
