The purpose of this study is to determine whether survival can be prolonged in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who receive dasatinib with docetaxel and prednisone.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisone
Overall Survival: Time From Randomization to Date of Death, Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause (in the randomized population). If the patient did not die, survival was censored on the last date he or she was known to be alive., From randomization to death or date of last contact (maximum reached: 45 months)
Percentage of Participants With an Objective Tumor Response by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Objective tumor response rate=the percentage of randomized participants with a best tumor response of partial (PR) or complete response (CR), within 42 days of end of dosing, divided by total number of patients who were evaluable (with at least 1 target lesion at baseline). By RECIST: CR=disappearance of clinical and radiologic evidence of target and nontarget lesions confirmed by another evaluation at least 6 weeks later. PR=a \>30% or greater decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to the baseline sum LD confirmed by another evaluation at least 6 weeks later. Stable disease=neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor shrinkage to qualify for PR, and at least 8 weeks since start of study therapy. Progressive disease=a 20% or greater increase in sum of LD of all target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD at or following baseline, or unequivocal progression on existing nontarget lesions, or new lesions are present., At baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter to end of treatment, at end of treatment, and at follow-up (within 42 days of end of dosing)|Time to First Skeletal-related Event (SRE), Time to first SRE is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of first SRE (unless SRE occurred while the patient was undergoing subsequent cancer therapy). Participants with a first SRE while on subsequent cancer therapy, those who died without a reported SRE, and those who did not have an SRE were censored on the date of their last SRE assessment prior to start of subsequent cancer therapy, if any. Participants who had no SRE assessments were censored on the day they were randomized., From day of randomization to date of first SRE or to last SRE assessment, if subsequent cancer therapy begun or no SRE (maximum reached: 42 months)|Percentage of Participants With A Reduction in Urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) Level From Baseline, The percentage of participants who had an on-study uNTx value confirmed (at least 3 weeks later) within normal limits (or ≥3 and \<60 nmol/mmol creatinine, if normal limits were missing) or an on-study uNTx level reduction from baseline of ≥35%, even when on-study uNTx value remained abnormal., At baseline, prior to each docetaxel infusion (every 3 weeks) to end of treatment, at end of treatment, and at follow-up (within 14 days of end of dosing)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Those who progressed or died while on subsequent cancer therapy and those who did not die or progress were censored at their last radiologic bone scan/imaging, skeletal related-event, or tumor assessment or at measurement of prostate specific antigen levels, whichever occurred last prior to start of subsequent cancer therapy ,if any. Participants with no assessments were censored on the day of randomization., From day of randomization to disease progression or death (or to last clinical assessment, if subsequent cancer therapy started or no progression or death) (maximum reached: approximately 43 months)|Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first PSA level measurement that led to confirmed PSA progression, for participants who had not started subsequent cancer therapy. For participants who did not progress or who progressed on cancer therapy, PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the last PSA level measurement before the start of cancer therapy, if any. Participants who had no on-study PSA level measurements were censored on the day they were randomized., From randomization to date of first PSA measurement leading to confirmed PSA progression (or to last bone scan assessment, if no progression or if cancer therapy started) (maximum reached: 30 months)|Percentage of Participants With a Reduction in Pain Intensity From Baseline, The percentage of participants with a reduction in pain intensity from baseline was defined as the number of participants who achieved a 30% or more decrease in pain intensity from baseline for at least 2 consecutive pain assessments (at least 14 days apart) within 14 days of end of dosing divided by the number of randomized participants who had a baseline pain intensity of at least 2. Pain intensity was assessed based on question 3 of the brief pain inventory questionnaire., At baseline, prior to each docetaxel infusion (every 3 weeks), at end of treatment, and at follow-up (within 14 days of end of dosing)
