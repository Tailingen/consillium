A Study Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Glofitamab in Combination With Rituximab Plus Ifosfamide, Carboplatin Etoposide Phosphate in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Transplant or CAR-T Therapy Eligible Diffuse B-Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of glofitamab (glofit) in combination with rituximab plus ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE) in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who have failed one prior line of therapy incorporating an anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 antibody (i.e., rituximab) and an anthracycline, and who are transplant or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy eligible, defined as being medically eligible for intensive platinum-based salvage therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or for CAR-T therapy.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Tocilizumab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants that achieves a CR or PR within three cycles of glofit-R-ICE, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria, Up to 2.5 years
Event-free survival (EFS) after enrollment, From enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression, initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy (not including planned ASCT or CAR-T therapy), or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) (up to 2.5 years)|Progression-free survival (PFS) after enrollment, From enrollment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria (up to 2.5 years)|Mobilization-adjusted response rate (MARR), The proportion of participants treated with intent to proceed to ASCT that achieves a CR or PR within three cycles of glofit-R-ICE, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria, and additionally achieves mobilization of a minimum of 2,000,000 CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells/kg for ASCT, Up to 2.5 years|Overall survival (OS) after enrollment, From enrollment to death from any cause (up to 2.5 years)|CR rate after enrollment, defined as the proportion of participants that achieves a CR within three cycles of glofit-R-ICE, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria, Up to 2.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), From the first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria (up to 2.5 years)|Duration of complete response (DOCR), From the first occurrence of a documented complete response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) as determined by the investigator according to Lugano criteria (up to 2.5 years)|Percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs), Up to 2.5 years|Percentage of participants with cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Up to 2.5 years|Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of glofitamab, Up to 2.5 years|Minimum serum concentration (Cmin) of glofitamab, Up to 2.5 years|Percentage of participants with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), From baseline up to 2.5 years
