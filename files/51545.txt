A Study of ZN-e4 in Subjects With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of ZN-e4 administered orally in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations who have progressed while on treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent (other lines of treatment are allowed, except for other epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors \[EGFRis\]) for Phase 1; and for Phase 2, subjects who have T790M+ and are osimertinib naïve (Cohort 1), and also those who have not been treated with an EGFR Inhibitor (EGFRi) (Cohort2).
