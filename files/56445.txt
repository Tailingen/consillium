Study of KTE-X19 in Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Positive B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)
This is a Phase 2 Study is to determine the efficacy and safety rate of B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) participants in remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) after KTE-X19 CAR T-cell therapy
B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Tecartus
Relapse Free Survival (RFS), The primary endpoint is RFS, defined as the time from KTE-X19 infusion until clinical relapse or death from any cause. Patients proceeding to subsequent anti-cancer therapy, inclusive of allogeneic transplantation, without relapse will be censored in this analysis. Surviving patients not meeting criteria for relapse by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., Up to 5 years
Molecular Response Rate, Measured as converting to a complete molecular remission following CAR T-cell immunotherapy. Molecular remission is defined as having fewer than 0.0001% clonotype sequences per one million nucleated cells., Up to 5 years|Clinical Relapse Rate, Measured as \>5% lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and/or the emergence of extramedullary leukemia., Up to 5 years|Molecular Relapse Rate, Measured as achieving complete molecular remission at day 28 and followed until 5 years from infusion or the emergence of detectable disease.

Molecular remission is defined as having fewer than 0.0001% clonotype sequences per one million nucleated cells., Up to 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Measured as time from enrollment until clinical relapse or death. In the case of death without documented relapse, patients will be censored., Up to 5 years|Molecular Relapse Free Survival (MRFS), Measured by complete molecular remission at day 28 and followed until 5 years from infusion or the emergence of detectable disease.

Molecular remission is defined as having fewer than 0.0001% clonotype sequences per one million nucleated cells., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Measured as time from date of enrollment to date of death from any cause., Up to 5 years|Rate of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Participants rate of developing Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Up to 5 years|Rate of Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), Participants rate of developing Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)., Up to 5 years
