Prospective Study Assessing Thyroidectomy Using Robot
The robot-assisted surgery for benign and malignant thyroid tumors was widely developed in Asia and begins to spread in Western countries. The main advantage of the technique is to avoid a scar in the neck by placing it either in the axilla or at the hairline behind the ear to improve esthetic consequences and body image. It is not surgery minimally invasive but rather a way of remote access surgery.

Data from the literature including cohort studies and meta-analyzes attest the security of the procedure in comparison with classic thyroid surgery (which remains the "gold standard"). However there is few data on the effectiveness of the technique in terms of the completeness of the surgery, according to the routine standard criteria used in endocrinology and endocrine cancer, and no French medico-economic study has been performed.
Patients With Thyroid Cancer
DEVICE: Da Vinci Xi
Efficacy for benign tumor, If total thyroidectomy : rate of patients with thyroglobulin (Tg) under non- suppressive treatment with L-thyroxine ( LT4 ) \<2 ng / ml to 3 months with a target value TSH between 0.5 and 2 ng / mL If lobectomy : size of the remaining thyroid ipsilateral to the surgery evaluated sonographically \<11 mm ( larger diameter ) to 3 months, Assessed 3 months after surgery|Efficacy for malignant tumor, Rate of patients in complete remission at 12 months, remission defined as no biological or radiological anomaly:

* Tg / LT4 \< 2 ng / ml in the absence of treatment with 131I ( in the absence of anti Tg antibodies) or Tg / LT4 \<0.2 ng / mL in patients treated with 131I (absent anti Tg antibody )
* Normal cervical ultrasound
* Normal SPECT -CT if treatment with 131I
* If realized : CT and / or normal 18 FDG - PET, Assessed 12 months after surgery
