Tumor Local Excision +Postoperative Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for T1-2N0M0 Low/Ultra-Low Rectal Cancer
This study is a single-center, single-arm, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of local excision followed by postoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with early-stage low/ultra-low rectal cancer. The study plans to enroll 60 patients with T1-2N0M0 low/ultra-low rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer Stage I
PROCEDURE: Local Tumor Resection|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
5-year DFS Rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects who remain free from recurrence, progression, or death for 5 years after completing surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (estimated as the proportion of event-free patients based on survival curves)., 5 years
5-year Local Recurrence Rate, The proportion of patients who experience tumor recurrence at or near the primary tumor site (within the pelvic region) within 5 years after initial treatment completion., 5 years|5-year Distant Metastasis Rate, The proportion of patients who develop metastatic disease in distant organs (e.g., liver, lungs, bones, or non-regional lymph nodes) within 5 years after initial treatment., 5 years|5-year OS, The proportion of patients who remain alive (regardless of disease status) at 5 years after initial diagnosis or treatment initiation., 5 years|Sphincter Retention Rate, The proportion of patients who successfully avoid permanent colostomy after rectal cancer treatment, maintaining natural anal sphincter function for defecation., 1 week after sugery|Quality of Life (QoL) Scores, Calculated based on standardized scores, with proportions of patients showing marked improvement, improvement, no change, or worsening. Specific calculation rules are provided in the appendix., 5 years
Baseline examnation: All enrolled patients in this study, in addition to routine laboratory and imaging examinations such as blood routine, blood biochemistry, serum tumor markers (Incl. CEA, CA-199, CA-724 β2-microglobulin, Ferroprotein), chest CT, abdominal and pelvic MRI, etc., were required to undergo KRAS, NRAS, BREF, PD-L1, MMR/MSS testings before surgery, and blood lymphocyte subgroups were analyzed before surgery.

All enrolled patients will first undergo local tumor resection. Adjuvant therapy will be initiated 4-6 weeks postoperatively based on pathological staging:

For pT1N0M0 patients without high-risk features:

Active surveillance OR Radiotherapy alone (Prescription: Pelvic field irradiation 45Gy in 25 fractions)

For pT2N0M0 or pT1N0M0 patients with adverse prognostic factors (including poorly differentiated histology, lymphovascular invasion, positive margins\*, tumor infiltration beyond the outer third of the submucosal muscle layer（SM3 level）, or submucosal invasion \>1mm):

Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Prescription:Pelvic field irradiation 45Gy in 25 fractions PLUS Local tumor bed boost 5.4Gy in 3 fractions；Concurrent chemotherapy: Oral capecitabine 825mg/m² twice daily)；For patients with positive margins after local excision: Re-excision followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy OR Dose-escalated chemoradiotherapy (Prescription: Pelvic field irradiation 45Gy in 25 fractions PLUS Local tumor bed boost 14.4Gy in 8 fractions)；

For patients with staging \> pT2N0M0:

Total mesorectal excision (TME) Following treatment completion, patients will enter clinical follow-up surveillance.
