Evaluation of Long-term Immunogenicity and Safety of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine in Healthy Female Subjects
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the necessary cause of cervical cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the GSK Biologicals' 580299 HPV vaccine up to 10 years after administration of the first dose of HPV vaccine (Month 0) in primary study NCT00196937. This protocol posting deals with objectives \& outcome measures of the extension phase from Year 5 to Year 10. The objectives \& outcome measures of the primary phase and extension phase up to year 4 are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00196937).
Infections, Papillomavirus
PROCEDURE: Blood sampling|PROCEDURE: Cervico-vaginal secretion (CVS) samples
Anti-Human Papillomavirus (Anti-HPV)-16/18 Antibody Titers in Serum at Years 5, 6 and 7, Anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers are presented as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) and expressed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units per milliliter (EL.U/mL).

The immune response of the HPV-16/18 vaccine (as determined by anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies assessed by ELISA) in the HPV-060 study population was compared with the immune response obtained in study HPV-001 and its long-term follow-up studies HPV-007/HPV-023 at equivalent timepoints and with the immune response obtained after natural infection in subjects from study HPV-008.

The immune response data for the efficacy studies HPV-001/HPV-007/HPV-023 can be found under the NCT record NCT00518336.
