Evaluation of TRILACICLIB in Chinese Patients With Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) for Chemotherapy-induced Myelosuppression, Antitumor Effects of Combination Regimens, and Safety in a Real-world Study
This is a single-arm, real-world study in Chinese patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Trilaciclib's protection against chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, the safety and the impact on the antitumor effects of the combination with chemotherapy in Chinese patients with ES-SCLC in the real world. Patients with ES-SCLC who already use or plan to use Trilaciclib will be invited to participate in the study. Data were collected from 28 days prior to initial chemotherapy (platinum/etoposide or topotecan systemic chemotherapy) after patients signed informed consent until patients died, dropped out of the study, lost to follow-up, informed withdrawal, or study termination. The end time of the study was defined as withdrawal of information, loss of follow-up or death of all enrolled patients, or 12 months after the last patient was enrolled, whichever happened earlier.
