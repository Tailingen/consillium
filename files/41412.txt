Efficacy and Safety of BCD-100 (Anti-PD-1) in Combination With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent, Persistent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer (CAESURA)
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BCD-100 (JSC BIOCAD, Russia) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent/persistent or metastatic cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer|Cervical Cancer Metastatic|Cervical Cancer Recurrent
BIOLOGICAL: BCD-100|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin (or carboplatin)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of the participants in the mITT population who have a Complete Response or a Partial Response. The ORR will be assessed by a blind independent central reviewer per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST., 6 months
Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), 1 year|1-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), 1 year|1-year Overall Survival (OS), 1 year
The study will be conducted in two stages. At the first stage patients will receive up to 6 cycles of BCD-100 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients who have demonstrated a positive antitumor effect (stabilization of the disease, partial or complete response) and who have no signs of unacceptable toxicity could continue to receive up to 12 cycles of maintenance therapy of BCD-100 in combination with bevacizumab or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
