An Open-Label Safety and Tolerability Study of INCB062079 in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Other Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB062079 in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and other malignancies.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Cholangiocarcinoma|Esophageal Cancer|Nasopharyngeal Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Solid Tumors
DRUG: INCB062079
Safety and tolerability of INCB062079 as measured by assessment of adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a subject provides informed consent., Baseline to 30-35 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 6 months per subject.
Tumor response rates in subjects with measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will be evaluated via modified RECIST for HCC; subjects with other advanced malignancies will be evaluated using standard RECIST v1.1., Every 2 cycles during the treatment period and every 8 weeks during the follow-up period, up to approximately 6 months per subject.|Cmax of INCB062079, Defined as maximum observed plasma concentration., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|Tmax of INCB062079, Defined as time to maximum plasma concentration., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|Cmin of INCB062079, Defined as minimum observed plasma concentration during the dosing interval., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|AUC0-t of INCB062079, Defined as area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last quantifiable measurable plasma concentration., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|tÂ½ of INCB062079, Defined as the apparent plasma terminal phase disposition half-life., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|Cl/F of INCB062079, Defined as oral dose clearance., Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, up to approximately 2 months per subject.|Analysis of biomarkers, A plasma sample will be collected during screening for possible analysis of FGFR4 pathway mutations using tumor circulating DNA., Screening visit
