A Study to Investigate Atezolizumab and Chemotherapy Compared With Placebo and Chemotherapy in the Neoadjuvant Setting in Participants With Early Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a global Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[anti-PD-L1\] antibody) and nab-paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (nab-pac-AC), or placebo and nab-pac-AC in participants eligible for surgery with initial clinically assessed triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Participants whose pCR assessment was missing will be counted as not achieving a pCR., After neoadjuvant study treatment and surgery, up to primary analysis data cut off on 03 ApriI 2020
Event-Free Survival (EFS) in All Participants, Event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease recurrence, disease progression, or death from any cause in all participants. Recurrent disease includes local, regional, or distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. Ipsilateral or contralateral in situ disease and second primary non-breast cancers (including in situ carcinomas and non-melanoma skin cancers) will not be counted as progressive disease or recurrent disease., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Event-Free Survival (EFS) in Subpopulation With PD-L1-Postive Tumor Status, Event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease recurrence, disease progression, or death from any cause in the subpopulation with PD-L1-positive tumor status. Recurrent disease includes local, regional, or distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. Ipsilateral or contralateral in situ disease and second primary non-breast cancers (including in situ carcinomas and non-melanoma skin cancers) will not be counted as progressive disease or recurrent disease., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in All Participants Who Undergo Surgery, Disease-free survival (DFS) defined as the time from surgery to the first documented disease recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. DFS is analyzed with the use of the same methodology as specified for EFS for all participants., From surgery and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in Subpopulation of Participants With PD-L1-Positive Tumor Status Who Undergo Surgery, Disease-free survival (DFS) defined as the time from surgery to the first documented disease recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. DFS is analyzed with the use of the same methodology as specified for EFS for the subpopulation of participants with PD-L1-positive tumor status., From surgery and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Overall Survival (OS) in All Participants, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause in all participants., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Overall Survival (OS) in Subpopulation With PD-L1-Positive Tumor Status, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause in the subpopulation with PD-L1-positive tumor status., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Mean Scores for Function (Role/Physical) and GHS/HRQoL by Cycle and Between Treatment Arms as Assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, Mean score in function (role, physical) and global health status(GHS)/ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by cycle and between treatment arms as assessed by the functional and HRQoL scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core30(QLQ C30). The score range for each scale and single-item measure is 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate a higher response level (i.e., better functioning, better QoL, worse symptoms)., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Mean Change From Baseline Scores for Function (Role, Physical) and GHS/HRQoL by Cycle and Between Treatment Arms as Assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30, Mean change from baseline score in function (role, physical) and global health status(GHS)/ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by cycle and between treatment arms as assessed by the functional and HRQoL scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core30(QLQ C30)., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Events (AEs), Percentage of participants with at least one adverse event., From randomization and up to study final analysis data cut off on 28 September 2022.|Minimum Observed Serum Atezolizumab Concentration (Cmin), Minimum observed serum atezolizumab concentration., Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 (cycle length = 28 days from Cycles 1 to 5, and 21 days from Cycles 6 to 16)|Maximum Observed Serum Atezolizumab Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed atezolizumab concentration (Cmax)., Day 1 of Cycle 1 post dose (cycle length = 28 days)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Percentage of participants with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to atezolizumab., Baseline up to approximately 20 months
