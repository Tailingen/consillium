Budesonide in Treating Patients With Lung Nodules at High Risk of Developing Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of budesonide may keep lung cancer from forming in patients with lung nodules.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well inhalation budesonide works in treating patients with lung nodules who are at high risk of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Budesonide|OTHER: Placebo
Number CT- Detected Lung Nodules by Participant, Lung nodules (nodule characteristics) in a person-specific analysis by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria using Computed Tomography (CT) detection: Persistent lung nodules detected at CT scan from previous year with 1 of following: longest diameter between 4\&5 mm. Nodules may be stable or grown from the previous year (\< 5 mm does not require additional diagnostic follow-up); longest diameter between 5.1\& 8mm. Nodules may be stable or grown from the previous year. If grown, doubling time should be \>1 year; longest diameter \> 8 mm with negative positron positron emission tomography (PET) scan, negative CT enhancement. Nodule should have grown with doubling time between 1\& 5 years; -longest diameter \>8mm, non solid or partially solid nodules, stable or grown with doubling time between 1\&5 years. Participants followed from baseline to 3 Years, follow up CT assessment planned at 12 months., Baseline assessment|Size of CT- Detected Lung Nodules by Participant, Lung nodules (nodule characteristics) in a person-specific analysis by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria using Computed Tomography (CT) detection.

Multiple lesions success is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST while failure when progression disease (PD) or stable disease (SD). CR: disappearance all target \& non target lesions + no appearance new lesions; PR: CR for target lesions+incomplete/SD for non target lesions+no new lesions or PR (i.e., 30%\<sum LD target lesions) for target lesions + no PD for non target lesions + no appearance of new lesions; PD: PD (at least 20% \> sum LD of target lesions) for target lesions irrespective of response of non target lesions or PD for non target lesions irrespective of response for target lesions/or appearance new lesions irrespective of response of target/or non target lesions; SD: neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor increase for PD., 12 Months|Participant Overall Response (by Tumor Type Subsolid or Solid Tumor) as Measured by RECIST Criteria at 12 Months, Number of participants with response according to RECIST criteria. For single nodules \> 5 mm, clinical meaningful shrinkage of 30% or \> of longest diameter (LD) considered treatment success after 1 year of treatment. For single nodules with LD \<5 mm, complete disappearance considered treatment success. In case of multiple lesions success of treatment is when complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) occurs according to RECIST criteria., 12 Months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the effect, in terms of size and number reduction of computed tomography (CT) scan-detected undetermined lung nodules, in asymptomatic subjects with lung nodules at high-risk for developing lung cancer treated with inhaled budesonide vs placebo.

Secondary

* Compare average modification of nodule size and nodule number due to inhaled budesonide versus placebo.
* Correlate the modulation of biological markers of lung cancer in serum and sputum after treatment with the modification of lung nodules sizes.
* Determine treatment toxicity, side effects, and safety of inhaled budesonide.
* Evaluate the role of CT scans in estimating the grade of respiratory impairment and emphysema.
* Determine the effect of inhaled budesonide on respiratory function before and after treatment.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.

Participants are stratified according to gender, smoking habit (current vs former smoker), and nodule characteristics (solid vs semisolid or non-solid). Participants are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Subjects receive inhaled budesonide twice daily for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Subjects receive inhaled placebo twice daily for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Participants undergo blood and sputum collection periodically during study for biomarker and correlative studies.

After completion of study therapy, subjects are followed at 1 month and continue CT scan screening.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 202 patients will be accrued for this study.
