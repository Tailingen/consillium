Target Therapy With GEMOX in Recectable Gallbladder Carcinoma Patients Monitored by ctDNA
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of target therapy according to genomic and proteomic profiling combined with GEMOX in recectable gallbladder carcinoma patients monitored by ctDNA.
Gallbladder Carcinoma
DRUG: gemcitabine and oxaliplatin.|DRUG: Afatinib
3-year DFS, 3-year disease free survival rates:The progression is defined consistent with contrast enhanced MRI/CT., up to 3 years
3-year OS, 3-year Overall survival rates, up to 3 years
sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA, sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA compared to clinical index（CA199，CEA）for monitoring tumour progression, up to 2 years
Genomic profiling studies the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a tumor to detect genetic changes or abnormalities. immuno-histochemistry tests reveal the abnormal activation status of signal pathways involved in study. These information will be used to recommend target therapy which may be more likely to result in a beneficial response. Patients will receive target antitumor agents according to the result of genomic and proteomic profiling and be monitored by circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA).
