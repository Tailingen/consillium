Sorafenib as Neoadjuvant Therapy Before Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This local, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study documents observational data on patients under routine treatment of metastatic RCC with Nexavar before and after cytoreductive nephrectomy. It's planned to better understand the impact of cytoreductive nephrectomy on Nexavar efficacy and possibly to define patients who get the most benefit from Nexavar before cytoreductive nephrectomy.
