Comparative Sedation Study of the MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System
The purpose of this study is to develop a recommended local anesthetic protocol and post-treatment pain management regimen, in order to assure patient comfort during office-based treatment with the MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal Device. Subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale) will be compared at multiple time intervals between all treatment groups.
Uterine Fibroids|Polyps
DEVICE: Hysteroscopic Morcellator
Subject tolerance of procedure-related pain rated on an 11 point scale (0-10), Immediately post treatment
Subject assessment of most severe post-procedural pain rated on an 11 point scale, Prior to subject discharge from office/day surgery unit|Subject assessment of most severe pain experienced during 48 hours post procedure, rated on an 11 point scale, 48 hours (+ 24 hours) post procedure
Forty subjects will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled study conducted at four physician offices or day surgery settings. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a local anesthetic group (Group #1 or Group #2). Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids. Subsequent to the procedure, subjects will be randomized 1:1 within the local anesthetic group to a post procedure pain management group (Group A or Group B). Subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale)will be compared at three time points: Immediately post procedure, prior to discharge from the treatment facility, and at 48 hours post procedure.
