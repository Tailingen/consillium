Combination Chemotherapy in Hodgkin's Disease or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Not Responding to Previous Treatment
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to previous treatment.
Lymphoma
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these two patient populations.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (Hodgkin's disease vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-88 patients (22-44 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 4-10 months.
