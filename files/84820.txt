Proton Beam Radiotherapy Followed by Tecentriq and Avastin for Primary Liver Cancer With Vp2-4 Portal Vein Invasion
This study is investigator initiated, single-institution, prospective, phase 2 open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of atezolizumab/bevacizumab and proton beam therapy to portal vein tumor thrombosis with or without main primary tumor in patients with stage 3 or higher hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Vp2-4 portal vein invasion who had not undergone systemic therapy for HCC. The primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival and secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), objective response rate, disease control rate (DCR), and time to local disease progression (LTP).
