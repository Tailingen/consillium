The Value of Artificial Intelligence-based 18F-FDG PET/CT in Diferential Diagnosis, Efficacy Prediction and Prognosis Prediction of T-NK Cell Lymphoma: a Clinical Study
Based on the PET/CT imaging data of patients with T-NK cell lymphoma, machine learning and deep learning methods are used to extract imaging features, establish a T-NK cell lymphoma prediction model, and provide more scientific and accurate prognosis prediction for the clinic.
