Adoptive Cell Transfer of Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and High-Dose Interleukin 2 in Select Solid Tumors
To determine whether special tumor fighting cells that is taken from participants' tumors and grown in the laboratory and then given back to the participant will fight the participant's cancer when their immune system is suppressed from attacking these special tumor fighting cells. This is called transfer of autologous (they came from you) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (the cells that have been grown in the laboratory. Participants getting these cell infusions will also be treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).
