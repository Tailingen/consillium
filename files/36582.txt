Phase II Study of Preoperative IMRT Combined With Capecitabine and Bevacizumab in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Pathological complete response, (pCR) correlates with a favourable overall prognosis in locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent preoperative chemoradiation, so obtaining a pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of preoperative IMRT combined with bevacizumab and capecitabine. primary endpoint is pathological complete remission rate.
Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
RADIATION: chemoradiation
Pathological complete remission rate (pCR), A TME surgery will be done 6-8 weeks after concurrent chemoradiation, pathological examination of surgical speciments will be show Pathological complete remission rate (pCR), after pathological examination of surgical speciments (6-8 weeks after chemoradiation)
Acute and late toxicity, Acute toxicities will be assessed every week during chemoradiation period , one week before surgery(6 weeks after chemoradiation) and every 3 months after surgery for 2 years.

late toxicites will be assessed every 6 months from the third year after surgery., Toxicity/safety:during preoperative treatment, early and late postoperative follow up
Disease-free survival, Followup will be done every 3 months in first 2 years, and every 6 months after 2 years., 3 year afte concurrent chemoradiation
