Pembrolizumab, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin in Patients With Advanced Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC).
The investigators hypothesize that tumor cell killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy exposes the immune system to high levels of tumor antigens.The combination of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin and Pembrolizumab may result in deeper and more durable responses compared with standard chemotherapy alone.

Pathologic Objective Response Rate (pORR) in Participants Receiving Protocol Therapy, The pORR will be calculated as the percentage of participants with pathologic complete response (pCR) and pathologic partial response (pPR) overall as best response. For this protocol, pathologic complete response (pCR) will be defined as no residual macroscopic or (viable) microscopic disease. Pathologic partial response (pPR) will be defined as the presence of residual (viable) microscopic tumor, and the size of the largest focus will be provided for possible outcome correlation., Up to 48 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is measured from date of start of treatment to the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: documented disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who are alive and progression-free will be censored at the date of last documented progression-free status which is the date of last tumor assessment according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 48 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-related Toxicity, Safety and tolerability of the intervention will be reported as the number of participants experiencing treatment-related toxicity including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs), as assessed by treating physician. Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.0, per physician discretion., Up to 48 Months
