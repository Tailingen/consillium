[68Ga]Ga-Sa-DABI-4 PET Imaging of Stimulator of Interferon Gene Expression in Cancer Patients
Stimulator of interferon gene (STING) protein plays a vital role in the immune surveillance of tumor microenvironment. Monitoring STING expression in tumors benefits the relevant STING therapy. This study will investigate the safety, biodistribution and potential usefulness of a novel 68Ga-labeled agonist (\[68Ga\]Ga-Sa-DABI-4) for noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of STING expression in the tumor microenvironment.
