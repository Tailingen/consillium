Dose-escalation, Safety, Pharmacokinetics Study of AVE8062 Combined With Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

- To determine the maximum administered dose (MAD) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ombrabulin in combination with best tolerated dose of bevacizumab based on the incidence of related Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the overall safety profile of the combination
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of both ombrabulin and bevacizumab when given in combination
* To evaluate preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity
* To assess the pharmacodynamic effect using (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Ultra-Sound) DCE-US, measuring biomarkers
Neoplasms, Malignant
DRUG: Ombrabulin (AVE8062)|DRUG: bevacizumab
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) that will define the MTD, 3 weeks
Overall safety profile of the combination, up to a maximum follow-up of 1 year|Pharmacokinetic parameters of ombrabulin, 6 weeks|Pharmacokinetic parameters of bevacizumab, 6 weeks|Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), up to a maximum follow-up of 1 year|Pharmacodynamic effect (biomarkers), cycle 1
The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 28-day screening phase, 21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit with a follow-up period. Each patient will participate in only one dose group and will receive AVE8062 with bevacizumab every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities, withdrawal of consent or Investigator's decision.
