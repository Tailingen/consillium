Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
The efficacy of HIPEC in prevention of local recurrence, distant metastasis or peritoneal metastasis in locally advanced gastric cancer is not definite. The hypothesis of the trial is that radical gastrectomy combined with HIPEC is superior to only radical gastrectomy in terms of overall survival.
Malignant Neoplasm of Stomach
PROCEDURE: D2 radical gastrectomy|DRUG: SOX neoadjuvant or postoperative chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
overall survival, From the date of surgery to the date of death or to the end of follow-up, 5 years
progression-free survival, 5 years|distant metastasis rate, 5 years|peritoneal metastasis rate, 5 years|local recurrence rate, 5 years|complication rate, 5 years
To determine the efficacy of HIPEC in the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer, patients are randomized into HIPEC group and control group. In HIPEC group, the patients undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy and HIPEC with paclitaxel and 5-Fu. Patients in the control group just undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Patients in both groups receive postoperative chemotherapy (6 circles together with neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and are followed up for 5 years or until death.

The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open and parallel group study.
