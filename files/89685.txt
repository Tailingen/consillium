Study of MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma After Treatment With Platinum-based and Cetuximab Therapy (MK-3475-055/KEYNOTE-055)
This is a study of single-agent pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have progressed on platinum-based and cetuximab therapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide a clinically meaningful objective response rate (ORR).

With protocol amendment 05 (02-Jan-2018), once study participants have achieved the study objective or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in All Participants, ORR was assessed by RECIST 1.1 by performing imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of treatment. ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR) defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm or Partial Response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders., Up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in Strong Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Positive Participants, Participants with a strong PD-L1 expression status were evaluated for ORR by RECIST 1.1. The expression of PD-L1 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and strong PD-L1 positive was defined as a PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥50%. ORR was assessed by performing imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of treatment. ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a CR defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm or PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders., Up to 36 months|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the product. Worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, or was another important medical event. Per protocol, analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed during the initial (first) course of therapy only., Up to 27 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment.
