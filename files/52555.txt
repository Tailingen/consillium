A Multi-center, III Phase,Randomized Controlled Clinical Study of Capecitabine Metronomic Chemotherapy After Standard Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Operable Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer|Capecitabine|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
PFS（Progression-free survival）, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of disease progression at any site including distant metastasis or second primary tumors or death， assessed up to 3 years, Progression-free survival：time from the date of randomization until the date of disease progression，assessed up to 3 years
OS, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of any death occurred, time from the date of randomization until the date of any death occurred|DDFS, time from the date of randomization until the date of any disease occurred
Capecitabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) for 2 weeks, followed by a 1 week break before repeating the next dosage cycle. In this study, capecitabine will be prescribed as dosage of 900mg/m2, and maintain for a whole year after the standard treatment in operable triple negative breast cancer patients. DFS is set as the primary outcome, OS and DDFS are also observed as the secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis are made to see whether this metronomic therapy of capecitabine ( 900mg/m2) will bring benefit to any of the iterms above.
