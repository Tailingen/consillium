Consolidation Whole Abdominal Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The primary objective of this phase-II study is to assess the toxicity of consolidation intensity-modulated whole-abdominal radiotherapy using tomotherapy in patients with advanced optimally debulked stage International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) III ovarian cancer with a complete remission after adjuvant chemotherapy.

36 patients will be treated to a total dose of 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions. The planning target-volume includes the entire peritoneal cavity and the pelvic and para-aortal node regions. Intensity-modulated whole-abdominal radiotherapy allows an effective sparing of liver, kidneys and bone-marrow (vertebral bodies and pelvic bones).
