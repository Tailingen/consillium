Efficacy of Home-based Treatment for Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
The goal of this clinical trials is to explore the effectiveness of home-based iymphedema treatment and the differences between the home-based and outpatient treatment. The main question is to verify that home-based treatment is as effective as outpatient treatment. We set two groups in this study, comparing the volume of affected upper limb to see if home-based iymphedema treatment is valuable method.

the volum of affected arm, A soft ruler was used to measure the patient's wrist stripes and 10cm, 20cm, 30cm and 40cm above the wrist stripes, respectively, to obtain the circumference value. The five measurement points can divide the limb into four truncated cones, and then the formula can be used to calculate the volume of each limb segment, in which C1 and C2 are the arm circumference of the upper and lower two points of the measurement segment. h is the length of the measuring section, that is, 10 cm, and the whole limb volume is the sum of the volumes of each section., at the first day and after one month
