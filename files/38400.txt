Influence of Umbilical Cord Clamping Time in the Newborn
This study compares two umbilical cord clamping times; the early one, up to a minute (ECC) and the late or delayed one, when the cord stop beating (DCC). The additional blood volume delivered to the newborn from the placenta - placental transference - by delaying umbilical cord ligation, increases the contribution of neonatal iron with increased iron stores in the infant, without increasing neonatal morbidity.

It is an intervention study without drugs administration with a longitudinal, prospective comparison and correlational design.

Patients are recruited by simple random sampling to one of the two intervention groups:

Group 1-ECC: Early clamping of the umbilical cord (before the first minute of life).

Group 2-DCC: Delayed clamping of the umbilical cord (when it stops beating).
