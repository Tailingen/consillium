Preoperative SRS/SRT vs Postoperative SRS/SRT for Brain Metastases
This pilot study is a randomized, open-label, 2-arm active-controlled phase II clinical trial conducted at a single study site (UAMS). Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms and stratified by size of index lesion and number of brain metastases.

The investigators will prospectively compare preoperative (neoadjuvant) SRS/SRT to postoperative (adjuvant) SRS/SRT in patients undergoing surgical resection for brain metastases.

The investigators hypothesize that neoadjuvant SRS/SRT prior to surgical resection of brain metastases will result in improved freedom from Central Nervous System (CNS) events when compared to adjuvant SRS/SRT after surgical resection.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: SRS/SRT
Number of Participants With Central Nervous System (CNS) Composite Event (CE), A CNS CE will consist of one of the following three events: Local Recurrence (LR) of the treated lesions, symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) to the treated lesions, or development of leptomeningeal disease (LMD)., From date of randomization to the date of a documented LR, SRN, or LMD, whichever comes first, assessed up to 18 months.
