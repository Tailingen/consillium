Phase I Clinical Study of α-PD-L1/DLL3 CAR-T in Patients With R/R SCLC
A study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of α-PD-L1/4-1BB DLL3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T (BHP01) in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and determine the appropriate CAR-T cell dose. Next, In dose expansion phase, patients were assign two groups with/without bridge radiotherapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
DRUG: α-PD-L1/4-1BB DLL3 CAR-T (BHP01)
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Safety, day1-day28
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1. In the event of PR or CR, the subjects should confirm it no less than 4 weeks after the first evaluation., up to 1 year after the enrollment|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from CAR-T administration to disease progression or death., up to 1 year after the enrollment|Disease control rate (DCR), The number of cases in which response (PR + CR) and stable disease (SD) are achieved from the start of cell infusion/the total number of evaluable cases (%)., up to 1 year after the enrollment|Duration of response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD or death of any cause, up to 1 year after the enrollment|Overall-Survival (OS), The period from the first infusion to any cause of death, up to 1 year after the enrollment|CAR-T cell numbers, Monitoring CAR-T cell numbers in blood to determine the persistence of CAR-T., up to 1 year after the enrollment
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of lung cancers, and two-thirds of cases are metastatic at the time of diagnosis. The inhibitory notch ligand delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is aberrantly expressed on the surface of up to 85% of SCLC cells and minimally expressed in normal tissues, making it a compelling therapeutic target. This is a phase I, first-in-human, 3+3 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of BHP01 in patents with relapsed/refractory SCLC who progressed after at least 1 platinum based chemotherapy regimen.This is a dose escalation and dose expansion study. 12-21 patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC are planned to be enrolled (Group Pre-A/A/B/C). After the Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period of the related dose group finished.16 patients are planned to enroll in dose expansion phase who was assign two groups with/without bridge radiotherapy.
