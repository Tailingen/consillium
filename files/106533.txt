Ofatumumab vs Physician's Choice in Subjects With Bulky Fludarabine-Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study was to confirm the clinical benefit observed in the pivotal registration study, Hx-CD20-406. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) required that a randomized study be conducted in CLL patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease as a specific obligation for grant of conditional approval for ARZERRA™ in the European Union (EU). This study compared ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy.

DRUG: Ofatumumab|DRUG: Physicians' Choice
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is the interval of time between the date of first randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any reason, whichever occurred first. The date of PD was defined as the first occurrence of any criteria of progression. PD criteria requires at least one of the following: progression of lymphadenopathy, \>=50% increase in liver or spleen size, \>=50% increase in number of lymphocytes per microliter, more aggressive histology, occurence of cytopenia after treatment attributable to CLL. Disease progression was determined according to the 2008 International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) update of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group CLL Guidelines for Response (NCI-WG). PFS was censored at the time of the last follow up for participants who have neither progressed or died., From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.

Their normal blood levels indicate proper immune status. Low levels indicate immuno-suppression. IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in the blood samples of the participants. Immunoglobulin testing was performed at Screening (SCR), Cycle 3 Week 4 (C3W4), Cycle 7 Week 4 (C3W4) ,Cycle 9 Week 4 (C3W4), 6 Month Follow-up Visit (6M FU), 9 Month Follow-up (9M FU), 12 Month Follow-up (12M FU), 18 Month Follow-up (18M FU), 24 Month Follow-up (24M FU), 30 Month Follow-up (30M FU), 36 Month Follow-up (36M FU), 42 Month Follow-up (42M FU).

All samples were first assessed in a screening (SCR) assay, and the potential positive (Pos) samples were further tested in the confirmation (CNF) assays. Confirmed positives were reported as HAHA positive and titer was determined for each positive sample. The drug tolerance of the HAHA assay is 200 microgram/milliliter (µg/mL); thus, samples that tested negative in the assay and had ofatumumab concentrations no more than 200 µg/mL were considered as conclusive negative (Neg) results., From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.|Changes From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 Item Module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16), The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important in CLL. There are 4 multi-item scales - fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects (\[TSE\], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale \[DES\], 4 items), and infection (4 items) - and single item scales (social activities \[Social Problems (SP) Scale\] and future health worries\[Future Health (FH) Scale\].). These are measured on a four point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 - 100, where 0 =no symptoms or problems and 100 = a severe symptoms or problems. EORTC QLQ-CLL16 was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle\[C\] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during Follow-up which was every month for Months (M) 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD., From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.|Mean Health Change Questionnaire (HCQ) Score, The HCQ consists of a single question in which the participant is asked if he/she has experienced any change in his/her health overall since beginning the study. For HCQ, values from 1 to 9 were assigned to the 9 responses in the HCQ questionnaire, ranging from 1 for 'my health is a great deal better' to 9 for 'my health is a great deal worse' since the beginning of the study. A score of 3 or less indicates improvement from Baseline. HCQ was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle\[C\] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during follow-up which was every month for Months 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD.., From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.
Patients with CLL that is refractory to fludarabine have few treatment options and a poor prognosis. There is a continued need for new therapies for these CLL patients, as demonstrated by the limited responses and substantial toxicities with existing therapies. This is supported by the lack of a consensus around standard of care treatment for CLL patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease. The objective of this study was to confirm the response rate and disease control in the refractory setting through a controlled trial comparing ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy in fludarabine-refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy patients. After 24 weeks of treatment with ofatumumab, patients were further randomized to either extended ofatumumab treatment or observation. Patients on the physicians' choice arm had the option of receiving ofatumumab if they experience progressive disease.
