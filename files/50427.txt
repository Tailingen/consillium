This study will be conducted to optimize the quality of care rendered for gynecological cancer patients attending the Gynecological Oncology Unit in El-Shatby University Hospital in Alexandria.As well as to assess the effect of implementing a psychoeducational intervention program among gynecological cancer women on the:

1. Quality of life with its different domains (physical, emotional, social and functional). "as a primary objective"
2. Psychological distress and cancer-specific stress. "as secondary objectives"
Psychological
OTHER: a psycho educational intervention program|OTHER: the routine care
A change in the Quality of life of gynecological cancer patients, A change in the Quality of life from baseline and follow up sessions is assessed using the Arabic version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) version 4. It includes 27 items and covers four primary QOL domains: physical wellbeing (PWB; 7 items, score range 0-28), emotional well-being (EWB; 6 items, score range 0-24), social well-being (SWB; 7 items, score range 0-28) and functional well-being (FWB; 7 items, score range 0-28). A five-point Likert scale will be used (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much), which provided four subscale scores and a total score ranging from 0 to 108, a higher score meaning a poor QOL, a lower score indicating high QOL and low effect of gynecological cancer treatment on QOL., over approximately 2 months for each patient as the tool is used initially before surgery and reused 8 weeks after the operation
A change in the Anxiety and depression, A change in the psychological distress from baseline and follow up sessions is assessed using the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).There is a total of 14 items in the scale which are equally distributed into anxiety and depression subscales. Higher scores reflect greater psychological distress., over approximately 2 months for each patient as the tool is used initially before surgery and reused 8 weeks after the operation|A change in the Cancer-specific stress, A change in the traumatic stress reactions to cancer diagnosis and treatment from baseline and follow up sessions is assessed using The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (ӀEЅ-R).The participants will be asked to rate the frequency of these feelings or events during the previous week, using а five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely. Items will be summed for а total score that ranges from 0 to 88. The IES-R is not meant to be diagnostic. While there is no specific cut-off score, scores higher than 24 are of concern; the higher the score the greater the concern for PTSD and associated health and well-being consequences., over approximately 2 months for each patient as the tool is used initially before surgery and reused 8 weeks after the operation
Cancer is a significant health problem worldwide with wide geographical variation in incidence. Additionally it has become an important item in each country's health agenda.It is a prominent cause of mortality in both economically developed and underdeveloped nations.Unfortunately, the burden is expected to grow globally due to the development and aging of the population.Gynecological cancer, which includes cancers of the cervix, ovary, uterus, vulva, vagina and fallopian tube are among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide.In Egypt, according to the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) 2020, approximately 2,787 new cases for ovarian cancer were diagnosed and 1,839 women died from the disease,1,694 new cases for uterine cancer and 350 women died from the disease and 1,320 new cases for cervical cancer and 744 women died from the disease.

Hence, this study will be carried out to develop and implement a psychoeducational intervention program among gynecological cancer patients attending the Gynecological Oncology Unit in El-Shatby University Hospital in Alexandria and evaluate its effect in improving their psychological outcomes and quality of life.
