Use of Low Dose Ketoconazole in Prostate Cancer That Does Not Respond to Hormone Therapy and Prior Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of ketoconazole and how well it works after chemotherapy has been used. Ketoconazole at lower doses has been used for fungal infections however has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in prostate cancer. Ketoconazole has been used for many years at high doses for prostate cancer, and this study will be to look at use of lower dose ketoconazole after someone has received chemotherapy. Ketoconazole works by halting the production of steroids in your body, including testosterone, and is thought to work directly on prostate cancer cells in published lab studies.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Ketoconazole|DRUG: Hydrocortisone
Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response (>50% Reduction From Baseline), Percentage of patients who achieved a clinically significant decline in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) after initiation of ketoconazole therapy, defined as a \>=50% decrease in PSA., From date of enrollment, every Cycle (4 weeks), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, study withdrawal, or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
PSA Response (>30% From Baseline), From date of enrollment, every Cycle (4 weeks), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, study withdrawal, or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) radiographic criteria for progression, From date of enrollment, every Cycle (4 weeks), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, study withdrawal, or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Duration of Stable Disease, From date of enrollment, every Cycle (4 weeks), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, study withdrawal, or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
The aim of the study is to research the response of low dose ketoconazole in hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients who have already undergone chemotherapy as part of their prostate cancer treatment. The hypothesis of the study is that HRPC patients who have been previously treated with chemotherapy will demonstrate objective PSA response rates to low dose ketoconazole, comparable to historical response rates reported in chemotherapy-na√Øve patients. This is a single arm trial, with all participants given ketoconazole 200mg TID, along with hydrocortisone given at 20mg in the morning, 10mg at night daily. Each cycle will consist of 28 days. The subject's study participation will continue until subject experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, withdraws consent from the study or dies.
