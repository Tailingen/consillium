Multicenter Study of Safety and Efficacy of Prolgolimab in Patients With Advanced Melanoma in Routine Clinical Practice
Describe the safety, tolerability, efficacy and approaches to prescribing prolgolimab in the standard dosing regimen of 1 mg / kg every 2 weeks in patients with advanced melanoma in routine practice.

Prolgolimab (Forteca, formerly BCD 100) is an IgG1 anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) monoclonal antibody containing the Fc-silencing 'LALA' mutation.

Describe the safety and tolerability of using Prolgolimab at a standard dosage regimen of 1 mg / kg every 2 weeks.

Describe the efficacy of prolgolimab 1 mg / kg every 2 weeks in patients with metastatic or inoperable melanoma in routine practice, based on the following indicators: Progression-free survival (time from first dose of prolgolimab to disease progression or death for any reason); Overall survival (time from receiving the first dose of prolgolimab to death for any reason); Objective response rate (proportion of patients with a complete or partial response to prolgolimab therapy).
