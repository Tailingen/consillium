Pilot Study to Validate Metallic Markers for Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer Tx
The purpose of this study is to test metallic markers in the breast tissue after breast conserving surgery and to observe the metallic markers' stability in the breast for use as tumor bed markers and positioning devices for radiation treatment.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) Scans (Metallic Markers)|DEVICE: Non-contrast CT Scans (Metallic Markers)
Positional Stability of Metallic Markers in the Breast Parenchyma, To validate that intraparenchymal metallic markers placed in the breast tissue can be used as stable markers throughout a course of radiation treatment for daily image guided localization. Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) will be deemed feasible if the average shift in marker position results in deviations of up to 7 mm from the initial position., Completion of planned radiation treatment.
In order to validate metallic marker placement and stability, patients will have the internal metallic markers placed at the time of their last breast surgery (either lumpectomy or re-excision for margins) by the surgeon and are permanent. They will undergo routine 3D CT-based treatment planning and will receive routine radiation treatment to the whole breast or partial breast as determined by the treating physician. Daily images of the breast will be obtained throughout treatment using the online portal imaging system. These images will be analyzed for the daily position of the metallic markers and compared across the entire course of treatment to determine the stability of metallic markers placement and to assess their efficacy as positioning devices for image guided radiation therapy.
