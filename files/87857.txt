Long-term Safety of Nipple Sparing Mastectomy in Women With GPV in Breast Cancer
Patients with a germline pathogenic variant (GPV) in high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes who are considering risk reducing mastectomy (RRM) often strongly desire to keep their nipple areola complex but inquire as to whether it is safe to do so. Relative to traditional or skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) techniques, nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) is associated with improved psychosocial and sexual well-being and is significantly better for body image and reducing feelings of disfigurement.

Despite this, guidelines have yet to endorse the use of NSM over other RRM techniques, stating that more data and longer follow-up are needed to confirm it as a safe and effective strategy in GPV carriers. As NSM was not routinely adopted in high-risk patient populations undergoing RRM before 2010, there has been little data to inform the long-term oncologic safety of NSM. Well-designed studies have reported low to negligible rates of subsequent breast cancer in BRCA1/2 carriers following NSM, but have been limited by short median follow-up of less than 3 years. The current study is designed to confirm, with longer follow-up, prior findings on the oncologic safety of NSM in unaffected BRCA1/2 carriers. The investigators will also expand data to other high-penetrance GPV carriers, including PALB2, CDH1, PTEN, and TP53, for whom there is little-to-no data on outcomes following RRM.

PROCEDURE: Nipple Sparing Mastectomy (NSM)|PROCEDURE: Skin-Sparing Mastectomy (SSM)|PROCEDURE: Total (Simple) Mastectomy
Incidence of breast cancer following RRM, The primary outcome of interest is the incidence of breast cancer following RRM, defined as a histologically confirmed diagnosis of in situ or invasive breast cancer present within the nipple/areola, skin, subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall/reconstructed breast, or axillary lymph nodes. Patients with clinically occult invasive breast cancer diagnosed at the time of RRM (ie. on mastectomy pathology) will be excluded from the primary outcome analysis., 10 years
Incidence of RRM, To evaluate uptake of RRM versus active surveillance amongst an international cohort of unaffected women with high-penetrance GPVs in BRCA1/2, PALB2, CDH1, PTEN, or TP53, 10 years|Incidence of post-operative complications, To evaluate post-operative complications and supplemental surgery following NSM, SSM, and total mastectomy in those undergoing RRM, 10 years|Incidence of pathologic outcomes following NSM, To evaluate pathologic outcomes following RRM, including the presence of high-risk lesions or occult in situ and/or invasive malignancy, 10 years|Number of participants using endocrine prevention, To explore the use of endocrine prevention in unaffected women with high-penetrance GPVs in BRCA1/2, PALB2, CDH1, PTEN, or TP53 who elect to undergo active surveillance, 10 years|Number of participants who have undergone pre-mastectomy imaging and post-mastectomy surveillance, To assess practices in pre-mastectomy imaging and post-mastectomy surveillance, including the number of participants who underwent preoperative MRI and mammography as well as post-mastectomy surveillance, including MRI, ultrasound and chest wall examination., 10 years
