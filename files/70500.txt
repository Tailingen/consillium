PET / CT Imaging and Safety in Patients With Lymphoma Treated With CD19 Car-t Cells
The proliferation and distribution of CD19 CAR-T cells in lymphoma patients are investigated 68Ga-NOTA-RP25 by PET / CT imaging.
Lymphoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-NOTA-RP25
SUV value of radioactive material uptake in the region of interest, According to the PET / CT imaging results of 68Ga-NOTA-RP25 after iterative reconstruction, PMOD software is used to outline the tumor, brain, liver, heart, tumor and other tissues as regions of interest (ROI), 1 month
Safety evaluation index, To observe AE/SAE of subjects, 1 month
The purpose of this study is to monitor the proliferation and distribution of CD19 CAR-T cells in lymphoma patients by using a novel specific PET tracer 68Ga-NOTA-RP25 for monitoring the proliferation of CAR-T cells.
