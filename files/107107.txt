The Preserving Fertility After Colorectal Cancer (PREFACE) Study comprehensively investigates fertility, sexual health and clinical outcomes along the cancer care continuum among individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer between age 18 to 49 years.

Patients are recruited prior to colorectal cancer therapy \[baseline\] and followed for up to 36 months after completion of first-course therapy (or 45 months after diagnosis for patients on maintenance therapy). Study timepoints are defined at: (i) completion of first-course treatment (or 9 months after diagnosis for patients on maintenance therapy \[treatment\]); (ii) and at 9, 18 and 36 month intervals thereafter \[surveillance\]. This cohort is enriched by a robust collection of biospecimens and data.
