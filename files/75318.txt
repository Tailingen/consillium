Phase III Comparison of Adjuvant Chemotherapy W/High-Dose Cyclophosphamide Plus Doxorubicin (AC) vs Sequential Doxorubicin Fol by Cyclophosphamide (A-C) in High Risk Breast Cancer Patients With 0-3 Positive Nodes (Intergroup, CALGB 9394)
To compare disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (s), and toxicity of high-isk primary breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes or with one to three positive nodes treated with adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), versus high-dose sequential chemotherapy with doxorubicin followed by cyclophosphamide (A--\>C).

To compare disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (s), and toxicity of high-isk primary breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes or with one to three positive nodes., Conclusion of the study
To obtain tumor tissue for biologic studies. The details of these biologic studies will be described in a companion protocol or protocols to be developed through the Intergroup mechanism., Conclusion of study
