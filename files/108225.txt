To prospectively collect serum and DNA samples from subjects with pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, liver disease, and from healthy and at-risk volunteers in order to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, stage, natural history of the disease, response to treatment, and to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions. In particular:
Pancreas Cancer
PROCEDURE: Serum and DNA Samples
* To establish a central pancreatic cancer specimen repository to serve as a resource for current and future scientific studies.
* To utilize the PCRT clinical data base to perform clinicopathologic correlation with the results of those studies.
* To test new hypotheses as they emerge.
