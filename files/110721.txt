Establishment of Individualized Immunotherapy Strategy and Platform Based on Changes of Intestinal Microbiota
To explore and analyze the relationship between intestinal flora changes and the efficacy of individualized immunotherapy in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, and to find new biomarkers to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, bringing new breakthroughs in tumor diagnosis and treatment.
Gut Microbiota
Degree of tumor regression, We used the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria to evaluate the response to the immune therapy and accordingly divided patients into two groupsï¼ŒResponse and No Response., 6 months
The relative abundance of species, Use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to specifically expand Increase the V3-V4 variable region of 16SrRNA and perform community analysis, 6 months
Species richness, Use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to specifically expand Increase the V3-V4 variable region of 16SrRNA and perform community analysis, 6 months
1. Compare the composition of intestinal flora of patients before and after immunotherapy and in patients with different therapeutic effects of immunotherapy.
2. Combine the results above with the patient's blood sample, which is carried out from the metabolic level.
3. Combine the pathological data of the patient to determine the staging and pathological types, and use blood samples to detect metabolites to find out different metabolites.
4. the metabolic data and the flora data are associated with the analysis to find the bacteria species with higher correlation with the differential metabolites to guide the subsequent animal experiments.
