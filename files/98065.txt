Unintentional Weight Loss and Cancer: A Prospective Trial of Patient-centered Weight Tracking Combin
Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is commonly associated with a wide variety of diseases and there is still no valid diagnostic pathway for evaluating UWL. When detecting UWL coupled with GRAIL Galleri testing, (an investigational pan-cancer early detection test), it is thought that there is a greater positive predictive value in detecting malignancies. This study aims to test the potential synergistic effects of UWL detection and GRAIL usage to detect malignancy at an even earlier rate. UWL will be measured using weekly weight tracking.
Unintended Weight Loss
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: GRAIL Galleri
Malignant UWL Detection, High-risk participant cohorts who have lost greater than or equal to 5% of their body weight at initial enrollment over the 3-year weight measuring period will be given a GRAIL Galleri test. If positive, the participant will be given laboratory work, imaging, and a physical examination to diagnose the malignancy., Up to 3 years post-enrollment
Non-Malignant UWL Detection, Participants who have lost greater than or equal to 5% of their body weight at initial enrollment over the 3-year weight measuring period but tested negatively during a GRAIL Galleri test will be seen by a specialist to determine their underlying cause of UWL., Up to 3 years post-enrollment
Enrolled participants will be provided with a Fitbit Aria Smart Scale and will be asked to weigh themselves each week at a similar time of day wearing a similar amount of clothing for a total of three years. These weight data will be automatically pushed to the Fitbit cell phone application and patients who lost â‰¥5% from their baseline will be identified, and the intentionality of this weight loss (intentional or unintentional) will be assessed. All patients with UWL will be asked to have a GRAIL Galleri test, a health history and physical examination, a blood draw, imaging, routine cancer screenings done if not already completed, and referral to a specialist if a new cancer is detected.
