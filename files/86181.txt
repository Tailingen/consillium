Clinical Study of Low-dose Interval Radiotherapy Combined With Tirelizumab and SOX Chemotherapy Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
To evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant low-dose interval radiotherapy combined with tirelizumab and SOX chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
Locally Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Neoadjuvant Therapy(5×3Gy radiotherapy)|DRUG: Neoadjuvant Therapy(tirelizumab, oxaliplatin, S-1)|PROCEDURE: Surgical treatment|DRUG: Adjuvant therapy(SOX chemotherapy)
Pathological complete response rate (pCR), Pathological complete response was defined as pT0N0M0, From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 16-18 weeks.
Major pathological response rate (MPR), The percentage of surviving tumor cells in the tumor bed after neoadjuvant therapy was ≤10%., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 16-18 weeks.|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of surgery, assessed up to 15-17 weeks.|R0 resection rate, The proportion of patients who completed R0 resection in the total enrolled patients., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 16-18 weeks.|Treatment safety, CTCAE 5.0 was used to record grade 3 and above treatment-related adverse reactions from the beginning of neoadjuvant therapy to 30 days after the end of surgery., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of 30 days post-surgery, assessed up to 19-21 weeks.|Postoperative complications, Clavien-Dindo criteria were used to evaluate., The first 30 days following surgery.|Event-free survival (EFS), From the beginning of the study to the time of the first occurrence of any of the following events, disease progression beyond surgical treatment, local or distant recurrence, death from any cause, etc., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of the first occurrence of the above events, assessed up to 60 months.|Overall survival (OS), From study inception to patient death from any cause., From the date of diagnosis to the date of death, assessed up to 60 months.|Biomarkers, By collecting tumor tissue and hematology samples before and after neoadjuvant therapy, scRNA-seq, WES, MRD and other techniques were used to explore biomarkers related to the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy., From the date of neoadjuvant therapy until the end of postoperative follow-up, assessed up to 60 months.
To evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant low-dose interval radiotherapy combined with tirelizumab and SOX chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
