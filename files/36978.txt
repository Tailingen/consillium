Early Versus Late Stopping of Antibiotics in Children With Cancer and High-risk Febrile Neutropenia
This randomised controlled trial will determine the non-inferiority of stopping empiric antibiotics prior to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery (Early Stopping) versus stopping antibiotics upon ANC recovery (Standard of Care/ Late Stopping) , in children with cancer and high-risk febrile neutropenia (FN).

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common complication of childhood cancer treatment and a leading cause of hospital admission and antibiotic exposure. Management typically involves broad-spectrum antibiotics until resolution of fever and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery \>500 cells/mm3. However, despite the frequency with which FN occurs, evidence to guide duration of antibiotics is limited to observational studies and small randomised controlled trials.Current international clinical guidelines provide conflicting recommendations on when to cease empiric antibiotics for FN. Early cessation of antibiotics in FN may translate to reduced antibiotic exposure and limit potential harms including drug side-effects, antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection and microbiome disruption. This randomised controlled trial will use a composite endpoint of fever recurrence, physiological instability, new bacteremia, intensive care admission and death to determine the non-inferiority of stopping antibiotics prior to ANC recovery compared with standard of care (SOC), in children with cancer and high-risk FN. Adopting a health informatics approach, patient identification, consent, randomisation and reporting of outcomes will be embedded within the electronic medical record (EMR). Children with high-risk FN who have been afebrile and clinically stable for at least 48 hours will be randomised to cease antibiotics or continue SOC. Data on primary outcomes, antibiotic duration, length of stay, C. difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance will be automatically collected by the EMR. This is the first study of its kind in children with high-risk FN and adopts a novel embedded trial design. Results will inform optimal antibiotic duration in FN, potentially reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure.
