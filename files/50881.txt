Neoadjuvant Herceptin in Patients With Breast Cancer
The purposes of this study are to better understand how Herceptin causes tumors to become smaller and to find out how effective Herceptin, together with chemotherapy, is in treating advanced breast cancer.
BREAST CANCER
DRUG: Herceptin
The effects of Herceptin and its efficacy in women with HER-2 overexpressing advanced breast cancer, A comparison of histologic and molecular markers from sequential core biopsies of primary breast cancers of patients receiving Herceptin, 1 year
To determine clinical response to therapy with Herceptin and Taxotere, one year
We want to determine the effects of Herceptin and to determine its efficacy in women with HER-2 overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The end-points will include the comparison of an array of histologic and molecular markers from sequential core biopsies of primary breast cancers of patients receiving Herceptin.

The other aim of this study would be to determine clinical response to therapy with Herceptin and Taxotere.
