Safety and Efficacy of ThisCART22 in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed B Cell Malignancies
This is a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of allogeneic CAR-T targeting CD22 in patients with refractory or relapsed CD22-positive B cell malignancies
B Cell Malignancy
BIOLOGICAL: ThisCART22 cells injection
The incidence of AE or SAE of CART cell infusion in relation to the study drug at grade â‰¥3 (refer to CTCAE version 4.03);, From infusion to week 12|ORR (sum of CR and CRi) after infusion., From infusion to week 12
The survival time of CAR-T-22 cells in vivo;, From infusion to month 12|ORR at week 4, 8, and 24 after infusion (ORR4, ORR8, ORR24)., At week 4, 8, and 24 after infusion
The patients will receive infusion of ThisCART22 cells from health donor ,to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ThisCART22 Cells in patients with refractory or relapsed CD22-positive B cell malignancies.

In this study, the dose range is 0.2-60 x10\^6 cells per kg body weight (no more than 3.0 x 10\^9 in total).
