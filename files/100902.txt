64 Cu-DOTA-alendronate PET Imaging in Localizing and Characterizing Breast Calcifications in Participants Before Undergoing Mastectomy
This early phase I pilot trial studies how well 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging work in localizing and characterizing breast calcifications (small calcium deposits) in participants before undergoing mastectomy. Diagnostic procedures, such 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate PET, may detect calcification and help doctors predict cancer associated calcification within breast tissue.

PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Copper Cu-64-DOTA-alendronate|OTHER: Pharmacokinetic Study|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography
Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in evaluating tumor size and calcifications, Tumor size sensitivity and the ability to detect calcifications will be compared to the extent of calcifications seen on mammogram., Up to 7 days
Uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate on positron emission tomography (PET) scan compared to histology after mastectomy, Up to 7 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the uptake (maximum standardized uptake value \[SUVmax\]) of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in female patients with biopsy-proven malignant breast calcifications.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate on PET -computed tomography (CT) with histology after mastectomy.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate.

Participants receive 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT imaging 60 minutes after injection. Participants with sufficient levels of residual radioactivity may undergo repeat imaging on day 1 as determined by the study team.

After completion of study , participants are followed up for 7 days.
