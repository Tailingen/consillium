A Study of XL844 Administered as a Single Agent and in Combination With Gemcitabine in Adults With Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of XL844 in combination with gemcitabine, how often it should be taken, and how well people with cancer tolerate the combination of gemcitabine and XL844.
Cancer|Lymphoma
DRUG: XL844|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Safety and tolerability of XL844 as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine when administered orally to subjects with advanced malignancies, Assessed at each visit/periodic visits|Determine the Combination maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities for XL844 alone and in combination with gemcitabine, Assessed at periodic visits|Evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics and estimate renal elimination of XL844 as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine, Assessed at periodic visits
(Exploratory:) Assess tumor response after repeated administration of XL844 in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with advanced malignancies, Assessed at periodic visits|Pharmacodynamic correlates of XL844 activity in tumor tissue, Assessed at periodic visits
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of XL844 in combination with gemcitabine, how often it should be taken, and how well people with cancer tolerate the combination of gemcitabine and XL844.
