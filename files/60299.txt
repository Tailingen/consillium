A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine PF-07985045 When Given Alone or With Other Anti-cancer Therapies in People With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have a Change in a Gene.
The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine when given alone or together with other anti-cancer therapies. Anti-cancer therapy is a type of treatment to stop the growth of cancer.

This study also aims to find the best amount of study medication.

This study is seeking participants who have solid tumors (a mass of abnormal cells that forms a lump or growth in the body) that:

* are advanced (cancer that doesn't disappear or stay away with treatment) and
* have a KRAS gene mutation (a change in the DNA of the KRAS gene that can cause cells to grow in very high numbers).

This includes (but limited to) the following cancer types:

* Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): It's a type of lung cancer where the cells grow slowly but often spread to other parts of the body.
* Colorectal Cancer (CRC): This is a disease where cells in the colon (a part of large intestine) or rectum grow out of control.
* Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): This is a cancer that starts in the ducts of the pancreas but can spread quickly to other parts of the body. Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.

All participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07985045) as pill by mouth once a day. This will be repeated for 21-day or 28-day cycles.

Depending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07985045 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at different times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.

Participants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07985045) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.

The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.

Participants will be in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, the participants will come into the clinic for 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After the participants have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing
