Predicting Responsiveness in Oncology Patients Based on Host Response Evaluation During Anti Cancer Treatments
This study will develop an algorithm of identifying patients with stage IV NSCLC and Melanoma who could benefit from cancer treatment they receive.

The goal of this research study is to develop an algorithm that predicts the patient's treatment outcome.This algorithm will serve as a tool for physicians when making treatment decisions, specifically for stage IV NSCLC and malignant melanoma patients receiving anti-cancer treatments. The investigators also aim to identify the metabolic pathways that could lead to better therapeutic options. The patients will be given their treatment according to the institute's standard of care. The patients will provide two blood samples and clinical data will be collected from their medical records.

In the first part of the trial, the data obtained from the blood samples and the medical records of the patients will be used to develop the prediction algorithm, and in the second part of the trial, the algorithm will be validated by comparing the objective response rate of the patients to the theoretical response prediction of the algorithm.
