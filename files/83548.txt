Regorafenib Combined With Irinotecan Drug-Eluting Beads for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Irinotecan Drug-Eluting Beads combined with regorafenib as the third-line treatment for a patient with colorectal cancer liver metastases. The study is planned to enrolled 126 patients failing first- and second-line standard chemotherapy treatment.
Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases|Regorafenib
DRUG: Regorafenib and DIBIRI|DRUG: Regorafenib
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented PD or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurred first. When a patient was alive and without progression, PFS was censored at the date of the last disease assessment., 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR), 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR) + total number of Stable Disease (SD); CR, PR, or SD had to be maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating), 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), It was defined as the time from the first judgment of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to the discovery of disease progression (PD) after treatment, 24 months|Adverse enents, Safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics based on adverse events collection, 24 months
