Safety and Efficacy of Interferon Gamma-1b Plus Chemotherapy for Ovarian and Peritoneal Cancer
The purposes of this study are to determine: 1) if treatment with interferon gamma-1b plus standard chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) can increase the overall survival of patients with advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma compared with chemotherapy alone; 2) how effective interferon gamma-1b plus standard chemotherapy is in preventing the progression or return of cancer; 3) the effects on quality of life; and 4) the safety of interferon gamma-1b combined with standard chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.
Ovarian Carcinoma|Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: Interferon gamma-1b
Overall survival time assessed at end of study, 4 years
Progression-free survival time assessed at interim analysis, 4 years|Treatment failure-free survival time assessed at end of study, 4 years|Quality of life assessed through 24 months after end of treatment, 4 years
Approximately 800 patients will receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus Interferon gamma-1b. Chemotherapy will be paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours) followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) every 3 weeks. Only those patients in the treatment arm will receive interferon doses. Interferon gamma-1b 100 mg will be administered subcutaneously 3 times per week (every other day; no more than 3 doses in a 7-day period) continuously while patients are treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel (including for the 3 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy). A total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy will be given unless disease progression or liming toxicity occurs or patients refuse further treatment. Each patient will receive a total of 54 doses over a period of 18 weeks. Each patient's participation will be from 3-8 years in duration.
