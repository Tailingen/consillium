Biological and Clinical Efficacy of Shingrix in Patients With CLL
This is a biological study. Patients who are eligible to receive Shingrix through the Italian National Health System will be invited to participate in the study. According to AIFA indication, the two doses of vaccine will be administered 4-8 weeks apart. Blood samples will be collected prior to the first vaccine dose (i.e. within the time frame of 3 months prior to the first dose) and 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the second vaccine dose to evaluate the serological response of Shingrix.

Serologic response evaluation, Rate of positive serologic response to Shingrix in different subsets of patients as determined by antibody response to varicella-zoster virus (â‰¥4-fold increase in anti-gE titer from baseline), at 1 month
This is a multi-centre, prospective study, performed on biological samples only. Patients who are eligible to receive Shingrix through the Italian National Health System will be invited to participate in the study.

According to AIFA indication, the two doses of vaccine will be administered 4-8 weeks apart.

Blood samples will be collected prior to the first vaccine dose (i.e. within the time frame of 3 months prior to the first dose) and 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the second vaccine dose to evaluate the serological response of Shingrix. All protocol procedures (including clinical assessment and blood draws) will be performed during regular follow-up visits according to clinical practice. No additional invasive/dangerous/painful procedures will be required by the study.
