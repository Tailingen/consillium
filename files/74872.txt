Protocol to Obtain Blood for Discovery of Novel Biomarkers and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to collect a blood sample from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and from volunteers without CLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
OTHER: No Intervention
To identify the genes that are differentially expressed at the polysomal RNA and protein levels in human patient CLL cells (compared to normal donor lymphocytes) using high-throughput microarray approaches., 2 Years
To determine whether the novel candidate genes from Specific Aim 1 have potential roles in CLL. (Note: Specific Aim 2 does not involve human subjects research)., 2 Years
The blood sample will be used in the laboratory to perform focused studies on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).
