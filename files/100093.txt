Transarterial Chemoembolization With Doxorubicin With or Without Everolimus in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into the tumor and blocking the blood flow to the tumor. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin is more effective when given alone or when given together with everolimus in treating patients with liver cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when given together with transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin and to see how well it works compared with giving transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin alone in treating patients with liver cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the recommended dose of everolimus in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting beads (TACE). (Phase I)
* Determine the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with HCC treated with TACE as compared to TACE alone. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study followed by a randomized phase II study.

* Phase I: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 7 days after the start of everolimus patients undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) comprising doxorubicin-eluting beads into the hepatic artery followed in 4 weeks by an MRI. If viable tumor is found patients undergo another TACE treatment continuing every 4 weeks for up to 5 treatments.
* Phase II: Patients are stratified according to center, age (≤ 60 vs \> 60 years), and number of lesions (≤ 3 vs \> 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

  * Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for up to 12 months and undergo TACE comprising doxorubicin-eluting beads as in phase I at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
  * Arm II: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily for up to 12 months and undergo TACE comprising doxorubicin-eluting beads as in phase I at the MTD.

In both arms, patients receive treatment for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Blood samples are collected periodically for analysis of AFP tumor markers. Patients also complete quality of life questionnaires, Health Economic Assessment, and EQ5D questionnaires at baseline and periodically during the study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed on day 30, and then every 3 months.
