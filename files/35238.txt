A Study of MRG002 in the Treatment of Patients With HER2-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: MRG002
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose confirmed wherein â‰¤ 1/6 of patients in a treatment cohort experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., DLT will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle (Day 1-28)|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The dose level of MRG002 recommended for further clinical studies based on assessment of the safety, efficacy and PK data from this study., Baseline to study completion (up to 6 months)|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 49 days after the last dose of study treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR and PR assessed by IRC and investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 6 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 6 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 6 months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter of MRG002: Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration., Baseline to 21 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter of MRG002: Tmax, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration., Baseline to 21 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter of MRG002: t1/2, The time required for plasma concentration to decreased by on half., Baseline to 21 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter of MRG002: AUClast, Area under the curve up to the last validated measurable plasma concentration., Baseline to 21 days after the last dose of study treatment|Immunogenicity, The proportion of patients with positive ADA immunogenicity results., Baseline to 21 days after the last dose of study treatment
This study consists of two parts. Phase Ia is a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MRG002. Phase Ib is a dose expansion study to further assess the efficacy and safety of MRG002 at confirmed RP2D.
