Phase 1b Safety and Efficacy Study of TRU-016
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRU-016 in combination with rituximab, in combination with obinutuzumab, in combination with rituximab and idelalisib, or in combination with ibrutinib in patients with CLL; and in combination with bendamustine in patients with PTCL.

Incidence and severity of adverse events, any time point during the study up to 18 months|CLL Cysteine 481 mutation status, The primary endpoint for Cohort 7 is the elimination of the cysteine 481 mutant clone (\<1%)., CLL patients in Cohort 7 will be followed for 9 months unless no cysteine 481 mutation is detected.
Overall Response Rate (ORR), any time point during the study up to 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), any time point during the study up to 18 months|Overall survival (OS), any time point during the study up to 18 months|Duration of response (DOR), any time point during the study up to 18 months|Resolution of disease-related symptoms, Resolution of disease-related symptoms which are common to the disease include fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite pain, and pruritus; symptoms will be assessed by descriptive statistics and data listings., any time point during the study up to 18 months|Maximum serum drug concentration (Cmax), any time point during the study up to 12 months|Minimum serum drug concentration (Cmin), any time point during the study up to 12 months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-t and AUC0-âˆž), any time point during the study up to 12 months|Systemic clearance (CL), any time point during the study up to 12 months|Volume of distribution (Vd), any time point during the study up to 12 months|Elimination half-life (t1/2), any time point during the study up to 12 months
The study will consist of 8 dose cohorts:

1. Previously untreated patients 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.
2. Relapsed patients, 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.
3. Previously untreated patients 10 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.
4. Previously untreated patients TRU-016 + obinutuzumab.
5. Relapsed patients, 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab + idelalisib.
6. Patients with CLL on ibrutinib or another BTK inhibitor for a total of more than 1 year who have not had a complete response (CR) will continue receiving ibrutinib or another BTK inhibitor.
7. Patients with CLL on ibrutinib or another BTK inhibitor with stable disease and in whom the cysteine 481 mutant clone is present at a level \>1%, will continue receiving ibrutinib or the alternative BTK inhibitor.
8. Patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL will receive TRU-016 dosed 10 mg/kg for the first dose and then 20 mg/kg weekly for 2 cycles, followed by dosing every other week for an additional 4 cycles (cycle = 28 days) + bendamustine for 2 days every cycle for 6 cycles.
