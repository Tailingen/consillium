Evaluation of the Efficacy of Estramustine in Patient With Breast Cancer Progression After Treatment With Aromatase Inhibitor.
Despite advances in early detection and treatment strategy, about 25 to 40% of patients treated for breast cancer develop metastasis.

Some patients are in a therapeutic impasse situation. It is therefore necessary to consider all possible options. The Estramustine showed encouraging results in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Given the clinical data, the answer rate of Estramustine and its impact on progression free survival deserve to be studied in earlier clinical situation.

This Phase II study evaluated the efficacy of Estramustine in women with breast cancer and metastates, already treated with aromatase inhibitors and for whom this treatment has failed.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Estramustine|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Progression-free survival after a 6- month monotherapy with Estramustine in patients with HER2-/RH+ breast cancer progressing, proportion of patients in progression-free survival (PFS) after a 6-month treatment is defined as the duration of objective response or stabilisation of the disease according to the Recist criteria.

The following events shall be considered as progressive :

* Relapse
* Treatment intolerance leading to stop the treatment
* Death, up to 6 months
Risks of thrombosis, risks of thrombosis assessed by the analysis of biomarkers (D-Dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, Chain Reaction Protein), up to 6 months|Clinical benefit of estramustine, clinical benefit of estramustine assessed by RECIST criteria, 1 year|Correlation between the answer rate and biomarkers, answer rate (RECIST criteria) and level of biomarkers (Lactate déshydrogénase, Antigène carcino-embryonnaire and Cancer antigène 15-3), 1 year|Tolerance of estramustine treatment, Toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), 1 year|Tolerance of tamoxifen treatments, Toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), 1 year|Proportion of patients developing thromboembolic events, proportion of patients developing thromboembolic events assessed in the 2 groups every month during the one-year patient follow-up, 1 year
