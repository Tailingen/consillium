A Phase II Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Cisplatin + Gemcitabine Before Surgery to Remove the Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug, atezolizumab, when combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and cisplatin (or GC). This study will help researchers begin to understand whether combining GC with atezolizumab is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach of using GC alone.
Bladder Cancer|Metastatic Bladder Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Test the safety of atezolizumab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as assessed by dose limiting toxicity rate., CTCAE version 4.0 will be used for all patients on this trial for evaluation of toxicities during systemic therapy., Participants will be followed for survival until 5 years from treatment completion or until disease recurrence/progression.
Relapse-Free Survival, Relapse-Free Survival by RECIST v1.1 is measured from the time of treatment initiation until the first date that disease progression is objectively documented., 3 years
