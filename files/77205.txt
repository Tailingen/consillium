Study of Debio 0932 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours or Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Debio 0932 when administered orally, every-other-day or daily during the first 30 days, in patients with solid tumours or lymphoma.
Cancer|Neoplasms|Solid Tumors|Lymphoma
DRUG: Debio 0932
Occurence of DLTs for both schedules, Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for both schedule A and schedule B, 30 days
Incidence of AEs, change in safety and efficacy parameters, Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, treatment discontinuations due to AEs for both schedules and expansion phase, change in 12-lead ECG (RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals), rate of confirmed response, duration of response and disease control, pharmacodynamic biomarkers and drug pharmacokinetic parameters., Duration of study
This is an open-label, non-randomised, dose-escalation phase I, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced and/or refractory malignancies (solid tumours or lymphoma), to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of Debio 0932 administered orally every-other-day (schedule A) or every day (schedule B) and to assess its safety profile, pharmakokinetic, antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

Increments used in dose escalation will be determined according to the maximum grade of treatment-related adverse events observed during the first 30-day treatment period of each schedule in the previous in the preceding dose level Once reaching the recommended dose (RD) for each schedule, up to 40 additional patients will be enrolled and treated at the RD of the retained schedule, as part of an expansion phase.
