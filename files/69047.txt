Immunotherapy With CEA(6D) VRP Vaccine (AVX701) in Patients With Stage III Colorectal Cancer
This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety of a vaccine that consists of an alphavirus replicon (VRP) encoding the protein (CEA) that has been found to be associated with cancers such as colon cancer in patients that have stage III colon cancer. We will also evaluate the patient immune response to the vaccine.
