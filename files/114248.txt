The Application of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis Analysis
The application of multimodal data fusion in prostate cancer will bring new opportunities to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. By integrating imaging, genomics, pathology, and clinical data, we expect to realize precision medicine for prostate cancer and significantly improve the survival prognosis of patients.

Prostate cancer stands as one of the most prevalent malignancies among men across the globe. Global cancer statistics reveal that the number of new prostate cancer diagnoses rises annually.

In recent years, the advent of multimodal data fusion technology has paved the way for innovative diagnostic and prognostic approaches in prostate cancer. For instance, the synergy of MRI imaging with clinical indicators such as PSA levels and Gleason scores not only refines the staging of prostate cancer but also sheds light on a patient's likely response to treatment and survival outlook.

The exponential growth of artificial intelligence, particularly the broad adoption of deep learning and machine learning algorithms, has emerged as a formidable asset in the realm of multimodal data analysis. By developing an AI-driven multimodal data fusion system, vast medical datasets can be efficiently processed, laying the groundwork for a more nuanced auxiliary diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making framework.
