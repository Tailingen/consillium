EIS-12656 as Single Agent and in Combination in Patients With Specified Solid Tumors
This trial investigates a new drug, EIS-12656, in participants with specified advanced solid tumors carrying pre-specified mutations. The trial consists of a dose escalation part (Phase 1) and a dose expansion part (Phase 2).

Number and percentage of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Number and percentage of participants with adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest including changes in safety lab parameters, physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG), From screening until end of treatment follow-up (45 days after last dose) (up to 7 months)|Number and percentage of participants experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (dose escalation part only), A DLT is defined as an EIS-12656 related adverse event during the first treatment cycle that meets the criteria outlined in the study protocol, Within 21 days of first dose
Maximum plasma concentration of EIS-12656 (Cmax), The concentration of EIS-12656 in plasma will be determined (Cmax will be derived), At pre-defined intervals from pre-dose Day 1 to Day 29|Area under the curve (AUC0-24), The AUC0-24 reflects the actual body exposure to drug over the last 24h dosing interval, At pre-defined intervals from pre-dose Day 1 to Day 29|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), The concentration of EIS-12656 in plasma will be determined (Tmax will be derived), At pre-defined intervals from pre-dose Day 1 to Day 29|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate defined as percentage of participants with the best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST v1.1, From screening to disease progression (approximately 1 year)|Duration of Response, Time from first response to progression or death, as defined by RECIST 1.1, From screening to disease progression or death (approximately 1 year)|Progression Free Survival, Time from first dose of EIS-12656 to progression or death, as defined by RECIST 1.1, From screening to disease progression or death (approximately 1 year)
The trial is a Phase 1/2, open label, uncontrolled trial to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of EIS-12656 alone or in combination with a PARPi or T-DXd in patients with specified advanced or metastatic solid tumors with homologous recombination deficient (HRD) mutations.

In the Phase 1 dose escalation phase participants will receive ascending doses of EIS-12656 to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine an effective and safe dose for the Phase 2 part.

In the Phase 2 dose expansion phase participants will either receive EIS-12656 monotherapy at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Module 1) or EIS-12656 in combination with a PARPi or T-DXd (Modules 2 and 3). The objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and anti-tumor activity of EIS-12656 alone or in combination.
