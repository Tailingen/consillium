Basket Study of AB-106 for the Treatment of Patients With Solid Tumors With NTRK Fusion Gene
AB-106 will be administered once a day. Each treatment cycle is defined as 21 days of continuous medication. Dosing will continue until any of the following conditions are met: disease progression, intolerable drug-related adverse events, researchers recommend discontinuation of treatment, withdrawal of informed consent, pregnancy during the study, use of other anti-tumor therapy, loss of follow-up, death and other causes, whichever occurs first.

The study includes a screening period, treatment period, safety follow-up and long-term follow-up.
