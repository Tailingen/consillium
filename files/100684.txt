A Phase 3 Study of Donafenib in Patients With Radioiodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to compare the progression free survival, overall response rate (ORR) and safety of participants treated with Donafenib 0.3g Bid by continuous oral dosing versus placebo.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Donafenib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), as determined by Independent imaging review committee(IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for the double-blind treatment period., Date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first) or up to approximately 3 years.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival measured from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause., Date of randomization until date of death from any cause, or up to approximately 3 years.|Objective Response Rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response(CR)+total number of Partial Response(PR)., From randomization of the first subject until the last subject complete 24 months treatment|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR) + total number of Stable Disease (SD); CR, PR, or SD had to be maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating), From randomization of the first subject until the last subject complete 24 months treatment|Time To Disease Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from date of randomization to disease progression radiological. Subjects without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first subject until the last subject complete 24 months treatment
Blinded Phase: Participants will receive blinded study drug (Donafenib/placebo) in 2:1 ratio until documentation of disease progression (confirmed by independent imaging review committee), development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. After having completed the primary analysis, subjects treated with Donafenib who have not experienced disease progression may request to continue open label Donafenib at the same dose, according to the clinical judgment of the investigator. Participants who discontinue treatment for any reason other than disease progression will be followed in the Blinded Phase until disease progression or start of another anticancer treatment; these participants then enter the Open label Phase for survival follow-up.

Open label Phase: Participants in the placebo arm who have disease progression confirmed by IRC could request to enter the Optional Open Label Donafenib Treatment Period and receive Donafenib treatment. Participants will receive Donafenib treatment until disease progression, development of intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Participants who had disease progression during the blinded Phase and did not enter the Optional Open Label Donafenib Treatment Period and all participants who discontinued Donafenib treatment in the Optional Open Label Donafenib Treatment Period will enter the follow-up period. Participants will be followed for survival, and all anticancer treatments will be recorded until the time of death.
