RNA Sequencing of Solid and Cystic Lesions of the Pancreas
The nature of cysts and solid masses in the pancreas can be difficult to diagnose. They may be benign, precancerous, or cancer. Current tests such as cytology (looking under a microscope) and tumor markers do not always give us the answer. The investigators are looking for genetic markers on biopsy specimens from the pancreas that will give us a better test for diagnosis. This study is only for diagnosing these lesions. The investigators are not treating any patients.
