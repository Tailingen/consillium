Phase I/II Study of Z-208 in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This phase I/II is studying the side effect and best dose of Z-208 for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Z-208
Phase I: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Z-208 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, 28 days|Phase II : Assess the objective tumor response rate in patients according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, 28 days for 6 courses
Phase I : Assess the objective tumor response rate in patients according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, 28 days for 6 courses|Phase I : Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients, 28 days for 6 courses|Phase I : Determine the adverse effects profile of this drug in these patients, 28 days for 6 courses|Phase II: Determine the PFS, 28 days for 6 courses
This is an open-label, dose-escalation study PhaseI Treatments repeats for 28 days for 1 course in the unacceptable toxicity

Cohort of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Z-208 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PhaseII Treatments repeats for 28 days for 6 courses until absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
