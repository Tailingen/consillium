A Study of KM501 in Patients With Solid Tumors
A single-arm, open, multicenter Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of the KM501 double-antibody ADC in subjects with advanced solid tumors that express, amplify, or mutate HER2
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: KM501
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (for Part 1a), Determine MTD of KM501, Up to 4weeks|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (if has) (Part 1a), Determine Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KM501, Up to 4 weeks.|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events （Part 1a）, Incidence of AE as assessed by CTCAE 5.0, Up to 8 months.|Objective response rate (ORR) (Part 1b), Number of participants who achieved a best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during treatment evaluated by investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 2-3 years.
Area under the concentration versus time curve of KM501 in plasma (AUC)(Part 1a and Part1b)., To determine the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of KM501, Up to 8 months for Part 1a; Up to 2 to 3 years for Part1b.|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of KM501(Part 1a and Part 1b )., Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration in ng/mL, Up to 63days for Part 1a; Up to 63 days for Part1b.|Serum Half-life (T-HALF) of KM501.
