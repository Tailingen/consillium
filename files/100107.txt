Image-Guided Tumorboost of Bladder Cancer
The purpose of the study is to increase the radiation dose (Boost) to the bladder tumor. The bladder cancer patients included in the study will undergo tumor demarcation. The bladder demarcations will then be the target for an image-guided boost delivered precisely to the expected tumor site.
Bladder Neoplasms
RADIATION: Radiation boost
Local tumor control, One year
Acute and late adverse effects of the radiotherapy treatment, 3 years
