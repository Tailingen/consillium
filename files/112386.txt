This is a phase I open-label, single and dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of WBC100, a drug targeting c-myc, in subjects who have been diagnosed with c-myc positive advanced solid tumor and refractory or intolerant to current standard systemic treatment.
