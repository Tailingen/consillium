Exogenous Testosterone Plus Dutasteride for the Treatment of Castrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Usually, the male hormone testosterone makes prostate cancer cells grow. Lowering testosterone usually stops the growth of prostate cancer. However, after a period of time without testosterone, prostate cancer cells learn to grow again.

You are able to join this trial because your prostate cancer is growing even though you have very low levels of testosterone. Studies have shown that high doses of testosterone, in this situation, can cause prostate cancer cells to stop growing.

The investigators did a study several years ago in which the investigators gave high doses of testosterone to patients such as yourself. The investigators showed that giving testosterone in this situation was safe. The investigators also showed that the investigators could, in some cases, make the PSA go down using high-dose testosterone.

The investigators believe that they can improve this type of treatment by combining testosterone with another drug called dutasteride. Dutasteride is another type of hormone. It should make testosterone levels rise. The investigators believe that combination of dutasteride and testosterone will be more a more powerful regimen against your cancer than testosterone alone.
Prostate Cancer|Castration-resistant, Metastatic
OTHER: testosterone (AndroGel®) with the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride
determine anti-tumor effects of the combination of testosterone + dutasteride in pts with castration-resistant prostate ca, as indicated by the proportion of pts remaining alive & progression free, 12 weeks from the start of testosterone treatment
To explore the association between AR expression in CRPC, as determined at baseline separately by AR FISH (performed on CTCs) and by 18F-FDHT uptake on PET scan, and progression free survival to the combination of testosterone plus dutasteride., 12 weeks|To correlate post-treatment changes in CTCs and FDG and FDHT PET scans with post-treatment alterations in PSA and standard CT (or MRI) and bone scans., post treatment
