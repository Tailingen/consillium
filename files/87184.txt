Pharmacokinetics of Apixaban in Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Study investigators will examine the absorption characteristics of apixaban, a direct-acting oral anticoagulation, in patients who have underwent a particular kind of surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy) which involves resection of the duodenum.

This study will examine apixaban pharmacokinetic exposure (AUC(0-24)) and maximum concentration (Cmax) when administered as a single oral dose in patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) compared to historical controls. This is a phase one, single dose pharmacokinetic study in stable patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy. Apixaban is an orally administered highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, belonging to the class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) along with rivaroxoban and edoxaban. Factor Xa is an essential mediator of the clotting pathway in humans. Apixaban is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of VTE, prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing knee and hip replacement surgeries and for reducing the risk of embolic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and absorption of oral apixaban in patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy to that of apixaban in historical controls.
