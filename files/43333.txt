First-line Treatment With Icotinib in Elder NSCLC EGFR Mutated Patients
A single arm, open label, phase IV trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of icotinib as first-line treatment for the elder patients with advanced or metastatic (IIIb and IV) NSCLC and mutated EGFR.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Icotinib
Progression free survival, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., 12 months
Overall survival, Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive., 24 months|Objective response rate, Number of participants with an objective response. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 3-6 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, Adverse events, Serious adverse events , incidence of and reason for study drug dose interruptions and discontinuations, laboratory assessments, vital signs., 18 months
A single arm, open label, prospective, phase IV trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of icotinib as first-line treatment for the elder patients with advanced or metastatic (IIIb and IV) NSCLC and mutated EGFR.

* Primary endpoint to assess progression-free survival
* Secondary endpoints to assess the overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate and so on.
