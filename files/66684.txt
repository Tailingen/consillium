Safety Study of Totally Laparoscopic Resection With Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction (NOSE) for Rectosigmoid Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic resection with natural orifice specimen extraction versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon or rectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: transrectal specimen extraction|PROCEDURE: Conventional laparoscopic surgery
Early morbidity rate, The early morbidity rate is defined as the event observed during operation and within 30 days after surgery., 30 days
Duration of the intervention, Duration of surgery., 1 day|Peritoneal bacterial contamination, Peritoneal fluid samples were collected under sterile conditions at the end of the procedure and sent for gram stain as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and fungal cultures.We assess the contamination rate of peritoneal fluid in the two interventions., 1 day|Pain score, Recording of the needed analgesia guided by pain score, 14 days|3-year disease free survival rate, A survival analysis will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, for which a comparison of the survival curve will also made using a Log-rank test., 3 years|5-year overall survival rate, A survival analysis will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, for which a comparison of the survival curve will also made using a Log-rank test., 5 years|Plasma levels of several cytokines after colorectal cancer surgery, We have measured and compared perioperative plasma levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in the two group sample., 7 days
