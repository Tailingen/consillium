Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluated per International Myeloma Working Group Response Criteria, 4 weeks
Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events will be classified and graded according to the CTCAE v.5.0. Frequencies of adverse events will be summarized on all patients who receive any study drug., 4 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who have not progressed or died are censored at the date last known progression-free. This is estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., The time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause, for up to 10 years.
