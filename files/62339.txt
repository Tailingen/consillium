Navtemadlin (KRT-232) With or Without Anti-PD-1/Anti-PD-L1 for the Treatment of Patients With Merkel Cell Carcinoma
This study evaluates KRT-232, a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of MDM2, for the treatment of patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) who have failed treatment with at least one anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy or in combination with avelumab in MCC patients who are anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment naïve. Inhibition of MDM2 is a novel mechanism of action in MCC.
Merkel Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: KRT-232|DRUG: Avelumab
Cohort 1 Part 1: To determine the KRT-232 RP2D., The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will determine RP2D for expansion based on safety and tolerability of each arm., 10 Weeks|Cohort 1 Part 2: To determine the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with p53WT MCC who have failed anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy, ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria version 1.1 after all subjects have been treated at the RP2D of KRT 232 and completed the second response assessment., 10 Weeks|Cohort 2 Part 1: To determine the KRT-232 RP2D in combination with avelumab, DLTs will be used to establish the MTD of KRT-232 in combination with avelumab. SRC will determine the RP2D based on the safety of combination of KRT-232 with avelumab., 28 Days|Cohort 2 Part 2: To determine the objective response rate (ORR) in treatment-naïve subjects with p53WT MCC, ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria version 1.1 after all 30 subjects have been treated at the RP2D of in combination with avelumab and have completed the second response assessment., 10 Weeks|Cohort 3: To determine the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) based on IRC assessments in subjects with p53WT MCC are chemotherapy naive and have failed anti-PD-1/PD-L., ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria 1.1 by IRC., 10 Weeks|Cohort 4: To determine the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) based on IRC assessments in subjects with p53WT MCC who have failed anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy and have had least 1 line of prior chemotherapy., ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria 1.1 by IRC., 10 Weeks
To determine the confirmed ORR based on investigator assessment., ORR will be assessed per RECIST criteria 1.1 by investigators., 1 year after last subject enrolled.|To determine the duration of response (DoR), Time from documentation of response (CR or PR as determined by RECIST 1.1) until disease progression., 1 year after last subject enrolled|To determine Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from initial treatment until disease progression., 1 year after last subject enrolled|To determine overall survival (OS), Time from initial treatment until death from any cause., 1 year after last subject enrolled|To determine clinical benefit rate (CBR), PR, CR or stable disease that last at least 10 weeks, per IRC or investigator assessment., 1 year after last subject enrolled.
