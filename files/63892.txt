Abiraterone/Prednisone, Olaparib, or Abiraterone/Prednisone + Olaparib in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer With DNA Repair Defects
This is a biomarker preselected, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients with tumors that have ATM, BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations/deletions/loss of heterozygosity will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to each arm. Patients with mutations in noncanonical DNA repair genes including FANCA, PALB2, RAD51, ERCC3, MRE11, NBN, MLH3, CDK12, CHEK2, HDAC2, ATR, PMS2, GEN1, MSH2, MSH6, BRIP1, or FAM175A defects will be assigned to Arm IV with single agent olaparib.

DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone
Objective Progression Free Survival (PFS), Evaluate the objective PFS of abiraterone/prednisone, olaparib or the combination abiraterone/prednisone + olaparib in mCRPC patients with canonical DNA repair defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM., Up to 2 years
Measurable disease response rate by RECIST, Objective disease response (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) assessed using RECIST 1.1., Up to 2 years|PSA response rate, PSA response rate (CR + PR) will be measured., Up to 2 years|Rate of undetectable PSA, The rate of undetectable PSA (CR) will be measured., Up to 2 years|Poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) inhibition, Evaluate if noncanonical DNA repair defects have clinical susceptibility to PARP inhibition alone., Up to 2 years|Incidence of Adverse Events, To evaluate the safety of the combination of abiraterone/prednisone + olaparib combination therapy. Adverse events will be assessed by the National Cancer Institute's CTCAE 4.0., Up to 2 years|The post progression response rate with cross over to olaparib or abiraterone, The response rate will be evaluated in patients who cross over to olaparib or abiraterone post progression on therapy with abiraterone or olaparib respectively by treatment arm., Up to 2 years|The post progression PFS with cross over to olaparib or abiraterone, The PFS will be evaluated in patients who cross over to olaparib or abiraterone post progression on therapy with abiraterone or olaparib respectively by treatment arm., Up to 2 years|Qualitative toxicities, Adverse Event summaries will be reported by treatment arm and organized by body system, frequency of occurrence, intensity (i.e., severity grade), and causality or attribution. Treatment exposure will be summarized for all patients, including dose administration, number of cycles, dose modifications or delays, and duration of therapy., Up to 2 years|Quantitative toxicities, Adverse Event summaries will be reported by treatment arm and organized by body system, frequency of occurrence, intensity (i.e., severity grade), and causality or attribution. Treatment exposure will be summarized for all patients, including dose administration, number of cycles, dose modifications or delays, and duration of therapy., Up to 2 years
