CLEVER Pilot Trial: A Phase II Pilot Trial of HydroxyChLoroquine, EVErolimus or the Combination for Prevention of Recurrent Breast Cancer
To evaluate the feasibility of administering HCQ, EVE or the combination in patients who have completed primary therapy for breast cancer and harbor bone marrow disseminated tumor cells.
Breast Cancer Stage IIB
DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine|DRUG: Everolimus
Feasibility: Number of Participants Who Completed 6 Cycles of Protocol Treatment Without Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity, For the primary endpoint of feasibility, we employed ongoing Bayesian toxicity monitoring after every 3 participants completed cycle 6, assuming a Beta (1,2) prior, equivalent to one DLT observed in 3 treated participants. Early termination of a treatment arm for toxicity (non-feasibility) would occur if the posterior probability that the toxicity rate exceeds the target maximum of 30% was greater than 75%. Trial enrollment and conduct was significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, including shortage of HCQ and inability of enrolled patients to travel. To address this, we amended the protocol to allow study Arms C and D to be combined for feasibility assessment, given that the investigational treatment was the same in the two arms, enabling enrollment to be halted when the sample size needed for feasibility assessment was complete for all study treatments. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v4.0., 3 years
