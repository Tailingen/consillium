AYA STEPS RCT: AYA Self-Management Via Texting, Education & Plans for Survivors
The proposed project will leverage two programs of research at UPenn and CHOP that are delivering technology-based interventions to adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors.

In the proposed study, all AYA survivors will receive a care plan via a tool (Smart-ALACC). They will then be randomized to receive (or not) a mobile health application (AYA STEPS) that will provide tailored messages to enhance uptake of their care plan.
