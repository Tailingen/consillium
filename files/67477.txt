Predictive Value of Human Microbiome and Serological Markers for Clinical Outcome of AIS With Active Cancer
Explore with active cancer patients with acute ischemic stroke in the human body characteristic microorganism disorder to clinical prognosis of the predictive value of the secondary objective: to observe with active cancer patients with acute ischemic stroke in the body of microorganisms and their serological indexes change law of exploration condition change related biomarkers of microscopic objects group based on the human body.
Ischemic Stroke, Acute|Tumor Progression
OTHER: intestinal flora disturbance
Neurological function score (mRS score), Neurological function score (mRS score) ，The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 5，The higher the mRS score, the worse the prognosis, 3 months after onset|Mortality, Mortality, 3 months after onset
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score(NIHSS score), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score(NIHSS score) ，The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 42，The higher the NIHSS score, the worse the neurological function, The first and seventh days of hospitalization、3 months, 6 months and 12 months after onset|Barthel Index, Barthel Index，The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100，The higher the BI index, the better the ability to take care of yourself, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after onset|Mini-mental State Examination, Mini-mental State Examination，The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 30，Closely related to educational attainment, the higher the score, the better the Closely related to educational attainment, the higher the score, the better the Closely related to educational attainment, the higher the score, the better the cognitive function, Seventh day of hospitalization、3 months and 6 months after onset|Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Montreal Cognitive Assessment，The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 30，Closely related to educational attainment, the higher the score, the better the cognitive function, Seventh day of hospitalization、3 months and 6 months after onset
investigators recently found that changes in gut microbiota in patients with ischemic stroke are associated with the development of disease. However, there are few studies on the correlation between ischemic stroke with cancer and human microbiome and metabolites Whether the human microbiome and its metabolites are associated with the prognosis of such patients remains to be investigated. Therefore, this study hypothesized that structural changes in the human microbiome and its metabolites in patients with acute ischemic stroke with active cancer were associated with stroke severity and disease recovery Therefore, this topic proposed by collecting active follow-up cancer of acute ischemic stroke patients after admission and oral swabs Excrement and urine and blood samples, and based on the queue, follow-up analysis of the human microbiome dynamic change rule and the prognosis of patients with cancer of the acute ischemic stroke correlation, activity, further explore the secondary prevention of stroke management strategy based on the human microbiome.
