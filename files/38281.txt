Patient-centered, Optimal Integration of Survivorship and Palliative Care
The goal of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a supportive care model (POISE) for patients with metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The main questions are

* is POISE feasible to deliver and acceptable to patients
* what is the effect of POISE on the distress patients feel related to their uncertain future, their confidence in their ability to manage cancer, and their understanding about what to expect Participants in the randomized controlled trial will receive either the new supportive care model, POISE, which consists of four visits with a trained palliative care clinician, or care as usual, and will be asked to complete three surveys.

Notes with a predicted probability of greater than 0.5 will be classified as containing goals of care documentation., 20 weeks

This research study involves an intervention consisting of four sessions with palliative care specialists who have been additionally trained to evaluate and address the specific psychosocial issues and health-promoting behaviors of patients with NSCLC.

The research study procedures include:

* Four 60-minute visits with a trained palliative care clinician
* Questionnaires and an exit interview
* Chart Review

It is expected that about 70 participants currently receiving targeted therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital for lung cancer will take part in this research study: 10 patients in an open pilot study, followed by 60 patients in a randomized controlled trial.
