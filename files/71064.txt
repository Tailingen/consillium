Recurrence Rate After Endoscopic Resection of , Laterally Spreading Tumor Granular Type (LST-G) of the Colon and Rectum: Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Vs. Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early-stage non-polypoid neoplastic lesions, particularly Laterally Spreading Tumors - Granular Type (LST-G) larger than 20mm, require effective endoscopic removal to prevent malignant progression. The two primary techniques for resecting these lesions are Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) and Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD).

EMR is a widely used, minimally invasive technique that involves resecting the lesion with a diathermic snare after submucosal injection. While effective and safe, EMR often necessitates piecemeal resection, increasing the risk of local recurrence. In contrast, ESD, developed in Asia, allows for en bloc resection regardless of lesion size, ensuring more accurate histopathological assessment and lower recurrence rates. However, ESD requires greater technical expertise, has longer procedural times, and carries a higher risk of complications.

In Western clinical practice, EMR remains the standard treatment, whereas ESD is selectively performed in high-expertise centers. Given the lack of randomized controlled trials comparing EMR and ESD in Western populations, this study aims to provide robust clinical evidence to guide treatment decisions.

The primary objective of this study is to compare the recurrence/residual adenomatous tissue rate at 6 and 12 months between EMR and ESD in patients with LST-G lesions of the colon and rectum
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)
Recurrence/Adenomatous Residual Rate, Proportion of patients with local recurrence or residual adenomatous tissue, confirmed through follow-up colonoscopies and histopathological examination., 6 and 12 months after treatment
Complete Resection Rate, Proportion of patients with a complete histopathological resection (R0), defined as tumor-free margins in both lateral and deep resection edges, out of the total number of randomized patients, 6 and 12 months after treatment|Differences in Procedure Time, Comparison of the average duration of the procedure (from submucosal injection to complete lesion resection) between the EMR and ESD groups. The procedure time is measured intraoperatively and is calculated as the total duration from the initial submucosal injection to the completion of lesion resection., Up to 2 months|Bleeding Rate, Number of patients experiencing bleeding out of the total number of randomized patients., During procedure (up to 2 months from enrollment) and 24 hours and 3 months after treatment|Perforation Rate, Number of patients with an intraoperative perforation, defined as visible mesenteric fat or free peritoneal space during the procedure, or delayed perforation diagnosed based on symptoms (abdominal pain, fever, peritonitis) and confirmed by radiological imaging (free air, fluid collection)., During procedure (up to 2 months from enrollment) and 24 hours and 3 months after treatment|Overall Complication Rate, Proportion of patients experiencing at least one complication, classified according to the Accordion Severity Classification of Postoperative Complications., 24 hours after treatment
