A Single-center Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of LCAR-L10D Cell Formulations Targeting CD19 and CD22 in Patients With CD19- and/or CD22-Positive Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, open-label, single-dose dose finding and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy profile of LCAR-L10D in subjects with CD19- and/or CD22-positive relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma after prior adequate standard of care.
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: Dual Specificity CD19 and CD22 CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
Type, incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to a drug-related toxicity during treatment with the drug, the severity of which is clinically unacceptable, limiting the further escalation of drug dose. An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment, Day 1-90 days after injection|Chimeric Antigen Receptor T（CAR-T）Positive Cell Concentration, Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of CAR-T positive cellular concentration, Day 1-90 days after injection
Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of this cell therapy, Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), Day 1-90 days after injection|Overall response rate (ORR) after administration, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LCAR-L10Dcell infusion, and the objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease per Lugano 2014 only., 2 years post infusion|Duration of remission (DOR) after administration, Duration of Remission (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (PR or better) to the first documented disease progression evidence (according to LUGANO 2014 ) of the responders (who achieve PR or better response)., 2 years post infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS) after administration, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LCAR-L10Dto the first documented disease progression (according to LUGANO 2014 ) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first., 2 years post infusion|Overall Survival (OS) after administration, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-L10Dto death of the subject., 2 years post infusion|Time to Response (TTR) after administration, Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-L10Dto the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for PR or better., 2 years post infusion|Incidence of anti-LCAR-L10D antibody and positive sample titer, Venous blood samples will be collected to measure LCAR-L10Dpositive cell concentrations and the transgenic level of LCAR-L10D, at the time points when anti-LCAR-L10D antibody serum samples are evaluated., Day 1-90 days after injection
CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies, CD19 and CD22 are proteins usually expressed on the surface of the lymphoma cells. The dual specificity CAR enables the T-cells to recognize and kill the tumor cell through recognition of CD19 and CD22.
