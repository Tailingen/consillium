A Study of Standard Treatment +/- Apatinib in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
To establish the progression free survival in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with cisplatin and etoposide plus or not apatinib
Progression Free Survival
DRUG: cisplatin, etoposide|DRUG: cisplatin, etoposide, apatinib
progression free survival, from the date of randomization to disease progression, 24 months
Assess progression free survival, overall survival and toxicity of standard EP regimen combined or not with VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor-apatinib. Response measured by RECIST response criteria. Toxicity via physical exam, adverse event review, assessing signs and symptoms, quality of life assessment and blood testing.
