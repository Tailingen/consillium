A Study of Fluzoparib Combined With QL1101 Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer Following Response on Front-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
This is a Prospective,Single-Center, Single-Arm, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fluzoparib Combined With QL1101, as maintenance treatment, in patients with Advanced FIGO Stage III or IV High Grade Serous or Endometrioid Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or primary peritoneal cancer following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy with QL1101. Eligible participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in addition to QL1101 will be enrolled in the study and will receive maintenance treatment with fluzoparib (for up to 2 years) combined with QL1101 (for up to 10 months during the maintenance phase or up to a total of 15 months inclusive of the approximately 5 months of bevacizumab received with chemotherapy) or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant withdrawal, Investigator's decision, or death, whichever comes first.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Fluzoparib|BIOLOGICAL: QL1101
Progression-Free-Survival(PFS), PFS by investigator's assessment, up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time interval from the start of treatment to death due to any reason or lost of follow-up. For subjects who survived or were lost to follow-up by the data analysis cutoff date, survival was truncated by the subject's last known survival time., up to 2 years|Second Progression Free Survival（PFS2）, Time to progression on the next anticancer therapy (PFS2) From date of start of next anticancer therapy to date of first documented progression of date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. The impact of this study's maintenance regimen on patient follow-up was determined by assessing the time from enrollment to second progression (PFS2), or the purpose of the PFS2 analysis was to demonstrate whether maintenance treatment could reduce the benefit provided by follow-up., up to 2 years|Time to start of first subsequent therapy or death（TFST）, The evaluation of the efficacy of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy by assessing the time to first follow-up or death, in addition to the similar assessment role as for PFS, allows evaluation of whether the regimen has an impact on follow-up and, if follow-up is delayed, on PFS2 and OS., up to 2 years|Health-related quality of life（HRQoL）, To evaluate the effects of this trial protocol on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with high-risk advanced epithelial ovarian cancer as assessed by the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovary (FACT-O).The TOI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores associated with higher HRQoL., up to week 24
