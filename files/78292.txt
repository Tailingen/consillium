L-DEP Regimen as a Salvage Therapy for Refractory Epstein Barr Virus-induced Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Pegaspargase together with liposomal doxorubicin, etoposide and high dose methylprednisolone (L-DEP) as a salvage therapy for refractory Epstein Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis
DRUG: Pegaspargase|DRUG: doxorubicin|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: methylprednisolone
Evaluation of treatment response, A complete response was defined as normalization of all of the quantifiable symptoms and laboratory markers of HLH, including levels of sCD25, ferritin, and triglyceride; hemoglobin; neutrophil counts; platelet counts; and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

A partial response was defined as at least a 25% improvement in 2 or more quantifiable symptoms and laboratory markers as follows: sCD25 response was\>1.5-fold decreased; ferritin and triglyceride decreased at least 25%; for patients with an initial neutrophil count of\<0.5 ×109/L, a response was defined as an increase by at least 100% to\>0.5× 109/L; for patients with a neutrophil count of 0.5 to 2.0 × 109/L, an increase by at least 100% to \>2.0 × 109/L was considered a response; and for patients with ALT \>400 U/L, response was defined as an ALT decrease of at least 50%., Change from before and 2,4,6 and 8 weeks after initiating L-DEP salvage therapy|Change of Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-DNA, Change from before and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after initiating L-DEP salvage therapy
Survival, from the time patients received L-DEP salvage therapy up to 24 months or November 2019|Adverse events that are related to treatment, Adverse events including pancreatitis, liver function damage, myelosuppression, infection, bleeding and so on., through study completion, an average of 2 years
