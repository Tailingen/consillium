An Phase I Study of YY001 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
The safety and tolerability of YY001 in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated, and the possible dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II clinical dose (RP2D) were observed.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: YY001
Dose limiting toxicity, The incidence and severity of adverse events (TEAE) during treatment were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v5.0), Up to 24 days after the initial drug administration|Maximum tolerated dose, In the dose increment stage, the highest dose whose estimated DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate but does not exceed the upper bound of the equivalent interval of DLT rate is selected as MTD., Up to 24 days after the initial drug administration|Recommended Dose for Phase II Clinical Studies (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of YY001., Up to 24 days after the initial drug administration
Duration of Response(DoR), The time from the patient's first objective response to the patient's disease recurrence, progression, or death., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from start date of study drug to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 24 months
The safety and tolerability of YY001 in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated, and the possible dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II clinical dose (RP2D) were observed.
