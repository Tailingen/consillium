FOLFIRI Alone Versus FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab Versus FOLFIRI Plus E7820 as Second-Line Therapy in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of the Phase Ib portion is to find out the highest dose of study drug that can safely be given when tested in a small group of subjects.

The purpose of the Phase II portion is to find out how safe the study drug is when taken at the highest dose in a larger group of subjects.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: E7820|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicities were defined as clinically significant adverse events (AEs) occurring less than or equal to (\<=) 28 days after commencing study treatment and considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study treatment. Toxicity was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0)., Cycle 1 (each cycle length=28 days)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse Events were defined as TEAEs if they started on or after the date and time of administration of the first dose of study drug during the study. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Any change in hematology, clinical chemistry, urine values and regular measurement of vital signs which were deemed clinically significant by the investigator were recorded as TEAE., From date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 11.5 months)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), ECOG-PS measured participant's performance status on 5 point scale: 0=Fully active/able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction; 1=restricted in physically strenuous activity, ambulatory/able to carry out light or sedentary work; 2=ambulatory (greater than\[ \>\] 50 percent \[%\] of waking hours), capable of all self care, unable to carry out any work activities; 3=capable of only limited self care, confined to bed/chair \>50% of waking hours; 4=completely disabled, cannot carry on any self care, totally confined to bed/chair; 5=dead., From date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 11.5 months)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Physical Examinations, Physical examination included examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, heart, chest, lungs, abdomen, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, and neurological status., From date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 11.5 months)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Electrocardiograms (ECGs) Parameter, ECG was to be a complete standardized 12-lead recording. The ECGs were reviewed by the investigator or designee prior to study drug administration as part of the participant's standard of care., From date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 11.5 months)
Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization of a participant to the date of first documentation of PD or death (whichever occurred first) based on investigator assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 millimeter (mm) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From the date of randomization to date of PD or death (whichever occurred first), up to 11 months|Phase 2: Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as time from the date of randomization of a participant until the date of first documented progression of such participant's disease based on investigator assessments according to RECIST v.1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 mm increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From date randomization to date of PD or death, up to 11 months|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants in the study whose best overall response was either CR or PR based on investigator assessments according to RECIST v1.1. A confirmatory scan was required after no less than 4 weeks and no later than 8 weeks, starting on the date that the response was first recorded. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to less than (\<)10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of treatment start to until date of first PD or death (whichever occurred first), up to 11 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as time from the date of randomization of a participant until the date of death of such participant, regardless of the actual cause of the participant's death., From date of randomization to date of PD or death, up to 11 months
The primary purpose for Phase 1b: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7820 recommended for Phase 2 when administered in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen (irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil \[5-FU\]) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have failed first-line therapy. Phase 2: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of E7820 administered in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen, compared with FOLFIRI alone and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mCRC who have failed first-line therapy.
