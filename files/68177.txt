Remote Telemonitoring of Patient-Generated Physiologic Health Data and Patient-Reported Outcomes
This study examines at-home monitoring of patient-generated phsyiologic health data and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-generated health data using at-home monitoring devices and smart device applications are used more and more to measure value and quality in cancer care. This trial may show whether at-home monitoring programs can improve the care of patients after hospital discharge from surgery.

Patterns, trajectory, and changes in patient-generated health data (PGHD), After discharge, all patient-generated physiologic data will be repeated at day 7,14,,and day 30 to measure any differences in weight, temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure and functional activity using the Aetonix devices and Vivofit watches, Up to 30 days|Patient reported outcomes (PROs) (symptoms, quality of life [QOL]) between groups, Quality of Life will be measured through the EQ-5D-5L and PROMIS 4 QOL measurement tools, From pre-surgery to the post-discharge period|Changes in PGHD/PROs, Distributions of PGHD/PROs will be generated. Means, standard deviations, and ranges will be calculated for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. All PROs will be scored according to instructions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to study patterns of change over time in PROs administered at multiple time points., Up to 30 days after surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote perioperative monitoring in solid tumor cancer patients scheduled for gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary (GU), gynecological (GYN) cancer surgery.

II. To explore patterns, trajectory, and changes in physiologic health parameter outcomes (weight, temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, daily steps) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (symptoms, quality of life \[QOL\]) from pre-surgery to the post-discharge period.

III. To explore the relationship between changes in physiologic health parameter outcomes/PROs and surgical outcomes (postoperative complications, readmissions).

IV. To explore changes in physiologic health parameters and PROs by open surgery versus minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) surgery.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo remote perioperative telemonitoring with home monitoring devices activity monitor beginning 7 days before surgery and up to 30 days after hospital discharge.

After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 months.
