Hematopoietic Stem Cell Microtransplantation for in AML
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation for in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)patients who can not receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
PROCEDURE: hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation-long-term|PROCEDURE: hematopoietic stem cell microtransplantation-short-term|DRUG: Conditioning for CR group|DRUG: Conditioning for Non-CR group
CR rate, The primary endpoint is CR (complete remission) rate in 2 years after microtransplantation, 2 years|relapse rate, 2 years
Overall Survival, 2 years|Disease-free Survival, 2 years|Incidence of chimerism, Incidence of chimerism will be evaluated in the patients. Both peripheral-blood cells and bone marrow are tested for hematopoietic donor chimerism by a standard cytogenetic analysis and a semiquantitative PCR-based analysis of the short tandem repeats., 2 years
Despite allogeneic HSCT is the only curative therapy for AML, some patients can not receive transplantation due to intolerance of transplant-related toxicity or unwillingness of HSCT. For these patients, microtransplantation seems an optional therapy. However, the efficacy still remain unclear.
