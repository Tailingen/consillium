Clinical Utility of Liquid Biopsy in Brigatinib ALK+ Patients
This is an open-label, non-randomised, phase II, exploratory, multi-country and multi-centre clinical trial. Chemotherapy-naïve patients with EML4-ALK rearrangement and with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients will be selected.

Patients enrolled in the study will receive brigatinib 90mg for the first 7 days (D 1-7 at cycle 1) and then 180mg daily thereafter for QW4 cycles of duration (28 days ±3days).

Brigatinib will be administered until progression disease, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to discontinue or death.

Brigatinib may continue beyond disease progression per RECIST v1.1 until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to discontinue, or death as per SmPC recommendations.

Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 1.5 years excluding a run-in-period of 4-6 months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the study duration to a total of 5 years. Patients will be followed for 1 year after the end of treatment independently of the cause of end of treatment. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.

The trial will end with the preparation of the final report, scheduled for 5.5 years after the inclusion of the first patient approximately.

DRUG: Brigatinib
Overall response rate (ORR), To evaluate the Overall response rate of brigatinib as measured by investigator. It will be assessed per RECIST v1.1 criteria. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy; it does not include stable disease and is a direct measure of drug tumoricidal activity., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Duration of response (DOR), To evaluate the efficacy of brigatinib as measured by investigator. Assessed as duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1, From date of documentation of tumor response until date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months.|Intracranial overall response rate (ORR), To evaluate the intracranial ORR defined as the proportion of patients with reduction in intracranial tumor, From date of documentation of tumor response until date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months.|Progression free survival (PFS) rate, To evaluate PFS rate until first progression documented during the treatment with brigatinib by RECIST v1.1, 1 year and 2 years of treatment with Brigatinib|Overall Survival (OS) rate, To evaluate the OS defined as the lenght of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of the treatment that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., 1 year and 2 years of treatment with Brigatinib|Safety and tolerability: NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria, Occurrence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined by NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria., From the subject's written consent to participate in the study through 30 days after the final administration of the drug.|Time on treatment (TTR), To evaluate the efficacy of brigatinib as measured by investigator according to RECIST v1.1. TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first objective tumour response observed for patients who achieved Complete Response or Partial Response (according RECIST v.1.1), From date of the start of treatment until first objective tumour response observed (partial or complete according RECIST v1.1), assessed up to 60 months.
