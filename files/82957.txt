Compliance With ERAS and Five Year Survival After Colorectal Cancer Treatment
The Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) protocol has transformed perioperative care, representing a significant paradigm shift in managing colorectal cancer patients. While the immediate benefits of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in expediting postoperative recovery are well-documented and widely acknowledged, it is essential to investigate its long-term implications, particularly its influence on survival rates. The aim of this study will be to analyse the impact of compliance with the ERAS protocol on long- term outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal resection.

PROCEDURE: High compliance with ERAS protocol
Post operative 5 year survival rate, 5 years
The aim of this study will be to analyse the impact of compliance with the ERAS protocol on long- term outcomes after laparoscopic colorectal resection.

The study will be designed as a prospective observational study to compare the long-term effects of surgical treatment of colorectal cancer in two groups of patients: those with high compliance with the ERAS protocol (â‰¥80%) and those with low compliance with the ERAS protocol (\&lt;80%).

The primary outcome of the study will be the 5-year survival rate. The inclusion criteria for Group 1 will involve 128 patients with ERAS compliance below 80%. Conversely, Group 2 will consist of 340 patients, all of whom achieved a compliance rate of at least 80%.

The correlation between compliance with the ERAS protocol and 5-year survival will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests. Additionally, survival analysis will be conducted separately for groups with varying cancer stages.
