A Phase 1b Study of Sevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Chinese Patients With Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody (Sevacizumab) Injection in combination with Chemotherapy in Chinese patients with Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer. This study includes two stages. Stage 1 is the dose-escalation stage. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD of Sevacizumab has been established, additional patients will be enrolled in the cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2).
