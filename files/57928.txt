A Study of REGN5093 in Adult Patients With Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition Factor (MET)-Altered Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate REGN5093 for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with MET alteration. The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of REGN5093.

The study has two phases. The main goal of Phase 1 is to determine a safe dose(s) of REGN5093. The main goal of phase 2 of the study is to use the REGN5093 drug dose(s) found in Phase 1 to see how well REGN5093 works to shrink tumors.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* Side effects that may be experienced by people taking REGN5093
* How REGN5093 works in the body
* How much REGN5093 is present in the blood
* To see if REGN5093 works to reduce or delay the progression of cancer
* How long it takes REGN5093 to work in the body
