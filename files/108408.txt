Impact on Quality of Life by Moxibustion in Chemotherapy for Cancer
Most cancer patients experience multiple symptoms related to chemotherapy and use CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Moxibustion is traditional Korean medical therapeutic method and uses the heat generated by burning herbal preparations containing Artemisia vulgaris to stimulated acupoint.

Herein, the investigators propose an open-label pilot study investigating the effectiveness of moxibustion stimulation at abdominal acupoint on quality of life in cancer patients under chemotherapy.
