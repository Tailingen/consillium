MMRC Horizon One Adaptive Platform Trial Evaluating Therapies in RRMM
This trial is an adaptive platform trial. The structure of the protocol allows the trial to evolve over time. Multiple investigational arms will be included within the trial under a Master Protocol (MP). These investigational arms may be added as appendices at different times depending on whether they are trial-ready and whether accrual in the trial will support another arm. Accrual to an arm will terminate in accord with the arm's appendix to the Master Protocol.

The purpose of this proposed structure is to support the recurrent research challenge of efficiently evaluating what is the best therapy for a particular patient.
