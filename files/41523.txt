Clinical Trial of Chemotherapy and Bemcentinib for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of bemcentinib plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine) in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Cancer of Pancreas
DRUG: Bemcentinib|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Determine the clinical activity as defined by overall response rate (ORR) of bemcentinib plus chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine) in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The analyses of ORR was performed on the Response Evaluable Population. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with CR+partial response as their best clinical response., Every 4 months from time of first dose of study drug until completion of treatment for approximately 42 months.
Complete Response Rate (CR), Determine clinical activity of bemcentinib plus chemotherapy as defined by complete response rate (CRR), partial response, stable disease, duration of response - overall response/stable disease, median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rate., Every 4 months from time of first dose of study drug until completion of treatment for approximately 42 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate, Determine clinical benefit rate as defined by complete response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) response rates. Clinical benefit response - percent of CR, PR, and SD., Every 4 months from time of first dose of study drug until completion of treatment for approximately 42 months.|Number of Participants With an Adverse Event of Grade 3 or Higher, Assess safety and tolerability of bemcentinib plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5, Every 4 months from time of first dose of study drug until completion of treatment for approximately 42 months.
Bemcentinib inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine through inhibition of the Axl pathway. The combination of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine has encouraging signs of clinical activity in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer38. We would like to build on this combination in a biomarker driven phase 1b/2 clinical trial of bemcentinib in nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
