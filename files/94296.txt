Survey Based Discrete Choice Experiment Study in Prostate Cancer (DECIDER) Study
The purpose of this study is to quantify and publish participants' relative preferences for outcomes of chemotherapy and novel oral hormonal agents when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for participants with locally-advanced and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). This study will also quantify the importance of administration factors related to convenience relative to treatment outcomes.

Log-odds (preference weights) by participant cancer type and country, Log-odds indicate participants' relative preferences for treatments with each attribute level in the study, all else equal., 1 day (once through survey)
Relative importance weights by participant type and country, These weights indicate the overall influence of each study attribute on choice., 1 day (once through survey)
The study will develop and administer a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify tradeoff preferences of participants with mHSPC and locally-advanced prostate cancer in various countries. Data/surveys are being collected in: United States, Canada, UK, France, Spain, Japan, China and South Korea.
