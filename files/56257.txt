Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Epcoritamab in Japanese Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (R/R B-NHL)
The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety and preliminary efficacy trial of epcoritamab (EPKINLYâ„¢) in Japanese participants with relapsed, progressive or refractory B-cell lymphomas and Japanese participants with B-cell lymphomas that have achieved partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) following prior standard of care (SOC). The trial consists of two parts: Part 1, dose escalation (phase 1), and Part 2, expansion (phase 2).

The purpose of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase-2 dose (RP2D), as well as to establish the safety profile of epcoritamab in Japanese participants with relapsed, progressive or refractory B-cell lymphoma and Japanese participants with B-cell lymphomas that have achieved PR or CR.

In the expansion part, additional participants will be treated with epcoritamab, at the RP2D and the purpose is to further explore and determine the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab.

Part 2 of the trial will be initiated once the RP2D has been determined in Part 1. In Part 2, epcoritamab is investigated as a monotherapy and in combination with other SOC agents.

All participants in the trial will receive epcoritamab, as monotherapy or in combination with SOC. The following regimens will be investigated in Part 2:

Arm 1: epcoritamab monotherapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL)

Arm 2: epcoritamab + rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in participants with R/R FL

Arm 3: epcoritamab + rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in participants with previously untreated DLBCL with high risk features

Arm 4: epcoritamab + gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx) in participants with R/R DLBCL who either failed prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), or are ineligible for autologous HSCT.

Arm 5: epcoritamab maintenance in participants with FL who achieve a CR or a PR following first line (1L)/second line (2L) SOC treatment
