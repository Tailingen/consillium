The Efficacy and Safety of Nab-paclitaxel in Pretreated Patients With Extensive Disease of Small Cell Lung Cancer
Patients with extensive disease(ED) small cell lung cancer is still have a dismal prognosis, even though the first line chemotherapy showing about 70% response rate. Most of the patients will relapse with in 6 months after the chemotherapy and the following therapy such as second line chemotherapy have a very limited efficacy to these patients. Currently, there is no standard 3rd line therapy for the patients with ED small cell lung cancer(SCLC).

As the investigators know, Nab-paclitaxel had showing promising efficacy in several cases report in the patients with SCLC, the aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel as a single agent in the SCLC patients with extensive disease and failed to first line/ second line chemotherapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate Objective response rate every 6-8 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy and before the completion of chemotherapy, tumor assessment every 6-8 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy, up to 24 months
Progression free survival, PFS is evaluated in the 24 months since the treatment began, 24 months|overall survival, evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began, 24 months|Side effects, evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, 24 months|Quality Of Life, evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began, 24 months
Primary end point: Objective Response Rate(ORR)

Secondary end point:

Progression Free Survival(PFS), Overall Survival(OS), Side effects according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) version 4.0 Quality Of Life(QOL) etc.
