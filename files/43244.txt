A Study of Cemiplimab With Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in People With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining the standard chemotherapy for head and neck cancer with the immunotherapy drugs cetuximab and cemiplimab (the study drug) is a safe treatment for head and neck cancer, and whether receiving this combination treatment before surgery may allow participants to forgo the standard radiation treatment after surgery.

Incidence of toxicities graded according to NCI CTCAE, The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, which will be evaluated by a description of observed adverse events by grades. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version5.0. The regimen will be deemed safe and well tolerated if there are 2 or fewer DLTs out of 10 patients enrolled. A DLT is defined as any non-hematologic grade 3 or greater adverse event as defined by CTCAE v5.0 that is thought to be related to the addition of Cemiplimab to the combination of a platinum-doublet with cetuximab., 1 year
