A Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Stage IIIc and Stage IV Malignant Melanoma
The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in terms of tumor response rates.
Melanoma
DRUG: Talimogene Laherparepvec
Objective Tumor Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with an overall best response of complete response or partial response. The objective response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or other clinical measurement using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Responses must have been confirmed on two visits not less than 4 weeks apart.

Tumor burden for a visit was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters of all tumors identified and measured up to that visit. Tumor response at each visit was derived from tumor burden, as follows:

* Complete response (CR): zero tumor burden
* Partial response (PR): a 30% or greater decrease in tumor burden
* Progressive disease (PD): a 20% or greater increase in tumor burden
* Stable disease (SD): none of the above (a \< 30% decrease and \< 20% increase in tumor burden), From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the date of death. Median OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days|Time to Progression, Time to progression was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the first date of documented progressive disease (via clinical symptom or tumor burden assessment) that was not followed by a later response of CR, PR, or stable disease.

Median time to progression was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.|Time to Longest Continuous Response, Time to response was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the initial date of the participant's last response interval., From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.|Duration of Response, Duration of response was calculated from the initial date of response (CR or PR) until the date of progressive disease (or until last follow up that was CR or PR). Participants could have multiple response periods; in this situation, the last response interval was used for the calculation of duration of response., From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The severity of an adverse event (AE) was graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3 (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = death).

Serious adverse events include death, life-threatening events, events requiring or prolonging hospitalization, result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or otherwise important medical events that may jeopardise the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes., From first dose of talimogene laherparepvec until 30 days after the last dose; the median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 82 (1, 346) days.
The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in terms of tumor response rates.
