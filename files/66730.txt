A Feasibility Trial of Nivolumab With Neoadjuvant CF or DCF Therapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the neoadjuvant therapy, nivolumab with CF (5-FU, CDDP) or nivolumab with DCF (5-FU, CDDP, DTX), for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma.
Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: CDDP|DRUG: DTX
Rate of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), To evaluate the safety of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from initial dose to 30 post-operative days
Response rate (RR): percentage of participants with with a best response of CR or PR, To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from baseline to date of disease progression, approximately 24 months|Pathological complete response rate, To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from baseline to operation, average of 10 weeks after initial dose|Radical resection rate, To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, at operation, average of 10 weeks after initial dose|Treatment completion rate, To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from baseline to operation, average of 10 weeks after initial dose|Adverse event (AE) expression rate, To evaluate the safety of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, up to 30 postoperative days|Progression-free survival (PFS), To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from baseline to date of disease progression or death, approximately 24 month|Overall survival (OS), To evaluate the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with nivolumab as neoadjuvant Tx, from baseline to date of death, approximately 24 month
