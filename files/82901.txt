Phase II GM-CSF Plus Mitoxantrone in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of mitoxantrone and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: GM-CSF
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Assessed as the time from the 1st dose of study drug to death or disease progression (increase \>25% over baseline PSA on 2 consecutive measurements 2 weeks apart, need for palliative therapy, formation/progression of new bone lesions, or decline of \>20% KPS), 18 months
Number of Participants With > 50% Decrease in Prostate-specific Antigen Levels (PSA Response), Defined as the first evidence of a total serum PSA decline of \> 50% from baseline, maintained for at least 28 days, and confirmed with 2 consecutive measurements taken 2 weeks apart., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Assessed as the time from the 1st dose of study drug to death., 18 months
This trial evaluates if the addition of GM-CSF to standard-of-care therapy after 1st-line docetaxel improves tumor control and survival. Because the 2 drugs have completely different mechanisms of action as well as non-overlapping metabolism, clinically significant drug-drug interactions are not anticipated, and therefore both drugs will be given at standard (approved) doses.
