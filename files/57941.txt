A Randomized, Phase 2/3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of RP2 in Combination With Nivolumab in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Na√Øve Adult Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to measure the clinical benefits of the combination of RP2 and nivolumab as compared with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma who have not been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: RP2|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of randomization to death from any cause., From Day 1 up to 3 years after last dose.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from randomization to first evidence of confirmed disease progression as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., From Day 1 up to 3 years after last dose.
Number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), The incidence of all TEAEs., From first dose up to 100 days after last dose.|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with a confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1., Every 12 weeks from Day 1 up to 3 years after last dose.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of patients with a confirmed best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD), as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1., Every 12 weeks from Day 1 up to 3 years after last dose.
