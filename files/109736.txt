Ultrasound-guided Thermal Ablation for Bethesda III/IV Thyroid Nodules
To evaluate the long-term outcomes of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation for Bethesda III/IV thyroid nodules
Thyroid Nodule
PROCEDURE: ultrasound-guided thermal ablation
volume reduction rate, The volume reduction rate (VRR)was calculated by the equations: VRR=(\[initial volume-final volume\] × 100)/initial volume, through study completion, an average of 6 months
rate of complications, complications of ablation, 1 week|rate of nodule regrowth, Regrowth was defined as ≥50% volume increase compared to the previously recorded smallest volume during the follow-up, through study completion, an average of 6 months|rate of change of thyroid function, thyroid function test, including free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid peroxidase antibody and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, through study completion, an average of 6 months|rate of delayed surgery, patients underwent surgery after ablation because of anxiety or unsatisfactory about the volume reduction, through study completion, an average of 1 year|cosmetic score, The cosmetic score was assessed by a physician (1, no palpable mass; 2, no cosmetic problem but palpable mass; 3, a cosmetic problem on swallowing only; and 4, a readily detected cosmetic problem), through study completion, an average of 6 months|symptom score, The symptom score was self-measured by patients using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (grade 0-10), through study completion, an average of 6 months|rate of disappearance, complete disappearance of ablated nodule on ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, through study completion, an average of 6 months
