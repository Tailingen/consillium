Anemia in LR-MDS patients
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Anemia
DRUG: CA-4948
Erythroid response (HI-E), To evaluate the proportion of patients who have an erythroid response (HI-E) according to the modified IWG 2018 criteria separately for both independent substudies., At the end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days).
HI-E response (erythroid response) duration, To evaluate HI-E response from the first day of response until loss of response., From the date of treatment start until date of documented loss of response, assessed up to 30 months.|Time to HI-E (erythroid response), To evaluate the time between start of treatment and first day of response., From the date of treatment start until first day of response, assessed up to end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days).|Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, To evaluate frequency of red blood cell transfusions in transfusion dependent patients, From the date of treatment start until the date of end of treatment, assessed up to 30 months.|Neutrophil (HI-N) responses, Neutrophil (HI-N) responses according to IWG 2018 criteria, At the end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days).|Platelet (HI-P) responses, Platelet (HI-P) responses according to IWG 2018 criteria, At the end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days).|Safety of CA-4948 (toxicities and adverse events), Assessments will include characterization of toxicities; characterization of AEs including type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and relationship to treatment, From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 30 months.|Number of participants with clinically significant changes of selected laborotory parameters (parameters listed in detailed description), To ensure patient safety, close monitoring is carried and includes the analysis of: transaminases, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, uric acid, TSH, FT4, urine analysis., From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 30 months.|Impact of treatment assessed by using the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), To assess patient-reported quality of life during CA-4948 treatment: 30 questions assessing the quality of life of oncology patients across 10 subscales will be analyzed. All subscales have a score range from 0 to 100 points.

Function subscales: a higher score represents a higher quality of life. Symptoms subscales: higher score represents higher level of symptoms/problems, i.e., represents lower quality of life., From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 30 months.|Impact of treatment assessed by using the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer cancer related fatigue questionnaire (EORTC QLQ- FA12), To assess patient-reported quality of life during CA-4948 treatment: 12 items, with four response categories for each item (coded with values from 1 to 4) will be analyzed. FA12 scores are transformed to the range 0-100: Higher levels indicate greater degrees of fatigue., From the date of treatment start until the end of study, assessed up to 30 months.
