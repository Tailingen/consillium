Neurofibromatosis (NFs) are rare genetic conditions with cure. Adolescents with NF experience more symptoms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of stress associated with coping with NF symptoms, lower levels of self esteem, difficulties with social skills and social support, high rates of learning disabilities, and more pain as compared with the general population norms.

The aims of this study are to compare the effect of two stress and symptom management programs tailored for adolescents with neurofibromatosis on quality of life and psychosocial functioning. We will also examine the degree to which treatment-dependent improvements in quality of life are mediated by improvements in depression, pain intensity and pain interference.
