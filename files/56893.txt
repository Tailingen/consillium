1st or 2nd Line MBC (Metastatic Breast Cancer) With Previous Avastin (Bevacizumab) Therapy
The study is being conducted to compare progression-free survival in patients treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine/capecitabine versus patients treated with placebo and gemcitabine/capecitabine for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed during or following treatment with a bevacizumab-containing regimen.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival, From the date of randomization to date of first documented disease progression (i.e., the date on which a radiologic procedure or clinical evaluation was performed) or the date of death due to any cause, if before progression, assessed up to 39 months.
Overall Survival, From the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 56 months.|Time to Progression, Calculated as the time (days) from date of randomization to date of first observed disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier), assessed up to 39 months.|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the proportion of participants experiencing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as best overall response. Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions., The overall tumor burden at baseline will be compared with subsequent measurements up to the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, if before progression, assessed up to 39 months.|Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response was calculated as the time (days) from first documentation of CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease (PD) or death is objectively documented. Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions., Period measured from the first documentation of complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is objectively documented.
