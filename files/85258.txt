Phase 3 Study of Zevalin Following R-CVP in Previously Untreated Patients With Follicular Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
This study will treat follicular lymphoma patients who have not received previous treatment with R-CVP. Half of the patients will receive Zevalin after R-CVP and the other half will receive only R-CVP. The two patient groups will be compared to determine if Zevalin given after R-CVP therapy provides greater benefits than receiving no additional anti-cancer therapy after R-CVP.
