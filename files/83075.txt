MRI Compared to PET/CT for Staging and Treatment Response in Lymphoma
The lymph nodes or masses,positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) standardized uptake values(SUV) results, whole body magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) intravoxel incoherent motion(IVIM) sequence D, D\*, f values and MRI volumes of lymphoma patients were compared before and after the chemotherapy in this project prospectively to provide data for evaluating the dependency and differences of PET/CT and whole body MRI in lymphoma staging and therapeutic evaluation. Long-term therapeutic effect indexes obtained in follow-up visits of patients such as Overall Survival(OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) etc. were used to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and differences of MRI and PET/CT. The research could provide a new method of nonionizing radiation iconography for physicians to give appropriate treatments and predict prognosis.
Lymphoma
DEVICE: magnetic resonance imaging|DEVICE: positron emission tomography/computed tomography|RADIATION: fludeoxyglucose F 18
18F-FDG uptake in lymphomas with PET/CT, Different 18F-FDG uptake values in lymphoma tissue (e.g. SUVmax, SUVmean, binding potential) will be measured and correlated with immunohistochemically determined somatostatin receptor status, lymphoma aggressiveness and tissue biomarkers, Within 30 days prior to start of chemotherapy|Agreement between DWI-MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT at diagnosis, Region based agreement (%; kappa value) of DWI-MRI with 18F-FDG PET/CT at diagnosis., Within 30 days prior to start of chemotherapy|Agreement between DWI-MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT in follow-up examinations, Region based agreement (%; kappa value) of DWI-MRI with 18F-FDG PET/CT after completion of chemotherapy for treatment response assessment, 2 weeks after the 4th cycle of chemotherapy
Overall Survival, 12 months|Progression Free Survival, 6 months
