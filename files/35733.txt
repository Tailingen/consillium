Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Arising in Non-cirrhotic Liver: a Propensity Score-matched Retrospective Cohort Study of Two National Databases
Background: Majority of liver transplantation (LT) recipients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were concomitant with liver cirrhosis, while few researches focusing on recipients without cirrhosis. Here we aim to investigate the prognosis of non-cirrhosis HCC recipients, expecting to provide theoretical basis for further improvement of these patients.

Methods: This retrospective study analyze outcomes between adult HCC recipients arising in non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic liver from two national databases (CLTR and UNOS, January 2015 to December 2020). Based on important variables, 1:2 and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) were performed respectively.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Non-cirrhotic Liver

Postoperative complications were evaluated by postoperative imaging and serological examination, Including rejection after liver transplantation, vascular complications, new metabolic diseases and so on, 3 months|The overall survival rate was evaluated by follow-up investigation and outpatient review, 1-3 years|The tumor-free survival rate was evaluated by follow-up investigation and outpatient review, 1-3 years
