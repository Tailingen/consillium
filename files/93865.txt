Recovery and Analgesia After Surgery for Gynecological Cancer
The purpose of the study is to compare epidural analgesia and intrathecal analgesia for explorative laparotomy through a middle-line incision for gynecological cancer in a fast track program to se if there is any difference in recovery. Length of stay is analyzed together with self-rate quality of life.
Gynecological Cancer
DRUG: Epidural|DRUG: Intrathecal
Length of Stay, From day of surgery (Day 0) until discharge after surgery, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days
Change in Quality of Life, The questionnaire Short Form with 36 questions "SF-36" will be used preoperatively and at 6 weeks after surgery. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled subscores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental Health) and two Component summary scores (physical Component summary scoer, mental component summary score). A score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., Preoperatively and until 6 weeks after surgery
Change in Pain, Pain at rest will be assessed using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Pain is documented on the day of surgery (day 0), 3 times daily postoperative day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42.

Scale: NRS Minimum value:0 Maximum value: 10. Higher scores indicate worse outcome., Day of surgery (day 0) until 6 weeks after surgery
