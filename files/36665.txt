ASL in Brain Metastasis MRI Following Gamma Knife Treatment
Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive MRI technique that could help the radiologists to distinguish brain metastasis progression versus radionecrosis following gamma-knife treatment.

The primary target of the study is to establish the diagnostic performances (specificity, sensitivity) of quantitative measures of ASL in brain metastases suspected of progression/radionecrosis after GK treatment
Brain Metastases
OTHER: MRI perfusion sequence
Diagnostic performance of ASL quantitative analysis in brain metastasis following GK treatment : tumor perfusion with quantitative measurement (one value) of RCBF (relative cerebral blood flow) on the ASL sequence, Quantitative analysis (rCBF) of the evolution of brain metastasis between the initiation of treatment and 6 months after., Evolution between Baseline MRI, 1 and 6 month follow up MRI
ASL Perfusion: Cerebral blood flow measurements, Baseline MRI, 1 and 6 month follow up MRI|Interreader correlation, Two neuroradiologists, Baseline MRI, 1 and 6 month follow-up MRI|Morphological analysis of the lesions, Lesion size, oedema, Baseline MRI, 1 and 6 month follow-up MRI
The metastasis progression versus radionecrosis following GK treatment can sometimes be difficult to distinguish. 60 patients will be included in this prospective, monocentric study. 3 MRI (baseline, 1month and 6 month follow-ups) will be performed. Two neuroradiologists will blindly analyse the MRIs comparing ASL sensibility and specificity to the standard morphological evaluation and T2 perfusion.
