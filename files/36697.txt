Effect of Oncothermia on Improvement of Quality of Life in Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from pain. Because of such a pain, their quality of life have seriously deteriorated. There have been a few studies that showed an effect for pain control by hyperthermia (heating the patient's body). However, there are several limitations in conventional hyperthermia. In this study, the investigators tried to show the effect of "Oncothermia" which is more selective to malignant tissue than conventional hyperthermia for pain control, increasing quality of life, and anti-tumor treatment.
