A Study to Evaluate Sildenafil for the Treatment of Lymphatic Malformations
There is an unsatisfied medical need for a first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations with a good benefit/risk profile. Based on a patient experience in the institution, the investigators plan to verify whether or not the medication sildenafil has a beneficial effect on lymphatic malformations. The investigators plan to do this by treating patients with lymphatic malformations with the medication sildenafil for a 20 week period. This is an investigator initiated study funded by an Innovations in Patient Care grant and a SPARK grant.
Lymphangioma
DRUG: Sildenafil
Change in Volume of Lymphatic Malformation, Participants were given sildenafil for 20 weeks. Participants weighing more than 20 kg were given 20 mg 3 times daily (60 mg/day). Participants weighing between 8 kg and 20 kg were given 10 mg 3 times daily (30 mg/day)., Baseline, 20 weeks
Lymphatic malformations can be challenging to treat. Mainstay interventions including surgery and sclerotherapy are invasive and can result in local recurrence and complications. We sought to assess the effect of 20 weeks of oral sildenafil on reducing lymphatic malformation volume and symptoms in children. Seven children (4 boys, 3 girls; ages 13-85 months) with lymphatic malformations were given oral sildenafil for 20 weeks in this open-label study. The volume of the lymphatic malformation was calculated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging performed before and after 20 weeks of sildenafil. Lymphatic malformations were assessed clinically on weeks 4, 12, 20, and 32. Both the physician and parents evaluated the lymphatic malformation in comparison with baseline. Sildenafil can reduce lymphatic malformation volume and symptoms in some children. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2014;70:1050-7.)
