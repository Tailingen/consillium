Evaluation of Diffusion Weighted Imaging -MRI in Patients With Resectable Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to correlate the percentage change in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between baseline and early therapy (at day 14) with tumor regression grade (TRG) measured in the surgical resection specimen.

This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm imaging trial. Patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) will undergo Diffusion Weighted Imaging- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) scans at least at three separate occasions: at baseline, at 14 days (maximum +/- 1 days deviation is acceptable) after first administration of chemotherapy and finally after up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (one week prior to surgery).

All patients registered in the study may participate to the test-retest analysis. This analysis required a double baseline scans (called test-retest) to be done on two separate occasions, separated from each other by from one hour to one week but both before start of therapy. The repeated scan at baseline (retest) is optional as it will be used only for the test-retest repeatability analysis.

Dedicated in-house developed software will be used to quantify ADC to assess tumor characteristics and response to therapy.
