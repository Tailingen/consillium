Effect of Different Colistin Doses on Clinical Outcome of Pediatric Cancer Patients With Gram Negative Infections
Prospective randomized study comparing different colistin dosing regimens in paediatric cancer patient with MDR gram-negative infection or sepsis
Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections|Pediatric Cancer|Colistin|Colistin Adverse Reaction|MIC
DRUG: Colistimethate Sodium
clinical improvement,, time to defervescence, 7- 14 days
adverse events, incidence of colistin related nephropathy, 14 days|microbiological clearance, time to clearance of cultures, 7-14 days
The aim of this study is to:

1. Evaluate the clinical outcome of two different dosing regimen of IV colistin in the treatment of children with multidrug resistant gram-negative infections or sepsis.
2. To estimate the frequency of colistin associated adverse effects.
3. To correlate the serum colistin concentration and MIC to microbiological clearance and clinical outcome
