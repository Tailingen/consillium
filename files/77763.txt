Role of Huachansu in Treating Hepatocellular Carcinoma and the Correlation With Na+/K+-ATPase
Primary Outcome Measures:

- To compare the progression free survival(PFS) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) with or without Huachansu, and the correlation between PFS and expression of peripheral Na+/K+-ATPase α3 family.

Secondary Outcome Measures:

- To compare the overall survival(OS), objective response rate(ORR), and side effects of treating HCC with TACE plus Huachansu or TACE alone.

Exploratory Outcome Measures:

- To evaluate the correlation between prognosis and expression of peripheral Na+/K+-ATPase α3 family.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Huachansu|OTHER: TACE
Progression free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months.
Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 100 months.
