Open-label Study of the Safety and Activity of Oprozomib in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), activity, and safety of oprozomib in patients with hematologic malignancies.
Multiple Myeloma|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: oprozomib
Determine the MTD (Phase 1) and ORR (Phase 2)., Phase 1- Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) with 3 + 3 Dose Escalation Cohorts in patients hematologic malignancies.

Phase 2- The Phase 2 portion of this trial will enroll patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM) into separate arms to assess activity of oprozomib in these patient groups. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to estimate the best ORR (for each group separately)., 6 weeks to 18 months
Evaluate the duration of response (DOR), Duration of Response is defined as the time from first evidence of partial response (PR) or better to confirmation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 64 months|Estimate the clinical benefit response (CBR), CBR is defined as Overall Response Rate (ORR) plus Minimal Response (MR) of oprozomib in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), 64 months|Estimate the major response for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), Major response for WM subjects is defined as Complete Response (CR) plus Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) plus Partial Response (PR). Major response to be equal or greater than (PR), 64 months|Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) for multiple myeloma (MM) subjects, Progression-Free Survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever comes first, 64 months|Evaluate the PFS for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) subjects, Progression-Free Survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever comes first, 64 months|PK parameters - maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), PK analyses to be performed on oprozomib and its metabolite(s) concentrations in order to estimate the maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax) value after oral administration, 55 months|PK parameters - time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax), PK analyses to be performed on oprozomib and its metabolite(s) concentrations in order to estimate the time to reach Cmax (tmax), 55 months|PK parameters - plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), PK analyses to be performed on oprozomib and its metabolite(s) concentrations in order to estimate the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, 55 months|Assess renal elimination of oprozomib and its metabolites (Phase 1b only), Urine will be collected over 24 hours to assess renal elimination of oprozomib and its metabolites following dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 1 for all patients., 55 months|Change from Baseline in hematology laboratory results, Assess the change from baseline in hematology panel, 64 months|Change from Baseline in serum chemistry results, Assess the change from baseline in serum chemistry panel, 64 months|Change from Baseline in vital signs, Assess the change from baseline in vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, 64 months|Change from Baseline in weight, Assess the change from baseline in weight, 64 months|Evaluate safety of oprozomib in Phase 2, Safety to be defined by incidence, nature, severity, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs), including all serious adverse events (SAEs), Until 30 days after the end of study (64 months)|Assess the effect on transfusion/ red blood cell (RBC) growth factor requirements (Phase 2 only) for WM only, Change from Baseline (prior 1 month) transfusion/RBC growth factor requirement in frequency and volume in WM (Phase 2 only), 64 months|Assess the effect on plasmapheresis requirements (Phase 2 only) for WM only, Change from Baseline (prior 1 month) plasmapheresis requirement in frequency and volume in WM (Phase 2 only), 64 months|Assess the effect on lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow (Phase 2 only) for WM only, Change from Baseline in percent of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow in WM (Phase 2 only), 64 months
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), activity, and safety of oprozomib in patients with hematologic malignancies.
