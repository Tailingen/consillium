PAVES: Pegfilgrastim Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Evaluation Study
This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study evaluating the efficacy of pegfilgrastim to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with newly diagnosed, locally-advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line treatment with bevacizumab and either 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin (FOLFOX) or 5-fluorouracil, Irinotecan, Leucovorin (FOLFIRI).

This study will also investigate the effect of adding pegfilgrastim to bevacizumab and either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI by evaluating overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate in each arm at regular intervals over a maximum of 60 months follow-up.

Percentage of Participants With Grade 3/4 Febrile Neutropenia Across the First 4 Cycles of Chemotherapy, Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia (FN) is defined as: • A temperature ≥ 38.0°C (≥ 100.4°F) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1.0 × 10\^9/L, where ANC was measured the same day or within ± 1 calendar day of a temperature ≥ 38.0°C (≥ 100.4°F), or • An ANC \< 1.0 × 10\^9/L in combination with: - documented sepsis or infection, OR - neutropenia-related hospitalization where ANC was measured the same day or within ± 1 calendar day. Participants monitored their oral temperatures and maintained diaries to record their temperature twice per day: once in the morning and once in the evening, as well as whenever they suspect they had fever throughout the first 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment., Approximately 2 months duration (Daily for 4 cycles of treatment; 2 weeks per cycle)
Overall Survival, Median time from randomization to date of death caclulated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants were censored on the date of last contact (i.e., the date the participant was last known to be alive) if they were not known to have died., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 8 June 2012. Median time on study was 11.6 months and the maximum was 27.6 months.|Progression Free Survival, Time from randomization to date of radiological disease progression or death from any cause, whichever event occurs first, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants without either event by the analysis data cutoff date were censored on the date of their last evaluable disease assessment. Disease progression based on the investigator's assessment of radiographic scans using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Clinical progression without radiological assessment was not be considered a disease progression in this analysis. Progression defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 8 June 2012. Median time on study was 11.6 months and the maximum was 27.6 months.|Time to Progression, Time from randomization to date of radiological disease progression calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants without progression were censored on the date of their last radiographic tumor assessment. Disease progression based on the investigator's assessment of scans using the RECIST v1.1. Clinical progression without radiological assessment was not considered a disease progression. Progression defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 8 June 2012. Median time on study was 11.6 months and the maximum was 27.6 months.|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response, The percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) defined by the RECIST v1.1 criteria at any time during the study. Response was be determined by the investigator's assessment of radiographic scans. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions and the disappearance of all non-nodal non-target lesions, and no new lesions. All nodal lesions must have reduction of short axis to \< 10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters and no new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or, the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)., From randomization to the data cut-off date of 8 June 2012. Median time on study was 11.6 months and the maximum was 27.6 months.|Percentage of Participants With Grade 4 Febrile Neutropenia Across the First 4 Cycles of Chemotherapy, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia (FN) is defined as:

* A temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥ 100.4ºF) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 0.5 × 10\^9/L, where ANC is measured the same day or within +/- 1 calendar day of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥ 100.4ºF), or
* An ANC \<0.5 × 10\^9/L in combination with:

  * Documented sepsis or infection, OR
  * Neutropenia-related hospitalization where ANC is measured the same day or within +/- 1 calendar day., Approximately 2 months duration (Daily for 4 cycles of treatment; 2 weeks per cycle)|Percentage of Participants With Grade 3/4 Neutropenia Across the First 4 Cycles of Chemotherapy, Grade 3/4 severe neutropenia is defined as neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<1.0 x 10\^9/L., Approximately 2 months duration (Daily for 4 cycles of treatment; 2 weeks per cycle)|Percentage of Participants With Grade 4 Neutropenia Across the First 4 Cycles of Chemotherapy, Grade 4 severe neutropenia is defined as neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<0.5 x 10\^9/L., Approximately 2 months duration (Daily for 4 cycles of treatment; 2 weeks per cycle)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that - is fatal; - is life threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death); - requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; - results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; - is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; - other significant medical hazard. AEs were assessed for severity according to National Cancer Institute, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0, based on this general guideline: Grade 1 = Mild AE; Grade 2 = Moderate AE; Grade 3 = Severe AE; Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 = Death related to AE., Approximately 8 weeks (4 treatment cycles)
