Diagnosis of Hemangiomas and Vascular Malformations
To develop a non-invasive, simple and affordable, measurement technique to differentiate hemangiomas from subtypes of VMS. The purpose of this study is to determine the best office based diagnositc instrument for differentiating the subtype of vascular lesions. The instrument must be simple and affordable so it can be used by primary car physicians in the doctor office. The procedure will be based on non-invasive and unharmful measurements that will be compared to the diagnosis from specialized physicians in this field and the final pathology.
