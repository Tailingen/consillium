Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Metastatic, Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Containing Inactivated Genes in the BRCA 1/2 Pathway
This pilot clinical trial studies docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic) and contains inactivated genes in the BRCA 1/2 pathway. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
