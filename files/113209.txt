A Tissue Collection Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects With Resectable Advanced Melanoma
The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and adverse event profile of pembrolizumab in subjects who have high risk melanoma before and after their standard of care surgical resection, and to collect tumor tissue from subjects before and after receipt of pembrolizumab to look at how the experimental drug interacts with tumor tissue. Subjects will receive 1 dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, followed by complete resection and then a year of adjuvant pembrolizumab
