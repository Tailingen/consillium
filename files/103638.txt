Combined Digital X-ray and Ultrasound Technique for Improved Detection and Characterization of Breast Lesions
The study will evaluate and refine a breast screening and diagnosis device.
Breast Cancer|Mass Cystic|Benign Mass
PROCEDURE: 3D Tomosynthesis and ultrasound imaging
To have a device that produces 3D/ultrasound imaging of the breast at the same time and in the same position., To be determined later.
The device produces 3-D mammograms and ultrasound pictures of the breast at the same time and in the same position. This should help make sure that any area on a mammogram can be easily found in the ultrasound when using the new device. The 3-D mammograms should provide better visualization of the suspected lesion and improve diagnostic accuracy.
