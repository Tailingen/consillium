A Phase I Clinical Trial of Bevacizumab Injection
Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody injection against human vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) is Avastin produced by Zhengda Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd Biological similar drugs. Its mechanism is to prevent VEGF from binding to its natural receptor VEGFR, inhibit the proliferation and activation of vascular endothelial cells, and play an anti angiogenesis and anti-tumor role by binding with VEGF. A randomized, double-blind, single dose, parallel comparison of bevacizumab injection and Avastin is planned The phase I clinical study on the similarity of pharmacokinetics and safety of traditional Chinese medicine in healthy male volunteers aims to compare bevacizumab injection with Avastin The similarity of pharmacokinetics, tolerance, safety and immunogenicity.
