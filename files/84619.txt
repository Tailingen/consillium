Stapler Reinforcement Patches Compared to Standard Staplers in Gastrojejunostomy
This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled study aimed at compareing the impact of stapler reinforcement patches versus standard staplers on postoperative complications in gastrojejunostomy.
Gastric Cancer|Gastrostomy|Anastomotic Leakage|Postoperative Complications
DEVICE: Stapler Reinforcement Patch|DEVICE: Standard Stapler
Rate of Anastomotic Leakage, The incidence of anastomotic leakage within 30 days post-surgery. Anastomotic leakage is defined as the presence of fluid containing enteric content in the abdominal cavity or the appearance of leakage confirmed by imaging or endoscopy., 30 days post-surgery
Rate of Anastomotic Stricture, The incidence of anastomotic stricture within 3 months post-surgery. Anastomotic stricture is defined as difficulty in food passage or narrowing confirmed by imaging or endoscopy., 3 months post-surgery|Postoperative Bleeding Rate, The incidence of postoperative bleeding within 30 days post-surgery. Postoperative bleeding is defined as the occurrence of bleeding requiring intervention or causing significant hemoglobin drop., 30 days post-surgery|Mortality Rate, The rate of mortality within 30 days post-surgery., 30 days post-surgery|Readmission Rate, Readmission Rate, 3 months post-surgery
This study compares stapler reinforcement patches with standard staplers in gastrojejunostomy to reduce postoperative complications. It aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of these patches in preventing anastomotic leakage and other related complications.
