Does Intensive Acid Suppression Reduce Esophageal Inflammation and Recurrent Barrett's Esophagus Following Ablation?
The investigators hypothesize that intensive acid suppression with a long acting high potency proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drug dexlansoprazole will lead to a greater decrease in levels of inflammatory mediators (compared to conventional PPIs) in the esophagus, which could potentially lead to decreased recurrence of intestinal metaplasia following endoscopic ablation.

Patients who achieve complete remission of intestinal metaplasia following ablation will be randomized (using concealed allocation, like the flip of a coin) to either intensive acid suppression with dexlansoprazole 60-90 mg/day or to symptom guided acid suppression with escalating doses of omeprazole (20-60 mg/day) for 6 months. Control of reflux will be assessed using 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring. The need to escalate drug dosage at the 3 month visit will be determined by presence of excessive acid exposure on ambulatory pH monitoring. Biopsies of esophageal tissue will be obtained at baseline, then at 3 months and 6 months following randomization to measure changes in inflammatory biomarkers.
