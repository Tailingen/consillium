Parathyroid Cancer Versus Atypical Parathyroid Neoplasm; Investigating Their Clinical Characteristics and Biological Behavior
Objectives:

1. Identify the clinical characteristics of parathyroid (PTH) cancer and PTH atypical neoplasms
2. Investigate if PTH carcinoma and atypical neoplasm present a biological behaviour and have a different impact on the health of the patients

Information Collected on Clinical Characteristics of Parathyroid (PTH) Cancer and PTH Atypical Neoplasms by Conducting a Retrospective Chart Review, 5 years|Information Collected on PTH Carcinoma's Biological Behaviour and Impact on the Health of the Patients by Conducting a Retrospective Chart Review, 5 years|Information Collected on Atypical Neoplasm's Biological Behaviour and Impact on the Health of the Patients \by Conducting a Retrospective Chart Review, 5 years
Data between the years of 1/1/2002 and 12/31/2013 will be analyzed. The medical records of all adult patients that had a parathyroidectomy for primary PHPT in MD Anderson Cancer Center will be screened in order to identify patients that had a histopathological diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma or atypical parathyroid neoplasm.
