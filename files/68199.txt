Prognostic Potential of Olfactory Function in Glioblastoma: a Prospective Observational Study
The study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of olfactory function in patients with glioblastoma. We are examining olfactory function at various points during therapy and correlating the results with survival data. In addition, neurocognitive tests will be carried out to correlate the results of olfactory function with the patient's cognitive abilities. Investigations into the quality of life and psychological condition of the patients are also performed. In addition to the cohort of glioblastoma patients, there is a control cohort without tumor disease in which the olfactory testing is also carried out in order to have a comparison.
Glioblastoma Multiforme, Adult|Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma|Glioblastoma, Adult
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: olfactory testing (threshold and identification test)
Overall survival, Overall survival in relation to olfactory function, From enrollment to 2 years after the end of radiotherapy
Progression free survival, Progression free survival in relation to olfactory function, From enrollment to 2 years after the end of radiotherapy|Neurocognition, Neurocognition in relation to olfactory function

The following tests are used for neurocognition testing:

* Immediate and delayed story recall from the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test
* Number span (forward and backward) and block span (forward and backward) from the Wechsler Memory Scale
* Phonemic word fluency from the Regensburg Word Fluency Test (phonemic)
* Trail Making Test A and B, From enrollment to 2 years after the end of radiotherapy|Quality of Life (QoL), Quality of Life in relation to olfactory function

The following questionnaires are used to assess quality of life:

* EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0; Part A with 28 questions on a Likert scale, 28 to 112 points, Higher score means lower quality of life; Part B with 2 questions on a Likert scale, 2 to 14 points, Lower score means lower quality of life )
* EORTC QLQ-BN20 (20 questions on a Likert scale; 20 to 80 points; Higher score means lower quality of life), From enrollment to 2 years after the end of radiotherapy|Psychological condition, Psychological well-being in relation to olfactory function

The following psychiatric questionnaires are used:

* Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8):

  8 questions on a Likert scale, score 0 to 24, higher score indicate more depression
* Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7):

  7 questions on a Likert scale, score 0 to 21, higher score indicate more anxiety
* National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer:

Score 1 to 10, higher score indicate more distress, From enrollment to 2 years after the end of radiotherapy
Background: Olfactory impairment is frequent in glioblastoma and is associated with poor overall survival. However, earlier studies were limited by confounding of important predictive factors and the lack of long-term olfactory assessments to evaluate treatment-related neurotoxicity.

Aim: To determine whether olfactory function is an independent prognostic marker for survival, quality of life and neurocognitive outcome in glioblastoma.

Design: Prospective, multicenter cohort study with 64 glioblastoma patients and 64 comparable controls without tumor disease. Patients were stratified by baseline olfactory status, extent of resection, radiologic involvement of olfactory regions,O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, age, and Karnofsky performance status.

Methods: Olfactory function will be serially assessed from diagnosis to treatment using Sniffin' Sticks (identification and threshold tests). Psychosocial assessments, neurocognitive testing and quality of life assessments will be performed at intervals. Coronal T2- and T1-weighted MRI scans will be evaluated independently by blinded neuroradiologists to identify olfactory involvement.

Next-generation sequencing will be used to investigate molecular correlates of hyposmia. As part of a parallel translational study, blood samples will be taken to analyze extracellular vesicles.

Olfactory testing:

In the identification test, 12 sniffin sticks are presented, which the patient has to name using a selection card with four terms each. Both nostrils are tested individually at each visit during the identification test. A correct answer scores one point. A maximum of 12 points is possible.

The threshold test consists of 16 dilution levels. Each level contains one sniffin stick with odor and two blanks. All three sniffin sticks of a dilution level are presented to the patient one after the other with eyes closed. The patient must indicate which of the three sticks contains an odor. Depending on whether the patient gives the correct answer, the three sniffin sticks in the next higher or next lower level are presented next. A maximum of 16 points is possible.
