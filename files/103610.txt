Safety of BBB Disruption Using NaviFUS System in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Patients
This study is to evaluate the safety and find the tolerated ultrasound dose of transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by using the NaviFUS System in recurrent GBM patients.

DEVICE: NaviFUS System
Number and severity of AE, Safety of transient opening of the BBB by using the NaviFUS System, 45 days
Tolerated dose of FUS with the NaviFUS System for transient disruption of the BBB, Dose escalation study using FUS, 7 days post-FUS|Quantify the BBB disruption following BBB disruption by the NaviFUS System, Dynamic T1 contrast-enhanced MRI, 1 day
This is a feasibility, open-label, single-arm, and dose escalation study. Eligible patients will be enrolled through the process of informed consent. Patients will be assigned into different dose groups generated from the NaviFUS System to transiently open the BBB in patients with recurrent GBM who will undergo surgery within 2 weeks. The focused ultrasound (FUS) dose is selected based on the results of pre-clinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety studies as well as other non-GLP primate studies. This study will evaluate the safety and the tolerated ultrasound dose of temporary disruption of the BBB in patients with recurrent GBM. To find the tolerated ultrasound dose, the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review the study data and provide the recommendations regarding continuation, termination, or other modifications of the study based on evaluation of observed adverse effects of the intervention. The extent and magnitude of BBB opening will be evaluated using of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
