One-day Mind Programme for Women With Breast Cancer
Breast cancer (BC) remains the second most common type of cancer worldwide and the leading cancer affecting women. In Portugal there are approximately 7000 new diagnoses of BC each year. The diagnosis and treatment of BC can profoundly impact patients' physical (e.g., fatigue, pain) and psychological (e.g. distress, depressive symptoms) well-being. Psychological interventions that foster adjustment to cancer (and to its treatment), mental health and quality of life are therefore essential.

The use of contextual behavioural therapies in samples of people with chronic diseases has shown evidence of efficacy in improving psychopathological symptoms. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the use of single-session ACT interventions in samples with chronically ill patients may be more viable, acceptable, and beneficial compared to multiple-session ACT interventions.

This interventional study aims to test the acceptability (aim 1) and effectiveness (aim 2) of a brief (7-hour) version of the "Mind Programme for Women with Breast Cancer", which is providing promising efficacy results. Similarly to the original programme, this brief version integrates contextual behavioural therapies (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - ACT, and Compassion-Focused Therapy - CFT), is tailored to BC women and presents a group and online format, delivered by two psychologists. This trial also aims to determine the contribution of mediating (psychological flexibility, self-compassion) and moderating (e.g. age) factors in treatment effectiveness (aim 3).

Women with BC who had previously shown interest in participating in the RCT of the (original) multiple-session Mind Programme, but that were either not eligible or were allocated to the waiting list, will be invited to join this trial. Participants will complete the 7-h intervention "One-day Mind Programme for women with breast cancer" and complete self-reported outcome measures (e.g. EORTC QLQ-C30, HADS, CompACT, SCS, resource use questionnaire) in three different timepoints (pre, post, and 3-month follow-up). The G\*Power 3.1.9.7 software was used to calculate the sample size (N=36) required for a single-armed linear repeated-measures model with three measurements and assuming a comparable (medium) effect size to that estimated in similar studies, an alpha of 0.05 and a minimum of 90% power.

High levels of acceptability and improvements in outcomes (e.g. breast cancer-specific quality of life, anxiety and depressive symptoms, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, health-related costs) are expected at post-treatment and follow-up. This trial seeks to contribute to the integration of brief and cost-effective psychosocial interventions in the usual healthcare for BC patients and survivors.

BEHAVIORAL: One-day Mind Programme for women with breast cancer
Quality of life of cancer patients, This outcome will be assessed through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items and scores range from 0 to 100 units for each scale and item: 1. Functional Scales: Higher scores indicate better functioning and quality of life; 2. Symptom Scales/Items: Higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms or problems., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Quality of life of breast cancer patients, This outcome will be assessed through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Breast Cancer 23 (EORTC QLQ-BR23). EORTC QLQ-BR23 scores range 0 to 100 units for each scale and item: 1. Functional Scales/Items (Body Image, Sexual Functioning, Sexual Enjoyment and Future Perspective): Higher scores indicate better functioning and quality of life; 2. Symptom Scales/Items (Systemic Therapy Side Effects, Breast Symptoms, Arm Symptoms and Upset by Hair Loss): Higher scores indicate a higher level of symptoms or problems., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).
Depressive symptoms and anxiety severity, This outcome will be assessed through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS is a 14-item questionnaire and each item is scored from 0 to 3 units, resulting in subscale scores ranging from 0 to 21 units: 1. Anxiety subscale: Higher scores indicate higher anxiety level; 2. Depression subscale: Higher scores indicate higher depression level., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Psychological flexibility, This outcome will be assessed through the Comprehensive Assessment of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Processes (CompACT) 18-item version. Each item of CompACT is rated on a scale from 0 to 6, resulting in subscale scores ranging from 0 to 36 units: 1. Openness to Experience subscale: Higher scores indicate more willingness to experience thoughts and feelings without trying to avoid them; 2. Behavioural Awareness subscale: Higher scores indicate more ability to be aware of and engage in behaviours that are consistent with one's values; 3. Valued Action subscale: Higher scores indicate higher extent to which individuals take actions that are aligned with their personal values., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Self-compassion, This outcome will be assessed via Self-Compassion Scale (SELFCS) 26-item version. Each item of SELFCS is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, resulting in subscale scores ranging from 4 or 5 to 20 or 25 units: 1.Self-Kindness subscale(ss): Higher scores indicate higher ability to be kind and understanding towards oneself, especially during difficult times; 2.Self-Judgment ss: Higher scores indicate higher tendency to be overly critical and judgmental of oneself;3.Common Humanity ss: Higher scores indicate higher recognition that suffering and personal failures are part of the shared human experience; 4.Isolation ss: Higher scores indicate higher feelings of isolation and disconnection from others when experiencing suffering; 5.Mindfulness ss: Higher scores indicate higher ability to hold one's painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness; 6.Over-Identification ss: Higher scores indicate higher tendency to become overly absorbed and fixated on one's negative emotions and thoughts., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Health-related quality of life, This outcome will be assessed through the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L). It consists of two main parts: the descriptive system (5 items representing 5 dimensions, that are scored on a scale from 1 to 5 levels of severity: 1. Mobility; 2. Self-care; 3. Usual activities; 4. Pain/Discomfort; 5. Anxiety/Depression) and the EQ visual analogue scale (that records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled '100 = The best health you can imagine' and '0 = The worst health you can imagine'). Higher scores in both parts indicate higher health-related quality of life and perceived overall health., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Economic impact of cancer on patients, This outcome will be assessed through a questionnaire adapted from the UK Cancer Costs Questionnaire (UKCC) Version 2.0. This questionnaire captures the financial burden associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment and has 4 key components: 1. Healthcare Utilization (4 open-ended questions regarding the number of contacts with health professionals outside the hospital setting); 2. Out-of-Pocket Expenses (3 open-ended questions regarding the direct costs incurred by patients, such as medication, travel, and other healthcare-related expenses); 3. Employment and Productivity (5 open-ended questions and 2 multiple-choice questions regarding the impact of cancer on the patient's employment status, including loss of earnings and productivity due to illness); 4. Informal Care (1 open-ended questions regarding the amount of informal care provided by family and friends). Higher scores indicate higher economic impact of cancer and its treatment on patients., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Acceptability of the intervention, This outcome will be assessed through a final evaluation form with 8 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Totally Disagree; 5 = Totally Agree) regarding several aspects of the programme (e.g. expectations, satisfaction, usefulness). Higher scores indicate higher acceptance of the intervention by patients., At post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme).|Feasibility of the intervention: adherence., This outcome will be assessed through direct observation of the patients during the intervention and via attendance records. Higher number of interactions during the intervention and higher attendance indicate higher adherence to the intervention., Throughout the One-Day Mind Programme (up to 7 hours).|Feasibility of the intervention: dropout., This outcome will be assessed via attendance records and it will involve calculating the percentage of patients who discontinue the programme before its completion. A higher percentage will indicate higher dropout rate., Throughout the One-Day Mind Programme (up to 7 hours).
Impact of significant life events - controlling variable, This outcome will be assessed through the Major Life Event Questionnaire (MLEQ). This Portuguese questionnaire comprises 23 items that represent major life events that may occur in a person's life (e.g. marriage, pregnancy, serious illness). For each item, participants are asked to report the occurrence (yes = 1) or absence (no = 0) of the specific event in the previous months (the number of months depends on the moment of assessment). The higher the score (min: 0; max: 23), the higher the number of major life events in the previous months., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme) / 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).|Sociodemographic and clinical variables - controlling variable, This outcome will be assessed through a questionnaire with 47 open-ended or multiple-choice questions regarding sociodemographic (e.g. age) and clinical data (e.g. cancer stage). This data will be important to check inclusion/exclusion criteria., Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme).|Psychological processes awareness - planned moderator, This outcome will be assessed through the Awareness of Contextual Therapies Processes Scale (ACTPS). ACTPS is 9-item tool used to measure the processes involved in contextual therapies, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly Agree), resulting in total scores ranging from 9 to 45 units, the higher the score, the higher the awareness level., Post-treatment (10 days after One-Day Mind Programme).|Efficacy expectancy - planned moderator, Yes-no single question about the efficacy expectancy: "Do you believe that the intervention will bring benefits to your quality of life and mental health?", Baseline (before One-Day Mind Programme).|Home practice frequency - planned moderator, Multiple choice question regarding the frequency of home practice in the last 3 months., 3-month follow-up (3 months after One-Day Mind Programme).
