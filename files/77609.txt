Phase 1 Study of Iobenguane (MIBG) I 131 in Patients With Malignant Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether iobenguane I 131 is safe and effective in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
Pheochromocytoma|Paraganglioma
DRUG: Ultratrace Iobenguane (MIBG) I 131
MTD of Ultratrace Iobenguane I 131, Although no primary efficacy endpoint was defined for this study, the MTD of Ultratrace iobenguane I 131 in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (a safety rather than an efficacy parameter) is the primary objective., 6 weeks post therapy dose
This was originally designed as a phase 1/2 study. The phase 1 patients received a small dose of study drug to see if the tumors absorb the drug. If the patient's tumors absorbed the drug, then the patient received one therapeutic dose. In the phase 1 portion, the study employed a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Enrollment in the phase 1 portion was to be completed once researches believed that they found the highest dose that they could give patients without causing unacceptable toxicity. This dose is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Following discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that occurred during the dose escalation stage of the study, the protocol was amended to conclude the trial upon the identification of the MTD. The Phase 2 safety/ efficacy stage of the study was conducted with modifications of the primary endpoint as Protocol MIP IB12B, with Special Protocol Assessment Agreement with the FDA in March 2009.
