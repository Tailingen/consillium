The PharmFIT Study
This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a pharmacy-based FIT intervention, Pharmacy-based FIT (PharmFIT), on colorectal cancer screening (CRC) screening rates in primary care patients who are not up to date on CRC screening. Through collaboration with community partners in North Carolina and the Pacific Northwest region, 1) the impact will be evaluated, 2) the implementation will be assessed, and 3) the costs of the PharmFIT intervention cost will be estimated. Patients (n=1,200) will be individually randomized to a usual care arm or a PharmFIT arm and we will determine whether there are statistically significant differences in CRC screening rates. Concurrently, a mixed methods approach will be used to assess a range of preliminary implementation outcomes, identify outcome barriers and facilitators, and identify implementation strategies to support future research. Also, the cost of PharmFIT will be calculated, using collaborative process flow diagramming (PFD) to inform micro-costing and budget impact analysis. Supported by preliminary work from the investigators, demonstrating widespread acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of PharmFIT, the rationale to conduct this hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation trial1 is to generate new knowledge about pharmacy-based interventions to effectively increase CRC screening uptake and implementation. The central hypothesis is that the PharmFIT intervention will increase screening uptake by improving access to, and opportunities for, this preventive service through the involvement of a multidisciplinary, multisite, team-based care approach to CRC screening.

BEHAVIORAL: PharmFIT
Service Penetration (Effectiveness), Receipt of any USPSTF guideline recommended CRC screening (FIT, FIT-DNA, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT colonography, or barium enema), using a yes \["1"\] vs. no \["0"\] dichotomous outcome in the 6 months following randomization., 6-months post randomization|Appropriateness of the PharmFIT intervention, Perceptions that PharmFIT is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory., 6-months post enrollment|Acceptability of the PharmFIT intervention, Perceptions that PharmFIT is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory., 6-months post enrollment|Feasibility of the PharmFIT intervention, Extent to which PharmFIT was successfully implemented and used within the clinics and pharmacies, measured by the Implementation Outcomes Questionnaire (IOQ) Feasibility Subscale., 6-months post enrollment|Fidelity to the PharmFIT intervention, PharmFIT delivered as intended; adherence; integrity; quality of PharmFIT intervention delivery, measured using the study's REDCap tracking database (e.g., patient communications delivered, FIT kits distributed, results reports, etc.)., Baseline, 6-months post enrollment|Cost of the PharmFIT intervention, Incremental cost of each additional patient screened in the intervention arm compared to usual care. Comparison of the programmatic costs incurred, and number of subjects screened in Arm 1(trial PharmFIT) compared to Arm 2 (usual care), measured as cost of intervention minus the cost of usual care, divided by the number screened in Arm 1 minus the number screened in Arm 2.

Intervention costs will be assessed using periodic episodes of direct observation of PharmFIT outreach activities, time logs maintained by the intervention team, and assembly of administrative data capturing non-personnel/non-labor expenditures, such as costs associated with materials printing, FIT processing, and mailing costs. Usual care costs will be estimated using data collected from collaborative process flow diagramming sessions., Through study completion, up to 12 months after PharmFIT intervention implementation
Reach, A) The total number of patients who received referrals after being identified for screening, overall and by patient sex, race, ethnicity, age group, insurance category, rurality, previous screening behavior, and clinic/pharmacy cluster. B) The number of patients who received referrals after being identified for screening, overall and by patient sex, race, ethnicity, age group, insurance category, rurality, previous screening behavior, and clinic/pharmacy cluster., 6-months post enrollment|Timely FIT completion, FIT completion at 60 days among those randomized to PharmFIT intervention., 6-months post enrollment|Timely follow-up colonoscopy, Proportion of patients with positive FIT results completing follow-up colonoscopy within 6 months following positive FIT results., 6-months post enrollment
The long-term goal of this study is to reduce CRC mortality by increasing access to CRC screening. The overall objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a pharmacy-based FIT (PharmFIT) intervention. PharmFIT is a collaborative patient care service intervention that involves primary care clinics identifying active patients who are due for screening and referring them, outside of a medical visit, to community pharmacies to receive their CRC screening via FITs. The program consists of 1) Patient eligibility assessments and endorsement by the Primary Care Provider (PCP); 2) Counseling on FIT use and return by the pharmacists; 3) Reminders to complete screening by the pharmacy staff; 3) Test result communication by the pharmacists/PCPs; and 4) Patient navigation and care coordination for follow-up care by both pharmacists and PCPs.
