To Evaluate Thrombosis Risk in Chemotherapy Patients With Solid Tumors Who Receiving Thrombocytopenia Treatment
Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a common hematological toxicity in patients with solid tumors undergo chemotherapy, which can increase the risk of bleeding, prolong hospital stay, increase medical costs, and even lead to death in severe cases. The incidence and severity of CIT varies among different chemotherapy regimens. Recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) and recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) have been approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.

Tumor patients are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). In the clinical study of rhIL-11, it was found that the administration of rhIL-11 in healthy subjects caused an increase in the plasma concentration of vWF factor in the form of normal mults. The application of rhIL-11 in patients with myeloid leukemia can increase the concentration of α2 globulin, fibrinogen and prothrombin time. However, there have been no large-scale clinical studies at home and abroad to evaluate whether platelet raising therapy will increase the risk of thrombosis in chemotherapy patients with solid tumor. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of platelet upwelling therapy in patients with solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy.
