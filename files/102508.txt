A Study of Acalabrutinib vs Investigator's Choice of Idelalisib Plus Rituximab or Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in R/R CLL
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib compared with rituximab in combination with idelalisib or bendamustine in previously treated subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Acalabrutinib (ACP-196)|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Bendamustine
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessment, To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib monotherapy (Arm A) compared with idelalisib/rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab (Arm B) based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria (Hallek 2008) with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012) hereafter referred to as IWCLL 2008 criteria in subjects with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As planned and reported in the interim clinical study report (dated 17 July 2019), because the study did cross the boundary at interim analysis.

IRC assessments were discontinued after the interim analysis. All IRC-related efficacy analyses in this clinical study report were based on the interim analysis data cutoff date of 15 January 2019. All other efficacy analyses were based on the final analysis data cutoff date of 03 September 2021., IRC assessments from randomization date until disease progression or death or IRC discontinuation on 15Jan2019 (as IA per this data cutoff showed crossing superiority boundary) whichever came first, up to 22 months of follow-up
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Investigator Assessment, PFS per investigator assessment based on the final analysis data cutoff date of 03 September 2021., From randomization date to date of disease progression or death due to any cause or data cutoff date on 03Sep2021, whichever came first, regardless of use of subsequent anticancer therapy, until 53 months of follow-up.|IRC-assessed Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per IWCLL 2008 Criteria Based on Data Cutoff 15 January 2019 From Interim Analysis, IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR) including complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) nodular PR (nPR), and Partial Response (PR), IRC assessments from randomization date until disease progression or death or IRC discontinuation on 15Jan2019 (as IA per this data cutoff showed crossing superiority boundary) whichever came first, up to 22 months of follow-up|Investigator Assessed Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per IWCLL 2008 Criteria Based on Data Cutoff 03 September 2021, IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR) including complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) nodular PR (nPR), and Partial Response (PR), Investigator assessments were done from randomization date until date of death or date of exit from study or data cut off date on 03Sep2021, whichever came first, up to 53 months of follow-up.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was based on data cutoff date of 03Sep2021, From randomization date to date of death due to any cause, or date of study discontinuation, or date of data cutoff on 03Sep2021, whichever came first until 54 months of follow-up.|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessment Based on 15 January 2019 Data Cutoff From Interim Analysis., Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as from the first documentation of CR, CRi, PR, or nPR to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause., IRC assessments from randomization date until disease progression or death or IRC discontinuation on 15Jan2019 (as IA per this data cutoff showed crossing superiority boundary) whichever came first, up to 22 months of follow-up|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Investigator Assessment Based on 03 September 2021 Data Cutoff, Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as from the first documentation of CR, CRi, PR, or nPR to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause., Investigator assessments were done from randomization date until date of death or study discontinuation or data cutoff date on 03Sep2021, whichever came first up to 53 months of follow-up.|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) Based on 03 September 2021 Data Cutoff, Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of institution of non-protocol-specified treatment for CLL (or first dose date of acalabrutinib for Arm B subjects crossing over to receive acalabrutinib) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., From randomization date to start of non-protocol specified subsequent anticancer therapy for CLL or death due to any cause or study discontinuation or data cutoff date on 03Sep2021,, whichever came first up to 53 months of follow-up.
