Enasidenib in MDS &Non-proliferative Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia w/o IDH2 Mutation
This is a phase 1b/2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate if enasidenib is safe and effective in improving anemia and decreasing transfusion needs in subjects diagnosed with lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or nonproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) without a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 2 (IDH2 wildtype). Other objectives include assessment of improvements in platelet production and characterization of the mechanism of action of enasidenib in enhancing endogenous erythropoiesis.

DRUG: Enasidenib mesylat dose escalation
Clinical Response: Hematological Improvement - Erythroid (HI-E), Clinical response was assessed as the number of participants achieving a hematological improvement - erythroid (HI-E). Participants will be characterized and stratified as nontransfused (NTD), low-transfusion burden (LTB) and high-transfusion burden (HTB), with response defined as follows.

* NTD = greater than or equal to 2 consecutive Hb measurements, greater than or equal to 1.5 g/dL for a period of minimum 8 week in an observation period of 16 to 24 week compared to the lowest mean of 2 Hb measurements
* LTB = 0 units of RBC transfusions
* HTB = greater than or equal to 4 unit or greater than or equal to 50% reduction in RBC transfusions The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 16 weeks|Related Adverse Events, Toxicity will be assessed as the number of related non serious adverse events and related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for the 12 cycle treatment period plus follow up. The outcome will be reported as numbers without dispersion., 12 months|Time to Hematological Improvement - Erythroid (HI-E), Time to hematological improvement - erythroid (HI-E) will be assessed as the time from first dose of enasidenib to the first observed hemoglobin response. Participants will be characterized and stratified as nontransfused (NTD), low-transfusion burden (LTB) and high-transfusion burden (HTB), with response defined as follows.

* NTD = greater than or equal to 2 consecutive Hb measurements, greater than or equal to 1.5 g/dL for a period of minimum 8 week in an observation period of 16 to 24 week compared to the lowest mean of 2 Hb measurements
* LTB = 0 units of RBC transfusions
* HTB = greater than or equal to 4 unit or greater than or equal to 50% reduction in RBC transfusions The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 16 weeks.|Duration of Hematological Improvement - Erythroid (HI-E), Duration of Hematological Improvement - Erythroid (HI-E) will be assessed as the time from recorded response to loss of response. Participants will be characterized and stratified as nontransfused (NTD), low-transfusion burden (LTB) and high-transfusion burden (HTB), with response defined as follows.

* NTD = greater than or equal to 2 consecutive Hb measurements, greater than or equal to 1.5 g/dL for a period of minimum 8 week in an observation period of 16 to 24 week compared to the lowest mean of 2 Hb measurements
* LTB = 0 units of RBC transfusions
* HTB = greater than or equal to 4 unit or greater than or equal to 50% reduction in RBC transfusions The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 16 weeks.|Clinical Response: Hematological Improvement - Platelets (HI-P), Clinical response for platelets was assessed as the number of participants achieving a hematological improvement - platelets (HI-P). Participants will be characterized and stratified as platelets \< or ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L, with response defined as follows.

* \< 20 x 10\^9/L = increase in platelets from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to \> 20 x 10\^9/L AND by ≥ 100%
* ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L = absolute increase in platelets of 30 x 10\^9/L The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 8 weeks|Clinical Response: Hematological Improvement - Neutrophils (HI-N), Clinical response for neutrophils was assessed as the number of participants achieving a hematological improvement - neutrophils (HI-N). Response defined as an absolute increase in neutrophils \> 0.5 x 10\^9/L that is also an increase of ≥ 100%.

The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 8 weeks|Red Blood Cell (RBC) transfusion independence (RBC TI), Clinical response for red blood cells was assessed as the number of participants who were transfusion dependent that achieve red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (RBC TI) for for 8 weeks or longer. The outcome will be reported as the number of participants that achieve the response, a number without dispersion., 12 months
Primary Objective(s)- To determine the efficacy (response rate) of enasidenib in improving anemia and decreasing RBC transfusion dependence.

Secondary Objective(s)- To determine the tolerability, safety and durability of the erythroid response and identify laboratory parameters as clinical markers of response.
