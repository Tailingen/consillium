General Anesthesia or Combined Spinal-epidural Anesthesia With Ketofol Sedation in Colon Cancer Surgery?
Anesthesia management in colon cancer surgery affects the postoperative mobilization, discharge and oral intake times of the patients. Due to the side effects of opioids, their use is tried to be reduced and therefore regional anesthesia methods are preferred in suitable patients. Especially in the preoperative period, opioid use has a negative effect on the recovery processes, morbidity and mortality of the patients. Epidural analgesia, a central block method, is recommended for postoperative pain control in ERAS protocols. Opioids suppress cellular and humoral immunity. Epidural analgesia reduces both opioid consumption and surgical stress response. It has been shown that epidural analgesia maintains the immune functions of patients and is associated with a decrease in tumor recurrence. It has also been shown to reduce postoperative pain, hypercoagulability and pulmonary complications, increase exercise capacity and accelerate the return of intestinal functions to normal. In line with this information, in this study, it was aimed to investigate the differences in the postoperative period in patients managed with regional anesthesia.

In the study, it was planned to create two groups who underwent open surgery for colon cancer. The first group will be operated under general anesthesia and the second group will be operated under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia with ketofol sedation. An epidural catheter will be inserted in both groups for postoperative pain management. In the study, patients' age, gender, weight, comorbidity, ASA score, amount of local anesthetic used, postoperative VAS scores, mobilization time, time to start oral intake, nasogastric withdrawal time, drain removal time, urinary catheter withdrawal time, hospitalization time and total cost will be evaluated.
