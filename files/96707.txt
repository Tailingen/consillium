Transbronchial vs Transthoracic Ablation for Early-stage Peripheral Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of RFA through a transthoracic or transbronchial approach in the treatment of early-stage peripheral lung cancer.
Stage IA Lung Cancer
DEVICE: The disposable pulmonary radiofrequency ablation catheter and pulmonary radiofrequency ablation system|DEVICE: The disposable percutaneous radiofrequency ablation needle and pulmonary radiofrequency ablation system
Complete ablation rate at 6 months after ablation, It is defined as the proportion of lesions with complete ablation to all ablated lesions at 6 months after ablation., 6 months
Technical success rate, It is defined as the proportion of lesions which the ablation needle reached and successfully ablated to all lesions intended for ablation., Immediately after ablation|Complete ablation rate 12 months after ablation, It is defined as the proportion of lesions with complete ablation to all ablated lesions at 12 months after ablation., 12 months|Local control rate at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after ablation, It is defined as the proportion of lesions with complete ablation and incomplete ablation to all ablated lesions at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after ablation., 1 year, 2 years and 3years|Progression free survival (PFS), It is defined as the duration from the ablation to the first occurrence of disease progression or the death of the subject., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the total time from the ablation to the death of the subject., 3 years|Safety, To assess the incidence of device- or procedure-related (serious) adverse events occurring during the study., 12 months
This study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial with 110 participants, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to CT-guided RFA and bronchoscopy-guided RFA groups. The primary study endpoint is the complete ablation rate at 6 months post-ablation. Secondary study endpoints are technical success rate, complete ablation rate at 12 months post-ablation, local control rate at 1, 2, and 3 years post-ablation, progression free survival, overall survival, and safety. Demographic data, clinical baseline characteristics, CT follow-up data, and safety data will be collected and recorded.
