Prophylactic Infusion of Donor Lymphocytes in Cord Blood Transplantation
Pilot, multicentric, open-label, single-arm, phase I-II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation (UCBT) platform, that consists of a UCBT of the 80 fraction, followed by a Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) of the 20 fraction (between 60 and 90 days after transplantation).

Multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase I-II pilot study in which a minimum of 20 patients will enter the study with the primary objective to assess the safety and secondary objective to assess efficacy in relation to immune reconstitution followed by a new platform of treatment consisting of initial cord blood unit 80 fraction transplantation, followed by a prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of the fraction 20 of the cord blood unit. The second infusion will take place between 60 and 90 days after transplantation.
