A Dose-escalation, Expansion Study of ARX788, in Advanced Solid Tumors Subjects With HER2 Expression (ACE-Pan Tumor 01)
This 2-part, Phase 1, open-label study will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARX788 in subjects with advanced HER2 positive cancers and will assess the safety and anticancer activity in breast, gastric and other advanced HER2 positive solid tumors.
Breast Neoplasms|Gastric Neoplasm|Solid Tumors
DRUG: ARX788
Number of subjects experiencing adverse events, frequency and seriousness of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), To assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile, Day 1 through 30 days after last dose|Phase 1b: Objective response rate (ORR: complete response + partial response) per imaging assessment based on RECIST version 1.1., Number of subjects with objective response is assessed every 6-8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression., 36 months
Number of subjects with tumor response per imaging assessment based on RECIST version 1.1., The objective response rate (ORR: CR+PR) based on RECIST v1.1 will be assessed as the primary endpoint to determine the anticancer activity of ARX788 as well as best overall response., 18 months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from first infusion to subject end of study., Pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics: ARX788 (intact ADC), total mAb, and metabolites, 36 months|Half-life of ARX788 from first infusion to end of study., Pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics: ARX788 from first infusion to subject end of study, 36 months|Immunogenicity profile of ARX788, Number of subjects who develop anti-ARX788 antibody, 36 months
Phase 1a will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with advanced cancer whose HER2 test results are in situ hybridization (ISH) positive or immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, based on safety, tolerability, PK findings and antitumor activity. Phase 1b will assess the safety, tolerability, and PK and anticancer activity in five expansion cohorts, including breast cancer, gastric cancer / gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, and other advanced HER2-positive solid tumors.
