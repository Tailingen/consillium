Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer With Oligo-Metastasis
Pancreatic cancer is increasing in incidence and will be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 2030 in the West. Only 10 to 15% of patients are eligible for curative resection with long-term survival rarely exceeding 20% at 5 years. The management of metastatic or recurrent diseases can not, unfortunately, be recommended to date because of limited data available (INCA 2019).

However, recent, low-strength publications have reported encouraging results on the long-term survival of stage IV or recurrent patients.

The aim of the present retrospective cohort study is to analyze results of surgery/destruction of metastatic synchronous or metachronous disease or local recurrence in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer

Overall survival, Overall survival at 3 years (percentage of patients alive). Overall survival (OS) (time from diagnosis until death, regardless of cause), 3 years
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (percentage of patients without recurrence) at 3 years. Progression-free survival (PFS) (time from diagnosis to time of first radiological evidence of local, regional, or distant relapse, or death due to any cause), 3 years
