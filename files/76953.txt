Understanding How Methadone Treatment During Surgery Affects Pain Levels and the Need for Pain Medications After Surgery
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether giving methadone during spinal surgery helps manage pain in the first 72 hours after surgery better than other standard pain medications. Participants' pain will be measured by how much pain is reported after surgery, and how much additional pain medication is needed to lower pain levels. The researchers will look at whether giving methadone during surgery reduces the need for other pain medications after surgery. In addition, the team will compare the effects of the two standard treatments- one with methadone and one without methadone to to evaluate which one works best.
