Cabozantinib for Advanced Urothelial Cancer
Background:

- Cabozantinib is a drug that slows the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. It is approved for medullary thyroid cancer. However, studies have shown that prostate and ovarian tumors respond to it. Researchers want see if cabozantinib can be a safe and effective treatment for urothelial cancer.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of cabozantinib for advanced urothelial cancer.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced urothelial cancer that has not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Tumor tissue samples will also be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.
* Participants will take cabozantinib by mouth once per day on each day of a 28-day cycle.
* Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.
* Participants will continue to take the study drug for as long as their cancer does not worsen and side effects are not too severe.

DRUG: Cabozantinib
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Cabozantinib (XL184) assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Median follow-up was 61.2 months
Overall Survival, Measure the timing from the study start until death., Median follow-up was 61.2 months|Progression Free Survival, Measure the timing of maintaining stable disease or partial response until disease progression assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions. Stable disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest um diameters while on study., Median follow-up was 61.2 months|Number of Participants With Grade 4 Toxicity Hypomagnesium Related to Cabozantinib, Grade 4 toxicity hypomagnesium experienced by participants related to Cabozantinib. Grade 4 toxicity is life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated., Median follow-up was 61.2 months|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Regardless of Attribution, Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Median follow-up was 61.2 months
Background:

* In the United States, urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and the ninth most common in women with an estimated 69,250 new cases and 14,990 deaths in the year 2011
* There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved second line drug for patients with metastatic Urothelial Cancer (UC)
* Multiple lines of evidence support targeting angiogenesis in UC
* In human bladder cancer, overexpression of tyrosine-protein kinase (c-Met)/Axl/platelet derived growth factor receptor- (PDGFR)-alpha or c-Met alone showed significant correlation with poor survival
* Cabozantinib is a new chemical entity that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases with growth-promoting and angiogenic properties.
* The primary targets of cabozantinib are mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET), vascular endothelial factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and rearranged during transfection (RET)

Objectives:

- To determine the response rate of cabozantinib in patients with progressive urothelial cancer who have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy

Eligibility:

* Patients in cohort 1 must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic, progressive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis.
* Patients in cohort 2 must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of bone only metastatic, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis.
* Patients in cohort 3 must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-transitional cell carcinoma cancer (including but not limited to squamous cell, neuroendocrine, adenocarcinoma including urachal and sarcomatoid) of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis.
* Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by treatment with at least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen or agent. Patients may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents.
* 18 years of age or older.

Design:

* A maximum of 71subjects will be enrolled in this open label, non-randomized, phase II trial of 60 mg each day of cabozantinib. Up to 50 patients will be accrued to cohort 1 (metastatic, progressive urothelial cancer. The remainder will be enrolled on exploratory cohorts 2 \& 3, bone only metastatic urothelial disease and non transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) bladder cancer respectively, during the time the study is accruing patients for cohort 1. Note: Patients who tolerate cabozantinib at 60 mg daily during the first 2 cycles (first restaging time period) without (Bullet) grade 2 toxicity may undergo dose escalation to 80 mg daily at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.
* A Simon 2 stage design with alpha=0.05 and beta = 0.10 as acceptable error probabilities. Initially 21 subjects will be enrolled and followed for progression. If 2 or more of cohort 1 subjects experiences a response, enrollment will continue until a total of 41 evaluable subjects with progressive urothelial cancer have been entered. 2-3 patients per month may enroll on this trial; thus, 2 to 3 years is anticipated as the accrual period.
* Each patient will undergo response evaluation assessments with chest abdomen pelvis computed tomography (CAP CT) (or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) with or without 18F-Sodium Fluoride (Na18F) positron emission tomography (PET CT) every 8 weeks while on active protocol therapy starting at baseline. Patients will undergo investigational Fludeoxyglucose, (FDG) PET/CT and PET/MRI (optional) at baseline, week 4 and week 8.
