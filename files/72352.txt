This study will assess the prevalence of HPV infection in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, intraepithelial neoplasia, and E6E7 biomarker at cervical and anal sites.
HPV Infection|Cervical/Anal Dysplasia
HPV infection, Prevalence of cervical and anal HPV infection and of oncogenic subtypes, among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, behaviorally HIV-infected adolescents, and HIv-negative adolescents, 48 weeks
intraepithelial neoplasia, Prevalence of intraepithelial neoplasia among the three study groups and in male and female subjects, 48 weeks|E6/E7, Prevalence of detected E6/E7 biomarker among the tree study groups and in male and female subjects.

Correlation between detected E6/E7 and presence of HPV infection and/or intraepithelial neoplasia Association between HAART use, CD4 counts, plasma HIV RNA level and HIV clinical staging with HPV infection, intraepithelial neoplasia and E6/E7 detection, 48 weeks|HPV vaccine, Proportion of adolescents who would benefit from the current preventive vaccine (i.e. those who have not been infected with oncogenic HPV subtypes 16 and 18), 48 weeks
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease and it causes cervical and anal cancer. Prevalence and incidence of HPV infection among young adults who are sexually experienced is high. No data exist for HIV-positive adolescents in regards to HPV infection, cervical and anal intraepithelial neoplasia. This study will compare the prevalence of HPV infection, intraepithelial neoplasia and E6/E7 biomarker at cervical and anal sites among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, behaviorally HIV-infected adolescents, and HIV-negative adolescents.
