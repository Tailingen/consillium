BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) in Head & Neck Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of BIBW 2992 compared with cetuximab (Erbitux) in patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer after failure of platinum-containing therapy. In addition, the trial aims to clarify the influence of EGFR genotype on tumor response to the treatment regimens.

Tumor Shrinkage Before Crossover (Stage 1) of the Trial as Per Investigator Assessment, Tumor shrinkage before crossover was defined as the change from baseline in the smallest post-randomisation sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (SLD), calculated as the smallest SLD after randomisation but before crossover minus SLD at baseline. Baseline was the SLD measured before randomisation. A negative value means the smallest post-randomisation SLD was smaller than baseline (decreased since baseline); a positive value means tumor size increased since baseline.

Mean calculated is actually the Adjusted mean. Adjusted mean is obtained from fitting an ANCOVA model including treatment, stratification factor prior chemotherapy for recurrent/metastatic disease and the baseline sum of longest distance of target lesions as covariates., From randomization until start of Stage 2 treatment, or within 28 days after the termination of Stage 1.
Tumor Shrinkage After Crossover (Stage 2) as Per Investigator Assessments, Tumor shrinkage after crossover was defined as the change from baseline in the smallest post-crossover sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (SLD), calculated as the smallest SLD after crossover minus SLD at baseline. Baseline was the SLD measured at the time of crossover, or the closest measurement before the patient started stage 2 treatment. A negative value means the smallest post-crossover SLD was smaller than baseline (decreased after crossover), a positive value means tumor size increased after crossover., From baseline assessed prior to first dose of Stage 2 study medication to 28 days after termination of Stage 2 treatment.|Best RECIST Assessment as Per Investigator Assessment for Stage 1 (as Confirmed Disease Control (Clinical
