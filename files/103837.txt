VR-based Intervention for Cognitive Restoration
The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a nature-based cognitive intervention to restore cognitive function among women treated for breast cancer.

BEHAVIORAL: Virtual reality-based cognitive intervention
Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS), The CNSVS will be used to assess global and domain-specific cognitive function, Cognitive function will be assessed at baseline|Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS), The CNSVS will be used to assess global and domain-specific cognitive function, Cognitive function will be assessed at 4 weeks after baseline (immediate post-intervention)|Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS), The CNSVS will be used to assess global and domain-specific cognitive function, Cognitive function will be assessed at 8 weeks after baseline (4 weeks after intervention)|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive, The FACT-Cog will be used to assess self-reported effectiveness in cognitive function, Perceived cognitive function will be assessed at baseline|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive, The FACT-Cog will be used to assess self-reported effectiveness in cognitive function, Perceived cognitive function will be assessed at 4 weeks after baseline (immediate post-intervention)|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive, The FACT-Cog will be used to assess self-reported effectiveness in cognitive function, Perceived cognitive function will be assessed at 8 weeks after baseline (4 weeks after intervention)
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), The FACIT-F will be used to assess experience and impact of fatigue, Fatigue will will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (immediate post-intervention), and 8 weeks (4 weeks after intervention)|Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), The PHQ will be used to assess depressed mood, Depression will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (immediate post-intervention), and 8 weeks (4 weeks after intervention)|Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), The PSQI will be used to assess sleep problems, Sleep problems will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (immediate post-intervention), and 8 weeks (4 weeks after intervention)|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), The FACT-G will be used to assess health-related quality of life, Quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (immediate post-intervention), and 8 weeks (4 weeks after intervention)|Perceived Restorativeness for Activities Scale (PRAS), The PRAS will be used to assess perceived restorativeness of their activities engaged to improve cognition, Perceived restorativeness will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks (immediate post-intervention), and 8 weeks (4 weeks after intervention)
Cognitive dysfunction is a kind of cluster of commonly reported neurotoxic symptoms following cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially chemotherapy. Our previous studies found that breast cancer patients and survivors had greater difficulties in performing attention, working memory, and executive function tasks and had persistent neural inefficiency of an executive network of the brain than disease and treatment counterparts.

The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a nature-based cognitive intervention to restore cognitive function among women with cognitive complaints after breast cancer treatment. All participants will receive the initial screening to verify their cognitive status and then will be randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group will receive a 4-week cognitive intervention by using a VR headset. Each VR content includes 10-12 video scenes with visual and auditory stimuli that were generated from nature.
