CAV Regimen for R/R Ph- B-ALL
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of cladribine, venetoclax combined with cytarabine and venetoclax (CAV regimen) for relapsed/refractory (R/R) Philadelphia Chromosome-negative (Ph-) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: cladribine, cytarabine,venetoclax
Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response (completed remission, completed remission with incomplete blood count recovery), ORR assessment is measured on days 21 from the start of CAV regimen
Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the time of enrollment to this trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the time of enrollment to this study to progression or death., 2 years|Adverse events, It is evaluated and graded according to CTCAE 5.0., 1 month
Relapse is common in Ph- B-ALL and a proportion of patients present refractory to initial treatment. Treatments for these patients consist immunotherapy and conventional chemotherapy. The former is too expensive and the latter has a low remission rate. Treatment for R/R Ph- B-ALL still remains a challenge. The efficacy and safety of cladribine, venetoclax and cytarabine (CAV) has not been explored in ALL. Thus investigators design such a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of CAV regimen for R/R Ph- B-ALL.
