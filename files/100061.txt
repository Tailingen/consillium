Navigant Study- Treatment Patterns in mCRPC (Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer )
Categorize the clinical parameters and patient determinants that drive physician decision making for treatment selection including Radium-223 for patients with mCRPC.
Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant
DRUG: Xofigo (Radium-223 dichloride, BAY88-8223)
Determining factors that drive physician decision for treatment selection., The treating physician should select out of the following options: Prostate Specific Antigen rising, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , Lactate dehydrogenase (LHD), testosterone, pain, symptoms, bone lesions, disease progression., Up to 9 months
Most common treatment sequences, Description of what treatments are given to treat mCRPC in first, second, third, and fourth line., Up to 9 months|Integration of Xofigo into the common treatment sequences, monotherapy or in combination., Describe where is Xofigo given in the treatment paradigm, whether is given in combination with hormonals or chemotherapy or given as a monotherapy, Up to 9 months|Mean Xofigo dose, Mean dose of each treatment received in the respective sequence, Up to 9 months|Duration of Xofigo treatment, Mean number of treatment cycles, Up to 9 months|Overall survival (OS), Collect outcomes for patients following treatment for mCRPC including changes in overall survival, Up to 9 months|Time to radiographic progression, Collect outcomes for patients following treatment for mCRPC including changes in time to radiographic progression, Up to 9 months|Time to PSA (Prostate specific antigen) progression, Collect outcomes for patients following treatment for mCRPC including changes in PSA progression, Up to 9 months|Most common SRE (Skeletal Related Event), The SRE occurring in the highest number of participants will be described., Up to 9 months|Most common clinical intervention, Most common clinical intervention to treat SRE/SSEs such as radiation or bone surgery., Up to 9 months|Time to first SSE(Symptomatic Skeletal Events), Time to first SSE outcome will be analysed using the Kaplan Meier method, Up to 9 months|Reasons for discontinuation, The treating physician should select out of the following options: Prostate Specific Antigen rising, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , Lactate dehydrogenase (LHD)), testosterone, pain, symptoms, bone lesions, disease progression., Up to 9 months|Change in laboratory values from baseline, for hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, Up to 9 months|Radiological progression free survival (rPFS), change in laboratory values from baseline for radiological progression free survival (rPFS), Up to 9 months|Time to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) progression, change in laboratory values from baseline for ALP, Up to 9 months|Time to visceral metastasis, time from baseline to the appearance of visceral metastasis, Up to 9 months|Time to onset of first subsequent treatment, or start of any other treatment for mCRPC, Up to 9 months|Pain, Based on chart reported pain, Up to 9 months|Most common symptoms, The participant and the treating physician should select out of the following list: fatigue, hypertension, cognitive disorder, seizures, edema, hypokalemia, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, Up to 9 months|Type of physician, Define type of physicians that treat of mCRPC, Up to 9 months|Change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks, and baseline to discontinuation, Measure PSA closed to the time of Xofigo initiation, 12 weeks after initiation and after discontinuation, Baseline and 12 weeks,Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Resource utilization, Number of outpatient, inpatient and emergency room visits as well as number of hospitalizations, Up to 9 months|Change in ALP from baseline to 12 weeks, and baseline to discontinuation, Measure ALP closed to the time of Xofigo initiation, 12 weeks after initiation and after discontinuation, Baseline and 12 weeks,Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change in LDH from baseline to 12 weeks, and baseline to discontinuation, Measure LDH values closed to the time of Xofigo initiation, 12 weeks after initiation and after discontinuation, Baseline and 12 weeks,Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a chart review of 200 Xofigo patients to describe sequencing and characterize clinical parameters and patient determinants that drive physician decision making.
