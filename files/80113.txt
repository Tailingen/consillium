Phase 1/2a Study of MPB-1734 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase 1/2a study with dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors (Part 1) and cohorts of up to 15 patients per selected indication (Part 2). The solid tumor types in Part 2 will be decided by the sponsor prior to the start of Part 2, but not be solely based on the efficacy results in Part 1.
Solid Tumor, Unspecified, Adult
DRUG: MPB-1734
Evaluation the the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) by safety data, Number and incidence of (serious) adverse events (AEs) (\[S\]AEs), including rate of mild, moderate, and severe hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, and sensory neuropathy an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first treatment cycle., Through the end of the first cycle (Days 1-21).
Incidence of Treatment-Emergence Adverse Events, Each adverse event will be coded using the Medical Dictionary (version 20.0) system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0)., Approximately 24 weeks|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Evaluation the change of Cmax, Day 1-Day 2|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), Evaluation the change of AUC, Day 1-Day 2|Half-life (T1/2), Evaluation of T1/2, Day 1-Day 2
This study will occur in two parts, Dose-escalation (Part 1) and Cohort-expansion (Part 2). The main purpose of Part 1 is to determine the doses and dosing schedule of MPB-1734 that is safe and tolerable when given in subjects with certain types of advanced cancer. Part 2 of the study will begin when the Sponsor determines the safe and tolerable doses and dosing schedule from Part 1. The main purpose of Part 2 is to continue to assess the safety and tolerability of the MPB-1734 dose and dosing schedule determined by the Sponsor during Part 1. The preliminary efficacy of MPB-1734 will also be assessed in both Part 1 and Part 2.
