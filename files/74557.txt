Statins and prOgression of Coronary atheRosclerosis in melanomA Patients Treated With chEckpoint inhibitorS
This study is a prospective observational study evaluating the natural history of coronary plaque burden in participants with melanoma treated with ICI. The study will be conducted at various sites across Australia.
Melanoma|Atherosclerosis
To determine the natural history of the burden and composition of coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with melanoma treated with ICIs., The change in non-calcified coronary plaque volume will be measured on serial computed tomography coronary angiography scans., 18 months
To determine the prevalence of CV risk factors in individuals with melanoma treated with ICIs., 18 months|To determine the relationship between statin use and the burden, composition and progression of coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with melanoma treated with ICIs., The change in non-calcified coronary plaque volume as measured on serial computed tomography coronary angiography scans will be compared between patients treated with statins and patients not treated with statins in the study., 18 months|To examine the impact of using CTCA to guide preventative therapy with statins in patients with melanoma treated with ICIs., The number of patients who were started on statin therapy by their treating clinicians after undergoing computed tomography coronary angiography in the study will be recorded., 18 months|To evaluate the impact of participation in a cardio-oncology trial on measures of quality of life in patients with melanoma treated with ICIs., Quality of life will be assessed by using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, EORTC QLQ-C30, EuroQOL EQ-5D, and FACT-M questionnaires at baseline and at 18 month follow up. The change in quality of life scores on each questionnaire will be compared with historical cohorts that have previously been reported in the literature., 18 months|To determine the incidence of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in patients with melanoma treated with ICIs., 18 months|To determine progression free survival with regard to the underlying melanoma following treatment with ICIs., 18 months|To determine overall survival in patients with melanoma treated with ICIs., 18 months
