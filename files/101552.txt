Bevacizumab, Erlotinib and 5-Fluorouracil With External Beam Radiation Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is determine the safety of 5-fluorouracil, bevacizumab and erlotinib when administered in combination with external beam radiation therapy(Phase I portion) as well as to begin to collect information about whether this combination treatment is effective in treating(Phase II portion) patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer|Adenocarcinoma of the Rectum
DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: erlotinib|PROCEDURE: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Erlotinib When Administered in Combination With 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Bevacizumab, and External Beam Radiation Therapy, MTD of Erlotinib was determined using a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme of three dose levels (50,100,150mg). Successive cohorts of 3-6 patients were enrolled into dose escalation cohorts for 14 day cycles. MTD reflects the highest dose of Erlotinib that had ≤1 out of 6 patients with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) at the highest dose level below the maximally administered dose. The maximally administered dose is the first dose that causes DLT in \>33% of patients. DLT was defined as: Any grade 4 neutropenia, Any grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or Any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity that results in greater than 7 days interruption in therapy., 3 years
Summary of Grade 3 or Greater Toxicity, Summary of grade 3 or greater toxicity by grade and type. All adverse events were evaluated using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.

Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living.

Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated., 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival, Summary of disease free survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. Disease free survival is the length of time after primary treatment for cancer ends that the participant survives without any clinical signs or symptoms of that cancer. The data is shown of the percentage of participants still in disease free survival at one, two, and three years., 1, 2, 3 years|Post-operative Complications After Resection of Rectal Cancers Following Preoperative 5-FU, Bevacizumab, Erlotinib, and External Beam Radiation Therapy., Surgical morbidity following R0 resection with one of the following procedures: abdominal perineal resection, low anterior resection, and low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis., 3 years
Pathologic Complete Response, The number of subjects who achieved a pathologic complete response as determine by pathologist, following completion of the study therapy. Pathologic complete response represents the absence of residual invasive disease in the rectum and in the regional lymph nodes., 3 years
* All participants will receive the following drugs: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given as a continuous 24-hour infusion; Bevacizumab given intravenously; erlotinib given orally at home. In the Phase I portion, we are looking for the highest dose of erlotinib that can be given safely in combination with the 5-FU, bevacizumab and radiation therapy. Therefore the dose of erlotinib may not be the same for each participant. The dose will increase until we find the highest dose without causing serious or unmanageable side effects.
* Study treatment is given as an outpatient and consists of 14 day cycles with a total of 3 cycles. Patients will be given all three study drugs and radiation therapy on a monday (unless a monday falls on on a holiday). This will be day 1 of the first treatment cycle. 5-FU is given continuously days 1-14. Bevacizumab is given on day 1. Erlotinib will be given on days 1-14. Radiation therapy will be performed on Days 1-5 and 8-12.
* The following tests and procedures will be performed weekly while participants are receiving study treatment: physical examination, measurement of vital signs, height and weight; performance status; blood work, urine sample.
* At the end of treatment the following tests will be performed: physical examination and measurement of vital signs; performance status; blood work; CT scans of chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients will also be evaluated for surgery at this time. Patients will be followed every three months for the first three years after surgery, then every 6 months for the next two years.
