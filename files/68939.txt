A Study to Evaluate the Safety and the Activity of S095029 as Part of Combination Therapy in Advanced Gastroesophageal Junction/Gastric Cancers.
This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of S095029 (anti-NKG2A antibody) in combination with pembrolizumab in in microsatellite instability-high/Defective mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR) locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric /GEJ adenocarcinomas.

This Phase 1b/2 study will be conducted in two parts; a safety lead-in part (Phase 1b) to identify the RP2D of S095029 in combination with pembrolizumab and an expansion part (Phase 2) to evaluate anti-tumor activity and safety in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR gastric /GEJ adenocarcinomas.
