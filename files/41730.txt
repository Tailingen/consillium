Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Preliminary Efficacy of AZD2014
The main purpose of the study is to establish a safe dose of the drug by providing information on any potential side effects this drug may cause and collecting data about how a patient's cancer responds to the drug. The study will also assess the blood levels and action of AZD2014 in the body over a period of time and will indicate whether the drug has an effect on the types of cancer the patients have.
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: AZD2014
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was determined by testing various doses and schedules of AZD2014 in cohorts of 3-6 evaluable patients. MTD reflects the highest dose of drug at each schedule that did not cause a DLT in \>1 patient, Up to 21 days from first multiple dose
