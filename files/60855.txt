Assessement of the Concordance of Genomic Alterations Between Urine and Tissue in High-Risk NMIBC Patients
The analysis of cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) in plasma has emerged as a clinically relevant predictive and prognostic biomarker in several metastatic solid malignancies, and even now represents standard-of-care for prescription of some targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (blood-based T790M companion diagnostic test). cfDNA can be detected not only in plasma but also in urine, even in patients with non-invasive disease. Recent studies found that the detection of genomic alterations in plasma of urothelial bladder carcinoma patients was relatively uninformative in the localized setting. However, urine cfDNA has been shown to provide a promising resource for robust whole-genome tumor profiling in clinically localized Muscle invasive Bladder cancer (MIBC) and Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). Genomic alterations using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel have been recently documented in a series of treatment-naïve high-risk NMIBC.

The investigator's aim is to determine whether liquid biopsies can be used as a new diagnostic assay to guide immunotherapeutic approaches in patients with high-risk NMIBC. The ultimate goal is to develop a "testing decision tree" to segment patients for informing on therapeutic decision and customizing treatment.
