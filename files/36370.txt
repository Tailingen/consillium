Filgrastim With or Without Plerixafor in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Lenalidomide
This clinical trial studies filgrastim (G-CSF) with or without plerixafor in treating patients with multiple myeloma (MM) previously treated with lenalidomide. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and plerixafor helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored
Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: plerixafor|BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim
Ability to Reach Target Collection of 5 x 10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg, In =< 2 days of leukaphereses
Percentage of Patients Achieving Target Goal CD34+ Cells Dose, In =< 5 days of leukaphereses|Compare Hematopoietic Stem Cells/kg Collections Between Different Mobilization Regimens in Those Patients Who Are Crossed Over From One Mobilization Regimen to the Other, Patients will be randomized to receive either G-CSF or Plerixafor with G-CSF. All patients will undergo at least 2 days of leukopheresis. Cells/kg between these 2 arms will be compared. For those patients that do not reach the target goal will undergo a wash-out period and cross over to the other study arm., By day 1|Compare Days of Apheresis Between Mobilization Groups, Using the Wilcoxon Rand Sum Test, Day 1|Compare Need for Hospitalization During Mobilization Between Mobilization Groups, Day 1|Compare Need for Remobilization Between Mobilization Groups, Using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate., Day 1
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Ability to reach target collection of 5 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/Kg with =\< 2 days of leukaphereses using one of two mobilization regimens.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Percentage of patients achieving target goal CD34+ cell dose (as above) in =\< 5 days of leukaphereses.

II. Compare collections between different mobilization regimens in those patients who are crossed over from one mobilization regimen to the other.

III. Compare days of apheresis, need for hospitalization during mobilization, and need for remobilization between mobilizing groups.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-8.

ARM II: Patients receive G-CSF SC QD on days 1-7 and plerixafor SC QD on days 4-7.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.
