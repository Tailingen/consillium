Evaluate Esophageal Reinforcement With ACell MatriStem Surgical Matrix: A Degradable Biologic Scaffold Material
The purpose of this study is to see if implanting MatriStem will lower the risk of one of the more common complications after stomach or esophagus surgery.
Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: MatriStem PSM
Number of Participants With Anastomotic Leak., Anastomotic leak will be assessed by clinical observation and one postoperative contrast study (thin-barium Gastrografin or Omnipaque swallow), up to 10 days
Stricture Formation Clinically and by Determination of Dysphagia Score, Patients will be evaluated in the outpatient clinic and will be assigned a dysphagia score from 0-4 by the RSA. Patients reporting symptoms consistent with stricture will be evaluated with radiographic contrast swallow study or endoscopy., 90 days postoperatively|Number of Participants Who Developed Anastomotic Stenosis, If during the follow up period, patients report any symptoms suggestive of anastomotic stricture, a contrast study (esophagram) or endoscopy will be obtained at that time to evaluate for stricture. These tests will be performed as per standard postoperative assessment by the surgeon., 90 days post op
