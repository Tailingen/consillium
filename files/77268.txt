Oral VT-464 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Enzalutamide, Androgen Receptor Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients, and Men With ER Positive Breast Cancer
The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety and efficacy of VT-464, a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have been previously treated with Enzalutamide, Androgen Receptor Positive Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients, and Men with ER positive Breast Cancer.

The change in PSA from baseline using waterfall plots in response to 12-weeks of treatment with VT-464, To determine the PSA response as defined by a â‰¥ 50% decrease in serum PSA per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria after each cycle and after 12 weeks of dosing with VT-464 compared to PSA level at baseline in patients who have been previously treated with enzalutamide., 12 weeks|Progression-free survival using Kaplan-Meier curves, Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival (PFS) will be constructed in each cohort and the median PFS will be determined and informally compared to any available results., 8 months|Determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) as defined by complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) in women with androgen receptor (AR) positive, triple-negative breast cancer, Clinical benefit rate will be measured at designated timepoints as listed per protocol, 16 weeks|Determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) as defined by complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) in women with androgen receptor (AR) positive, triple-negative breast cancer, Clinical benefit rate will be measured at designated timepoints as listed per protocol, 24 weeks
Overall survival using Kaplan-Meier curves, Overall Survival: will be analyzed similarly to PFS, with a separate Kaplan-Meier curve for each arm. A patient for whom there is no death event will be censored; the censored date will be the date of last contact., 32 months|The safety and tolerability of VT-464 by evaluating adverse events, vital signs, physical examination findings, concomitant medications and laboratory tests., The safety of VT-464 will be evaluated by laboratory evaluation, electrocardiogram, the report of adverse events and concomitant medications at each 28-day cycle of treatment and 4-5 weeks after therapy has been discontinued., 8 months|Maximum PSA response compared to baseline, Maximum PSA response will be descriptive in nature and presented for each cohort as a percent of patients and as a waterfall plot., 8 months
This is a Phase 2 open-label study of VT-464 in patients with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been previously treated with enzalutamide, female patients with triple negative, AR positive breast cancer and men with ER positive breast cancer. The study consists of five cohorts: patients in Cohort 1 must have never received prior chemotherapy. Patients in Cohort 2 must have received at least one (and not more) prior course of chemotherapy for CRPC. Women with TNBC will be stratified into two cohorts AR 1 to 9% (cohort 3) and AR \> 10% (cohort 4). Cohort 5 will consist of men who have been diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer and have failed at least one prior endocrine therapy.
