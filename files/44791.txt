Sunitinib Malate in Refractory Germ Cell Tumors
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if SutentÂ® (sunitinib malate, SU011248) can control the disease in patients with germ cell tumors that are resistant to earlier treatment.
Genitourinary Disease
DRUG: Sunitinib Malate
12 Week Progression Free Survival Rate in Refractory Germ Cell Tumors Treated With Sunitinib Malate, Measurable disease or response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Participants who die during therapy or are lost to follow-up shall be counted as progressive disease. Progressive disease defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Evaluation of measurable disease response follows Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines., 12 weeks
The Study Drug:

Sunitinib malate is designed to block pathways that control important events such as the growth of blood vessels that are essential for the growth of cancer.

Within 14 days of enrollment on this study, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:

* Your complete medical history will be recorded.
* You will have a physical exam.

Within 7 days of enrollment on this study, you will have the following tests and procedures performed:

-Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine testing and to test for certain biomarkers (to check the status of the disease).

Study Drug Administration:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take sunitinib malate capsules once a day (by mouth) for 4 weeks in a row followed by 2 weeks with no study drug. These 6 weeks are considered 1 cycle of study treatment.

Study Visits:

On Day 1 of each cycle (about every 6 weeks), you will have the following tests done before you take the study drug:

* You will have a physical exam.
* You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you have experienced since your last visit.
* You will have blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine tests and to test for certain biomarkers.

For the first 4 weeks of treatment, you should have your blood pressure monitored. This may be done at your home with a digital pressure device, or you may visit your local doctor for this testing.

About Day 21 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2- 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This may be done at your local doctor's office and results faxed to the study doctor.

On Day 1 of Cycle 2, Day 1 of Cycle 3, and then Day 1 of every 2 cycles after that (Cycle 5, Cycle 7, and so on), you will have imaging scans to check status of the disease. This could include CT or MRI scans, an ECG, and a chest x-ray. If your doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have additional imaging scans at any time.

On Day 1 of every other cycle (Cycle 3, Cycle 5, and so on), you will have an echocardiogram or MUGA scan.

Length of Study:

You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or if the disease gets worse. However, if the disease gets worse very quickly during Cycles 1 or 2, you will be taken off study at that time.

Off-Study Visit:

When you are taken off of treatment on this study, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam.
* You will be asked how you are feeling and about any changes in your medical history since beginning this study.
* You will also be asked about any side effects you have experienced since your last visit.

This is an investigational study. Sunitinib malate is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with kidney cancer. Its use in patients with germ cell tumors is investigational. Up to 42 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
