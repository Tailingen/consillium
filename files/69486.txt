Lenvatinib Plus PD-1 Antibody vs TACE for Intermediate-stage HCC Beyond Up-to-seven Criteria
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib combined with PD-1 antibody compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond up-to-seven criteria

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B especially for those with tumor beyond up-to-seven criteria. Recently, Lenvatinib was proved non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus PD-1 antibody in intermediate-stage HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of lenvatinib combined with PD-1 antibody over TACE.
