Patupilone Versus Doxorubicin in Patients With Ovarian, Primary Fallopian, or Peritoneal Cancer
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of patupilone compared to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Additionally, this study will assess the ability of patupilone to extend the survival time and potential beneficial effects in women who have nonresponsive or recurrent ovarian, primary fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Neoplasms
DRUG: EPO906 (Patupilone)|DRUG: doxorubicin
To show superiority of patupilone in overall survival compared to doxorubicin in taxane/platinum resistant patients with ovarian cancer, every 8 weeks
To determine the duration of overall response in patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), End of study|To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with patupilone, end of study|To determine the time to disease progression (TTP) of patients treated with patupilone, end of study|To determine overall best tumor response (CR, PR, SD, PD and Unknown), end of study|To investigate the safety and tolerability of patupilone, end of study|To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of patupilone from all patients, end of study|To explore relationships between Cmin (pre-dose patupilone blood concentration) and efficacy/adverse events, end of study
