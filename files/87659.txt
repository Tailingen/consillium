Radical Surgery Followed by Immunotherapy Using Precision T Cells Specific to Multiple Common Tumor-Associated Antigen for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Objectives:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radical surgery combined with dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells in reducing the recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer

Methods:

This study designs a novel therapy using dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells. 60 postoperative patients of hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled. They are randomly divided into postoperative routine therapy group and dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells combined with postoperative routine therapy group. Dendritic cell-precision multiple antigen T cells treatments will be performed every 3 weeks with a total of three periods. The mail clinical indicators are Progression-Free-Survival and Overall Survival.
Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: Postoperative routine treatment|BIOLOGICAL: DC-PMAT treatment
Progress-free survival, 2 years
Overall survival, 2 years|Quality of life, Quality of life core questionnaire will be used., 2 years
A total of 60 patients may be enrolled over a period of 1-2 years.
