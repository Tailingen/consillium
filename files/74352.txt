2D-radiotherapy in Palliation of Advanced Esophageal Cancer
The study wants to define the efficacy of a short course 2D-radiation therapy in patients with symptomatic advanced esophageal cancer.
Palliative Care
RADIATION: Short course radiotherapy
Assessment of symptoms [odynophagia, chest-back pain, dysphagia, regurgitation], Symptoms were graded using the IAEA scoring system. Values range from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (severe symptom)., 1 year
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Acute radiation toxicity], Acute toxicity after treatment is evaluated with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale. Values range from 0 (no acute toxicity) to 4 (maximum acute toxicity)., 1 year|Assessment of the Performance Status, Performance Status after the treatment is evaluated according with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score. Values range from 0 (better status) to 5 (worst status)., 1 year|Assessment of the Overall Survival, Overall Survival is evaluated from the end of radiotherapy to the last date of follow-up. It is calculated in months., 1 year
The study wants to define the efficacy of a short course accelerated 2D-radiation therapy delivered in twice daily fractions and 2 consecutive days for symptomatic palliation of advanced esophageal cancer.
