Apatinib for Advanced Lung Squmamous Carcinoma
In order to search for effective and low toxicity anti-tumor angiogenesis drugs, jiangsu hengrui pharmaceutical co., ltd. developed the high-efficiency VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor apatinib. This drug is mainly used to treat malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR2 to play an anti-angiogenic role. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that apatinib has good tumor growth inhibition activity for lung cancer. This study aims to further confirm the effectiveness and safety of apatinib third-line treatment for patients with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.
