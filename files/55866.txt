Blood Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and From Healthy Volunteers
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer and from healthy volunteers.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Mass Spectrometry
Levels of cathepsin D, Measure plasma CD levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and non-smoker healthy controls using mass spectrometry., At Routine Follow-Up
Levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), Measure FAS levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and non-smoker healthy controls using mass spectrometry., At Routine Follow-Up|Global microRNA expression, Measure global microRNA expression by microarray analysis using Illumina probes., At Routine Follow-Up
OBJECTIVES:

* Measure plasma cathepsin D levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and in healthy volunteers using mass spectometry.
* Measure fatty acid synthase levels in these patients and healthy volunteers using mass spectometry.

OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients and healthy volunteers to measure the levels of cathepsin D and fatty acid synthase by proteomic profiling and mass spectrometry.
