4-valent HPV Vaccine to Treat Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis in Children
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in children caused by HPV 6,11 can be a life threatening condition resulting in surgical interventions. The maturing and disintegrating papillomas are the sources for the subsequent HPV relapses and immunization might slow down or even prevent this ongoing process.

After an initial immunological and ear-nose-throat (ENT) assessment children with at least 3 relapses in their patient history will be vaccinated with 4-valent HPV vaccine according to the following schedule: 0., 2., 6. months. It will be followed by an immunological and 3 ENT examinations to assess response to vaccination.
