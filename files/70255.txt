Everolimus (RAD001) and Carboplatin in Pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, mono-center phase I/II study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of RAD001 in combination with carboplatin in taxane- and anthracycline-pretreated patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, the study is designed to characterize the safety, the tolerability and efficacy of this study.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: RAD001 (Everolimus) in combination with carboplatin|DRUG: RAD001 (Everolimus) in combination with carboplatin
Phase I: dose limiting toxicity, after three weeks|Phase II: response rate, every six weeks
Phase I: adverse events, after three weeks
During the phase I part the study will include at least 3 patients at each dose-level until MTD is reached. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. Once MTD is reached a total of 6 patients will be treated at MTD (phase I). For the phase II the minimax two-stage design will be applied. After testing the drug on 16 patients in the first stage of phase II, the trial will be terminated if 1 or fewer respond (SD, PR, CR). If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 34 patients will be studied during the phase II part.
