Effect of Immune Formula in Gastrointestinal Cancer Patients Undergoing Cancer Surgery
Malnutrition is a common feature in cancer patients and associated with worse outcomes especially increased risk of postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery.

The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recommends preoperative oral/enteral immunonutrition support to decrease risk of postoperative complications. However, the evidence comparing between immune formula and standard formula is still controversial. Numerous studies have indicated that curcumin is beneficial to the immune system. This study aimed to assess the effect of an immune formula which contains curcumin versus standard formula for malnourished gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing cancer surgery.

A randomized controlled trial will be conducted on 40 malnourished gastrointestinal cancer patients who plan to undergo major cancer surgery. Patients in the intervention group will receive 2 sachets of immune formula per day (355.5 kcal and curcumin 25 mg per sachet) for 10-14 days and dietary counseling. Participants in the control group will receive 2 sachets of isocaloric standard formula per day for 10-14 days and dietary counseling. Anthropometry and biochemical parameters were measured in 3 periods (before intervention, two weeks after intervention in preoperative, and post-operative period). Postoperative complications were recorded until patient discharge from hospital for 30 days.

Malnutrition is a common feature in cancer patients and associated with worse outcomes especially increased risk of postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery.

The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recommends preoperative oral/enteral immunonutrition support to decrease risk of postoperative complications especially in malnourished patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Numerous studies have indicated that curcumin is beneficial to the immune system. This study aimed to assess the effect of an immune formula which contains curcumin versus standard formula for malnourished gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing cancer surgery.

A randomized controlled trial will be conducted on 40 malnourished gastrointestinal cancer patients who plan to undergo major cancer surgery. Patients in the intervention group will receive 2 sachets of immune formula per day (355.5 kcal and curcumin 25 mg per sachet) for 10-14 days and dietary counseling. Participants in the control group will receive 2 sachets of isocaloric standard formula per day for 10-14 days and dietary counseling.

Body mass index (BMI), body composition, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), hand grip strength, food intake, pre-albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are measured at the day before and the day after having all of oral nutrition supplements. Parameters are re-measured within 5-7 days after operation along with fasting blood sugar, insulin and HOMAR-IR. Postoperative complications are assessed with Clavien-Dindo classification on the last day in the hospital. Re-admit rates are recorded until 30 days after discharge.
