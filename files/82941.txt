Pilot Study Evaluating the Use of Simultaneous HBV, HCV, and HIV Rapid Tests
This is a pilot, monocentric, prospective, randomized control trial looking at the use of rapid tests as a part of normal care. The investigators will be testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Testing will be proposed to all persons seeking care at the Centre d'Accueil, de Soins et d'Orientation from the organization Médecin du Monde (CASO, MDM).

Infection status of participants will be determined by either the standard test (ELISA) or rapid test. The choice between tests will be determined randomly.

The overall goal is to determine the general acceptability and feasibility of rapid tests and to see if they can help individuals increase their awareness of infection status when compared to longer, routine methods of testing. In addition, results from these tests will allow the medical doctor to guide participants to appropriate care. All positive tests will be confirmed at a specialized hospital (Hôptial Saint-Antoine, Paris, France) and health-specific information will be obtained four months after testing.

Accessibility of Testing Results, The number of individuals who obtained test results for HBV, HCV, and/or HIV divided by the total number of tested individuals., Evaluated once, up to 4 months after testing
Access to Care, The number of individuals seeking specialized care with a complete evaluation of disease severity divided by the total number of seropositive individuals., Evaluated once, up to 4 months after testing
Proportion Participating, The number of individuals accepting to participate in the study divided by the total number of individuals proposed., At testing|Proportion of Rapid Test Failures, The number of rapid tests giving inconclusive results divided by the total number of rapid tests (only available in the rapid test arm)., At testing
