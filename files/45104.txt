A Dose Escalation Study of Radio-labeled Antibody for the Treatment of Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability in subjects who receive FF-21101(111In) for dosimetry and FF-21101(90Y) for treatment of advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: FF21101
Safety and tolerability of radio-labeled FF21101, measured by number of patients with adverse events leading to discontinuation or number of patients with dose limiting toxicity, 28 days
Number of patients achieving overall response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1), Overall response rates are defined as the number of patients achieving a best response of complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], or progressive disease \[PD\]), 8 weeks
Number of patients expressing CDH3 (human cadherin 3/P-cadherin) as a predictor of clinical activity, measurement of CDH3 expression, Single sample taken at enrollment
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability in subjects who receive FF-21101(111In) for dosimetry and FF-21101(90Y) for treatment of advanced solid tumors. This is an open label study that will recruit approx 70 patients
