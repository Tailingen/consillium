Comparison of Yttrium-90 Absorbed Doses Using PET/CT Versus PET/MR Imaging for Hepatic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to compare the results of positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) to positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) to help determine any added advantage of one over the other in relation to a tumor which might assist in further management plans.
Hepatic Malignancies
DEVICE: PET/CT|DEVICE: PET/MR|RADIATION: SIRT with Y-90
Reproducibility Coefficient (RDC) Between the Two Imaging Modalities in Liver Tumor Tissues, RDC between the two imaging modalities for post-Y-90 Radioembolization (RE) absorbed doses (Gy) in the liver tumor tissues The RDC is the minimum difference between the two measurements that can be considered a true difference, with 95% confidence., Post-op day 0, 1 hour apart
RDC Between the Two Imaging Modalities in Background Liver Tissues, RDC between the two imaging modalities for post-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the background liver tissues

The RDC is the minimum difference between the two measurements that can be considered a true difference, with 95% confidence., Post-op day 0, 1 hour apart
Participants in this study will undergo PET/CT (standard imaging) and PET/MR (additional imaging), within 6 hours after SIRT with Y-90 for palliative treatment of the liver malignancy. Patients will be randomized to receive either of the imaging modalities first, based on the availability of the imaging device, and less than 1 hour apart. Upon acquirement and construction of PET/CT and PET/MR images, a software (MIM SurePlan LiverY90) would be utilized for semi-automatic determination of the liver/tumor contours and calculation of the Y-90 absorbed doses (Gy) in the regions of interest (including within tumor and background liver outlines) using the Local Deposition Method.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the agreement between post-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the liver tumor tissues based on PET/CT versus PET/MR imaging. This would permit the comparison of Y-90 tumor absorbed doses, acquired from PET/MR, with the current standard of care PET/CT imaging to verify the data consistency and to validate its application for the prediction of tumor response to treatment.

The secondary objective of this study is to assess the agreement between post-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the background liver tissues (surrounding tumors), based on PET/CT versus PET/MR imaging. This would permit the comparison of Y-90 background liver absorbed doses, acquired from PET/MR, with the current standard of care PET/CT imaging to verify the data consistency and to validate its application for the prediction of dose toxicity.
