A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Luspatercept (ACE-536) Versus Epoetin Alfa for the Treatment of Anemia Due to IPSS-R Very Low, Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) Participants Who Require Red Blood Cell Transfusions and Are ESA Naïve
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of luspatercept (ACE-536) compared to epoetin alfa on red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (for at least 12 weeks) with a concurrent hemoglobin increase of at least 1.5 g/dL in participants with anemia due to revised international prognostic scoring system (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who require RBC transfusions and have never been exposed to erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA).

A participant is counted as 'Treatment-Emergent' if there is a positive post-baseline sample while the baseline sample is ADA negative, or there is a positive post-baseline sample with a titer \>= 4-fold of the baseline titer while the baseline sample is ADA positive. A participant is counted as 'Preexisting' if the baseline sample is ADA positive and the participant is not qualified for 'Treatment-Emergent'. If the participant was discontinued from study treatment earlier than one year from the first dose, additional samples will be collected if last ADA is positive.

Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug., Day 1 on week 4, 10, 16, 22, and every 12 weeks (±14 days) from the 24-Week MDS Assessment visit for up to one year from the first dose|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of 30 items that includes a global health status score ranging from: 1-7 as well as scores for 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain) and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) all ranging from 1-4. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A high score for a functional scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status/health related quality of life (HRQoL) represents a high overall HRQoL; but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug., Baseline and week 24.|Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia Version 4 (FACT-An), The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire includes 47 items rating on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) (so that 0 is considered worse quality of life and 4 is good response) on five primary subscales:

* Physical well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Social/Family well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Emotional well-being (sum of 6 items, score range from 0-24)
* Functional well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Anemia-related symptoms (sum of 20 items, score range from 0-80)

A total score for the FACT-An can be calculated by summing the five primary subscales with a score range from 0-188. Higher scores representing better quality of life.
