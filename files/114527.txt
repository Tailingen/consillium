Minus Anthracycline or Short-Term Versus Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Followed by Paclitaxel Regimen for Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy
We aimed to evaluate the noninferiority of short-term anthracycline-free chemotherapy (TC, six cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide) or short-term anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CEF-T, three cycles of cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/fluorouracil followed by three cycles of docetaxel) to a standard anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy (EC-P, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide for four cycles followed by paclitaxel for twelve weeks) in HER2-negative operable breast cancer.
Primary Breast Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide Fluorouracil Epirubicin Docetaxel|DRUG: Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide Paclitaxel
Disease-Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to occurrence of a new event including local recurrence, regional relapse, distant metastasis, contralateral primary breast cancer, second non-breast invasive cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers), or death from any cause., 5 years
Distant Disease-Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to the earliest recurrence outside of the ipsilateral locoregional region or to death from any cause, whenever a death occurred before distant recurrence, 5 years|Overall Survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, 5 years|Adverse Events, Number of Participants with Adverse Events, through chemotherapy completion, an average of 6 months
It was initiated as an adjuvant chemotherapy trial to test noninferiority of an anthracycline-free short-term regimen (T75C600 x 6 \[TC\] once every 3 weeks) or a short-term regimen (C500E100F500 x 3 once every 3 weeks followed by T100 x 3 every 3 weeks \[CEF-T\]) compared with a standard long-term anthracycline-containing regimen (E90C600 x 4 once every 3 weeks followed by P80 x 12 once every week \[EC-P\]) in HER2-negative breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to each arm after completing the surgical excision of the primary tumor.
