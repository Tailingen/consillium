PD-1 Inhibitors With or Without Radiation in Advanced Melanoma
This trial was a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled phase II trial. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors with or without radiotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. At the same time, tissue and peripheral blood samples of patients were collected for the determination of PD-L1 expression, ctDNA and other biomarkers and results analysis to find prognostic or curative effect predictors. A total of 92 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study.

Patients with advanced melanoma who met the inclusion criteria but did not meet the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and received PD-1 inhibitors with or without radiotherapy.
