TTT Versus TTT and Triamcinolone to Decrease Exudation in Choroidal Melanoma After Proton Beam Therapy
Proton beam therapy is a safe irradiation modality for choroidal melanoma. But often after irradiation the exudation increases resulting in an exudative retinal detachment requiring vitreoretinal surgery. It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is capable to decrease the exudation. If there is any advantage in a combined treatment this study will investigate.
Exudative Retinal Detachment|Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: Triamcinolone Acetonide|PROCEDURE: Transpupillary thermotherapy
Decrease of exudation, as indicated by compairing the extent of exudation measured in quadrants in color fundus photographs, autofluorescence imaging, and/or optical coherence tomogaphy., 6 weeks, 6 months
Toxic tumor syndrone and required secondary vitrectomy, If tumor relaxed lipid exudates or a neovascular glaucoma develop a secondary vitrectomy will be required to preserve the globe., 3 years
Proton beam therapy is an eye preserving irradiation modality for uveal melanoma. After proton beam therapy tumor related lipid exudation and exudative retinal detachment often increase. Therefore vitreoretinal surgery is sometimes required to reattach the retina to protect visual acuity. It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is capable to decrease exudation. If there is any advantage in a combined treatment and if it is that effective to possibly avoid vitreoretinal surgery this study will investigate.
