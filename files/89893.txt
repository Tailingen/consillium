Systemic Treatment Alone Versus Systemic Treatment Plus Radiotherapy in Oligometastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate whether incorporating locoregional radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma, including inductive oligometastases, along with standard systemic therapy, contributes to improved progression-free survival rates for patients.

Various institutions are attempting to use locoregional radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma, accompanied by a few metastases. Research findings have indicated that high-dose locoregional radiotherapy can suppress disease progression, potentially prolonging the interval for additional systemic therapy; however, whether the addition of locoregional radiotherapy in cases of renal cell carcinoma with oligometastases demonstrates superior oncologic outcome compared to standard systemic therapy alone has yet to be established. Therefore, a randomized phase III study is being conducted to evaluate whether incorporating locoregional radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma, including inductive oligometastases, along with standard systemic therapy, contributes to improved progression-free survival rates for patients.
