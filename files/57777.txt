Safety and Feasibility Study of Enhanced Recovery in Pancreaticoduodenectomy
The purpose of this study is to assess the adherence to an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway and the impact of the ERAS protocol on postoperative short-term outcome in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).
Pancreatic Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced recovery after surgery protocol|PROCEDURE: Standard perioperative care|DRUG: PONV prophylaxis with Ondansetron + Dexamethasone|OTHER: Postoperative mobilization program|DRUG: Epidural analgesia with naropin + sufentanil|DRUG: Pre-anesthetic medication with diazepam|BEHAVIORAL: Preadmission counselling|DRUG: Preoperative bowel preparation with sodium phosphate
Adherence to the pathway, Adherence to single items of the pathway., Participants will be followed from two weeks before surgery, for the duration of hospital stay, and for 30 days after discharge, an expected average of 8 weeks.
Postoperative outcome, Comparison of postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission., The outcomes will be assessed for the duration of hospital stay and for 30 days after discharge
A specific enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol has been applied since October 2010 in consecutive patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a high volume Institution. Patient compliance for each item has been assessed. Each ERAS patient was matched with a patient who received standard perioperative care. Match criteria were age, gender, malignant / benign disease, and PD prognostic score.
