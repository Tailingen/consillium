Sorafenib in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer
Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: sorafenib tosylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Overall response rate (confirmed CR, R and PR), Up to 3 years|Incidence of qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen, Up to 3 years|Overall survival, Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, From date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the overall response rate (confirmed CR, R and PR) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated with BAY 43-9006.

II. To evaluate qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

III. To assess overall and progression-free survival in this group of patients treated with this regimen.

IV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, associations between gene expression signatures and response.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
