A Phase I/II Open-Label Study of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF Administered to Unresectable Stage IIIC and Stage IV Melanoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to test the combination of Ipilimumab and GM-CSF. Both ipilimumab and GM-CSF are intended to work with the body's own immune system to attack melanoma cells in the body. This study will also demostrate how safe the combined drugs are when used to treat patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 melanoma (metastatic melanoma), which cannot be removed by surgery.
