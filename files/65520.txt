Clinical and Basic Study for Pediatric Liver Transplantation
Background: In mainland China, the development of pediatric liver transplantation (LT) has lagged behind that of adult LT during the past two decades, but it has been progressing immensely in recent years. Renji hospital(shanghai) is currently the largest pediatric transplant center in mainland China.

Aim and method: This study is performed for establishment of key techniques for pediatric LT in mainland China, including the indications and timing for pediatric LT, the criteria for donor selections, living donor LT planning, prevention and treatment for posttransplant complications, long-term follow-up management et al.
