Docetaxel and Ifosfamide in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel and ifosfamide in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: ifosfamide
Response rate
Time to treatment failure|Duration of response|Survival|Toxicity as assessed by CTC version 2.0|Quality of life as assessed by Schipper's Functional Living Index - Cancer
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of docetaxel and ifosfamide as first-line chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.
* Determine the response rate and duration of response of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the time to treatment failure and survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour (beginning 1 hour after docetaxel infusion) on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every month during study, and then every 3 months after completion of study.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
