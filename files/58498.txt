Efficacy of MR-HIFU Ablation of Breast Cancer
This study evaluates the efficacy of MR-HIFU ablation of breast cancer. Ten patients with early-stage breast cancer with a maximum diameter of 3 cm will undergo MR-HIFU ablation, followed by MRI and surgical resection to evaluate treatment effect. The main purpose of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of total tumor ablation with MR-HIFU. The secondary objective is safety assessment.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU Breast Tumor Therapy System
Amount of ablated tissue at histopathological examination, The amount of ablated tissue and residual viable tumor tissue will be assessed in all tumor slices., 2-3 weeks (after surgery is performed)|Presence of non-perfused volumes on DCE-MRI, Efficacy will be assessed by the presence of non-perfused volumes on DCE-MRI. A pre-treatment MRI is used as comparison., 1 week after MR-HIFU ablation
Number of patients with adverse events, Adverse events will be documented. The (possible) relationship with MR-HIFU ablation will be asessed in all cases., Approximately 2 to 3 weeks
