Dovitinib for Gastric Cancer With FGFR2 Amplification: GASDOVI-1
This is a single-center, prospective, single-arm, open-label phase II study
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Dovitinib
response rate, To evaluate with abdominal and pelvic dynamic CT scan every 6 weeks using RECIST version 1.1, 1year|Progression-free survival, To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) with TKI258(Dovitinib) administered orally at 500 mg/day on a 5 days on/2 days off dosing schedule to adult patients \> 18 years with evaluable metastatic or unresectable gastric cancer harboring FGFR2 amplification (copy number \> 3, identified by real time PCR using TaqMan probe) who failed one or two lines of chemotherapy in palliative setting., From date of enrollment to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
Number of Adverse Events, Monitoring for safety and toxicity will be performed every cycle (3 weeks) of chemotherapy and whenever patients have problems., 1year|Evaluation of Efficacy, To correlate concentrations of circulating growth factors, soluble receptors with efficacy (response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival) of TKI258 at 500 mg/day on a 5 days on/2 days off dosing schedule., From date of randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years|FGFR2 copy number, To compare FGFR2 copy number determined by FISH(fluorescence in situ hybridization) with FGFR2 copy number identified by real time PCR using TaqMan Probe., 1year
In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TKI258(Dovitinib) monotherapy as a salvage chemotherapy after failure of standard first or second-line chemotherapy in metastatic or unresectable gastric cancer harboring FGFR2 amplification.
