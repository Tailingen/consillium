CD7 CAR-T in the Treatment of CD7 Positive Refractory Relapsed Acute Leukemia
Patients with acute leukemia derived from T lymphocytes have the characteristics of high expression of CD7 antigen, such as acute T lymphocyte leukemia (T-ALL).CAR-T therapy is to genetically modify the patient's T lymphocytes to target and eliminate tumor cells in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. CAR-T cells are costimulatory molecules that include single-chain antibodies (scFv) that recognize tumor-specific antigens, hinge regions, transmembrane regions, intracellular signaling regions (immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif ITAM), and intracellular signaling regions. The chimeric antigen receptor of CD28 or CD137(4-1BB) conduction domain is expressed in a lentiviral vector, and the vector is transfected into autologous T cells, so that the modified CAR-T cells have targeting and specificity Recognizes and kills cancer cells expressing tumor antigens, and can proliferate and activate in vivo, but has no effect on cells that do not express the antigen
