AssesSment of Early-deteCtion basEd oN liquiD Biopsy in PANCEATIC Cancer (ASCEND-PANCREATIC)
ASCEND-PANCREATIC is a prospective, multi-omics, observational study aimed at early detecting pancreatic cancer by combined assays for biomarkers of cfDNA methylation, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation, serum protein markers and blood miRNA markers, in which of 7,062 participants will be enrolled. The development and validation of the model will be conducted in participants with early stage cancers or benign diseases, along with healthy individuals. The performance of the pancreatic cancer detection test will be evaluated in participants with high risk of pancreatic cancer.
