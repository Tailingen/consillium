Circulating Melanoma Cells in Metastatic Patients Treated With Selective BRAF Inhibitors
The purpose of this study, is to evaluate Circulating Melanoma Cell (CMC) changes in Metastatic Melanoma (MM) patients, undergoing treatment with selective inhibitors of mutated BRAF.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Anti-B-RAF
Change of CMC count during treatment and comparison with CT and PET, 24 months
This is an observational prospective pilot study aimed to investigate the association between changes of total and apoptotic CMC count and disease progression in MM patients undergoing treatment with selective inhibitors of mutated B-RAF.
