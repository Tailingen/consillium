Effects of ECA on Quality of Life in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Suffering From Cetuximab-induced Rhagades
The SUPPORT trial is an open-label, prospective, randomized, national multicenter intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate versus the standard treatment of each institution on the pain intensity and QoL in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy.
Pain
DEVICE: ECA|OTHER: Standard topical treatment of the institution, e.g. Lotio
pain intensity 24 hours after application of ECA or the standard treatment quantified by the visual analogue scale (VAS), pain intensity quantified by the visual analogue scale (VAS), 24 hours after application
Evaluation of QoL, Evaluation of QoL assessed by the EORTC-QoL-C30 questionnaire and the Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI), 5 to 7 days after application of treatment
SUPO-Score for classification of cetuximab-induced rhagades, SUPO-Score for classification of cetuximab-induced rhagades:

Grade 1: Rhagades without clinical symptoms

Grade 2: Painful rhagades Grade 2a: Moderate pain, no impairment of activity in the daily routine (ADL) Grade 2b: Severe pain and impairment of the activities of daily living (ADL) Grade 3: Painful, deep and spontaneously bleeding rhagades

Grade 4: Superinfection of the rhagades (detection of bacterial growth) Grade 4a: Local infection Grade 4b: Systemic infection

Grade 5: Death due to complications of the rhagades, 24 hours and 5 to 7 days after application of treatment|Adverse Events of ECA, Adverse Events of ECA due to NCI CTCAE v. 4.02, from time of randomization untio end of study, i.e. until 5 to 7 days after application of treatment
