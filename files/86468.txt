Phase 1 Study of SGI-110 in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SGI-110 when administered subcutaneously to Japanese patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: SGI-110
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) occurring during Course 1 for which there was a reasonable probability or possibility of a causal relationship with the IMP. The severity of AEs was graded in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

* Nonhematologic toxicity of Grade ≥3, except for (i) nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea of Grade 3 that is controllable by optimal therapy, and (ii) Grade 3 laboratory findings other than serum creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase.
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that was not present at trial entry and that is not resolved within 7 days
* Grade 4 neutropenia that was not present at trial entry and that is not resolved within 7 days
* Febrile neutropenia (defined as a neutrophil count of \<500/μL accompanied by a fever of ≥38°C)
* Any AE that results in a delay of \>4 weeks in starting the next treatment course, 28 days (Day 1 to Day 29)
