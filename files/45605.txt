A Phase I/II Study of AST-3424 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
An open-label, Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of AST-3424 administered as a single agent
Advanced Solid Tumors|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: AST-3424
Incidence and severity of adverse events(AEs), Adverse events will be noted and graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or severity (if not covered by CTCAE), measure begins from informed consent to 30 days after last dose of study drug.|Safety changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), Resting 12-lead ECGs will be obtained from all subjects' pre-AST-3424 infusion and within 30 minutes post-AST-3424 infusion in order to assess any impact AST-3424 may have on the QT interval as assessed by the Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF)., Day 1 Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Safety Changes of body weight, If during treatment a participant's body weight changes by \>10%, the dose should be adjusted., Day 1 of each cycle (there are 34 cycles; 21 days for each cycle)|Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in phase I, Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Throughout Cycle 1 (21 days for each cycle) in phase I (dose escalation phase).|Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in phase I, Determination of the MTD, based on the frequently of DLTs observed in Cycle 1 in participants enrolled to the Dose Escalation Phase., Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle (all 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax of AST-3424 and AST-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Maximum peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax of AST-3424 and AST-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - The magnitude of the slope of the linear regression of the log concentration vs. time profile during the terminal phase (Kel), Kel of AST-3424 and AST-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Half-life (T1/2), T1/2 computed as ln (2)/Kel of AST-3424 and AST-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Area under the concentration-time curve (AUClast), AUClast from Hour 0 through the last quantifiable concentration time (LQCT), where LQCT is the time at which the last sample with a quantifiable concentration was drawn, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1(first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|Objective response rate(ORR), Approximately 36 months|Disease control rate(DCR), Approximately 36 months|Duration of response (DOR), Approximately 36 months|Progress free survival (PFS), Approximately 36 months
This is an open-label phase I/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD/RP2D, pharmacokinetics, preliminary efficacy, and the relationship between AKR1C3 expression and efficacy of AST-3424 monotherapy in advanced solid tumors.

The study is divided into phase I and Phase II. The maximum tolerated dose will be explored in phase I. In phase II, participants will be treated with AST-3424 according to the Phase I confirmed dose. Phase II clinical study will first be conducted in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
