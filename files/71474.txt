A Study to Test Lung Function After Radiation Therapy
It is known that radiation damages lung tissue. New human studies at University of Iowa show that the radiation damage is not as expected. The purpose of this study is to document lung function using four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and quantify changes three months after radiation therapy for malignant lung disease.
