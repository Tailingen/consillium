A Study of Participants With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Nivolumab in France After at Least One Prior Chemotherapy-based Treatment by Lung Initiative on Sequence Therapy
The purpose of this trial is to describe the following, for each cohort, in real world conditions in France:

* The characteristics and treatment sequence of patients treated with nivolumab
* The effectiveness of nivolumab treatment
* The safety profile of nivolumab
* Treatment patterns (e.g. duration of treatment, subsequent treatments) of nivolumab
* The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients treated with nivolumab, at baseline and during follow up using the EuroQoL-5D-3L
