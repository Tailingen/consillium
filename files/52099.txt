Colorectal cancer is the third largest malignant tumor in the world and a significant cause of cancer-related deaths. The probability of simultaneous liver metastasis in colorectal cancer is about 25%, and the proportion of liver metastasis occurring in the entire disease process is as high as 40% -50%. It is of great clinical significance to transform the initial unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer into resectable ones to improve the overall survival rate and prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. We designed a single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of adebrelimab plus cetuximab and chemotherapy for patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type unresectable liver metastases colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab plus cetuximab and chemotherapy for patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type unresectable liver metastases colorectal cancer.
