A Phase II Study of Tucatinib and Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in Patients With HER2-positive Metastatic Solid Tumors and Metastases to Brain (TUCATEMEB)
To learn if the study drugs, tucatinib and adotrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), can help to control solid tumors that have spread to the brain.
Metastatic Solid Tumor|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine|DRUG: Tucatinib
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

‚óè To determine the intracranial antitumor activity of the tucatinib and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T- bination per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) in patients with huma

Key Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the intracranial antitumor activity of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.
* To evaluate the duration of intracranial response of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.

Other Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.
* To evaluate the systemic antitumor activity of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.
* To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases receiving the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination.
* To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases receiving the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination.
* To evaluate the duration of response to the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination per the RECIST v1.1 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.
* To evaluate the clinical benefit rate of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination per the RECIST v1.1 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic solid tumors and brain metastases.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To assess the effects of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination on cell proliferation and apoptosis.
* To evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers of response and resistance to the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination.
* To assess the effects of the tucatinib and T-DM1 combination on circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) dynamics.
