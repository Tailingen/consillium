A Safety Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Elesclomol Sodium in Patients With Solid Tumors
The aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose). This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics of elesclomol and evaluate its anti-tumor activity in advanced solid tumors that are metastatic and unresectable.
