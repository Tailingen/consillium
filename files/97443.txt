FitEx for Endometrial Cancer Survivors: Initial Efficacy
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare physical activity outcomes between endometrial cancer survivors randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) usual care, 2) FitEx, 3) FitEx+yoga. Survivors randomized to FitEx groups will recruit \~3 support team members to complete the intervention with them. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Do FitEx groups undertake more physical activity than the usual care group?
* Are there differences in quality of life, self-compassion, flourishing, self-efficacy, social support, habit formation, and fruit /vegetable consumption

Participants will:

* Wear a Fitbit
* Complete surveys
* Participate in 30 minute weekly virtual meetings (FitEx groups only)
* Receive weekly newsletters (FitEx groups only)

The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the initial efficacy of FitEx, a physical activity tracking and promotion program, and FitEx+yoga for endometrial cancer survivors (ECS), with focus on improvement of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at the completion of the 8-week program. Specifically, this project will recruit early stage ECS with obesity to be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions: 1) usual care, 2) FitEx, 3) FitEx+yoga. ECS in either intervention condition will each select \~3 friends or family members to be their support members (minimum 2 and maximum 5). All ECS will receive a Fitbit to track their MVPA. We will then compare secondary ECS outcome measures between intervention and control groups including quality of life, self-compassion, flourishing, self-efficacy, social support, habit formation and fruit/vegetable consumption. Additionally, support team member MVPA (via Fitbit) and secondary outcomes will be compared. We will also explore long-term MPVA and secondary outcomes in all groups at 6 months.
