Rituximab Augmentation Following R-CHOP Induction Chemotherapy in Extremely Elderly Patients With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
Rituximab (R) plus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) combination is considered as the new gold standard for the first-line treatment of elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The study is aimed to evaluate the overall response rate and the safety of four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by rituximab augmentation (weekly four times infusion) in newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with aged more than 70 years.

DRUG: rituximab
the overall response rate, To evaluate the objective overall response rate of four cycles of R-CHOP and followed by four times weekly rituximab augmentation in exteremely elderly patients with DLBCL., three years after the completion of rituximab augmentation|Number of patients with adverse events, All patients will be evaluated for the toxicity during the treatment. Toxicity is graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC v3.0)., three years
progression-free survival, Three years after the completion of rituximab augmentation
1. Four cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy for the induction treatment \[Dose intensity of CHOP chemotherapy is modulated according to Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)\]

   If patients with CCI \<1
   * Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks.
   * Conventional dose of CHOP chemotherapy repeat every 3 weeks.

   If patients with CCI â‰¥1
   * Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks.
   * 75% of conventional CHOP repeat every 3 weeks.
2. Rituximab augmentation

   * Rituximab: 375 mg/m2, every week x 4 times.
   * Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 tablet per day during augmentation
