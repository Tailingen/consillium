Sequential or Up-front Triple Treatment With Durvalumab, Tremelimumab and Bevacizumab for Non-resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients
This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, international, Phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential or up-front triple treatment with durvalumab, tremelimumab and bevacizumab for non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following arms:

Arm A: initial treatment with durvalumab plus tremelimumab followed by treatment escalation with the addition of bevacizumab upon radiological progression or in the absence of objective response

Arm B: up-front treatment with durvalumab, tremelimumab and bevacizumab

Patients will be stratified according to macrovascular invasion and etiology of liver disease (viral etiologies versus others).
