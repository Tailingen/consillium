The Effectiveness of Bupivacaine and Bupivacaine+Dexmedetomidine Combination in Transversus Abdominis Plane* Block
Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an anesthesia method that provides somatic analgesia to the anterior and lateral abdominal walls. Thus, TAP block is widely implemented in perioperative management of colorectal cancer patients.

Researchers aimed to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and duration of effect of dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine in the TAP block applied in colorectal cancer surgeries.

Analgesic effectiveness of bupivacain and bupivacain+dexmedetomidine combination in colorectal cancer surgery, Numeric Rating Scales of two groups in postoperative period. The numeric rating scale (NRS) is a pain screening tool, commonly used to assess pain severity at that moment in time using a 0-10 scale, with zero meaning "no pain" and 10 meaning "the worst pain imaginable", postoperative day two
Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an anesthesia method that provides somatic analgesia to the anterior and lateral abdominal walls. With the increasing use of ultrasound guidance during peripheral nerve blocks, trunk blocks such as the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block are widely used for analgesia after abdominal surgery.

The advantages of TAP block include being less invasive than epidural analgesia, lower incidence of hypotension, and shorter hospital stay. Due to these advantages, TAP block has become a widely preferred method.

Researchers aimed to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and duration of effect of dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine in the TAP block applied in colorectal cancer surgeries. The study will be conducted in a tertiary oncology hospital in Turkey and 84 colorectal cancer patients will be included.
