Malaysia-Singapore Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2010 Study
The overall objective of this study is to continue to improve the cure rate of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Singapore and Malaysia in the context of a multi-centre cooperative trial using a risk-stratified therapy based primarily on early response to therapy utilizing a simplified minimal residual disease (MRD-lite) platform.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: L-Asparaginase|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Daunorubicin|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: 6-Mercaptopurine|DRUG: Thioguanine|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Imatinib
Event-free survival (EFS), EFS was estimated from time of diagnosis to time of first event or of patient's last follow-up. Failure to achieve complete remission (CR), relapse, death in continuous remission from whatever cause, secondary leukemia and abandonment (absence from scheduled therapy for more than 6 weeks) were considered as events., 5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS was determined from diagnosis to time of death from any cause., 5 years|Minimal residual disease (MRD) measurement, At time point of Day 33, week 8 and week 12
Number of participants with chemotherapy-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE version 4.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Dose intensity of chemotherapy during various phases of therapy, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
The study was designed on the premise that a risk classification strategy combining clinical and genetic presenting features with molecular assessment of MRD should reduce both treatment-related toxicities and relapse risk.

The patient will be assigned to one of the 3 risk groups depending on his/her response to the treatment and special laboratory tests. There are no experimental drugs in this study. All the drugs used are standard established treatment for childhood ALL for the last 30 years. The difference in treatment is by changes in the frequency and dose of the chemotherapy drugs.

The overall study treatment lasts for about 2 years.
