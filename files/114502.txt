Safety Study of High Dose Temozolomide to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Central Nervous System (CNS) Malignancy
The goal of this study is to find the maximum dose of a drug, temozolomide, that can safely be given to subjects with brain tumors. Past studies showed that the maximum dose of temozolomide was limited by low blood counts. The investigators will use blood stem cells collected from bone marrow to help subjects recover their blood counts, a procedure called autologous stem cell transplant or stem cell rescue. This way, the investigators expect to be able to safely deliver very high doses of temozolomide. This study is only available at Tufts Medical Center.
Central Nervous System Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis
DRUG: Temozolomide
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide with hematopoietic stem cell rescue in patients with recurrent CNS malignancy, 5 years
Estimate the response rate, response duration and survival according to established response definitions, 5 years|Determine the pharmacokinetics of high daily dosing of temozolomide in the transplant setting, 5 years
High dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant is an accepted treatment alternative for patients with brain tumors. Temozolomide has been approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain tumors of the brain. The doses of temozolomide given in this study will be higher than approved by the FDA and higher than those given in any prior studies.

Over 25 subjects will be enrolled on this study over a period of 5 years. This study will only be available at Tufts Medical Center.
