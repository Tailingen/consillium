Fraction Dose Escalation of Hypo-fractionated Radiotherapy in LANSCLC
This Phase 1 trial aimed to determine the maximum tolerated fraction dose (MTD) of hypofractionated radiotherapy (hypo-RT) combined with concurrent chemotherapy and subsequent consolidation immune checkpoint inhibitors (cICI) for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).
Locally Advanced Lung Carcinoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy|DRUG: Concurrent chemotherapy|DRUG: Consolidation immunotherapy
the maximally tolerated fraction dose, The maximum tolerated fraction dose was defined as the highest DL in which \<=2 patients of the 6 treated patients experienced G3+ toxicity and \<=1 patient experienced G4+ toxicity within 12 months after RT. If a patient had multiple types of toxicities, only the highest grade of toxicity was counted., 1 year
