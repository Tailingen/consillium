Neoadjuvant Dupilumab, Pembrolizumab, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin in Locally Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Pilot trial of the IL-4 receptor antagonist dupilumab plus pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in locally advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

Primary Objective: To assess the safety of neoadjuvant dupilumab and pembrolizumab plus weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin as measured by the proportion of severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with locally advanced TNBC.

Secondary Objectives: To determine the rates of pathologic complete response with the addition of dupilumab to NAC and pembrolizumab; to determine the rate of residual cancer burden 0-1; to estimate the recurrence-free survival and overall survival; to assess the toxicity of the combination of dupilumab, pembrolizumab, and paclitaxel-carboplatin.
Locally Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer|TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dupilumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Incidence of severe immune-related adverse events (irSAE), Incidence of severe immune-related adverse events within 4 months of therapy.

Immune related Severe Adverse Events (irSAE) are defined as:

* Any Grade 4 immune-related AE with the exception of hypothyroidism
* Any Grade 3 immune-related AE requiring permanent discontinuation of dupilumab and pembrolizumab
* Any new Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory abnormality, if

  * medical intervention is required, or
  * the abnormality leads to hospitalization, or
  * the abnormality persists for \> 72 hours
* Any non-hematologic AE which is considered severe or life-threatening and requires discontinuation of dupilumab and pembrolizumab
* Any â‰¥ Grade 2 immune-mediated uveitis
* Any immune-related AE resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one's ability to conduct normal life functions) for a period of 30 days or greater
* Grade 5 or life-threatening toxicity, Within 4 months of therapy
Proportion of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) with 95 percent Wilson Score interval, Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as the lack of invasive cancer in the breast and axilla at time of surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy. The research team will calculate the proportion of patients with pathologic complete response with 95 percent Wilson Score interval without continuity correction., During procedure, after 13 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy|Proportion of patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) categories 0 and 1 with 95 percent Wilson Score, Residual cancer burden (RCB) categories 0-1 comprise of patients who have achieved pCR (RCB 0) and have minimal tumor burden (RCB 1) after neoadjuvant therapy. The research team will calculate the proportion of patients with residual cancer burden categories 0 and 1 with 95 percent Wilson Score interval without continuity correction., After completion of neoadjuvant therapy (13 weeks)|Proportion of patients who did not experience an invasive breast cancer recurrence (Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS)), Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is measured as the proportion of patients who did not experience an invasive breast cancer recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or regional nodes, distant organ sites, or death from any cause for the specified time period. It is defined as time from start of treatment to occurrence of an invasive breast cancer recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or regional nodes, distant organ sites, or death from any cause.

The research team will summarize using Kaplan-Meier method with 95 percent pointwise confidence intervals using complimentary log-log scale. Median RFS with 95 percent confidence interval will be calculated using Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Hazard ratios with 95 percent confidence interval will be estimated using Proportional Hazards Cox regression model., During procedure, after 13 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until documented death from any cause. The research team will summarize using Kaplan-Meier method with 95 percent pointwise confidence intervals using complimentary log-log scale. Median RFS with 95 percent confidence interval will be calculated using Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Hazard ratios with 95 percent confidence interval will be estimated using the Cox Proportional Hazards regression model., After completion of neoadjuvant therapy (13 weeks)|Number of immune-related adverse events grades 3-5, Toxicity will be measured by the number immune-related adverse events grades 3-5 and incidence of severe TEAE (Grade 3-5 or serious AEs) according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, as well as based on rates of dose interruptions and drug discontinuations due to adverse events., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment|Number of adverse events measured using CTCAE Version 5.0, Number of adverse events will be reported according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment|Incidence of all-grade immune-related adverse events, Incidence of all-grade immune-related adverse events and severe TEAEs with the combination therapy within 3 months at the last study visit and within 6 months with chart review., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment|Type of adverse events, The type of severe adverse events will be collected., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment|Number of dose interruptions, The research team will assess the number of dose interruptions due to AEs with 95 percent Wilson Score interval without continuity correction., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment|Number of drug discontinuations, The research team will assess the number of drug discontinuations due to AEs with 95 percent Wilson Score interval without continuity correction., Within 3 months and 6 months of treatment
