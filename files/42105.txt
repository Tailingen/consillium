This is a multiple center, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study of NBP administered to women with metastatic breast cancer who receive nab-paclitaxel as therapy. Nab-paclitaxel will be administered at a dose \>260 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 4 planned cycles. Subjects will begin receiving NBP orally at a dose of 400 mg administered every 12-hours (BID) or matching placebo 5 days (10 doses) prior to starting nab-paclitaxel therapy and continue to self-administer it BID until Visit 6/Day 100/Week 15. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or reducing symptoms associated with nab-paclitaxel induced toxic neuropathy (CIPN). The secondary objectives include an evaluation the efficacy of NBP relative to placebo at preventing or attenuating taxane induced acute pain syndrome (TAPS), the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of NBP relative to placebo and to determine if NBP administration impacts the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel or if nab-paclitaxel affects the pharmacokinetics of NBP.
