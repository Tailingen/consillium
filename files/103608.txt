HydroMARK Post-market Clinical Follow-up Study
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the HydroMARK Breast Biopsy Site Marker manufactured in the Devicor Medical Products, Inc. Tijuana facility.
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ultrasound imaging
Safety Cohort, The safety cohort will consist of approximately 491 evaluable subject medical records reviewed retrospectively from patients followed for a minimum of 90 days post-implant unless the subject was exited according to the medical records due to the implant being removed/explanted or subject death. Device-related adverse events and device deficiencies will be collected., 90 days post-implant|Performance Cohort, The performance cohort will prospectively enroll approximately 341 subjects with a suspected breast cancer that will undergo as part of standard of care an ultrasound-guided breast biopsy procedure, including placement of HydroMARK, with an aim of achieving a minimum 239 evaluable subjects (assuming 30% attrition rate due to surgical excision prior to follow-up, lost to follow-up, death) returning to the office at 6-12 weeks for ultrasound imaging to evaluate HydroMARK visibility.

The visibility rate will be dichotomized into two categories from rankings using a 1-5 Likert-type scale - 1 "no/inadequate visibility" and 2 "slightly visible", 3 "moderately visible", 4 "very visible" and 5 "extremely visible" will be coalesced into a single category of "being visible"., 6 - 12 weeks post-implant
