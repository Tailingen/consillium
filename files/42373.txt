Decitabine and Plerixafor in Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The hypothesis of this proposal is that combining plerixafor, an inhibitor of stromal cell derived factor - 1α (SDF-1α), with decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, as induction and postremission therapy for older patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) will improve treatment outcomes via mobilization of leukemia stem cells and alteration of the pharmacodynamics of decitabine. The protocol will establish the safety and feasibility of combining two different doses of plerixafor with a fixed dose and schedule of decitabine.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: plerixafor|DRUG: decitabine
response to treatment, blood and bone marrow testing will be done to determine response to treatment every month, after every cycle (every month) - average subject will be on study for 4-6 months
