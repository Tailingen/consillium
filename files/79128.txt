AML96 - Risk-Adapted and Randomized Postremission-Therapy for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
The AML96 study examines the feasibility of a risk-adapted postremission treatment strategy including related and unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high risk AML patients and related allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation for standard risk AML patients in a multi-center setting. Furthermore it randomizes patients between intermediate-dose Cytarabine vs high-dose Cytarabine within the first postremission-course.
