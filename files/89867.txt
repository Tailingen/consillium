Exploratory Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Myeloid Malignancies
This is an open-label, single-arm, exploratory clinical trial utilizing a "3+3" dose escalation followed by dose expansion to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of CD33/CD123/CLL-1 CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloid malignancies.

Part A: Dose Escalation Phase. Follows a "3+3" dose escalation design with four predefined dose cohorts: 0.2×10⁶, 0.5×10⁶, 1×10⁶, and 2×10⁶ CAR-positive cells/kg.Anticipated enrollment: 12-24 subjects.Primary objectives: Assess safety, tolerability, and determine MTD.Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period: 28 days post-infusion.

Part B: Dose Expansion Phase.Enrolls 21 additional subjects to receive CAR-T cell infusion at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part A.Primary objective: Further evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

Overall Study Objectives:Safety profile of CD33/CD123/CLL-1 CAR-T therapy.Efficacy endpoints (e.g., response rates, survival outcomes).Pharmacokinetic characterization of CAR-T cells (expansion/persistence).
