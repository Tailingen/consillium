Phase 1 Dose-finding Study of L19TNFα Plus Melphalan Using Isolated Inferior Limb Perfusion (ILP) in Subjects With Intransit Stage III/IV Melanoma
In this study the recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα will be associated in ILP with the standard treatment with melphalan 10mg/l limb volume in subjects affected by stage III/IV limb melanoma.

The recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα was created with the intention to target TNFα directly to tumor tissues with the result in high and sustained intralesional bioactive TNFα concentrations.
