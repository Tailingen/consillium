Immune Profiling for Cancer Immunotherapy Response
In patients clinically treated with FDA-approved immunotherapy the investigators will assess the predictive value of pre- and on-treatment 1) immune-methylation profiling across cancer types, and 2) immune-methylation profiling and cytokine profiling within cancer types.

Response to therapy, The investigators will employ iRECIST, and outcome criteria will be clinically evaluated and include the primary endpoints of progression (non-responders) or response, with patients followed up every month for 6 months (or until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent), judged according to the objective response rate (ORR) assessed using iRECIST., 5 years
