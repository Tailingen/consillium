A Study of MRG004A in Patients With Tissue Factor Positive Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG004A in patients with Tissue Factor positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: MRG004A
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose confirmed wherein less than 2 out of 6, or \< 33% of evaluable patients in a treatment cohort experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., DLT will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle (Day 1-21)|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The dose level of MRG004A recommended for further clinical studies based on assessment of the safety, efficacy and PK data from Part A of this study., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the Independent Central Review (ICR)., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., From signing informed consent until 45 days after the last dose of MRG004A
Duration of Response (DoR), The time interval between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of disease progression or death for any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who achieve CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 6 weeks based on RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from the date of first study dose to disease progression or death whichever occurs first., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Overall Survive (OS), The time from start of study treatment to date of death as a result of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of MRG004A: Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of MRG004A: Tmax, Time to reach the maximum plasma concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of MRG004A: AUClast, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), The proportion of patients with positive ADA immunogenicity results., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
This study consists of two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MRG004A. Part B is a disease specific multi-cohort dose expansion study to further assess the efficacy and safety of MRG004A at confirmed RP2D.
