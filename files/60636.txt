Study of a Novel Indibulin Dosing Schedule for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is a Phase I/II trial of a novel Indibulin dosing schedule for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will have measurable or non-measurable, metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer and may have received any number of prior therapies for their disease.

It is expected that the Phase I portion will enroll up to 20 patients and the Phase II portion will enroll up to 45 patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Indibulin
Phase I- Maximum Tolerated Dose, The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Indibulin when given for 5 days followed by a 9 day rest (5-9) using a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Throughout Cycle 1 (28 days)|Phase II- Progression Free Survival, The primary objective of the Phase II portion of this trial is to examine the efficacy of indibulin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer at the MTD established in Phase I. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who are progression free at 4 months when treated with Indibulin (5-9)at the MTD determined by the phase I portion of the trial., 4 months
Phase I- Number of participants with Adverse Events as a measure of safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety of Indibulin when administered for 5 days followed by a 9 day rest (5-9) in patients with metastatic breast cancer, Duration of study, approximately one year|Phase I- Toxicity, To describe the Cycle I and overall toxicity rates of indibulin (5-9) using the NCI CTC version 3., Cycle 1 (28 days), and duration of study (approximately one year)|Phase I- Pharmacokinetics of indibulin in study subject plasma assessed in Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 5 per schedule below in Description section., To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of Indibulin (5-9) as it is assessed in Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 2, Day 5 and Day 8. Cycle 1 PK schedule as follows: Day 1 immediately pre dose, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and approximately 24 hours after start of infusion (Cycle 2 Day 1), Day 5 pre-dose and at anytime during Day 8., During Cycle 1 (28 days)|Phase II- Overall Response Rate, To estimate the overall response rate (complete response and partial response)associated with Indibulin (5-9) schedule at eth MTD determined by the Phase I portion of this trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer., At the end of Cycles 4 and 6 (approximately 4 months and 6 months respectively)|Phase II- Rate of Stable Disease, To estimate the rate of stable disease greater than 6 months associated with the Indibulin (5-9) schedule at the MTD determined by the the Phase I portion of this trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer., Phase II- greater than 6 months|Phase II- Number of patients with Adverse Events as a measure of safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety of Indibulin when administered for 5 days followed by a 9 day rest (5-9) at the MTD determined by the Phase I portion of this trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer., Throughout study, approximately one year
