Phase II Study of Chemotherapy and PD-1 Inhibitor Combination With Autologous CIK Cell Immunotherapy to Treat Lung Cancer
This prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase II, randomized controlled trial (CCICC-002b) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous cytokine-induced killer cell immunotherapy in combination with PD-1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic|First-line Treatment
BIOLOGICAL: CIK cells injection|DRUG: Sintilimab Injection|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Albumin paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Time Frame: Up to 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the initial treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or all-cause death (whichever occurs first) assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the initial treatment until the date of death due to any cause., up to 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR was defined as first documented evidence of a CR or PR until PD or death as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) as determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered with study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study drug. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., up to 24 months (Serious AEs: Up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment (Other AEs: Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Any Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered with study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this study drug. The number of participants who discontinued any randomized study drug due to an AE is presented., up to 24 months
