A Study for Participants With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study will compare the effects of Enzastaurin plus Sunitinib versus Sunitinib alone in metastatic Renal Cell Cancer.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Enzastaurin|DRUG: Sunitinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Part 2, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the number of months between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever came first., Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease (PD) (Up to 24 Months)
Overall Survival (OS) in Part 2, OS time was defined as the number of months between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause., Randomization to Death from Any Cause (Up to 24 Months)|Time-To-Tumor Progression in Part 2, Time to tumor progression (TTP) at initial treatment was defined as the number of months between date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to disease under study, whichever came first., Randomization to the Date of Objective Progressive Disease or Date of Death due to Study Disease, whichever came first (Up to 24 Months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious AEs (SAEs) in Part 1, Clinically significant events were defined as serious adverse events, regardless of causality. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Randomization to Study Completion (Up to 6 Cycles)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under Concentration Time Curve During One Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCτ,ss) of Enzastaurin + Metabolite (LSN326020) + Total Analytes in Part 1, Pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed in participants to determine the area under the concentration time curve during one dosing interval at steady state (AUCτ,ss) of Enzastaurin, LSN326020 and total Analytes. τ equals 12 hours for Enzastaurin, LSN326020 and total Analytes., Cycle 1 Day 15: Predose, 2, 4, and 6 - 8 hours, Up to 12 Hours Post dose|PK: Maximum Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss) of Enzastaurin + LSN326020 + Total Analytes in Part 1, PK was assessed in participants to determine the maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax, ss) of Enzastaurin + LSN326020 + total analytes., Cycle 1 Day 15: Predose, 2, 4, and 6 - 8 hours, Up to 12 Hours Post dose
This is a multicenter, Phase 2 study of enzastaurin and sunitinib versus placebo and sunitinib as first-line therapy in participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, containing 2 parts. Part 1 is a safety lead-in study with 12 participants and possible dose escalation. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 2 study in 110 participants.
