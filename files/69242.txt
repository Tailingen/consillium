Perioperative Tislelizumab Combined With Nab-Paclitaxel for Muscle-invasive Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma
This is a phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab when given in combination with nab-paclitaxel as perioperative treatment in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) prior to cystectomy or complete TURBT. Patients will receive treatment with tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 3 treatment cycles over 9 weeks followed by standard radical cystectomy or complete TURBT.
Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel
Clinical Complete Response (cCR) rate, defined as the absence of tumor residual confirmed by surgery (RC-PLND or complete TURBT), negative urine cytology and no evidence of lymph nodes or distant metastasis on imaging., At the time of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical cystectomy (within 12 weeks of the first dose of tislelizumab)
Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy., At the time of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical cystectomy (within 12 weeks of the first dose of tislelizumab)|Event-free survival (EFS), defined from D1 of neoadjuvant treatment until progression (in those who progress prior to surgery) or until recurrence (post-surgery) or until death as a result of any cause., up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the number of days from study entry to death. Individuals who are alive at last contact will be censored on the date of last contact., up to 3 years|Disease-specific survival (DSS), DSS was documented from the date of initial treatment till the date of the disease-related death., up to 3 years|Number of adverse events and severity by grade (CTCAE), Safety and toxicity will be characterized according to the reported adverse event (AE) profile using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as well as a patient questionnaire derived from the Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)., up to 1 years
