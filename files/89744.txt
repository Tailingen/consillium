Blood Flow Path Reconstruction in Rectal Cancer
89 patients with distal sigmoid and rectal cancer were referred in our observation and underwent MS-CTA between June 2020 and March 2022. We classified the distribution of LCA and confirmed whether there exists AMCA (accessory middle colic artery). Then we planned blood flow path based on the classification of LCA branches before operation. High ligation was applied in regular radical surgery. During operation, we carefully protect the bifurcation of ascending and descending LCA. Then we compared the planned blood flow path with the actual postoperative blood flow path to verify the mechanism we proposed previously.
