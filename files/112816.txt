A Study to Evaluate Two Different Regimens of VELCADE in Combination With Dexamethasone, Thalidomide and Cyclophosphamide (VDT vs VDTC) in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this Phase 2 randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with a regimen of VELCADE, dexamethasone, and thalidomide (VDT) or VELCADE, dexamethasone, thalidomide, and cyclophosphamide (VDTC) in subjects with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma who have received no prior treatment and are candidates to receive high-dose therapy and autologous bone marrow/stem cell transplantation.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: bortezomib, dexamethasone, and thalidomide|DRUG: bortezomib, dexamethasone, thalidomide, and cyclophosphamide
Percent of Particpants Achieving Overall Combined Complete Response (CR) Following Induction, Percent of Particpants Achieving Overall combined complete response (CR w/normalized serum κ:λ ratio + CR + near complete response (nCR)) following induction therapy.

* CR criteria: negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow.
* κ:λ ratio: normal free light chain (FLC) ratio
* nCR criteria: positive immunofixation analysis of serum or urine as the only evidence of disease; disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow., all data included in clinical database as of 10 April 2009
Percent of Participants Achieving Overall Combined Complete Response (CR) Following High-dose Chemotherapy (HDT)/Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT), Percent of Participants Achieving Overall Combined Complete Response (CR) (CR w/normalized serum κ:λ ratio + CR + Near Complete Response (nCR)) following stem cell transplantation.

* CR criteria: negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow.
* κ:λ ratio: normal free light chain (FLC) ratio
* nCR criteria: positive immunofixation analysis of serum or urine as the only evidence of disease; disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow., all data included in clinical database as of 10 April 2009
