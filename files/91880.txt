Short Course Radiation Therapy in Palliative Treatment of Abdominal Cancer
Aim of the study is to assess efficacy of a short course radiation treatment in patients with symptomatic abdominal malignant lesions
Abdomen Tumors|Radiotherapy|Palliative Care
RADIATION: standard treatment|RADIATION: short course treatment
Efficacy of palliation using the short course scheme compared with the standard scheme, Reduction of initial symptoms after radiotherapy, assessed with Likert scale (bleeding, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, jaundice, weight loss, bowel obstruction are evaluated as none-mild-moderate-severe), 3 months
acute toxicity in the two treatment groups, incidence of treatment-related acute adverse events in the two arms of the study registered using Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria, 3 months|late toxicity in the two treatment groups, incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the two arms of the study registered using RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbility Scoring Schema, 12 months|Quality of Life (QoL) assessment in the two groups, changes in QoL after the treatment assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire C15-PAL (a specific questionnaire from EORTC developed to assess the quality of life of palliative cancer care patients), 12 months
Standard treatment for abdomen lesions (3000 cGy in 10 daily fractions of 300 cGy each) is compared with experimental treatment (1800 cGy in 4 fractions of 450 cGy twice a day) to demonstrate non-inferiority of this scheme
