PG Versus TG for Advanced PGC
We conducted a retrospective study on patients with pathological stage II-III PGC who underwent PG or TG from 2013 to 2023. Propensity score-matching was applied to adjust for tumor size and stage between the PG and TG groups at a 1:1 ratio. We evaluated the procedural safety, oncological, and functional outcomes.
