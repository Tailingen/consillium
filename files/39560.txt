Securing Access to Innovative Molecules in Oncology and Hematology for Children, Adolescents and Young Adults
It involves collecting safety and efficacy data, under the actual conditions of use of medicines in children and adolescents, using a validated tool (Ennov EDC) and relying on the network of Interregional pediatric oncology appeal organizations (RIOs) identified by INCa since 2010 and responsible for the organization of Pluridisciplinary Pediatric Interregional (RCPPI) and National Consultative Meetings which discuss each case of relapse in order to define the best therapeutic options.

OTHER: Data collection
Collect access data, Collect access data of children, adolescents and young adults in therapeutic failures and not eligible for a clinical trial with innovative molecules, whether they are targeted therapies, immunotherapies or chemotherapies, up to 1 year
The objective is to aim for completeness throughout the national territory. This is why this project will be carried out in close collaboration with the RIOs and RCPPI and that of the 31 centers of the SFCE which bring together more than 400 doctors pediatric oncologists and hematologists on the French territory
