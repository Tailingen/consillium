AssesSment of Early-deteCtion basEd oN liquiD Biopsy in GASTRIC Cancer, ASCEND-Gastric
ASCEND-Gastric is a prospective, multi-omics, observational study aimed at detecting gastric cancer by combined assays for serum protein markers, deep sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation and circulating RNA. The study will enroll 498 participants, including 128 patients with benign gastric diseases and 370 patients with gastric cancer.
