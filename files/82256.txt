Study of 3D189 in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
To assess the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of 3D189 in patients with hematological malignancies.
Acute Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
BIOLOGICAL: 3D189
Number and frequency of TRAEs, including AE and SAEs (safety parameters), ncidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the study treatment (graded in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] v5.0), From the initiation of study treatment to the completion of safety follow-up after the end of study treatment, up to 13 months|Immune response rate of 3D189 vaccination among subjects, The rate of positive results for any of the immune tests used to assess the WT1 -specific T-cell immune responses., From baseline (pre-treatment) to the end of study treatment,up to 12 months
Overall survival (OS), From time of registration to the time of subject death., up to 24 months|Relapse-free survival (RFS) or progression-free survival (PFS), From time of registration to the time of documented morphological leukemic relapse (for AL patients only) or disease progression (for MDS, MM and NHL patients) or subject death (for all patients), up to 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) in MDS, MM or NHL patients receiving 3D189 treatment, as evaluated by the investigators according to the corresponding response evaluation criteria and by comparison with baseline., up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Time interval between the documentation of ORR (CR/PR) post study treatment and the documentation of progressive disease (PD) (for MDS, MM or NHL patients)., up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of patients who achieve CR or PR post study treatment or who remain stable for at least the first 12 weeks of study treatment (for MDS, MM or NHL patients)., up to 12 months
This is a phase 1, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study of 3D189 (also known as galinpepimut-S), a multivalent peptide vaccine targeting Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1), for maintenance immunotherapy in patients with WT1-positive hematological malignancies, including patients with acute leukemia (AL) patients in complete remission (CR), or multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who have received at least first-line standard therapy and recently achieved CR or partial remission (PR), if the latter is the best achievable response for the patient.
