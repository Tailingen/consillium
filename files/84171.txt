Novel Mechanisms and Predictors of VEGF Receptor Inhibitor- or Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Associated Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease
The purpose of this study is to understand the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase (VEGF) inhibitor, immune checkpoint-inhibitor (ICI), and combination treatment on blood pressure and blood vessel function.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement
Change in Mean Blood Pressure, Mean 24 hour blood pressure from ambulatory 24 hour recording, Baseline and 1 month
Ratio of Post-treatment to Pre-treatment Change in Digital Pulse Amplitude, Digital pulse amplitude will be measured using peripheral artery tonometry, Baseline and 1 month
