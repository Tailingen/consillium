Interest of Peri Operative CHemotherapy In Patients With CINSARC High-risk Localized Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Phase III, multicenter, randomized open-label and comparative study designed to demonstrate whether adding 4 cycles of peri-operative doxorubicin-based chemotherapy improves metastasis-free survival as compared with standard management in patients with resectable STS, considered as high-risk according to CINSARC (Complexity Index in SARComas) signature.

After signed informed consent, patients considered as eligible to CHIC-STS study by the investigator will be enrolled in the study and a molecular screening will be performed (600 patients will be screened).

Patients considered as low-risk according to CINSARC signature will be treated at the discretion of the clinicians (prospective cohort).

Patients considered as high-risk according to CINSARC signature will be randomized in the open-label multicenter phase III trial and assigned in one of the two following treatments arms:

* Arm A (control arm): Standard of care (surgical excision +/- external radiotherapy).
* Arm B (experimental arm): Standard of care + 4 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy during 12 weeks.

A total of 250 patients will have to be randomized with 125 patients in each arm.
