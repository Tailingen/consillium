Early Diagnosis of Pulmonary Nodules
This study is intended to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the multiprotein classifier based on the observed study prevalence of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in the study participants.
Precancerous Conditions|Carcinoma
Incidence rate of adult patients diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Incidence rate of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer as determined by histologic or cytologic diagnosis and/or radiographically stability at 2 years post enrollment., 2 years post enrollment
Patients must present with previously non-diagnosed lung nodules as found on CT. There is no change to the typical standard of care that any of the investigating physicians and/or centers provide the patients enrolled in this study. The data from this study will not be used to diagnose cancer nor be used to influence treatment decisions for the study participants.
