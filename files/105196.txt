A Study of Navicixizumab Monotherapy or in Combination in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a study of navicixizumab monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel or irinotecan in patients with advanced cancer. Patients will be enrolled into one of the following cancer cohorts:

* Cohort A: CRC
* Cohort B: Gastric and GEJ cancer
* Cohort C: TNBC
* Cohort D: Platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (ovarian cancer)
Colorectal Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: navicixizumab+paclitaxel|BIOLOGICAL: navicixizumab+irinotecan|BIOLOGICAL: navicixizumab monotherapy
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or PR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 as determined by investigator tumor response assessments, Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from first dose to the date of first documentation of objective disease progression or death (any cause), whichever occurs first, as determined by investigator tumor response assessments, Up to 12 months
Adverse Events, Assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0); clinical laboratory tests; vital sign measurements; electrocardiograms (ECGs); Doppler echocardiograms (ECHOs); physical examinations (PEs), Up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS, Defined as the time from first dose to death, Up to 18 months|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the time from first dose to first documentation of response (CR or PR), Up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with SD or a confirmed BOR of CR or PR, Up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR) to documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 18months|Xerna™ TME biomarker, Relationship between antitumor activity of navicixizumab therapy and Xerna™ TME Panel biomarker subtypes, Up to 18 months
Cancer antigen-125 response, Serum levels of cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) to determine CA-125 response (Cohort D \[ovarian cancer\] only) and biomarker research through the analysis of tumor and blood samples, Up to 12 months|Immunogenicity, The presence of anti-navicixizumab antibodies (ie, immunogenicity), Up to 6 months|Navicixizumab Pharmacokinetics, Navicixizumab concentrations by time point, Up to 6 months
After completing all screening procedures, including the submission of a tissue sample, patients that meet eligibility requirements will be assigned to receive navicixizumab alone or in combination with another anticancer agent. Treatment is assigned based on the patients type of tumor and the cohort that is open at the time of enrollment. Patients will receive treatment in 4 week cycles, attend study visits and have their heart monitored through echocardiograms and daily blood pressure measurements. Patients will also have their tumors monitored regularly through CT scans. Patients receiving benefit may continue on study drug until their tumor progresses, they experience intolerable side effects, their physician decides it is in their best interest to discontinue therapy or they choose to withdrawal from the study. After discontinuing study treatments, all patients will receive regular follow up calls or visits to assess their status and other anticancer treatments they may start.
