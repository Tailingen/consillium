Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of GX-I7 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
Patients will be enrolled in two stages:

* Dose-escalation stage: Approximately 15-30 patients will be enrolled.
* Dose-expansion stage: 6-12 patients will be enrolled. Dose-escalation slots will be filled first, then dose-expansion slots.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: GX-I7
DLT, Incidence of nature of DLTs, up to 24 months|AE, Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAEv4.0, up to 24 months|ECG test evaluated by QTc, Change QTc from baseline (\> 500 msec), up to 24 months
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, Serum concentration of GX-I7 at specified timepoints for the Area under the concentration time-curve (AUC), up to cycle 3 day 1(approximately 9 weeks)|Anti-tumor activity, Objective response, defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v.1.1, as determined by the investigator, up to 24 months|Immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) during the study, up to 24 months|Exploratory Biomarker, Changes in immune infiltrates, immune-related gene expression in tumor tissue prior to and during study treatment, up to 24 months
* Dose-escalation stage : designed as classical 3+3 to determine MTD or RP2D to evaluate approximately GX-I7.
* Dose-expansion stage : designed to enroll additional 6-12 patients to acquire additional safety and pharmacodynamic data to more fully inform the dose selection for RP2D
