ESM Versus OM ï¼šA Randomized Controlled Trial
The consideration of quality of life issues has led to the development of alternative surgeries for breast cancer patients, particularly in the case of localized disease. Nipple-sparing subcutaneous mastectomy (SM), for example, was designed to preserve the nipple-areola complex which facilitates breast reconstruction. However, SM still leaves behind a conspicuous scar.There have already been some observation study show that endoscopic subcutaneous mastectomy(ESM) can improve the cosmesis outcomes and at the same time as safe as the traditional SM.However there is no RCT in this field.That is why the investigators design this study.
Endoscopic Subcutaneous Mastectomy
PROCEDURE: subcutaneous mastectomy|PROCEDURE: endoscopic subcutaneous mastectomy
local recurrence rate, Definition and diagnostic criteria of local recurrence: physical examination or imaging examination found lesions in the same side of breast, chest wall or skin and surgical scars, and confirmed by histology as breast cancer of the same tissue type; 12 months after operation, the evaluation was carried out., 12 months after operation
Distant metastasis, Definition and diagnosis criteria of distant metastasis: the lesions appeared in the distant organs other than breast and surrounding tissues, such as bone, lung, liver, brain, etc., and were diagnosed as breast cancer metastasis by imaging or histology; the evaluation was carried out 12 months after operation., 12 months after operation
