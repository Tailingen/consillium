GeneSearch Breast Lymph Node (BLN) Assay Timing Study
This study is designed to collect data about the amount of time required to use the assay in clinical-use conditions.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: GeneSearchâ„¢ Breast Lymph Node (BLN) Assay
To determine, under clinical use conditions, the assay turn-around-time (TAT) from the time of node removal to the report of the assay result to the surgeon., 1 day|To determine, under clinical use conditions, whether the assay result was or was not received in time ('time for decision' (TFD)) to make an intra-operative decision to proceed to further non-sentinel axillary lymph node dissection., 1 day|To collect data in relation to other surgical procedures during the SLND/breast surgery to determine if the assay TAT resulted in longer surgery time than would have occurred if the assay had not been used., 1 day
Assay turn-around-time will be collected at sites that are using the GeneSearch BLN Assay for intraoperative testing of sentinel lymph nodes. The sites must be planning to use the assay result to guide the decision to complete an axillary lymph node dissection.
