TAES Alleviate Post-VATS Depression
Depression can significantly affect postoperative rehabilitation quality and increase the mortality of patients who receive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This study intend to evaluate the transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) of VATS safety and the efficacy of the postoperative depression compared to a sham group.

Depression is a common psychiatric problem in perioperative period in patients who receive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Multiple research have pointed out that the incidence of postoperative depression can be as high as 11.8%-34% . Brian et al.reported that the iIncidence of new depressive episodes one year after VATS was as high as 12.4%. Depression not only reduces treatment compliance and quality of life, prolongs hospital stays, and increases postoperati''ve mortality, but can also exacerbate pain and reduce sleep quality, significantly affecting postoperative recovery .

Modern studies report that surgical trauma, pain, sleep disorders, and stress responses increases inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6, and cause inflammation. This results in a decrease in the production of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which causes depression. Therefore, the antidepressant drugs widely used in clinical practice are serotonin reuptake inhibitors; however, they are not only expensive and slow to act, but also have various side reactions, such as decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, irritability, and anxiety. Further, long-term use may also cause damage to the nervous system.

Transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) is an innovative diagnostic and therapeutic technique used in traditional Chinese medicine that integrates transcutaneous nerve electrical stimulation with meridian acupoints. It offers numerous advantages, such as being noninvasive, painless, simple to operate, with high treatment compliance, and minimal side effects. Multiple studies have shown that TAES not only has analgesic, anti-stress, and anti-inflammatory effects and can improve postoperative sleep disorders but can also directly increase the concentration of serotonin in the brain. Therefore, TAES may effectively improve post-VATS depression symptoms. This prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind, single-arm, single-center study will provide insights oninto the safety and effectiveness of TAES in improving post-VATS.
