Study of Sunitinib in Subjects With High Risk Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study is designed to explore the molecular modulatory effect of Sunitinib when given in a neoadjuvant setting prior to radical or partial nephrectomy. The study will evaluate aforementioned outcomes in 30 patients at a dose of 50mg/day for 4 weeks followed by surgery 2-4 weeks following the last dose.
