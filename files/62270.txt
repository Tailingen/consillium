BrUOG 292: FOLFOX-A For Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer: A Phase II Brown University Oncology Research Group Trial
A standard treatment for your cancer is called FOLFIRINOX (this utilizes the FDA approved chemotherapy drugs fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan). In this study you will receive the chemotherapy treatment FOLFOX-A (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin and Abraxane ®) which substitutes irinotecan for the FDA approved chemotherapy drug Abraxane ®. Even though Abraxane is FDA approved for pancreatic cancer, the combination of Abraxane with the other 3 drugs is being investigated. Your doctors are studying the activity and side effects of FOLFOX-A in advanced (metastatic) pancreatic cancer.
