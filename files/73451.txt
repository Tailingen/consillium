THRIVE Well Cancer FDTN/Exercise_Creatine Supplementation
The study's purpose is to evaluate whether creatine supplementation can help breast cancer survivors respond quicker to exercise by improving strength, endurance, and body composition. We are seeking to compare information collected from healthy woman of the same age who have never had breast cancer to those participants who have had breast cancer and undergone chemotherapy treatment.
Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer Female|Muscle Weakness
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Creatine
Change in strength in breast cancer survivors, Determine the change in strength in breast cancer survivors by comparing pre and post measurements of strength measurement tools including 1RM/10RM/Biodex evaluations., baseline and 12 weeks|Change in physical functional capacity in breast cancer survivors, Determine the change in strength in breast cancer survivors by comparing pre and post measurements of the six minute walk test., baseline and 12 weeks
Change intramuscular storage of creatine, Determine the change in intramuscular storage of creatine by comparing pre and post vastus lateralis muscle using MRI., baseline and 12 weeks|Change in body composition in cancer survivors, Determine the change in body composition in breast cancer survivors by pre and post measurements of bone mass as well as lean vs fat mass via a DEXA scan., baseline and 12 weeks|Change in the return of strength for breast cancer survivors with creatine + exercise, Breast cancer survivors who complete 12-weeks of exercise with creatine supplementation group who regained strength and physical function to that of women of similar age who never had cancer., 12 weeks
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of creatine supplementation in modulating strength and physical function in breast cancer survivors that have recently completed chemotherapy.
