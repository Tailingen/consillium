Evaluation of Pertuzumab-Trastuzumab and Taxane in the Standard Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer
This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and the safety of use of this treatment combined with a taxane for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of real life patients to the patients of CLEOPATRA.

In 2013 the European Medicines Agency authorized the use of a new antibody named Pertuzumab in combination with Trastuzumab in first-line setting for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy and the safety were demonstrated in the CLEOPATRA study. This study had inclusion and exclusion criteria that might not be representative of a real life population of women with metastatic breast cancer. Few study tried to evaluate this treatment in real life settings but with discordant results. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and the safety of use of this treatment combined with a taxane for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of real life patients to the patients of CLEOPATRA.
