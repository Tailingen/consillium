Safety Study of A-101 Topical Solution for the Treatment of Common Warts
A Phase 3 Study of A-101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with Common Warts
Common Wart
DRUG: A-101
Proportion of Subjects With Treatment Emergent AEs After Application of A-101 45% for the Treatment of Common Warts, Safety exposure will be measured by the proportion of subjects exposed to A-101 45% who have emergent adverse events. In order to be eligible for A-101-WART-303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 study. The A-101-WART-303 study was an open-label with a single arm where all subjects received A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. Since A-101-WART-303 is an extension study, statistical analyses were performed by stratifying patients by treatment arms in the A-101-WART-301 or A-101-WART-302 studies. In the A-101-WART-303 study, subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these subjects may return to the site to receive A-101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional treatment cycle of 8 weeks., Baseline to a maximum of 341 days
Durability of Response: Median Number of Days All Warts Remain Clear by Treatment Group and Treatment Cycle for Subjects With All Warts Achieving a Status of Clear (PWA=0) (Treatment Cycle 1), Safety exposure will be measured by the proportion of subjects exposed to A-101 45% who have emergent adverse events.
