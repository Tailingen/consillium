Sphenopalatine Block Vs Dexmedetomidine Infusion in Trans Nasal Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery
Improving pain and surgical field by using sphenopalatine ganglion block and dexmedetomidine in trans-nasal endoscopic pituitary surgery.
Sphenopalatine Ganglion Nerve Block|Transnasal Endoscopic Pitutary Surgery
PROCEDURE: Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block|DRUG: Dexmedetomidine|OTHER: General Anesthesia (control group)
Postoperative pain using VAS scale., Pain will be assessed based on VAS scale from (1-10), as 1 is the least pain and 10 is the maximal pain possible at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24h after surgery., 24hours|Surgical field using Average Category Scale (ACS)., Done by asking the surgeon about amount of bleeding on a scale of (0-5) as 0= no bleeding and 5= sever bleeding, every 15 min interval till the end of surgery., 5hours
Pituitary neoplasm is one of the most common sellar pathology. Trans-nasal endoscopic pituitary surgery (TEPS) evolved rapidly, almost replacing the craniotomy approach. TEPS, a surgical instrument, is primarily executed through a minimally invasive approach through the nostril to access a pituitary tumor.

That is why the anesthetic plan must ensure the best possible surgical field visualization and the most adequate analgesia.

Multimodal anesthesia including regional and general anesthesia are obtained to optimize surgical field by decreasing bleeding, reduce pain, promote rapid recovery and potential economic gains for the hospital.

The sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) is considered one of the regional anesthetic techniques that is safe and easy anesthetic procedure used to control bleeding and for postoperative analgesia.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has become popular for induced hypotension. It is an Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist with a sympatholytic and analgesic effect. It provides a unique conscious sedation without respiratory depression. It is used effectively in optimizing surgical field through its hemodynamic stability effect.
