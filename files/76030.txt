Study Evaluating the Safety of Rovalpituzumab Tesirine for Third-Line and Later Treatment of Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
A single-arm, open-label study to assess the overall safety of rovalpituzumab tesirine in participants with relapsed or refractory delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) expressing small cell lung cancer by evaluating the frequency of high grade (\>= Grade 3) select treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Rovalpituzumab tesirine
Number of Participants with a High Grade (>= Grade 3) Protocol Specified TEAE, Number of participants with a high grade (â‰¥ Grade 3) protocol specified Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) during and after treatment with rovalpituzumab tesirine. Severity of TEAEs will be graded at each study visit according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Approximately 32 months
Change in Participant Reported Outcome EORTC QLQC15-PAL, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Palliative Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) is a 15-item self-report questionnaire composed of 4 multi-item scales (physical \& emotional functioning, fatigue and pain) along with 6 individual items (nausea \& vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and global quality of life)., Approximately 32 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is based on independent review of radiographic assessment, defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Approximately 32 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Approximately 32 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Approximately 32 months|Change in EORTC QLQ-LC-13, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer (EORTC QLQ-LC 13) is a lung cancer specific module developed to assess lung cancer-associated symptoms and treatment-related side effects among lung cancer patients., Approximately 32 months|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR, whichever is recorded first) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST version 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Approximately 32 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of participants with an objective response or stable disease (CR+PR+SD) according to RECIST version 1.1., Approximately 32 months
