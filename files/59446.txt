Scalp Cooling in Gynecologic Cancer Patients
In gynecologic cancers, many common chemotherapy agents can lead to chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Currently scalp cooling is the most well studied preventive measure. However, its acceptability and its impact on patients' QOL in Asian population is unclear.
Gynecologic Cancer|Chemotherapy-Induced Change
DEVICE: Scalp cooling Paxman Orbis II system|OTHER: Standard treatment
Incidence and grading of chemotherapy induced alopecia, Will be assessed by Dean's scale Grade 0 - 4 (from 0% to \>75% hair loss), 9 months
Quality-of-life scale, Different functional scales will be assessed by questionnaires like the EORTC questionnaires where all scales range from 0-100. The higher the score, the greater the intensity of that particular item is., 9 months|Anxiety / depression level, Anxiety and depression scales will be assessed by GAD7 PHQ9. A higher score means the more frequent an event is., 9 months|Incidence and grading of treatment-related adverse events, Will be assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 9 months
Dynamic scalp cooling system prevents alopecia by inducing vasoconstriction leading to a reduction of scalp blood flow, thus reducing the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to the hair follicles and reducing follicular metabolic activities. One recent meta-analysis included 10 studies showed that the efficacy was 43% in general.
