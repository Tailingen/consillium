Daily Adaptive Radiation Therapy Using an Individualized Approach for Prostate Cancer
This trial is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial designed to assess whether adaptive radiotherapy with urethral sparing for low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer will translate into a decreased rate of patient reported acute urinary side effects, as measured by the patient reported EPIC-26 questionnaire, compared with the historically reported rate for non-adaptive, non-urethral sparing prostate SBRT.
