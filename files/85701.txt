TILs for Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent Cervical Cancer
Prospective, single center, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic cervical carcinoma.
