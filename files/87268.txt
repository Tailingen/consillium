GC Regimen Chemotherapy Plus CIK Cells for Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in Southern China and South Asia. After radiotherapy, some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma still had distant metastasis. In recent years, some chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, were used to treat patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, including those with local recurrence and distant metastases, with a certain short-term effect. However, chemotherapy alone is still not ideal for effectively improving the prognosis of patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more-effective adjuvant therapies.

CIK cells (cytokine induced killer cells, CIK) are a population of heterogeneous cells generated by the in vitro amplification of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood. The cells are co-induced with multiple cytokines; the lymphocytes with co-expression of CD3+CD56+ have the strongest anti-tumor effect. Because of their non-MHC restricted tumor killing activity, CIK cells have a powerful anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo, which spans a broad anti-tumor spectrum.

In this study, the patients with post-radiotherapy distant metastasis of NPC will be treated with autologous CIK cells in combination with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin regimen chemotherapy(GC). The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the toxic side effects and the short- and long-term efficacy of CIK used in combination with GC chemotherapy to treat NPC in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: 40 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy will accept 4 cycles chemotherapy of Gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen and then are randomized divided into 2 groups. The 20 patients in GC+CIK group will be treated with maintaining therapy of adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion sequentially; the other 20 patients will be followed-up only without CIK cells treatment. The safety of chemotherapy and CIK cells transfusion and the tumor regression status will be observed. The early response and long-term efficacy of two groups patients who accept GC chemotherapy or GC +CIK bio-therapy will be investigated.
Stage IV Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: GC chemotherapy plus CIK cells (Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, Autologous CIK cells)|DRUG: GC chemotherapy (Gemcitabine, Cisplatin)
Complete remission (CR), (According to the response criteria in solid tumor(RECIST), version 1.1)

Complete remission (CR):Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial remission (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters;

Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study ;

Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., Participants will accept 4cycles GC regimen chemotherapy (every 4 weeks) plus 8 cycles CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks), a total of therapy time will be 12 months.|Partial remission (PR), (According to the response criteria in solid tumor(RECIST), version 1.1)
