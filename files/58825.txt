TELESCOPE- TELEhealth Shared Decision-making COaching
Hypothesis 1a: The investigators anticipate that navigator decision coaching, compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) will result in higher quality SDM for lung cancer screening (LCS )(primary outcome), greater knowledge of lung cancer screening benefits and harms, and lower decisional conflict.

Hypothesis 1b: Compared to enhanced usual care (EUC), we expect that TELESCOPE will result in more screening discussions, increased initial for lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose CT scan (LDCT) uptake among interested participants, increased adherence to repeat LCS and diagnostic testing, and increased smoking cessation referrals for current smokers.

Hypothesis 2: The investigators expect that a "booster" coaching session will increase adherence to repeat lung cancer screening (LCS).
Lung Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: TELESCOPE, Remote Decision Coaching with Navigation Intervention
To assess shared decision making, Semi-structured interviews (qualitative data), The change in baseline, three months and five years
Tobacco treatment referral, Semi-structured interviews (qualitative data), The change in baseline, three months and five years
Receipt of tobacco treatment, Semi-structured interviews (qualitative data)., The change in baseline, three months and five years|Completion of diagnostic testing, Semi-structured interviews (qualitative data)., The change in baseline, three months and five years
The investigators' primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of the TELESCOPE intervention vs. enhanced usual care (EUC) on shared decision-making (SDM) for lung cancer screening.

Secondary objectives are to test the effectiveness of the TELESCOPE intervention vs. EUC on screening uptake, adherence with diagnostic testing and annual testing, and smoking cessation referrals and receipt of tobacco treatment for current smokers. The investigators will also use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the implementation potential of navigator-led decision coaching for lung cancer screening (LCS ) and identify components and organizational and individual level characteristics that might facilitate or interfere with successful implementation.
