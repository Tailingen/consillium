Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: lobaplatin , 5-FU ,leucovorin
objective response rate(ORR) time to progression (TTP) toxicities, 12/31/2010
1-year survival rate KPS score, 12/31/2009
patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer have a particularly poor prognosis .The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer is under 10%. Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an incurable disease and due to the lack of effective therapies to manage this disease,the median survival is only 6 to 8 months Chemotherapy which is one of the most effective treatment so far is used as part of combined modality therapy for locally advanced diseases or as a palliative treatment for metastatic diseases.Lobaplatin is the third generation of platinum.Phase Ⅱclinical trials indicate that lobaplatin is effective for esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and small cell lung cancer.
