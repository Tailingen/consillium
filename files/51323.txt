To study the natural course of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma and to determine the usefulness and safety of weekly administration of small doses of doxorubicin.

Doxorubicin is one of the most active of all antitumor agents but at currently used doses toxicity is common. When small doses are administered on a weekly schedule, the toxicity of the drug appears to be reduced.

DRUG: Doxorubicin hydrochloride
Doxorubicin is one of the most active of all antitumor agents but at currently used doses toxicity is common. When small doses are administered on a weekly schedule, the toxicity of the drug appears to be reduced.

Patients are stratified for non-therapy purposes into 2 groups; doxorubicin is given intravenously (IV) every week on an outpatient basis. Patients are monitored carefully, and weekly blood samples are taken to determine the effectiveness and safety of treatment. Patients are evaluated for toxicity after one dose of the drug and weekly thereafter. Patients are evaluated for response to the drug after 4 weeks and monthly thereafter.
