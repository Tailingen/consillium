A SHR-1210 BE Study on Healthy Subjects
The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of SHR-1210 before and after process changes.
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: SHR-1210
Pre-test: Incidence and severity of AE/SAE/AESI (rated based on CTCAE v5.0), Day-1 to Day 46|Formal Test: Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: AUC0-inf, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: the geometric mean ration, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: 90% confidence interval (90% CI) of AUC0-inf, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9
Pre-test: Inter-individual coefficient of variation (CV) of the AUC0-inf of SHR-1210, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: Cmax, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: AUC0-t, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: Tmax, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: t1/2, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: CL, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: Other Pharmacokinetics parameters of SHR-1210 before and after process changes in the fed state: Vss, Based on pre-dose, 0.25-192 hours post-dose sampling times on Day 1 ~ Day 4 and Day 6 ~ Day 9|Formal Test: The incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (Nab) for SHR-1210, Based on sampling times pre-dose on Day1, post-dose on Day 9 and Day 16|Formal Test: Incidence and severity of adverse events (rated based on CTCAE 5.0）, Day-1, Day 1 to Day 46±7
The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of SHR-1210 before and after process changes.
