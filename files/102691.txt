NeoAdjuvant Pembrolizumab and STEreotactic Radiotherapy Prior to Nephrectomy for Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a prospective, open label, phase II, randomised, non-comparative clinical trial, evaluating changes in tumour-responsive T-cells following neoadjuvant stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) with or without pembrolizumab, prior to nephrectomy, in patients with localised primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
