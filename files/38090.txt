In China, Europe and America, colorectal cancer is one of common malignant tumors. It is very important for treatment of colorectal cancer to enhance the quality of treatment, increase patients' survival rate and improve the life quality. So far, surgical resection is optimal treatment for patients with colorectal cancer. As a result, increasing the quality of surgery and improving the perioperative managements have a great influence on patients received a coloproctectomy. Investigators have spent over ten years studying enhanced recovery after surgery programs for colorectal cancer and have got some successful experience. Investigators found enhanced recovery after surgery can accelerate patients' recovery without increasing complications. This study is the first multi-center study of enhanced recovery after surgery for colorectal cancer in China. During this period, the study is aimed to evaluate the safety of applying enhanced recovery after surgery for colorectal cancer.
