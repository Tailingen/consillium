Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan Versus Treatment of Physician's Choice in Patients With Hormone Receptor-positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HR+/HER2-) Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Endocrine Therapy
The goal of this clinical study is to see if sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) can improve life spans of people with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and their tumor does not grow or spread when compared to currently available standard treatments, such as paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel or capecitabine. The primary objective is to compare the effect of SG relative to the treatment of physician's choice (TPC) on progression-free survival (PFS).
Locally Advanced or Unresectable Metastatic Breast Cancer|Stage IV Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PFS is defined as time from date of randomization until the date of first objective progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 29 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause., Until death, up to approximately 60 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Until progression, up to approximately 60 months|Change from Baseline in the Physical Functioning Domain Using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at Week 16, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of global health status/QoL scale; five functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social); three symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain); and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).

The Physical Functioning domain includes 5 questions in which participants will be asked to rate their overall health and overall quality of life as it relates to physical functioning during the past week on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 4 (excellent), with a higher score representing a high QoL., Baseline, Week 16|Time to Deterioration in Version 3.0 EORTC-QLQ-C30 Scores, Time to deterioration from baseline in European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores. Scale scores range from 0-100. For functioning and global health status/QoL scales, higher scores indicate better functioning or global health status/QoL. For symptom scales, higher scores indicate greater symptom burden., Up to approximately 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PFS is defined as time from date of randomization until the date of first objective progressive disease (PD) by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Until progression or death, up to approximately 60 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Up to approximately 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR and Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the earlier of the first documentation of objective PD or death from any cause (whichever comes first)., Until progression or death, up to approximately 60 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), First dose date up to 30 days post last dose, up to approximately 60 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinically Significant Laboratory and/or Vital Sign Abnormalities, First dose date up to 30 days post last dose, up to approximately 60 months
