Adjuvant PEG Intron in Ulcerated Melanoma
Patients with an ulcerated melanoma with Breslow \>1 mm, N0M0 have a significantly higher risk for relapse than patients with a non-ulcerated primary and about a 40-50% chance of developing stage IV disease to which they will almost invariably succumb. In stage I and II patients with an ulcerated primary who have been sentinel node (SN-staged) and found to be SN-negative there is still a 25-30% relapse risk.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety when treated with PEG IFN alfa-2b for 2 years as compared to observation (no treatment), administered after adequate surgery has been performed for ulcerated primary cutaneous melanomas.
