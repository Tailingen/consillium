Population Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Oral Posaconazole in Children With Leukemia
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and Population Pharmacokinetics of Oral Posaconazole in Children with leukemia.
Leukemia, Acute
DRUG: posaconazole oral suspensions
Number, type and grade of adverse events of posaconazole assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number, type and grade of adverse events of posaconazole oral suspensions to children with leukemia assessed by CTCAE v4.0., 1 year|Plasma posaconazole concentration monitoring and its pharmacokinetic, Blood samples for determination of plasma posaconazole concentration will be collected predoses (just prior to a daily dose) on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. Anther concentration (include peak concentraton) will also be collected at least 7days after the first dose., 1 year
Serious Adverse events and drug-related adverse events monitoring, 2 years
Posaconazole as a new triazole antifungal agent with broad spectrum coverage, was recommended for prophylaxis of invasive fungal disease in adults. Some studies have demonstrated the relationship between posaconazole plasma concentration and efficacy and few data have been published in children with leukemia.The purpose of this study is to describe the off-label use of posaconazole oral suspensions in children;to figure out the relationship between concentration and clinical outcomes/ adverse events;to identify factors that influence plasma concentration.
