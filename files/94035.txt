Molecular Data and Their Correlations With Clinical Outcomes in Gynecological Cancer Patients.
Gynger is a no profit, observational study, composed of a retrospective cohort (A) and a prospective cohort (B). The primary aim of this trial is to describe gene profile of Italian gynecological cancers patients, through the centralization of NGS reports performed in clinical practice or collected in clinical trials, and to correlation them with clinical and pathologic features.
Gynecologic Cancer
OTHER: NGS tests
The proportion of different gene alterations found with NGS tests, This percentage will be calculated within enrolled patients that have a report of NGS test at baseline, 4years
Progression-free-survival (PFS), PFS as defined by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1, as the time frame from randomization to progression or death for any cause,whichever comes first, until progression disease (up to 4 years)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the time between first line therapy start and death from any cause, 4 years|ORR, Overall Response Rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial response to a given therapy., 4 years
