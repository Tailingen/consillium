Comparison of Imaging Quality Between Spectral Photon Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT) and Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT)
This pilot study wants to determine to which extent SPCCT allows obtaining images with improved quality and diagnostic confidence when compared to standard Dual Energy CT (DECT), both with and without contrast agent injection.

Depending on the anatomical structures/organs to be visualized during CT examinations, different scanning protocols are performed with quite variable ionizing radiation doses. Therefore, in order to obtain the most extensive and representative results of the improvement in image quality between SPCCT and DECT that will be performed CT imaging on several body regions and structures, including diabetic foot, diabetic calcium coronary scoring, adrenal glands, coronary arteries, lung parenchyma, kidney stones, inner ear, brain and joints, earl/temporal bone, colorectal carcinosis.

quality of the images, A single four-point scale will be used (1: unacceptable, 2: usable under limited conditions, 3: probably acceptable, 4: fully acceptable) based on the European guidelines on quality criteria for computed tomography, Day 8
Diagnostic confidence graded, The diagnostic confidence grade will be calculated on a four-point scale (1: insufficient, 2: poor, 3: average, 4: good)., Day 8|Subjective image quality graded, It will be calculated on a five-point scale (1: poor, 2: fair, 3: average, 4: good, 5: excellent) for each following criterion: noise, artifacts and sharpness., Day 8|CT Dose Index volumic (CTDIvol), To determine the radiation dose delivered to the patients during the DECT and SPCCT imaging procedures.

The CTDI is an estimation of the dose delivered to the organs for each acquired section that is based on acquisition parameters of a water phantom with a 32 cm diameter. The value is expressed in milligray (mGy)., Day 8|Dose Length Product (DLP), To determine the radiation dose delivered to the patients during the DECT and SPCCT imaging procedures.

The DLP is obtained as follows: CTDI \* length of body explored = value in mGy.cm., Day 8|Equivalent dose (mSv), To determine the radiation dose delivered to the patients during the DECT and SPCCT imaging procedures.

The equivalent dose is obtained by multiplying the DLP to the specific organ conversion factor., Day 8|Quantitatively image quality : Noise, The noise by selecting regions of interest (ROI) will calculated., Day 8|Quantitatively image quality : Density, The density (HU) by selecting regions of interest (ROI) will calculated., Day 8|Quantitatively image quality : contrast-to-noise ratio, The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) by selecting regions of interest (ROI) will calculated., Day 8|Depiction of anatomical structures of interest, Depiction of anatomical structures of interest will be graded on a four-point scale (1: visualization just possible, 2: unclear borders but different structures already visible, 3: very good visualization, well-defined anatomy, 4: perfect delineation of anatomy)., Day 8|Radiation dose, An average radiation dose delivered to the patients for each clinical application will be calculated., Day 8|Statistical comparison between SPCCT and DECT, Statistical comparison between SPCCT and DECT will be performed over all images and anatomical structures globally and also for each clinical application of interest., Day 8
