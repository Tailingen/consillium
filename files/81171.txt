Effect of Concurrent Capecitabine-based Long-term Radiotherapy Followed by XELOX Plus TME in Patients With High Risk Rectal Cancer: a Multi-centers, Randomized Controlled, Open-Label Trial
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy followed by 4 cycles XELOX pre- a delayed TME compared with 6 cycles XELOX post- a Regular Timing TME in patients with high-risk rectal cancer defined by MRI.

Pathological complete response rate, Pathological complete response (pCR) rate between control and intervention arm, up to 30days after total mesorectal excision
Disease Free Survival, Disease Free Survival was defined as the time from the date of surgery to the date of the local recurrence, and/or distant disease, or tumor-related death., 3-year|R0 of total mesorectal excision rate, Overall R0 of total mesorectal excision rate between the control and intervention arm, up to 30days after total mesorectal excision|Surgery morbidity, Surgical morbidity reported according to Clavien-Dindo classification, 30 days and 12-months|quality of surgery, Quality of surgery determined using the mesorectal grading system, Time of surgery
This is the randomized controlled, multi-centers, and open-labeled study. Delivering systemic chemotherapy between concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery would be more effectively improved local control rates and improved metastases-free survival rates. The investigators attempted to investigate the effect on pathological response of delivering 4 cycles XELOX between concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy and TME with lengthening the interval from radiation to surgery. In this study, the participants with high risk of deeper infiltration, or extramural vessel invasion, or circumferential resection margin involvement, or surrounding organs and structures invaded et al. were recruited. The participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control and intervention arm. The participants in the control arm will receive best current practice of concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy followed by TME and then a 6 cycles of XELOX as standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The participants in the intervention arm will receive concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy followed by 4 cycles XELOX as neoadjuvant chemotherapy pre- a delayed TME.
