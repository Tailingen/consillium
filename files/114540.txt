Intra-arterial Gemcitabine vs. IV Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel Following Radiotherapy for LAPC
The study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized active controlled study of subjects with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma which is unresectable.
Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DEVICE: RenovoCath
Overall Survival, OS from time of randomization will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the test and control groups using the stratified Log-Rank Test, Up to Five Years
Overall Survival for treatment received and unresected populations, The primary endpoint analysis will be repeated for the Treatment Received and Unresected Subject populations., Up to Five Years|Progression Free Survival, To compare the Progression Free Survival of intra-arterial delivery of gemcitabine using the RenovoCath™ device vs. continuation of IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel following induction therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and radiation treatment for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Disease response and progression will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1., Up to Five Years|Objective response rate and duration of response, Objective response is defined as a complete response, CR, or partial response, PR, determined by Investigator assessment and confirmed by repeat assessment ≥ 4 weeks after initial documentation., Up to Five Years|Health Related Quality of Life, The EORTC questionnaire will be used to assess health related quality of life. The summary scores for the EORTC questionnaire will be calculated at baseline and follow-up., Up to Five Years|Neuropathy Assessment, The degree of neuropathy will be measured by the FACT/GOG-NTX-4 (version 4). The results will be cross tabulated by randomized treatment group for each study visit., 1 Year|Frequency of neutropenia, Neutropenia with onset after randomization requiring the use of filgrastim or other medications for white blood cell stimulation will be compared between the test and control groups through progression of disease., 1 Year|Patient reported symptoms, Symptoms reported by subjects using the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire will be compared between the test and control groups through progression of disease., Up to Five Years|Safety, defined as adverse event rate, and tolerability, defined as occurrence of treatment discontinuation, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the occurrence of treatment discontinuation and the presence of adverse events, Up to Five Years
All subjects will receive induction therapy of IV gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, as well as SBRT radiation therapy for approximately a total of four months. Subjects who remain eligible will then be randomized to receive either intra-arterial chemotherapy with gemcitabine; or to continue gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Subjects will receive the randomized treatments for up to 16 weeks or until progression. Both groups will receive either IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or oral capecitabine following the 16-week treatment course until disease progression at the discretion of the Investigator and then followed for survival for five years.
