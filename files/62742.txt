AFM13 in Relapsed/Refractory Cutaneous Lymphomas
The investigators plan to investigate AFM13 and evaluate its ability to facilitate and redirect the Natural Killer (NK) cells in eliminating CD30-positive lymphoma targets in the skin and, by inference, other organs involved by the lymphoma.

This is an open label, Phase Ib/IIa study designed to evaluate the biologic activity of AFM13 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas with cutaneous involvement. Primary cutaneous CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) represent a spectrum from lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), to primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (C-ALCL), to transformed mycosis fungoides (TMF).

The most indolent form of primary cutaneous CD30-positive LPD is LyP, which is usually well controlled with low dose oral methotrexate, but control of the disease frequently requires life-long therapy. In contrast, TMF is an aggressive disease which does not have a standard of care, as patients are treated with various modalities of care with variable outcomes). The spectrum of other CD30-positive lymphomas with cutaneous presentation is very broad and involves systemic B and T cell lymphomas with various clinical behaviors.

Redirecting Natural Killer (NK) cells towards these CD30-positive malignancies through direct engagement with AFM13 is expected to induce tumor cell killing through NK cell-mediated and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (i.e., cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)).

The primary objective of this trial is to study the biologic and immunologic effects induced by the administration of various doses of AFM13, when given as a single agent.
