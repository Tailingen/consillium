Study to Evaluate Panobinostat (DACi) Pharmacokinetics and Safety in Solid Tumors and Varying Renal Function
Panobinostat (LBH589) is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) which belongs to a structurally novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds. It is one of the most potent class I/II pan-DAC inhibitor (pan-DACi) that has shown anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models and patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

To date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of panobinostat has been characterized in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies participating in several phase I/II clinical studies. Panobinostat PK does not appear to be different in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies. However, the effect of organ dysfunction on PK of panobinostat is yet to be elucidated.

Kidney and liver are involved in the elimination and metabolism of panobinostat. The current study is designed to evaluate the impact of renal function status on panobinostat PK.
