Evaluating Endostatin Plus TC Regimen in Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver Using Contrast Enhancement Ultrasonography
Contrast enhancement ultrasonography（CEUS）could be used to evaluate the blood flow perfusion liver cancer. In this clinical trial, CEUS was used to evaluated the changes of blood flow perfusion of Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver after treated with endostatin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen.
