Secondary Ear Reconstructions Based on Nagata Method
The goal of this observational study is to provide a feasible surgical strategy based on Nagata method for patients who require secondary revision surgeries and to verify its long-term aesthetic outcomes. The main question it aims to answer is:

• Whether ear reconstruction surgery based on Nagata method can improve the unsatisfactory outcomes of primary reconstruction surgery? Participants who had accepted secondary ear reconstruction based on Nagata method in our department will be required to received questionnaires in the follow-up and their photographs will be collected for reconstructed ear evaluation of its realness through convolutional neural network (CNN) models we previously developed.
Secondary Ear Reconstructions Based on Nagata Method
PROCEDURE: secondary ear reconstruction based on Nagata method
Preoperative and postoperative scores evaluated based on CNN, Preoperative and postoperative photographs were acquired for reconstructed ear evaluation of its realness and appearance improvement through convolutional neural network (CNN) models we previously developed., change from baseline in appearance scores at 7 months after secondary surgery
Five-point Likert scale scores, Five-point Likert scale score will be collected to show patient-reported outcomes in the follow-up study through questionnaires to assess patients' postoperative satisfaction. This questionnaire includes overall appearance, size, projection and subunits of the ear and the postoperative status of donor site. 1 = poor and 5 = excellent., at least 7 months after secondary surgery
