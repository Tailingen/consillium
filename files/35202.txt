Effect of Preoperative Budesonide Inhalation on Arterial Blood Oxygenation and Intrapulmonary Shunt During OLV
The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of preoperative budesonide inhalation on arterial blood oxygenation and intrapulmonary shunt in patients received one-lung ventilation
Lung Cancer
DRUG: preoperative budesonide inhalation|DRUG: preoperative normal saline inhalation
Arterial blood oxygenation, Arterial blood oxygenation was assessed through blood gas analysis of sample taken from radial artery, Arterial blood oxygenation was assessed through blood gas analysis before intervention,before OLV ,10 min after OLV,30 min after OLV,60 min after OLV and 10min after two-lung ventilation.
Intrapulmonary shunt, Intrapulmonary shunt was assessed through blood gas analysis of sample taken, Intrapulmonary shunt was assessed through blood gas analysis before intervention,before OLV ,10 min after OLV,30 min after OLV,60 min after OLV and 10min after two-lung ventilation
Population:

The target population comprises all adult aged 45-65 years who was diagnosed lung cancer and to receive video-assist thoracoscopic lobectomy under general anethesia.The study sample will include 50 subjects of both gender and any race or ethnicity.

Procedures:

Eligible and consented patients will be enrolled into the study if all eligibility criteria are met and will be randomly allocated to one of the two study arms:Budesonide inhalation group vs Normal saline inhalation group

Study Duration:
