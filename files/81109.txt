Healthy Human Control Blood Collection for Validation of Biomarker Assay
Human blood will be collected to serve as control in validating clinical studies studying the detection and levels of circulating tumor cells and microvesicles in cancer patients. Targeted population is cancer-free 18-60 year old men and women. Volunteer selection will rely upon a short health questionnaire. About 20 mL blood will be collected from volunteers up to 20 different timepoints. The Procedure involves minimal risk of harm (eg discomfort, bruising) to the volunteer.
