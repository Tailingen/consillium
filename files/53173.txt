High-Dose Chemotherapy Plus Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim together with peripheral stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor works in treating patients with hematologic cancer.
Leukemia|Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: busulfan|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: cyclosporine|PROCEDURE: bone marrow ablation with stem cell support|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
Hematopoietic reconstitution measured daily during transplant, at months 2, 4, 7, and 10, and then every 6 months until disease progression
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell infusions obtained from normal histocompatible sibling donors for reconstituting bone marrow and immunologic function when given after high-dose busulfan/cyclophosphamide in patients with a hematologic malignancy.
* Determine the efficacy of this treatment in these patients.
* Determine the ability to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors given filgrastim (G-CSF) by determining the hematopoietic progenitor cell content of allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell collections.
* Determine the incidence of engraftment failures in these patients.
* Determine the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5, cyclophosphamide IV twice a day on days -4 and -3, and cyclosporine IV over 6 hours on day -1 and then 10 hours on day 0 for 2 doses (allogeneic only). Allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cells IV are administered on day 0.

Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously twice a day beginning 3 hours after completion of cell infusion and continuing until blood counts recover.

Patients are followed every month for 2 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months until disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued over a 15 month period.
