Effect of Short Term Ovarian Suppression on Androgen Overproduction in Overweight Girls With Androgen Excess
This study will test whether short-term suppression of ovarian function can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that one dose of depot leuprolide agonist administration will improve androgen levels in girls with ovarian androgen overproduction. Specifically, this intervention will improve androgen levels after ovarian stimulation testing with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG).
