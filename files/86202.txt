Bemcentinib (BGB324) in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm, phase II study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of bemcentinib when given in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 106 participants with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. The study will enroll three cohorts of participants with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung: Cohort A will consist of participants who received a maximum of 1 prior line of platinum-containing chemotherapy and no prior immunotherapy of any kind. Cohort B will consist of participants who received a maximum of one prior line of an anti-programmed death receptor (PD)-(L)1 therapy (monotherapy). Cohort C will consist of participants who received a maximum of one prior line of therapy with an anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy.The primary objective is to assess the anti-tumor activity of bemcentinib and pembrolizumab when given in combination.
Lung Cancer Metastatic|NSCLC Stage IV|Adenocarcinoma of Lung
DRUG: Bemcentinib; pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate includes all participants who have a partial or complete response., The disease response is the best improvement or change in a participants cancer burden, as measured from baseline (screening) and then measured again at regular intervals over the whole period of the study, an average of 24 months.
Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate includes all participants who have a partial or complete response, or who maintain stable disease., Disease response is assessed every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression (worsens) or study completion, an average of 24 months.|Duration of Response, Duration of response includes participants with a partial or complete response and is measured from the date of response until the cancer progresses (worsens)., Disease response is assessed every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study completion, an average of 24 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of the 1st dose of the 1st cycle until the date of progression (the date on which the progression is initially observed) or the date of death (whichever is earlier)., Disease assessments are conducted at screening and then every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death, whichever comes first, up to study completion (an average of 24 months)|Overall survival, Time to death is measured from the date of first dose until the date of death or the date the participants is last known to be alive. It includes all participants., Survival visits are conducted every 12 weeks after disease progression until death or until study completion (an average of 24 months).|Number of participants with Adverse Events (as assessed by CTCAE v4.03), The number of participants with each adverse event will be summarized., Adverse events are collected from the date of consent until up to 120 days after cessation of both treatments.|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters: Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Cmax defined as the maximum observed concentration., Up to 106 weeks|PK Parameters: Area Under the Curve (AUC), AUC defined as the area under the concentration versus time curve., Up to 106 weeks|PK Parameters: Elimination Half-life (T½), T½ defined as the elimination half-life., Up to 106 weeks|Number of Participants with Clinical Laboratory, Vital Signs, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities, Number of participants with clinical laboratory (hematology, including coagulation, urinalysis), vital signs (temperature, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate), and ECG abnormalities will be reported., 106 weeks
