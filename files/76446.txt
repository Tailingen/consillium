Corrected QT Interval Effects of Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer and the Safety and Tolerability of Combined T-DM1 and Pertuzumab in Patients With Early Disease Progression
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase II study designed to evaluate the effect of T-DM1 on the duration of corrected QT (QTc) interval in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and to make preliminary assessments regarding the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of combined T-DM1 and pertuzumab in patients with early disease progression.

The QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The QTcF interval is the QT interval as calculated using Fridericia's correction; the QTcB interval is the QT interval as calculated using Bazett's correction.

Change From Baseline in Mean Duration of the QTc Interval, The QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The corrected QT interval was calculated using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Each participant had triplicate QTcF intervals measured at each timepoint and the average was calculated for each patient at each timepoint. For each timepoint, a participant's corresponding baseline QTcF interval was subtracted from the average QTcF intervals to create a baseline-adjusted average QTcF interval., Cycle 1 Day 1, pre-dose (Baseline); Cycle 1 Day 1, 15 and 60 minutes post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8; and Cycle 3 Day 1, 15 minutes pre-dose and 15 and 60 minutes post-dose.

Each participant had triplicate QTc intervals measured at each timepoint and the average was calculated for each patient at each timepoint. QTc interval categories are based off International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Tripartite Guideline E14., Cycle 1 Day 1, 15 and 60 minutes post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8; and Cycle 3 Day 1, 15 minutes pre-dose and 15 and 60 minutes post-dose.|Percentage of Participants Within Each Baseline-adjusted QTc Interval Category, The corrected QT interval was calculated using Fridericia's correction (QTcF) and using Bazett's correction (QTcB) from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Each participant had triplicate QTc intervals measured at each timepoint and the average was calculated for each patient at each timepoint. For each timepoint, a participant's corresponding baseline QTc interval was subtracted from the average QTc intervals to create a baseline-adjusted average QTc interval.

QTc interval categories are based off International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Tripartite Guideline E14., Cycle 1 Day 1, pre-dose (Baseline); Cycle 1 Day 1, 15 and 60 minutes post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8; and Cycle 3 Day 1, 15 minutes pre-dose and 15 and 60 minutes post-dose.|Percentage of Participants With New Abnormal U Waves, The incidence of abnormal U-wave changes from baseline was determined based on centrally read electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings comparing each of the three triplicate readings from the post baseline ECG time points to the baseline ECG reading. At each time point, if at least one of the three triplicate readings was abnormal, the participant was counted as abnormal for that ECG timepoint as follows: a large U wave, inverted U wave, or T-U fusion compared with baseline was considered an abnormal significant change from baseline., Cycle 1 Day 1, pre-dose (Baseline); Cycle 1 Day 1, 15 and 60 minutes post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8; and Cycle 3 Day 1, 15 minutes pre-dose and 15 and 60 minutes post-dose.|Percentage of Participants With New Abnormal T Waves, The incidence of abnormal T-wave changes from baseline was determined based on centrally read electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings comparing each of the three triplicate readings from the post baseline ECG time points to the baseline ECG reading. At each time point, if at least one of the three triplicate readings was abnormal, the participant was counted as abnormal for that ECG timepoint as follows: an inverted T, flat T, or biphasic T compared with baseline was considered an abnormal significant change from baseline. Additionally, nonspecific T-wave changes from baseline were considered as abnormal nonsignificant changes from baseline. T-wave changes from baseline due to ventricular conduction or left ventricular hypertrophy strain were considered not evaluable.

Responses were assessed by physical examination and imaged-based evaluation using a modified version of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0:

CR-the disappearance of all target lesions and the disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level and no new lesions.

PR-either the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter with no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., Tumor assessments were performed after every three cycles until study termination or progressive disease (up to a maximum of one year).|Duration of Objective Response Based on Investigator Assessment During the Single-agent Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment Period, In patients with an objective response during the single-agent trastuzumab emtansine treatment period, duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented objective response to the time of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease was defined as either at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.

If a patient did not die or experience disease progression before the end of the study, duration of response was censored at the day of the last tumor assessment when the patient was known to be progression free., Time from the first documented objective response to the time of first documented disease progression or death, up to a maximum time period of one year.|Progression-free Survival During the Single-agent Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment Period, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment (Day 1) to first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. If a patient did not experience disease progression or die, PFS was censored at the day of the last tumor assessment that a patient was known to be progression free., From the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression or death, up to a maximum time period of one year.|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit During the Single-agent Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment Period, Participants were considered to have experienced clinical benefit if they had an objective response or maintained stable disease for at least 6 months from start of study treatment. Objective response was defined as a complete or partial response determined on two consecutive tumor assessments at least 4 weeks apart based on a modified version of RECIST.

Stable disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., Tumor assessments were performed after every three cycles until study termination or progressive disease (up to a maximum of one year).|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An serious AE is any AE that is fatal, life threatening, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product(s), or is considered a significant medical event by the investigator (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).
