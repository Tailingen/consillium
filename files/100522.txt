The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Viscum album extract when used in combination with pembrolizumab as adjuvant chemotherapy in adult patients (aged 19 and older) who have been diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of unilateral breast and have completed surgery.

This clinical trial aims to recruit 40 adult participants aged 19 years or older who have been diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of the unilateral breast and require adjuvant chemotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, after completing surgical tumor resection and radiotherapy.

Potential participants will receive a full explanation of the study's purpose and procedures and will voluntarily provide written informed consent. After screening for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, only those who meet the criteria will be enrolled and proceed with the study.

Participants in the treatment group will receive Viscum album concurrently with pembrolizumab as part of their adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for 18 weeks in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Viscum album. Participants in the waitlist control group will undergo scheduled assessments without any additional intervention for the first 18 weeks, followed by a 4-week intervention phase starting from week 19.

Researchers will compare the treatment group receiving pembrolizumab plus 18 weeks of Viscum album to the waitlist control group, who will not receive any intervention for the first 18 weeks, to see if early administration of Viscum album leads to better outcomes compared to delayed intervention.

Participants will:

Sign informed consent after receiving full explanation of the study Be screened for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria If eligible, participants will be assigned to either the treatment or control group Receive subcutaneous injections of Viscum album three times per week for 18 weeks (treatment group only) Undergo scheduled clinical assessments throughout the study period
