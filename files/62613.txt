response -rate by RECIST v1.1 criteria, Assessment of response-rate by RECIST v1.1. Complete response + partial response, 40 months
Incidence of treatment-Emergent Adverse Event(safety and tolerability), Assessment of the safety and tolerability: incidence, nature and severity of treatment-related adverse events will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., 40 months|Pathologic complete response (pCR), Histological report of radical surgery, 40 months|Progression-free survival (PFS)., Recist 1.1 criteria, 40 months|Overall Survival (OS)., time will be calculated as the interval from treatment start date to the date of death for any cause, with censoring at the date of last contact for patients alive., 40 months|Variations of the Quality of Life, Variations of the Quality of Life score as assessed with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), validated in Italian language. In this quality of life there are specify 9 main symptons: the score range is from 0 to 10 for each one.

For each symptom the "0 score" corrisponds to "no symptom present" (better outcome) and the "10 score" corrisponds to "maximum symptom assessable" (worse outcome). The listed symptoms are: 1) Pain 2) Fatigue 3) Nausea 4) Depression 5) Anxiety 6) Somnolence 7) Loss of appetite 8) General Malaise 9) Dispnea. The total score is ranging from 0 to 90, 40 months|FDG-PET/CT response rate according to EORTC criteria, 1. to determine the rate of concordance with CT scan RECIST 1.1 response criteria and PET/CT EORTC Criteria

   * Complete response: complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease (RECIST 1.1) and Complete resolution of FDG uptake in all lesions (EORTC)
   * Partial response (PR): greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of target lesions (RECIST 1.1) and ≥ 25% reduction in the sum of SUVmax
   * Stable disease (SD): Not qualify for CR, PR or PD
   * Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions or appearance of new unequivocal malignant lesions (RECIST 1.1) and ≥ 25% Increase in the sum of SUVmax or appearance of new lesions.
2. To evaluate the relationship existing between tumor response measured by FDG-PET/CT EORTC Criteria (mainly early PET response as evaluated at first restaging) and pCR-rate (pT0 after surgery) and progression-free survival (months)., 40 months
