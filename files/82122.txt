Head-to-head Comparison Between [18F]-FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI in Lymphomas
Investigating the performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI in lymphomas
PET/MRI
SUVmax, Standardized uptake value of 18F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for target lesion of subject or suspected tumor in each time point window (SUV), 150 days
In this study investigators evaluated Nodal and Extranodal Lymphoma Lesions uptake by 18F-FDG PET (PET/CT and PET/MR). Prior to treatment, all patients will undergo whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MR. The methods' efficiency was compared in the diagnosis of lymph node (LN) and organ involvement.
