A Study of Individualized Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Intrahepatic Cancer
This is a Phase II trial to characterize the safety and efficacy of individualized stereotactic body radiation therapy (SRBT) for patients who have had previous liver treatment or who have primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

RADIATION: individualized Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
The Percentage of Patients With Local Control at 1 Year Post Treatment, For this study, local control is defined as the lack of progressive local disease following CR (Complete Response) or PR (Partial Response), or lack of progressive local disease in patients with non-evaluable disease, who have no progressive elevation in serum tumor markers., 1 Year
The Percentage of Patients Alive Without Progression at 1 Year, Progression is defined as a greater than or equal to 20% growth of a lesion from the smallest lesion measurement, 1 Year|The Percentage of Patients Alive at 1 Year, 1 Year|The Number of Patients Who Experience Grade 4+ Hepatotoxicity, Grade 4 toxicities are life threatening toxicities that require urgent attention., 1 Year|The Number of Patients That Experience Grade 4+ Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Grade 4 toxicities are life threatening toxicities that require urgent attention., 1 Year
The trial endpoints are toxicity, survival and progression-free survival. DCE-MRI and plasma biomarkers will also be collected to explore their use as tools for treatment individualization in future trials. During the current trial, an indicator of liver function, indocyanine green (ICG), will be used to identify during treatment patients who are at excess risk for radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) so that their radiation dose may be reduced. The model used for individualization will be updated as trial data accrue, so this is an adaptive trial of an individualized therapy. The planned accrual is seventy (70) evaluable patients over three years.
