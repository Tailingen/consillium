Treatment of Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Russia"
In connection with the transition to the 8th version of the classification of lung cancer according to the TNM system, there are currently no precise epidemiological data on stage III NSCLC, clinical characteristics of patients in this group, approaches to therapy and treatment results in the Russian Federation. The published statistics only provide information on the overall incidence of stage III lung, trachea and bronchial cancer, which is about 40%. This observational study will make it possible to characterize the Russian population of stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients, approaches to choosing a treatment option for stage III NSCLC and the outcomes of this treatment in real clinical practice.
Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Examine clinical and morphological groups, * gender ratio (husband, wife)
* smoking status (smoker, non-smoker, past smoker)
* proportional distribution: squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, dimorphic cancer, others)
* how many patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement: (N0, N1, N2, N3)
* detection frequency: PDL (PDL \<1, PDL\> 1, PDL \<49, PDL\> 50), EGFR (EGFR + (19.24 exon) EGFR-), (ALK +, ALK -), (ROS-1 +, ROS-1 -) Get information about regional algorithms
* Variants of treatment tactics:

Percentage:

a. Surgery

v. Chemotherapy

-Diagnostic algorithm:

a. Morphological verification frequency b. The frequency of confirmation of metastatic lesions within the thoracic lymph nodes c. F, 10/01/2023
Explore clinical approaches, * Percentage of treatment options depending on:

  a. histological type
* squamous
* adenocarcinoma
* dimorphic
* 3 A st
* 3B st, 10/01/2023|Diagnostic algorithm:, v. from a variant of molecular genetic disorders

* PDL \<1
* PDL\> 1
* PDL \<49
* PDL\> 50
* EGFR +, 10/01/2023|Percentage of treatment options, from functional status

* ECOG 1

  1. only surgical treatment
  2. surgical + drug treatment
  3. surgical + drug treatment + radiation therapy

-Evaluate the frequency of decision-making as a standard practice vs with an individual decision, * Percentage of treatment options depending on:

  a. The nature of the progression
* oligo progression
* systemic progression

  b. Prior treatment options v. after surgical treatment
