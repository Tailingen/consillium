A Study to Investigate Subcutaneous Isatuximab in Combination With Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone in Adult Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The main purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy (Myeloma response) of subcutaneous (SC) isatuximab treatment in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in adult participants with RRMM having received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. After confirmation of the feasibility of SC isatuximab by manual administration, patient will be randomized to 1 of the 2 delivery methods of SC isatuximab.

It will be completed at baseline prior to study treatment administration or other study related procedures. This questionnaire has been designed to assess the expectations of the participants regarding both the treatment (side effects, worth taking) and the administration method (confidence, comfortability, pain, side effects, potential time-savings), as well as to understand previous treatment experience from the participant (experience with injection methods for oncology medication)., Baseline|Patient experience and satisfaction questionnaires (PESQ v2) with isatuximab administered subcutaneously, PESQ v2 is a participant assessed questionnaire. It has been designed to follow up on participant experience and satisfaction regarding the treatment (side effects, worth taking and overall satisfaction) and the administration method (confidence, comfortability, pain, side effects, potential time-savings and overall satisfaction). The PESQ v2 includes items to assess preference on subcutaneous injection method. This questionnaire has been developed using industry standard for instrument development and has been debriefed and adapted based on qualitative interviews with oncology patients. The more general treatment expectations instrument (v1) was further adapted and debriefed with patients to assess manual and OBDS subcutaneous delivery (v2). The PESQ v2 contains a total of 9 items. There are 6 items that are administered for the duration of treatment, and 3 preference items administered only after patient experience of both manual and OBDS., 18 months after LPI i.e., approximately 28 months|Health state utility assessed using Health Resource Utilization and Productivity Questionnaire (HRUPQ), Medical resource utilization and participant productivity will be collected from participants through a specific questionnaire developed by Sanofi. The data collected include number, nature (emergency or routine) and duration of hospitalizations, emergency room visits and outpatient medical encounters and employment history., 18 months after LPI i.e., approximately 28 months|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL), HRQL is assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) myeloma module with 20 items (QLQ-MY20) and EORTC quality of life questionnaire with 30 questions (QLQ-C30); a total of 50 items. The EORTC QLQ-C30 provides a comprehensive assessment of the principal HRQL dimensions identified as relevant by cancer patients. The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 to assess symptoms and side effects due to the treatment or the disease which impact HRQL in participants with MM., 18 months after LPI i.e., approximately 28 months|European Quality of Life Group questionnaire with 5 dimensions and 5 levels per dimension (EQ-5D-5L), Health status is assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, a standardized measure of health status that provides a simple, generic measure of health utility, and consists of 2 sections: descriptive and VAS. The descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical VAS with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents., 18 months after LPI i.e., approximately 28 months
The duration of the study for a participant will include a period for screening of up to 28 days. A cycle duration is 28 days. Participants will be allowed to continue therapy until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs), participant request to discontinue treatment, or any other reason, as well as the study treatment is commercially available and reimbursed in the participant's country, or is available from another source, whichever is first. The overall study duration will be of approximately 45 months.
