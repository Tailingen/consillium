ASK120067 Versus Gefitinib as First-line Treatment for EGFRm Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
To assess the efficacy and safety of ASK120067 versus a standard of care epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gefitinib in patients with locally advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: ASK120067|DRUG: Placebo Gefitinib 250 mg|DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Placebo ASK120067
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy prior to progression and was used to assess the efficacy of single agent ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib as measured by PFS., CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease with at least 1 visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) and it was used to further assess the efficacy of ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib defined as the number (%) of patients with measurable disease with at least 1 visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) and it was used to further assess the efficacy of ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib, CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression and was used to further assess the efficacy of ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib, CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a best overall response (BOR) of Complete response (CR), Partial response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) â‰¥6 weeks prior to any Progressive disease (PD) event and was used to further assess the efficacy of ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib, CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|Depth of Response, The Depth of response was defined as the relative change in the sum of the longest diameters of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Target lesions (TLs) at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions (NLs) or progression of Non-target lesions, CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS)- Number of Participants With an Event, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause and was used to further assess the efficacy of ASK120067 compared with Gefitinib, Time from treatment start to the time of death due to any cause or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 5 years
intracranial Progression-free survival (iPFS), intracranial Objective Response rate (iORR), intracranial duration of response (iDOR), intracranial Disease Control Rate (iDCR), and intracranial Depth of Response (iDepOR), For subjects with brain metastases at baseline, concurrent imaging examination of the brain lesion sites will be performed. Tumor response and PD will be additionally assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (for measurable lesions at baseline) for subjects with brain metastases at baseline., CT or MRI at screening and every 2 Cycles until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years
