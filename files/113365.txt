The Potential Use of Inhaled Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Cancer Patients
This is a pilot, randomized, single-center, parallel group, open-label controlled study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nebulized HCQ01 plus Standard of Care (SOC) versus SOC alone in hospitalized cancer patients with COVID-19. King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) is the study sponsor, and the study will be conducted at KHCC COVID-19 wards.

Approximately 28 cancer patients, ≥18 years of age with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to the treatment and control arms where they will receive ten doses of Hydroxychloroquine solution via nebulizer in addition to SOC or the control arm where treatment will follow KHCC SOC.
