This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of HER3-DXd monotherapy in subjects with refractory locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have been previously treated with ≥1 prior line of systemic anticancer therapy.

The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of HER3-DXd monotherapy for each type of indicated locally advanced or metastatic tumor. Secondary objectives include the assessment of safety and tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of HER3-DXd monotherapy for each type of indicated locally advanced or metastatic tumor. HER3 protein expression in tumor tissue and its relationship with HER3-DXd efficacy will also be evaluated.
