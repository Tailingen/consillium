Radiofrequency Ablation Plus Radiotherapy for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatic resection are main treatments for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Many randomized controlled trials found these two treatments have similar short term overall survival. However, hepatic resection is associated with higher long-term overall survival. These results reveal that tumor recurrence rate after RFA is higher than that after hepatic resection. And minimal residual tumor may exist after RFA. Radiotherapy after RFA may be effective to prevent early tumor recurrence.
