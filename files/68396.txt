Cycles to remission, Total number of cycles of chemotherapy required to attain remission, 3 years|Time to remission, Time in days from randomization to remission, 3 years|Need for multiagent chemotherapy, Need for progression from single agent to multiagent chemotherapy, 3 years|Relapse, Re-elevation of hCG after achieving remission, 1 year|Death, Death from any cause, 1 year
This is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial including patients seen at one of 13 gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers in Brazil. Subjects are eligible if they have low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia according to FIGO 2000 criteria and the FIGO/WHO prognostic risk score. The study includes two treatment arms: immediate treatment with single-agent chemotherapy (center choice of agent) or second uterine curettage. The primary outcome is the rate of primary remission. Secondary outcomes are the number of chemotherapy cycles required to achieve remission, rate of primary chemotherapy resistance, rate of relapse, and overall survival.
