Neoadjuvant Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus to Treat Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma in Patients Undergoing Complete Resection of Liver Tumors
This is a neoadjuvant Phase 2a, open-label trial in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are undergoing a complete resection of the metastatic colorectal tumors in their liver.
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Recombinant Vaccinia GM-CSF; RAC VAC GM-CSF (JX-594)
Delivery to and replication within tumors, IT injection: replication and dissemination of JX-594 following injection of a single colorectal metastasis within the liver. A positive replication response is defined as a \> 2-fold increase in viral genome concentration in the blood(as measured in the first 12 hours following injection) within the first 14 days following treatment.

Note: Viral genomes will be measured in the blood by Q-PCR at baseline, on Day 1 (15 minutes, 3 hours \& 8 hours) post-treatment and on Days 3, 5, 8, 11 and 15.

IV infusion: assessment of viral gene \& protein expression in histologic samples of tumor tissue, Day 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, and 15
JX-594 spread to, and replication within, non-injected tumors after IT JX-594 injection, JX-594 spread to, and replication within, non-injected tumors after IT JX-594 injection as measured by the presence of viral protein expression and/or LacZ expression in non-injected tumor sections from at least 1) two different non-consecutive cuts, both of which contain viable tumor tissue in at least 10 high power fields; and 2) at least 5 cells in one high power field show positive staining for viral protein and/ or LacZ expression, Day 1|Modified Choi response assessment, Modified Choi response assessment based on DCE-MRI at baseline and between Days 8 14 (within 7 days prior to surgical resection), Day 8-14|Toxicity: Grade I-IV Adverse Events (according to CTCAE), Toxicity: Grade I-IV Adverse Events (according to CTCAE); including surgical complications such as delay of surgery, prolonged hospitalization, bleeding (monitor transfusion requirements), postoperative infections, bile leak, hepatic failure sepsis and death, Day 1- Day 43
Patients will receive either an intravenous infusion or an intratumoral injection of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) directly into one liver lesions at Day 1. Patients will undergo a complete resection of all liver tumors at Day 15. Patients will then be monitored throughout their life for disease recurrence and/or general overall survival.
