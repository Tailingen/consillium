Vitamin D Supplementation on 15-Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase Expression in Barrett's Esophagus
This study is being conducted to determine if vitamin D supplementation increases the level of a protein that may be involved in decreasing the risk of esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's esophagus. Subjects with Barrett's esophagus will take vitamin D supplementation for 2-12 weeks depending on the severity of their condition, and receive an upper endoscopy procedure before and after vitamin D supplementation trial.

Arm 1(no or low grade dysplasia): 15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation induces 15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression as measured by RT-PCR in Barrett's esophagus, after 12 weeks of vitamin D supplement|Arm 2 (high grade dysplasia): 15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation induces 15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression as measured by RT-PCR in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 weeks of vitamin D supplement
decreased prostaglandin E2 expression in Barrett's esophagus, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation leads to decreased prostaglandin E2 expression in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 or 12 weeks of vitamin D supplement|effects on cyclooxygenase-2 expression, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation affects cyclooxygenase-2 expression in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 or 12 weeks after vitamin D supplement|15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression differences between RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, To determine whether 15-Prostaglandin dehydrogenase expression in Barrett's esophagus differs between RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, after 2 or 12 weeks after vitamin D supplement|effects on levels of Ki-67, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation affects levels of Ki-67, a marker for proliferation, in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 or 12 weeks after vitamin D supplement|effects on levels of caspase, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation affects levels of caspase, a marker for apoptosis, in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 or 12 weeks of vitamin D supplement|effects on insulin resistance, To determine whether vitamin D supplementation affects insulin resistance in Barrett's esophagus, after 2 or 12 weeks of vitamin D supplement
28-day run-in phase during which subjects are treated with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg po q day or an equivalent dose of another proton pump inhibitor). The purpose of the run-in phase is to minimize esophagitis, which can cause histologic changes that can be confused with dysplasia. After the run-in phase, subjects will undergo an upper endoscopy for Barrett's surveillance or Barrett's mapping as part of routine clinical care. At the time of endoscopy, research biopsies will be obtained for the study. Subjects eligible and continuing in the study will take vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU capsules once weekly with or without daily metformin for a total of two or twelve weeks depending on the severity of Barrett's esophagus. After completion of vitamin D3 subjects will return for an EGD (endoscopy) and biopsies for the research study.
