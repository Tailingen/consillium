A Phase II Exploratory Clinical Trial of Multiple Drug Combinations in the Treatment of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple drug combinations in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib+ SHR-1210（Camrelizumab）|DRUG: Apatinib+ SHR-1316（Adebrelimab）|DRUG: SHR-1316（Adebrelimab）+SHR-A2009
Objective Response Rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions≥4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, up to 1 year
Disease Control Rate (DCR), the proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete or partial response, or stable disease (CR

+ PR + SD), up to 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), the time from treatment initiation to the first disease progression or death from any cause, up to 2 year|Duration of response（DOR）, the time from the first confirmed response date to the first disease progression or death date, up to 2 year|Time to response（TTP）, the time from treatment to first confirmed tumour response, up to 1 year|Overall survival(OS), the time from treatment initiation until death from any reason, up to 2 year|3- and 6-month PFS rates, Progression-free survival rates at 3- and 6-month, up to 6 months|6-, 9- and 12-month OS rates, overall survival rates at 6-, 9- and 12-month, up to 12 months|adverse events(Safety), adverse events, up to 2 years
Immunotherapy has been widely used in patients with advanced esophageal cancer. Immunochemotherapy has become the standard treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The common second-line standard treatment is immunotherapy or chemotherapy, but that are established according to the medical evidence after the progression of chemotherapy, the preferred treatment plan after immuno-resistance needs to be explored. The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of different drug combinations in patients with advanced esophageal cancer.
