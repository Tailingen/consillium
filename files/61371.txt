A Study of Avelumab in Penile Cancer Who Are Unfit for or Have Progressed After Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
This is a phase 2 study whose purpose is see how useful investigational drug, avelumab, is in patients with locally advanced or metastatic penile cancer who are unfit for or progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy.

The usefulness of avelumab in this study population will be determined by anti-tumor activity assessed by objective response rate.

Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its communication with another protein called programmed death protein 1 (PD-1). The communication of these proteins are thought to be important in the growth of tumors. Blocking these proteins from communicating may stop or shrink tumors.

Objective Response Rate, To demonstrate the anti-tumor activity of avelumab by objective response rate (ORR) according to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic penile carcinoma unfit for platinum-based chemotherapy or progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy., 4 weeks
Progression-free Survival Rate, Assess the progression free survival (PFS) of avelumab in patients determined to have PD-L1-positive tumors (including infiltrating immune cells) by the GMP verified Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test with thresholds of \<1%, 1-49%, and ≥ 50% to define PD-L1 positivity, and in all enrolled patients, 3 years|Overall Survival Rate, Assess the overall survival (OS) of avelumab in patients determined to have PD-L1-positive tumors (including infiltrating immune cells) by the GMP verified Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test with thresholds of \<1%, 1-49%, and ≥ 50% to define PD-L1 positivity, and in all enrolled patients, 3 years
