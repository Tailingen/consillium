Sorafenib and Micro-therapy Guided by Primovist Enhanced MRI in Patients With Inoperable Liver Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate Sorafenib and local microtherapy guided by Primovist enhanced MRI in patients with inoperable liver cancer (HCC).

Methodology:

Patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma will receive either:

* local ablation therapy of liver lesions by radiofrequency ablation followed by sorafenib or placebo (local ablation group), or
* radioembolization (SIRT) + sorafenib or sorafenib alone (palliative treatment group).

In each study group, patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms following a pre-defined randomization plan. Randomization will be on a 1:1 basis in the local ablation group and on the basis of 10 (sorafenib only) : 11 (SIRT + sorafenib) in the palliative treatment group.

Patients in the local ablation group will be followed at 2 months intervals for recurrence and overall survival, patients in the palliative treatment group will be followed for overall survival. Follow-up in each study group will end 24 months after inclusion of the last patient into the respective study group.

The assignment of patients to the local ablation or palliative study group will be based on the ablative potential of RFA (local ablation if ≤4 tumors, each ≤5 cm in size). Diagnostic imaging will be used to guide this decision. The assignment to the local ablation or the palliative treatment group will be made by the local investigator.

As a sub-study, all patients will undergo Primovist®-enhanced MRI in addition to contrast-enhanced CT before assignment to one treatment group. The goal of the sub-study is to assess the value of Primovist®-enhanced MRI to correctly stratify patients for a local ablation or palliative treatment strategy. Primovist®-enhanced MRI will be compared with contrast-enhanced multislice CT using a truth panel assessment as the standard of reference. In addition, Primovist-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced CT will be obtained during follow-up of patients in the local ablation group to assess its potential for detection of recurrence.

time to recurrence, In patients in whom local ablation therapy is appropriate, to determine if the sorafenib in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) prolongs the time-to-recurrence (TTR) in comparison with RFA + placebo., 13-18 months (average time to recurrence)|overall survival, In patients in whom RFA is NOT appropriate (palliative treatment group), to determine if the combination of yttrium-90 microspheres (SIRT) + sorafenib improves the overall survival (OS) in comparison to sorafenib alone.

Interim analysis will be conducted after 60 and 180 deaths and a final analysis after 240 deaths., 10-15 months (average survival)|Primovist®-enhanced MRI is non-inferior or superior compared with contrast-enhanced multislice CT, To confirm in a 2-step procedure that Primovist®-enhanced MRI is non-inferior (first step) or superior (second step) compared with contrast-enhanced multislice CT for assignment of patients to a palliative vs. local ablation treatment strategy.

The overall study is successful, if the primary objectives 1 OR 2 are met, AND Primovist-enhanced MRI is at least non-inferior to contrast-enhanced CT for treatment stratification., 3 years
