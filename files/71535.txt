A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, PK, PD, and Efficacy of ONO-7018 in Patients With R/R NHL or CLL
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study. This will be the first-in-human clinical study for ONO-7018 and will be conducted in two phases: a Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) and a Dose Expansion Phase (Part 2).
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell
DRUG: ONO-7018|DRUG: ONO-7018
Estimate of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD will be estimated based on Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observed during the first 3 weeks of treatment, Up to 3 weeks|Incidence, causality, and severity of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), Adverse events with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0 used as a guide for the grading of severity., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Plasma Concentration of ONO-7018, Plasma concentration will be assessed to evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Up to 48 weeks|Antitumor Activity of ONO-7018 (Overall Response Rate [ORR]), Antitumor activity of ONO-7018 as measured by ORR will be assessed according to the response criteria for Lymphoma.Lymphoma., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Antitumor Activity of ONO-7018 (Duration of Response [DOR]), Antitumor activity of ONO-7018 as measured by DOR will be assessed according to the response criteria for Lymphoma., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Antitumor Activity of ONO-7018 (Progression Free Survival [PFS]), Antitumor activity of ONO-7018 as measured by PFS will be assessed according to the response criteria for Lymphoma., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Antitumor Activity of ONO-7018 (Overall Survival [OS]), Antitumor activity of ONO-7018 as measured by OS will be assessed., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
ONO-7018 is a selective inhibitor of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue protein 1 (MALT1) and is expected to exhibit antitumor activity in NHL and CLL. The purpose of this study is to determine the MTD and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics (biomarkers), and efficacy of ONO-7018 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL or CLL.
