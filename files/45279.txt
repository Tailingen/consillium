Vorinostat in Treating Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ of the Breast
RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: vorinostat|GENETIC: protein expression analysis|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: neoadjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery
Reduction in Ki-67 compared to baseline Ki-67, 3 days prior to surgery
Changes in HDAC1 and HDAC6 expression and histone H4 and α-tubulin acetylation in breast tissue and serum samples, 3 days prior to surgery
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the in vivo molecular and biological effects of vorinostat by analyzing changes in proliferation and apoptosis, histone acetylation, and HDAC protein expression in women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vorinostat twice a day for 3 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy 2 hours after the last dose of vorinostat.

Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and during surgery for biomarker laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, HDAC1 and HDAC6 protein expression, and histone H4 and α-tubulin acetylation.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 1 month and then every 6 months for 5 years.
