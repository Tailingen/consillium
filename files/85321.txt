A Study of IMU-131(HER-Vaxx) and Chemotherapy Compared to Chemotherapy Only in Patients With HER2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
The Phase 1b study is an open-label, multicenter dose escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMU-131. The RP2D will be evaluated in the dose expansion Phase 2 study. The Phase 2 study is a randomized, open label comparison of IMU-131 plus standard of care chemotherapy versus standard of care chemotherapy alone.
Gastrointestinal Neoplasms|Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: IMU-131|DRUG: Cisplatin and either Fluorouracil (5-FU) or Capecitabine or Oxaliplatin and capecitabine.
Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in the Reported AE section., Up to approximately 7 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 Extension: Number of Participants With AEs, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in the Reported AE section., From date of first dose to date of last dose plus 30 days (Up to 24 months)
Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was measured from randomization to date of earliest progressive disease (PD) based on blinded central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, or to date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was measured from randomization to date of earliest PD based on blinded central review according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1 after randomization/enrollment date., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with a BOR of CR or PR according RECIST 1.1 after randomization/enrollment date., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the earliest date when a tumor response of CR or PR was observed until the date of first occurrence of disease progression which assessed by the blinded central reviewer or death (due to any reason)., Up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 and Phase 2 Extension: Percentage Change From Baseline in Tumor Size, Change in tumor size (CTS) was measured as the sum of diameters based on blinded central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Baseline up to approximately 30 months|Phase 2 Extension: OS, OS was measured from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to 24 months
