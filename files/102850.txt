RANKL Inhibition and Breast Tissue Biomarkers
A robust knowledge of how to reduce breast density could play a key role in breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women, but viable preventative targets to reduce breast density-associated breast cancer risk are yet to be developed. The investigators propose to investigate the effect of RANKL inhibition with denosumab on breast tissue markers in high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts. Study findings could provide robust evidence to move forward with a clinical trial targeting RANKL inhibition in premenopausal breast cancer prevention.
