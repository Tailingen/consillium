Accuracy of Robotically Assisted Cranial Biopsies
This is an observational post-market study determining biopsy accuracy in a clinical environment using Cirq速 Robotic Alignment Module Cranial. The goal is to determine whether the robotic procedure to be examined can achieve a clinically acceptable value of at least 90% in terms of diagnostic yield.
Intracranial Neoplasm
DEVICE: Cirq速 Robotic Alignment Module Cranial
Diagnostic yield, Determine the percentage of diagnostically significant biopsies determined histologically, 24 months
Target point and entry point error, Determine accuracy of biopsy needle by comparing the target and entry point location to the planned location, 24 months|Time for procedure, Determine the time needed for the intraoperative biopsy procedure, 24 months
The goals of the project are to determine the accuracy of Cirq速 Robotic Alignment Module Cranial navigated biopsy procedures, Automatic Image Registration accuracy within the workflow, and compatibility of Cirq速 Robotic Alignment Module Cranial in the clinical workflow. Patients will undergo cranial biopsies according to standard of care using released products within their intended use with the exception that the accuracy of the biopsy needle will be measured using a specific intraoperative workflow.
