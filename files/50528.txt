Anti-inflammatory Cells in Peritoneal Cavity
Some subsets of lymphocytes are able to inhibit immune response and thus, could be used to control auto-immune diseases and transplant reject. In mice, the main source of those anti-inflammatory lymphocytes is the peritoneal cavity. No data are available in human. This study aims at exploring the presence of those anti-inflammatory lymphocytes in human peritoneal cavity and at determine how to expand those cells.
Ovarian Cysts|Chronic Renal Insufficiency
OTHER: peritoneal fluid and blood sample
relative percentage of regulatory B cells among B cells in peritoneal cavity compared to peripheral blood, Comparison of Breg cell in peritoneal cavity to Breg cell in peripheral blood B, up to 48 hour
B cells will be collected during procedures planned for patients' standard care. Peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood of patients will be collected during coelioscopy for exploration of ovarian cysts or dialysis for treatment of chronic renal insufficiency.

Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) will be measured in peritoneal fluid and in peripheral blood after in vitro stimulation and assessment of intracellular interleukin-10 by flow cytometry. Proportion of Breg cells among B cells will be compared between peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood in both groups.

Different protocols to induce differentiation of B cells into Breg cells will be tested and compared.
