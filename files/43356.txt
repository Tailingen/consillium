Anesthesia in PROstate Biopsy Pain Obstruction Study
This is a multicentre randomized controlled trial in comparison of the perineal nerve block approach between the periprostatic block in the pain control in men undergo a transperineal prostate biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: perineal nerve block|BEHAVIORAL: periprostatic block
The pain of the biopsy procedure, The pain will be measured by numerical rating scale（NRS), which distributed from 0 to 10. 0 represents no pain, and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable., within10 minutes after the prostate biopsy
The pain in 1,6, and 12 hours after the biopsy, The pain in 1,6, and 12 hours will be measured by numerical rating scale（NRS), which distributed from 0 to 10. 0 represents no pain, and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable., 1,6, and 12 hours after the biopsy|Changes in blood pressure during biopsy procedure, The changes will be measured and recorded by multi-parameter monitoring, During the biopsy procedure|Changes in heart rate during biopsy procedure, The changes will be measured and recorded by multi-parameter monitoring, During the biopsy procedure|Changes in breath rate during biopsy procedure, The changes will be measured and recorded by multi-parameter monitoring, During the biopsy procedure|The detection rate for prostate cancer, The detection rate for any of the prostate cancer, within 1 month after the biopsy|The detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer, The detection rate for prostate cancer with a ISUP\>2, within 1 month after the biopsy|External manifestation of pain, A questionnaire with five items: the degree of facial expression (0 for no particular expression or smile; 1 for an occasional grimace or frown, a withdrawn expression, or a disinterested expression; 2 for frequent or constant quivering chin or a clenched jaw), the degree of activity (0 for lying quietly or being in a normal position, 1 for slight contractions of the hip muscles or slight movements of hip, 2 for severe contractions of the hip or lifting the hip out of the bed), the degree of voice expression (0 for quiet or normal communication, 1 for an occasional moan or weeping sound, 2 for constant moaning or sobbing and screaming), the degree of pacification (0 for being peaceful and not requiring pacification, 1 for being able to be comforted easily, 2 for being difficult to comfort) and the degree of cooperation (0 for being calm and cooperative, 1 for language resistance, 2 for body resistance)., 10 minutes within biopsy|Anaesthesia satisfaction, A questionnaire with five items :whether the pain during the biopsy was less severe than expected (scores from 0 to 10, where 0 represents far less severe and 10 represents far more severe than expected); whether the pain after anaesthesia was less severe than the pain during anaesthesia (scores from 0 to 10, where 0 represents far less severe and 10 represents far more severe); weather the patient is satisfied with the overall feeling of the biopsy (scores from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the highest level of satisfaction and 10 represents the lowest level of satisfaction); whether the patient would recommend this type of biopsy to other patients (scores from 0 to 10, where 0 represents they would highly recommend it and 10 represents they would definitely not recommend it); and whether the patient would still want to choose this way if they have to undergo another biopsy (scores from 0 to 10, where 0 represents very willing to choose it and 10 represents extreme reluctance)., 24 hours after the biopsy|Adverse event, Any of the adverse events during the trial, Within 1 week after the biopsy|The number of biopsy cores, The number of biopsy cores, 10 minutes within biopsy|The location of each biopsy core, The location of each biopsy core, 10 minutes within biopsy|Prostate volume, The prostate volume will be measured by MRI before biopsy, within 3 months before the biopsy procedure
This trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled study in which all men plan to undergo a transperineal prostate biopsy. This study aims to determine whether the perineal nerve block approach is better than the periprostatic block in the pain control in men undergo a transperineal prostate biopsy.
