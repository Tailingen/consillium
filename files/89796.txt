Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy With Nitroglycerin in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Nitroglycerin will increase the effectiveness of treatment with induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy by reducing chemo-radio resistance through an increased oxygen pressure in tumoral tissue. The combination treatment of nitroglycerin and chemotherapy will result in longer disease-free and over-all survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC
Locally Advanced Non Small-Cell Lung Canger
DRUG: Transdermal nitroglycerin
Time to progression, over-all survival, 5 years
Levels of oxidative stress through lipid peroxidation and quantification of VEGF Toxicity from treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy combined with transdermal nitroglycerin, 5 years
Nitroglycerin decreases hypoxia-induced resistance to antitumor drugs due to inhibition of Hypoxia Inducible Factor alfa (HIF-1Î±), it increases oxygen pressure in tumoral tissue by augmenting tumor blood flow, increases apoptosis, activation of p53, and induces cellular growth inhibition. Randomized studies showed that the addition of transdermal nitroglycerin to non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with metastasis treated with vinorelbine and cisplatin achieved a significantly better global response to treatment than conventional treatment
