A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of RO7296682 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study was planned to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO7296682 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: RO7296682
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) Determined According to The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] v5.0), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., From signing of informed consent form (ICF) until last follow-up visit (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months)|Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as occurrence of a clinically significant adverse event (AE) from first administration of RO7296682 up to 7 days after second administration of RO7296682. DLTs were defined as following: 1) Hematologic toxicities - Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>=7 days, Grade \>=3 febrile neutropenia, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting \>=48 hours, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding episode and Grade 4 anemia 2) Nonhematologic toxicities - Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, Grade \>=3 fatigue, Grade 3 arthralgia, fever \>40 degree Celsius occurs within 48 hours, Grade \>+ laboratory abnormalities, Grade 3 autoimmune thyroiditis or other endocrine abnormalities, Grade 3 tumor flare, Grade 3 transient increase of bilirubin in participants with liver lesions, transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase \[AST\]/alanine aminotransferase \[ALT\]) and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and any other RO7296682-related toxicity significant enough to be qualified as DLT., Up to 28 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigators' assessment of radiographic disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. CR is the disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters in the absence of CR., From treatment initiation until last follow-up visit (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months )|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the percentage of participants with an overall response of either CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), based on Investigators' assessment using RECIST Version 1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. PD is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for (PD). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline (nadir)., From treatment initiation until last follow-up visit (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Objective response is defined as the percentage of participants having a CR or PR as determined by investigators' assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1. CR is the disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters in the absence of CR., From treatment initiation until last follow-up visit (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months)|On-Treatment Progression Free Survival (PFS), The PFS on treatment was defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1, (1 cycle=21 days) ) to the first occurrence of documented disease progression based on RECIST Version 1.1 Investigator's assessment, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For participants who did not have documented progressive disease or death (within 30 days from last study treatment) during the study, PFS was censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. Participants without any post baseline assessments or with all post-baseline assessments having unknown result/response but known to be alive at the clinical cut off for the analysis would be censored at the date of study treatment initiation plus one day., From treatment initiation until last follow-up visit (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months)|Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of RO7296682, Cycles 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Total Clearance (CL) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Terminal Half-Life (T1/2) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Time of Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of RO7296682, Cycles 1, and 3 or 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) During the Study Relative to the Prevalence of ADA at Baseline, Predose on Day 1 of each 21-day and subsequent cycles up to end of study (Up to approximately 2 years 7 months)|Treatment-induced Changes in Treg Levels in Blood and/or Tumor as Compared to Baseline, Baseline and at Cycle 1 Day 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Treatment-induced Changes in Treg/Teff (T-regulatory Cell; T-effector Cell) Ratio in Blood and/or Tumor as Compared to Baseline, Baseline and at Cycle 1 Day 4 (Cycle length = 21 days)
A Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO7296682 in participants with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. RO7296682 was administered by IV infusion Q3W. This entry-into-human study is divided into a dose-escalation stage (Part A) and a dose expansion stage (Part B).
