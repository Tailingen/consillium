Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (Phase 1), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.

The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is being tested to treat children who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (sALCL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This study will look at the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose, safety and pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin along with overall response of people who took brentuximab vedotin.

The study enrolled 36 patients. In the phase 1 portion of the study, 12 participants were enrolled to receive brentuximab vedotin 1.4-1.8 mg/kg, 30-minute IV infusion, Day 1 of every 21-day cycle, until there was evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Once the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase 2 dose and pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin was reached, participants were enrolled by diagnosis into two phase 2 study arms: relapsed or refractory sALCL or relapsed or refractory HL and received brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg as 30-minute IV on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 16 cycles. One participant received a maximum of 20 cycles at the joint discretion of the sponsor and the investigator for continued clinical benefit.

This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone every 12 weeks for 12 months after the end of treatment (EOT) for progression free survival and then every 6 months until death, study closure, or 2 years after enrollment of the last participant for overall survival.
