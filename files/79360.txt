Doxorubicin Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study
This protocol is designed to obtain detailed information on the impact of body composition on the pharmacokinetic behavior of doxorubicin after a single intravenous dose in children 21 years of age or younger. There is no efficacy component. Approximately 9 children will be enrolled at Children's Hospital Boston. The information gained from this study could be very important in developing dosing strategies for doxorubicin in the obese patient population.
Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin
To evaluate the relationship between obesity and doxorubicin pharmacokinetics in children
To explore the relationship between PK parameters and the patients' characteristics (age, gender, and ethnicity) and to correlate between PK parameters and DXA data (fat mass, lean tissue mass, and bone mineral content)
