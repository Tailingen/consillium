Entinostat Neuroendocrine (NE) Tumor
This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center Phase II trial of entinostat given as a 5 mg oral dose every week (days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-week cycle) in patients with relapsed or refractory abdominal neuroendocrine (NE) tumors. Patients will continue on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are derived from NE cells that reside widely in the endocrine system and other organs and comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms. Because NETs can arise in a broad spectrum of locations they are associated with a broad range of symptoms that may be caused by mass effects and/or by the production of hormones or biogenic amines.

Most recently, entinostat has been shown to down-regulate the number and function of two key immunosuppressive cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), in the tumor microenvironment thereby enhancing the activity of immune checkpoint inhibition. To date, entinostat has been investigated alone or in combination in \>900 patients with cancer in clinical studies, including \>600 patients with solid tumors. Entinostat as a single agent has been studied in metastatic melanoma and in combination has been studied in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and colon cancer.
