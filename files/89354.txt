Ceritinib Rare Indications Study in ALK+ Tumors
This is Proof-of-Concept (POC) study to assess the preliminary antitumor activity and safety and tolerablity using ceritinib (LDK378) in the treatment of life threatening tumors that are characterized by ALK genetic alteration (and/or overexpression in some diseases).
Tumors With Aberrations in ALK|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor|Glioblastoma
DRUG: Ceritinib (LDK378)
Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Investigator Assessments for Participants With at Least 16 Weeks of Treatment, The DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 16 weeks from the start of ceritinib treatment. The assessment criteria are: Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1., Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors); GBM (RECIST 1.1 and RANO, Response Evaluation in Neuro-Oncology); Hematologic tumors (Cheson)., Baseline up to approximately 16 weeks
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local assessment according to RECIST 1.1, RANO or Cheson hematological criteria., Baseline, every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever came first assessed up to approximately 84 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Investigator Assessment, DOR is defined as the time from date of first documented CR or PR to date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, Baseline, every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 84 weeks|Time to Response (TTR) Per Investigator Assessment, TTR is defined as the time from date of the first dose to date of first documented response (CR or PR), Baseline, every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 84 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Investigator Assessments, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of ceritinib to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, Baseline, every 8 weeks until disease progression or death from any cause, assessed for up to approximately 84 weeks|Percent of Participant Deaths During Treatment and Follow-up, Deaths due to any cause during treatment and 30 day follow-up, Baseline up to approximately 84 weeks
