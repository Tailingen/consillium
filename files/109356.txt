A Open-label Prospective Cohort Trial of Curcumin Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) for EGFR -Mutant Advanced NSCLC
The purpose of this study is is to assess the safety and tolerability of curcumin in combination with EGFR-TKIs in selected patients with advanced non-resectable mutant EGFR NSCLC.

feasibility assessed by: Willingness of patients to participate= Number of enrolled/Number of approached patients,, Feasibility will determine whether the use of curcumin is appropriate for further testing; and will be assessed by:

Willingness of patients to participate= Number of enrolled/Number of approached patients,, 8 weeks|feasibility assessed by follow-up rate= number of actual study visits/ total number of study visits, will by assessed by follow-up rate= number of actual study visits/ total number of study visits, 8 weeks|feasibility Adherence/Compliance rate= Number of taken capsules/Total number of capsules, Adherence/Compliance rate= Number of taken capsules/Total number of capsules, 8 weeks|feasibility Questionnaires completion rate= Number of completed questionnaires/Total number of questionnaires, Questionnaires completion rate= Number of completed questionnaires/Total number of questionnaires, 8 weeks|safety number of side effects, Safety will be assessed by number of side effects, 16 weeks
To evaluate and compare the changes in health-related quality of life before and after, Patients' quality of life on curcumin treatment will be assessed by the FACT-L at the baseline, 4 weeks,8 weeks on concurrent curcumin and TKI and 8 weeks post-study. Clinically important difference in the score is considered 2 points., 8 weeks|To evaluate anti-inflammatory properties of Curcumin (assessed by measuring C-reactive protein), anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin will be assessed by measuring C-reactive protein tests will be performed at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks into study., 8 weeks
This is a phase 1 open prospective cohort study to assess the safety and feasibility of using curcumin in conjunction with an EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC. The investigators will use an enhanced bioavailable formulation of curcumin (CURCUViva TM at 80 mg/ 1 capsule per day) approved and licensed by Health Canada (NPN 80027414) that has been shown to have 2-3 times higher curcumin concentration in the blood as compared to previous clinical trials. As primary objective, the investigators will recruit 20 patients for a duration of 8 weeks to monitor adverse effects according to the the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria.Exploratory objectives would include assessing changes in health-related quality of life using the standardized FACT-L questionnaire and evaluating anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin by measuring CRP. If tolerable safety data is obtained, an expanded phase II trial will be designed.
