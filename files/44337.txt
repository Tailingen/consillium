ALBI and PALBI Scores and HCC Prognosis
To compare the predictive ability of ALBI and PALBI grades with CTP and MELD scores.

To investigate the efficacy of ALBI and PALBI grades for predicting the prognosis of HCC and overall survival among different modalities of treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Prognosis
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ALBI
Overall survival among HCC patients as assessed by the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, We will compare the ability of ALBI score to predict overall survival among HCC patients versus Child Pugh and MELD scores, 2 years|Overall survival among HCC patients as assessed by the platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) score, We will compare the ability of PALBI score to predict overall survival among HCC patients versus Child Pugh and MELD scores, 2 years
Overall survival among HCC patients according to treatment modality as assessed by the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, We will compare the ability of ALBI score to predict overall survival among HCC patients stratified according to treatment modality (Surgical resection, local ablation, trans-arterial chemoembolization, sorafenib and best supportive care), 2 years|Overall survival among HCC patients according to treatment modality as assessed by the platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI), We will compare the ability of PALBI score to predict overall survival among HCC patients stratified according to treatment modality (Surgical resection, local ablation, trans-arterial chemoembolization, sorafenib and best supportive care), 2 years
