A Comparison of Immediate Treatment of CIN1 With Cryotherapy and 12 Month Cytology Follow up in HIV Seropositive Women
Based on the high incidence of cervical cancer and high grade dysplasia and increased progression and incomplete treatment of CIN2 and 3 in South Africa, we propose to study the effect of cryotherapy among HIV-positive women diagnosed with CIN 1 versus regular 12 month cytology follow-up. This study will be a dual-arm, open-label, randomized clinical trial for HIV-infected women diagnosed with CIN 1 and receiving care at the Themba Lethu Clinic, Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. CIN 1 will be identified from patients who have had a colposcopic biopsy for persistent LSIL as per standard of care.
Cervical Dysplasia
PROCEDURE: cryotherapy
Regresson of CIN1 to a normal biopsy, Treatment failure is the progression of CIN1 to CIN2, 12 month
Women with HIV have a higher risk of cervical cancer. Screening and treatment formaly of the disease is limited die to poor access of screening programs and multiple visits. Women with HIV also have high progressions rates of disease amd my need to be treated earliers. Cryotherapy is a low option and very easy to implement especially in low resource provinces.

* It is cheaper and easier to administer than Large Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LLETZ)
* No histology or transportation costs of specimens
* Less invasive than LLETZ
* It is nurse driven and easily learned
* It decreases loss to follow-up of patients due to reduced waiting time, transportation costs, time off work and HIV stigma
