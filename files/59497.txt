Radiotherapy and Durvalumab/Durvalumab Combo (Tremelimumab/Olaparid) for Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized multi-arm trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of thoracic radiation therapy followed by either durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab or olaparib in participants with Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) who have completed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and achieved ongoing complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD).
