A First-in-human Clinical Trial to Evaluate an Alpha-radiation Imaging Agent
This is a first in man study to determine if \[203Pb\]VMT-α-NET identifies neuroendocrine tumors with SPECT/CT. This is the first step to testing \[212Pb\]-based alpha radiation therapy in neuroendocrine therapy.
Neuroendocrine Tumor Grade 2|Neuroendocrine Tumor Grade 1
DRUG: [203Pb]VMT-α-NET|DEVICE: SPECT/CT
Ability of [203Pb]VMT-α-NET to identify neuroendocrine tumor lesions, percentage of lesions detected with \[203Pb\]VMT-α-NET compared to the gold standard of NetSPOT or Ga-68 DOTATOC., Study days 1 through 5
Measure radiation dose from [203Pb]VMT-α-NET dosimetrically, Determine the radiation absorbed dose to the organs and effective dose by pharmacokinetics through imaging and blood-measurements., Study days 1 through 5|Single-time point survey, Evaluate the potential of feasibility of single-time point imaging to measure the renal radiation dose, Study days 1 through 5
The goal of this work is to use \[203Pb\]VMT-α-NET as the imaging agent to create a specialized patient treatment plan using \[212Pb\]VMT-α-NET as a first-in-human therapy for treatment resistant or refractory neuroendocrine tumors of the foregut or midgut. The first step is to test the imaging agent \[203Pb\]VMT-α-NET. This requires a very small dose of the drug (microdose) which is then measured by a series of images (like CT scans) over 4 days. Blood samples are also drawn that that time. It is hoped the imaging will identify the tumors so that a therapy using \[212Pb\]VMT-α-NET can be created.
