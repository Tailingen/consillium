HCC Response Assessment by MRI After SBRT
The aim of this work was to describe SBRT different presentations, to study predictive factors for tumor responses following treatment, and to compare tumor response assessments according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
RADIATION: SBRT delivers high dose selective irradiation with millimeter precision to a small volume. The CyberknifeÂ® is a robotic SBRT dedicated device that can deliver 100 to 200 photobeams to the target
tumor response assessments, The tumor response was evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Within the 24 months after SBRT
