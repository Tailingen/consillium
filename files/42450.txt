Does Serum-DXM Increase Diagnostic Accuracy of the Overnight DXM Suppression Test in the Work-up of Cushing's Syndrome?
Background: The evaluation for hypercortisolism includes an overnight 1mg dexamethasone (DXM) suppression test. An important shortcoming is the diagnostic specificity of only 80%, which is likely due to inter-individual differences in gut absorption or metabolism of DXM.

Study hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that serum-DXM measurements will increase the diagnostic accuracy of the overnight DXM-test in the work-up of hypercortisolism.

Aims: The primary aim of this prospective study is to evaluate if serum-DXM measured simultaneously with serum-cortisol in morning samples could increase the diagnostic accuracy this diagnostic test. There are several secondary aims. One is to estimate the prevalence and causes of unusual DXM absorption or metabolism. The investigators will also evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of salivary DXM. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of midnight salivary cortisol and cortisone, and urinary cortisol, will be evaluated and compared.

Design: Levels of DXM in morning serum following an overnight DXM-test will be analyzed in patients under evaluation for hypercortisolism (including incidentalomas). A cut-off level to identify inadequate DXM concentrations in serum to suppress endogenous cortisol production will be established based on the negative tests. This cut-off level will then be applied in a retrospective analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of DXM-tests. This prospective study has a blinded design as the DXM measurements are disclosed after the end of the trial.
