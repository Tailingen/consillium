Tumor Microenvironment in Patients With Localized Osteosarcoma Treated With Mifamurtide: a Translational Study
International, multicenter retrospecitve biological study
Localized Osteosarcoma
Characterize the immunephenotype in patients with localized osteosarcoma treated with chemotherapy +/- mifamurtide for primary osteosarcoma, A gene expression profile analysis will be performed through NanoString, using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, which includes 770 genes related to the tumor microenvironment. This analysis will be carried out on the NanoString platform, present at the Hemolympopathology Division of the European Institute of Oncology, at baseline (Day0)|Correlate the rate of immune cells, and the level of the PDL-1 checkpoint with event-free survival and overall-survival, For survival analysis the following factors will be correlated with Overall Suvival and Event Free Survival age (pediatric \< 18 years vs adult ≥ 18 years), gender, LDH and phosphatase alkaline (PA) levels at baseline (normal vs high), pathologic response (good: chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis ≥ 90%; poor: chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis \< 90%, \[10\]), tumoral miroenvironment components, PD-1 expression on IC, and PD-L1 both on TC and IC., genetic signatures., at baseline (Day0)
International, multicenter retrospecitve biological study that will analyze the tumor micro environment in biological archival samples of patients, who were treated with chemotherapy +/- mifamurtide according the protocols for primary localized osteosarcoma (ISG-OS2 and GEIS-33)
