Process Optimization of Preoperative Biliary Drainage in Patients With Malignant Obstructive Jaundice
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of different methods of preoperative biliary drainage in patients with extrahepatic bile duct neoplasms with obstructive jaundice (hilar cholangiocarcinoma, distal bile duct cancer, and periampullary carcinoma), including PTBD (Percutaneous Transhepatic Biliary Drainage), ENBD (Endoscopic Nasobiliary Drainage) and EBS (Endoscopic Biliary Stenting).
