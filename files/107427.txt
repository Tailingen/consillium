177Lu-PSMA-R2 in Patients With PSMA Positive Progressive, Metastatic, Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This Phase 1/2 study is intended to investigate the safety, tolerability, and radiation dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 and further assess preliminary efficacy data in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The Phase 1 portion of the study will determine the recommended dose of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 for radio-ligand therapy (RLT) of mCRPC, and the Phase 2 portion will expand into approximately 60 patients documenting the preliminary activity (anti-tumor response) of repeated treatments administered, continuing safety assessments and collecting QoL data.

There are 9 multiple-item scales: 5 scales that assess aspects of functioning (physical, role functioning, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea and Vomiting); and a global health status/Quality of Life (QOL) scale. There are 5 single-item measures assessing additional symptoms (i.e., dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea) and a single item concerning perceived financial impact of the disease. All but two questions have 4 point scales ranging from "Not at all" to "Very much." The two questions concerning global health status/ QOL have 7 point scales with ratings ranging from "Very poor" to "Excellent."

It consists of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions use a 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual)., Prior to dosing on Day 1 and every 12 weeks until 1 year after disease progression or early study termination whichever comes first
Recruitment for PROter A206T-G01-001 (NCT03490838) was halted in Phase I by sponsor decision. Phase II expansion portion of the study was never initiated. Importantly, this recruitment halt was not a consequence of any safety concern. Ongoing patients at the time of recruitment halt continued per protocol and completed the 1 year safety follow-up prior to early study termination.

The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the study to assess the safety and tolerability of 177Lu-PSMA-R2 and to assess Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if reached) and the recommended Phase II dose was not reached due to early recruitment halt.
