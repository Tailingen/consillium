The purpose of this study is to help the Dartmouth Cancer Center and the National Cancer Institute understand how to educate people about cancer screening.

Change in knowledge related to colorectal cancer risk, prevention, and screening, A pre-test and post-test are conducted with participants to assess any changes in knowledge related to key learning outcomes expected from the educational intervention (assessed via 14 true/false and multiple choice questions). Participants meeting eligibility criteria for inclusion in the three-month follow-up survey will also answer knowledge questions related to key learning outcomes in the three-month follow-up survey (assessed via 18 true/false and multiple choice questions)., pre-test administered immediately before educational intervention; post-test administered immediately after educational intervention; survey approximately 3 months after initial engagement in study|Change in colorectal cancer screening and other risk behavior intentions, A pre-test and post-test are conducted to assess behavioral intention related to five prevention and screening behaviors (assessed via 5 questions on a 5-point Likert scale: strongly agree, agree, unsure, disagree, strongly disagree)., pre-test administered immediately before educational intervention; post-test administered immediately after educational intervention|Change in colorectal cancer screening behaviors, Participants meeting the inclusion criteria for the three-month follow-up survey will answer three yes/no/decline to answer questions asked in the three-month follow-up survey regarding colorectal cancer screening behaviors. These questions are followed by a skip logic of additional multiple choice and free response questions to assess the nature of the changes (e.g. type of screening used)., pre-test administered immediately before educational intervention; post-test administered immediately after educational intervention; approximately 3 months after initial engagement in study|Change in non-screening cancer prevention behaviors, Participants meeting the inclusion criteria for participation in the three-month follow-up survey will be asked two yes/no/decline to answer questions related to exercise/activity and diet since the time of initial participation in the study. These questions are followed by a skip logic of additional multiple choice questions to discern the direction of the change (e.g. increased/decreased physical activity; increased/decreased healthy eating habits)., pre-test administered immediately before educational intervention; post-test administered immediately after educational intervention; approximately 3 months after initial engagement in study
Change in knowledge related to lung cancer risk, prevention, and screening, A pre-test and post-test are conducted with participants to assess any changes in knowledge related to key learning outcomes expected from the educational intervention (assessed via 6 true/false questions)., pre-test administered immediately before educational intervention; post-test administered immediately after educational intervention|Reach to current and former cigarette smokers, Number and percentage of participants who indicate that they have quit smoking cigarettes within the last 15 years and the number and percentage of participants who indicate current tobacco use., survey administered immediately before educational intervention|Change in tobacco use frequency, Participants meeting the inclusion criteria for the three-month follow-up survey will answer a question about their current tobacco use (every day, some day, not at all, decline to answer) and responses will be compared to participants' answers to the same question administered approximately three months earlier before receiving the educational intervention, survey administered immediately before educational intervention; approximately 3 months after initial participation in study|Uptake of lung cancer screening behaviors, Participants meeting the inclusion criteria for the three-month follow-up survey will answer two yes/no/decline to answer questions asked in the three-month follow-up survey regarding lung cancer screening behaviors since their initial participation in the study approximately three months earlier., approximately 3 months after initial participation in study|Uptake of tobacco quitting behaviors, Participants meeting the inclusion criteria for the three-month follow-up survey will answer four yes/no/decline to answer questions asked in the three-month follow-up survey regarding use of tobacco quitting services and quitting behavior since their initial participation in the study approximately three months earlier., approximately 3 months after initial participation in study
The Dartmouth Cancer Center's Community Outreach and Engagement Team will implement Screen to Save 2 in two formats-traditional outreach using in-person fairs and an online format. The education in both formats will be based on a set of key messages that cover information about colorectal cancer, including risk factors, prevention, screening recommendations, and screening options. Key messages provided by the National Cancer Institute will be tailored to the local context of NH and VT, including information about local options for getting screened for colorectal cancer. A third arm will receive education about lung cancer screening. This third arm will serve as the control arm for the first two arms (the arms receiving in-person or online colorectal cancer screening education) to assess study Aim 1. This third arm will also serve as an intervention arm for assessing Study Aim 2.

Using online or telephone surveys, some participants will be contacted approximately three months after their initial participation. Some of the participants contacted after three months will again be contacted another three months later (six months after initial participation). The three- and six-month surveys will assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to cancer screening, including outcomes from cancer screening.

The primary aims of the study are as follows:

Aim 1: Implement and evaluate Screen to Save 2 outreach and educational activities to improve knowledge of colorectal cancer screening methods, to increase intent to get screened for colorectal cancer, and connect screening services to the target population.

Aim 1a: Conduct cancer screening fairs in Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) 7-9 counties, using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and, where feasible, coordinate with local service providers to make colorectal cancer screening services available to event attendees.

Aim 1b: Utilize web-based module to conduct targeted outreach about colorectal cancer screening using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and refer them to locally-available screenings, healthcare provider systems, and/or healthcare coverage systems.

The secondary aim of the study is:

Aim 2: Evaluate online educational activities' ability to reach 45-74 year old current and former tobacco users from rural (RUCC 7-9) counties, increase lung cancer screening knowledge among that demographic, and encourage engagement with local tobacco treatment resources and lung cancer screening.
