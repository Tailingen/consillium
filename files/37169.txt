A Study of Exercise Therapy in People With Solid Tumor Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether exercise therapy is an effective and safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects when done before standard surgery for solid tumor cancer. The researchers will also study whether the program is feasible (practical) by tracking how well participants follow the program.

To characterize biological activity of neoadjuvant exercise therapy as defined by the change in tumor cell proliferation marker (Ki67) evaluated in paired formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples obtained before (diagnostic biopsy) and after (surgical resection) exercise therapy. The biopsies will be collected as part of the standard medical care., up to 3 years
