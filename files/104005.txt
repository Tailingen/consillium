Image Guided VATS vs. VATS Resection
To evaluate workflow and outcomes of iVATS and standard VATS for small pulmonary nodules. The outcomes of the patients will be evaluated separately as there will be no direct comparison of the two arms.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Image guided Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) resection|PROCEDURE: Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery
Operating Room Time, The time (in min.) from incision to close, 3 years to complete
Time to T-bar placement, The time from patient ready for surgery to placement of t-bar, 3 years|Time for induction to incision, Time (in min) from induction to incision made, 3 years|Hospital Length of Stay, Length of hospital stay (in days) in both arms, 3 years|Radiation Exposure, The radiation exposure (mSV) in the iVATS arm, 3 years
Quantitative Analysis of CT scans, To collect imaging data from pre-operative and post-operative CT scans for quantitative analysis from both arm., 3 years
This is a prospective phase II clinical study to evaluate iVATS and standard VATS for small pulmonary nodules. We have successfully completed and published a phase I/pilot study with 25 patients demonstrating safety and optimal procedural workflow for combining image-guidance with VATS. This phase II clinical study will further expand upon the safety and feasibility of this procedure. Additionally, this data will be used to design a phase III comparison study between iVATS and standard VATS.
