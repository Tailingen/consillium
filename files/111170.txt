Genomic & Proteomic Analysis of Docetaxel & Capecitabine as Primary Chemo for Stage II-III Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy \& toxicity of combined docetaxel \& capecitabine as primary chemo for subjects w/ stage II-III breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel & capecitabine
The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy & toxicity of combined docetaxel & capecitabine as primary chemotherapy for subjects with stage II-III breast cancer.
To evaluate genomic and proteonomic changes after initial therapy with docetaxel & capecitabine as monotherapy after combined docetaxel & capecitabine therapy.|To compare pre-treatment genomic and proteomic profiles in responders and non-responders.|To compare the results of serum-based and tissue-based proteomic analyses.
The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy \& toxicity of combined docetaxel \& capecitabine as primary chemotherapy for subjects with stage II-III breast cancer.Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups: Docetaxel followed by four cycles of docetaxel \& capecitabine vs. capecitabine followed by four cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine.
