New Double Epigenetic Regimen in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and side effect of chidamide, azacitidine combined with priming HAG regimen for relapsed or refractroy acute myeloid leukemia
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Refractory Acute Leukemia|Relapsed Adult AML
DRUG: CAHAG regimen|DRUG: Placebo regimen
Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response (completed remission without minimal residual disease, completed remission with incomplete blood count recovery, morphologic leukemia-free state and partial remission) rate achieved after one or two courses(28 days) induction therapy by CAHAG regimen., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Complete remission without minimal residual disease (CR with MRD-), If studied pretreatment, CR with negativity for a genetic marker by RT-qPCR, or CR with negativity by MFC, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (,1.0\*10E9/L \[1000/uL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100\*10E9/L \[100 000/uL\]), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), Bone marrow blasts ,5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Partial remission (PR), All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Duration of Response (DOR), It is measured the time from initial response to subsequent disease progression or relapse., 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), It is measured from the time of entry into this trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., 1 year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), It is measured from the time from randomization to progression or death., 1 year
Adverse reactions in hematology, Record of adverse events in hematological system during and after CAHAG regimen induction (agranulocytosis days, PLT/RBC transfusion units)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Nonhematological adverse reactions, Record of adverse events in other organs or systmes during and after CAHAG regimen induction (infection and organ injury)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
