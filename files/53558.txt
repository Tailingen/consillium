A Window of Opportunity Trial of Afatinib In Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study is for patients that have Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and he or she will have surgery to remove the tumor. The main purpose of this study is to study how safe and suitable treatment with Afatinib is in participants before surgery to remove the tumor. Another goal of the study is to see if treatment with Afatinib affects the growth and activity of the tumor. Afatinib has not been approved for use by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and is experimental.

In some persons, the growth of cancer cells is thought to be stimulated by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). This is a protein found in the body which binds to the cell wall to sites called receptors and stimulates cell growth. Some cells have too many receptors and uncontrolled growth and because of this, develop into a cancer tumor. There are several other cancer drugs that bind to these receptors to slow or stop cancer growth such as Gefitinib and erlotinib which are FDA approved and used for the treatment of NSCLC.

The drug Afatinib has been shown to inhibit mutated EGF receptors in clinical trials and may be a candidate for the treatment of NSCLC and a variety of early stage cancers. Participants in this study will take Afatinib by mouth, in pill form, for at least 14 days before having their scheduled surgery to remove their cancer tumor. Participants will be observed for side effects and followed for 30 days after surgery to assess the results after surgery.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: BIBW 2992 (Afatinib)
Feasibility, The primary endpoint will demonstrate feasibility of neoadjuvant treatment of BIBW 2992 in patients with early stage (IA to IIIA) NSCLC awaiting surgical resection. Feasibility will be assessed based on the ability to complete the treatment for each patient. For our feasibility endpoint we will declare the treatment "completed" if a patient completes at least 14 days of treatment, had a thoracotomy for the planned surgical resection, and 30 days of post operative care., 30 days post operative care
Safety and Efficacy, The secondary objective is to determine whether pre-operative BIBW 2992 treatment affects metabolic tumor labeling, as measured by PET-CT scanning. We will measure the absolute and the percentage change in SUV from baseline to follow-up., 30 post operative care
