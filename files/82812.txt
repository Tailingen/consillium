A Study Comparing Zanubrutinib With Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in Participants With Previously Untreated CLL or SLL
To compare efficacy between zanubrutinib versus bendamustine and rituximab in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL, as measured by progression free survival assess by Independent Central Review.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Venetoclax
Cohort 1: Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Independent Central Review (ICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until first documentation of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the ICR per 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) guidelines with modifications for treatment-related lymphocytosis in participants with CLL and the Revised Criteria for Response for Malignant Lymphoma in participants with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)., Up to approximately 3 years and 7 months (as of cut-off date of 07MAY2021)
Cohort 1: Overall Response Rate (ORR) Between Treatment Groups as Determined by ICR, ORR in Cohort 1 is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, partial response, or partial response with lymphocytosis, determined by the ICR., Up to 5 years|Pooled Cohort 1/1a: Overall Response Rate (ORR) Between Treatment Groups, Up to 5 years|Cohort 1: Overall Survival (OS) Between Treatment Groups as Determined by the ICR, OS in Cohort 1 is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any reason., Up to 5 years|Cohort 1: Duration of Response (DOR) Between Treatment Groups as Determined by the ICR, Duration of response in Cohort 1 determined using the iwCLL criteria with modification for treatment related lymphocytosis (in participants with CLL) and the Lugano Classification for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; in participants with SLL), is defined as the time from the date that criteria for response (ie, partial response with lymphocytosis \[PR-L\] or better) are first met to the date that disease progression is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Pooled Cohort 1/1a: Duration of Response (DOR) Between Treatment Groups, Up to 5 years|Cohort 1: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Between Treatment Groups Determined by Investigator Assessment (IA), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until first documentation of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the investigator per iwCLL guidelines with modifications for treatment-related lymphocytosis in participants with CLL and the Revised Criteria for Response for Malignant Lymphoma in participants with SLL., Up to 5 years|Pooled Cohort 1/1a: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Between Treatment Groups Determined by Investigator Assessment (IA), Up to 5 years|Cohort 1: Patient-reported Outcomes as Assessed by the (European Quality Of Life 5D 5L) EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire, Up to 5 years|Cohort 1: Patient-reported Outcomes as Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Questionnaire., Up to 5 years|Cohort 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 5 years|Cohort 2: Progression-free Survival (PFS), Up to 5 years|Cohort 2: Duration of Response (DOR), Up to 5 years|Cohort 3: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 5 years|Cohort 3: Progression-free Survival (PFS), Up to 5 years|Cohort 3: Duration of Response (DOR), Up to 5 years|Cohort 3: Rate of Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease (MRD4), Up to 5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to 5 years|Apparent Rate of Clearance of Zanubrutinib From Plasma (CL/F)CL/F, Predose up to 12 hours postdose|Cohort 1 Zanubrutinib Only Arms: Area-Under-Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours Postdose (AUC0-12), Predose up to 12 hours postdose|Cohort 3: Area-Under-Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours Postdose (AUC0-12) of Zanubrutinib, Predose up to 12 hours postdose
This is a global phase 3, open label, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus bendamustine plus rituximab (B+R) in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), including participants without del(17p) \[Cohort 1\] and participants with del(17p) \[Cohort 2 and Cohort 3\]. Participants in Cohort 1 are randomized 1:1 to zanubrutinib (Arm A) or bendamustine plus rituximab (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by age, Binet stage, immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status, and geographic region. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive treatment with zanubrutinib. Participants in Cohort 3 will receive treatment with zanubrutinib and venetoclax.
