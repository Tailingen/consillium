Clinical Evaluation of Yervoy in Combination With Adoptive T Cell Transfer for Metastatic Melanoma Patients
A rationally designed combination of adoptive T cell therapy and ipilimumab could strongly increase the proportion of CR patients, as well as the durability of response, as compared to ipilimumab or TIL alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of those two important modalities could result in a durable (≥ 1 year) complete response rate of 30% in stage IV melanoma patients.
A Combination of Adoptive T Cell Therapy and Ipilimumab Could Increase the Proportion of CR Patients, and Durability of Response
BIOLOGICAL: Adoptive cell transfer|DRUG: Ipilimumab 5 MG/ML Injection [Yervoy]
Determine the response rate of the combination of ipilimumab with young TIL protocol and the CR rate of this combination according to modified RECIST 1.1., October 2017
• Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment regimen., Toxicity will be reported by type and severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4., Follow up for 1 year
Determine duration of response, follow up for 1 year|Determine overall survival, follow up for 1 year
