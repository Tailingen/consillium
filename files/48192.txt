Biological Effect of Warfarin on Pancreatic Cancer
This study aims to asses the effect of warfarin on markers of AXL pathway in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Warfarin
Determine change in AXL pathway, Determine change in circulating biomarkers of AXL pathways (including phosphogas6, soluble AXL)., 30 days
Assess adverse events, Assess the adverse events (per CTCAE v4.0 criteria) associated with the addition of warfarin in patients with pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy., 30 days|Effect of warfarin on tissue markers, Evaluate the effect of warfarin on tissue markers of the AXL pathways measured by western blot analysis in tumor tissue and expression levels of EMY markers following warfarin therapy., 30 days|Antitumor effect, Antitumor effects will be observed by change in CA9-19 levels pre and post warfarin. therapy., 30 days
There is emerging evidence from pre-clinical models that Axl activation is critical for the tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Warfarin is a readily available drug in the clinical setting and could be easily, safely, and quickly used in patients in combination with known cytotoxic chemotherapies to improve overall survival.

Oral warfarin has been well tolerated in both prophylaxis for catheter-associated thrombosis and in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

The aim of this trial is to confirm the preclinical evidence that warfarin affects AXL pathway in patients with pancreatic cancer. This will validate the effect of escalating doses of warfarin on circulating biomarkers of AXL.
