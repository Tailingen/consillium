LCCC 1128: Open Label Phase II Trial of the BRAF Inhibitor (Dabrafenib) and the MEK Inhibitor (Trametinib) in Unresectable Stage III and Stage IV BRAF Mutant Melanoma; Correlation of Resistance With the Kinome and Functional Mutations
This phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600E mutant, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to the combination of a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib). Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression.If a subject is removed from the study for one of a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, an inability to tolerate the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, a need to receive other therapy or completion of 3-years of study treatment without progression, and the subject later receives, as part of his/her standard of care, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib and progresses on the standard of care regimen, then the subject may be contacted by the treating physician to be put back on to the LCCC 1128 protocol and have a progression biopsy at this progression time point. Markers of resistance will be explored by performing near kinome-wide profiling on tumor samples, and in patients who co-enroll in institutional protocol LCCC1108, by sequencing tumors using NextGen DNA sequencing technology. Overall response rate and duration to this combination will also be assessed.

DRUG: BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib
Change in Kinase Expression, The primary outcome of this study is to identify kinases that are differentially expressed pre- and post-treatment with BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors. The kinases will be profiled using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and reported as a sum of the Log 2 Fold Change between baseline and one year post treatment across all patients, Baseline and One year post treatment|Kinome Signature Predictive of Resistance, Prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) based on nearest shrunken centroid will also be carried out to identify a subset of kinases that predicts resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibition., One year post treatment
BRAF and MEK Inhibition Associated With New Functional Mutations in the Approximately 150 Oncogenes, The secondary outcome measure is to explore whether resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is associated with new functional mutations in the approximately 150 oncogenes / tumor suppressor genes that are assessed in more than 10% of the tumors (using Next Generation (NextGen) DNA sequencing technology) in the subset of patients who co-enroll in a correlative study, with particular focus on one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS, MEK1, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 8 (MAP3K8) or Cancer Osaka Thyroid (COT), and PTEN)., One year|Overall Response Rate (ORR), To determine the disease overall response rate (ORR: complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)/total number of patients) as measured radiographically via Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, One year post treatment|Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response is defined as the time from documentation of response (Complete or Partial) to time of disease progression or death. Response was measured radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions. Complete Response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response as a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and Progressive Disease as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions., One year post treatment|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from Day 1 of protocol treatment to the date of progression as measured radiographically using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) or to the date of death. Per RECIST, Progressive Disease as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions., One year post treatment|Rate of Overall Survival (OS) at 12 Months, The rate of overall survival is defined as the percentage of patients still alive at one year from Day 1 of protocol treatment, One year post treatment
The present phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600E mutant, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition. Overall response rate and duration to this combination will also be assessed.

Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression (clinical or radiological). Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit. We anticipate that up to 50% of patients may continue on therapy post-progression for 2-8 weeks.

BRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib is ongoing in metastatic melanoma to establish the safety of this combination, and to determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for each agent. Expansion cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were included in the phase I to characterize the safety in more detail, and to explore the efficacy of this combination. The combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of rash compared to either agent alone and with just 1 report of cutaneous SCC.

This proposed study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib 2mg QD and dabrafenib 150 mg BID. Despite a very promising overall response rate of 81%, these patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance mutations, and given the cooperative signaling network of kinases that sense inhibition of key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological intervention. The study objectives are as follows: Objectives Primary Objective To identify kinases that are differentially expressed pre- and post-treatment with BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors, and to determine a kinome signature predictive of resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition in stage III/IV melanoma Secondary Objectives To explore whether resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is associated with new functional mutations in the approximately 150 oncogenes / tumor suppressor genes that are assessed in more than 10% of the tumors (using NextGen DNA sequencing technology) in the subset of patients who co-enroll in LCCC1108, with particular focus on one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS, MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN) To determine the overall response rate (ORR: complete response + partial response) as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate the duration of ORR as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) as defined by RECISTv1.1 To estimate the rate of overall survival (OS) at 1 year from day 1 of treatment

Primary Endpoint Kinome signature pathway will be based on comparison of kinome expression from pre- and post-treatment biopsies using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with mass spectrometry.
