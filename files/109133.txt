Study of XL184 (Cabozantinib) in Adults With Glioblastoma Multiforme
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate and 6-month progression-free survival rate of XL184 in subjects with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme. XL184 is a new chemical entity that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET, kinases implicated in tumor formation, growth and migration.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: XL184
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Response and progression were determined per modified MacDonald Criteria and modified RANO criteria for GBM using imaging and clinical features, 8 weeks until progressive disease
Duration of Objective Response (Months), Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective response that was subsequently confirmed at a visit that was â‰¥ 28 days later to disease progression or death due to any cause., Assessed during periodically scheduled visits until progressive disease|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Response and progression were determined per modified MacDonald Criteria and modified RANO criteria for GBM using imaging and clinical features, Assessed during periodically scheduled visits until progressive disease|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dose to death due to any cause., Assessed during periodically scheduled visits until progressive disease
