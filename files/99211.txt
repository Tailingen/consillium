D-1553 Tablet Versus Docetaxel Injection for KRAS G12C Mutation-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Prior Standard Therapy Failure
The purpose of this project is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of D-1553 Tablet versus Docetaxel Injection in subjects with prior standard therapy failure kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) G12C mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on RECIST 1.1 was used as the primary endpoint.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: D-1553 Tablet|DRUG: Docetaxel injection
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from subject randomization (first treatment) to first disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, was assessed by an independent Review Committee (IRC) per Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Baseline up to 3 years
Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Baseline up to 3 years|Objective mitigation rate (ORR), According to RECIST 1.1 criteria, proportion of patients with confirmed tumor volume reduction to pre-specified values and maintained minimum requirements

, namely the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., Baseline up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), From the time of tumor first evaluated as complete or partial response to the time of first disease progression or death from various causes., Baseline up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), According to RECIST 1.1 criteria, proportion of patients with confirmed tumor volume reduction to pre-specified values and maintained minimum requirements

, namely the proportion of patients with CR, PR and stable disease (SD)., Baseline up to 3 years|Time to response (TTR), Time from patient randomization (first treatment) to first response per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Baseline up to 3 years|Patient-reported outcome (PRO), Reports of their health status directly from patients, Baseline up to 3 years|Abnormal laboratory test indicators, The occurrence of laboratory test indicators exceed the normal range, From the subject signed the informed consent form to 30 days after the last dose|Adverse event rate, The occurrence of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs), From the subject signed the informed consent form to 30 days after the last dose|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Time to maximum plasma concentration after dosing, Pre-dose and 2 hours after D1553 administration on Day 1 of cycle 1 and cycle 3. Each cycle is 21 days.|Half life (t1/2), Time required for plasma concentrations to drop by half, Pre-dose and 2 hours after D1553 administration on Day 1 of cycle 1 and cycle 3. Each cycle is 21 days.
