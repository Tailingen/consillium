Orelabrutinib With R-CHOP-like Regimen for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Untreated Non-GCB DLBCL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orelabrutinib combined with rituximab，followed by orelabrutinib combined with R-CHOP-like regimen for newly diagnosed untreated Non-GCB DLBCL Patients
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|DRUG: CHOP-like Regimen
Complete Response Rate, The rate of patients who achieved complete response after treatment by OR-CHOP-like, At the end of Cycle 6（each cycle is 21 days）
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The rate of patients who achieved CR or PR after treatment by OR-CHOP-like, At the end of Cycle 3 and Cycle 6（each cycle is 21 days）|Progression-free survival（PFS）, PFS will be assessed from the first OR(Orelabrutinib plus Rituximab) given to date of progression, relapse, death or end of follow-up, up to 24 month after the end of last patient's treatment|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of the therapeutic regimen measured by the incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, initiation of study drug until 30 days after last dose|Mini response rate, The rate of patients who achieve ≥25% tumor reduction after OR treatment, the first 21 days
The study will start with an initial 21-days of induction therapy with orelabrutinib and rituximab，following imaging examinations to evaluate response rates. Then treatment with 6 cycles chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP-like) either alone or in combination with orelabrutinib will depend on response during induction phase. Each cycle is 21 days.
