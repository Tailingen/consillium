Retrospective Cervical Cancer Oligo States (Recurrence, Metastasis) Multicentre Outcomes Study
This multi centric international retrospective study aims to register patients with oligo metastatic and oligo recurrent cervical cancer. The study will register patients in planned period with an aim to analyse clinical outcomes with or without use of radiation in this setting.
Cancer, Cervical|Recurrence|Metastasis
OTHER: Concurrent Chemoradiation, Systemic Chemotherapy other locally directed therapies (like surgery, ablation, etc.)
3-year overall survival, To estimate overall survival of patients diagnosed with oligo-recurrent and (induced) oligo-metastatic cervix cancer., From date of diagnosis of recurrence untill the date of death due to any cause or date of censoring at the last time the subject was known to be alive, whichever came first, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study
3-year Infield progression free survival, To estimate infield progression-free survival and progression-free interval of patients diagnosed with oligo-recurrent and (induced) oligo-metastatic cervix cancer., From date of first disease progression to date of subsequent progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study|3- year Progression free survival, To estimate overall progression-free survival of patients diagnosed with oligo-recurrent and (induced) oligo-metastatic cervix cancer., From date of first disease progression to subsequent disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study|Dose response relationship of nodal and visceral progressions, Radiation Dose-Response Curve will be generated for mean time to nodal and visceral progressions at different dose level, From date of start of treatment of disease progression, assessed upto 3 years|Dose response relationship within setting of re-irradiation (infield progressions), Radiation Dose-Response Curve will be generated for mean time to infield progression at different dose level, From date of start of treatment of disease progression, assessed upto 3 years|Moderate to severe adverse events within the (induced) oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting ( including toxicity with targeted agents like bevacuzimab and pembrolizumab), Number or percent of participants with treatment-related moderate to severe adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 (If available), From date of start of treatment of recurrence to end of study, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study|Report on various risk groups within oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting, Clinical, pathological, and treatment-related factors of patients recorded during the sudy will be used to develop multivariable risk models to identify risk factors and define various risk groups within oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting, From date of recurrence to end of study, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study|Nomogram which correlates risk groups with expected outcomes within the (induced) oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting, Nomogram will be developed which could estimate the probability of a expected outcomes (overall survival, infield progression free survival, overall progression free survival) based on the risk group the patient belongs to within oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting., From date of recurrence to end of study, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study|Tissue based biomarkers, Sponsor Institute will facilitate storage of biopsy tissue of patients within oligo-metastatic and oligo-recurrent setting included in this study. In future, these tissue samples will be used for translational reseach in this field., From date of start of recurrence to end of study, assessed upto 3 years after initiation of the study
