Intermittent Darolutamide Treatment in the Triple Therapy of mHSPC
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent use of darolutamide compared to long-term use in combination with ADT and docetaxel in the treatment of mHSPC patients.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer|Intermitent Anti-androgen Therapy
DRUG: Darolutamide continuous|DRUG: Darolutamide intermittent
Radiographic Progression Free Survival, rPFS, 36 months|Overall Survival, OS, 36 months
Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, Time to mCRPC, 36 months|Time to pain progression, TTPP, through study completion, an average of 3 year
Patients will firstly receive 6 months of darolutamide in combination with docetaxel and ADT treatment.

1. When the patient reaches:

1. PSA â‰¤ 0.2ng/ml
2. Or PSA \> 0.2ng/ml but with more that 90% decrease comparing baseline
3. Without newly discovered metastatic lesions. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either continuous treatment group or intermittent treatment group (1) Continuous treatment group: Darolutamide: 600mg, bid+ADT: Leuprorelin (3.6mg qm or 10.8mg q3m) or goserelin 80mg qm until mCRPC; (2) Intermittent treatment group: Only ADT as background treatment without Darolutamide. PSA check every three months, when the patient's PSA \> 1ng/ml (or PSA \> 1ng/ml and PSA has risen by more than 20% comparing baseline), restart the darolutamide, until mCRPC.

2. When the patient:

1. PSA \> 0.2ng/ml and has not decreased by 90% compared to baseline
2. Or has new metastatic lesions, they will exit the study. Imaging assessment will be conducted every 3 months
