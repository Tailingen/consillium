Probiotics for Chalaziosis Treatment in Children
There is growing evidence encouraging the use of probiotics in many conditions in children. The aim of the investigator's study is to define the possible beneficial impact of probiotics on paediatric patients affected by chalaziosis.
Chalazion
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: probiotics|OTHER: conservative treatment
Time Taken for a Complete Resolution of the Chalaziosis, change in the time taken for complete resolution of chalaziosis (complete disappearance of the eyelid mass lesions), 3 months|Number of Recurrences, complete ophthalmological evaluation was done weekly during the first month and then monthly in order to evaluate possible recurrences (presence of a new eyelid mass lesion), 3 months
Prospective comparative pilot study on 26 children suffering from chalaziosis. They will be randomly divided in two groups. One group will receive conservative treatment and the other one will receive conservative treatment and a daily supplementation of probiotics. All patients will be evaluated at 2-week intervals for 3 months. If the lesion will not disappear or decrease in size to 1 mm or less in diameter on subsequent visits, the same procedure will be repeated for another 3-months cycle. The follow up periods extend from 3 to 6 months according to the results.
