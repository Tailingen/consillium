Safety and Efficacy Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Chinese Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma (MK-3475-151/KEYNOTE-151)
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and objective response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Chinese participants with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, with disease progression following first line chemotherapy or targeted therapy. ORR will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

With Amendment 6 (effective date 18-Mar-2022), once the study objectives have been met or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and may be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

Number of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE. The number of all participants who experienced at least one AE is presented., Up to approximately 17 months (Through data cutoff date of 27-December-2017)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, The number of all participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 17 months (through data cutoff date of 27-December-2017)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The ORR per RECIST 1.1 for participants is presented. Participants without response data were treated as non-responders. ORR was analyzed using an exact method based on binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) and is reported as percentage of participants., Up to approximately 17 months (through data cutoff date of 27-December-2017)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first day of study treatment to death due to any cause. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months., Up to approximately 76 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 for participants is presented., Up to approximately 76 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. DOR assessments were based on blinded independent central review (BICR). DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months., Up to approximately 76 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), ORR was defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all lesions and no new lesions confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 50% decrease in tumor burden relative to baseline confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation) per irRECIST assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The ORR per irRECIST for participants is presented. Participants without response data were treated as non-responders. ORR was analyzed using an exact method based on binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) and is reported as percentage of participants., Up to approximately 76 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per irRECIST based on blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Using irRECIST, progressive disease was defined as at least a 25% increase in tumor burden relative the minimum recorded tumor burden confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation.
