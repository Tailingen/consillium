Bio-Repository of High Risk Cohorts for the Early Detection of Pancreas Cancer
Bio-repository to collect bio-specimens from patients with 1) pancreatic cysts and 2) patients at high risk, defined by family history and/or genetic mutations, for pancreatic cancer.

Pancreas Cancer, Development of Pancreas Cancer, 5-10 years
Observational study to collect bio-specimens from 2 separate patient cohorts identified to be at high risk for subsequent development of pancreas cancer.

1. Patients diagnosed with a pancreatic cyst undergoing either endoscopic ultrasound or surgery. Bio-specimens collected include pancreatic cyst fluid and blood. These will be collected using a standard operating protocol.
2. Patients defined as a high risk individual for pancreas cancer by family history and/or known genetic mutations. Bio-specimens collected include blood. This will be collected using a standard operating protocol.
