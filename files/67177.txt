Biomarkers of Pancreatic Cancer and New Way to Detection
Amphoteric regulatory protein (AREG), a member of epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is expressed in many tumors.Our study confirmed that the expression of AREG in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer is significantly higher than that of patients with benign pancreatic diseases and healthy people, which is expected to become a new early serum marker of pancreatic cancer. The serum concentration of AREG was detected by traditional ELISA and compared with CA-199, which was a conventional tumor marker of pancreatic cancer. Next, we compare the advantages of using sensor to detect AREG compared with ELISA.
Pancreatic Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer, Diagnosis based on the concentration of serum biomarkers, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Serum was collected ï¼š pancreatic cancer : healthy control =200:200 Clinical data were collected: age, gender, diagnosis, cancer stage, CA199 level at initial diagnosis, histopathological type, etc. The informed consent of the subjects was obtained before the study, and all experimental procedures were approved by ethics.

Draw a summary table of patient characteristics. The level of AREG was detected by ELISA kit and compared with CA199.
