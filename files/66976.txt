A Study Investigating BGB-26808 Alone or in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, and nonrandomized dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate BGB-26808 as monotherapy or in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to explore the recommended dosing for BGB-26808.

DRUG: BGB-26808|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Phase 1a: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory assessments, and that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 90 days after the last dose or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first; up to approximately 12 months|Phase 1a: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) of BGB-26808, MTD is defined as the highest dose evaluated for which estimated toxicity rate is the closest to the target toxicity rate. MAD is defined as the highest dose administered if MTD is not reached., Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDFE) of BGB-26808, RDFE of BGB-26808 alone or in combination with tislelizumab will be determined based upon the MTD or MAD., Approximately 1 month|Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Approximately 6 months
Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Approximately 6 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first as assessed by the investigator., Approximately 9 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease. It will be summarized similarly as ORR as assessed by the investigator., Approximately 6 months|Phase 1a and 1b: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting â‰¥ 24 weeks as assessed by investigator., Approximately 6 months|Phase 1b: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug(s) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 9 months|Phase 1a: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin) for BGB-26808, Approximately 6 months|Phase 1a: Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) for BGB-26808, Pharmacokinetic analysis for BGB-26808 concentrations, alone or in combination with tislelizumab. Single-dose and steady-state PK parameters., Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Half-life (t1/2) for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Apparent clearance (CL/F) for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1a: Accumulation ratio for BGB-26808, Approximately 1 month|Phase 1b: Plasma concentrations of BGB-26808, Approximately 6 months|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, ECGs, laboratory assessments, and that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria., From the first dose of study drug(s) to 90 days after the last dose or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first; up to approximately 12 months
