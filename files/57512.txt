First-line Maintenance of OH2 Injection for Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, open, randomized controlled Phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral injection of OH2 combined with capecitabine for first-line maintenance of advanced colorectal cancer.
Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: OH2|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression-free survival, Time after treatment to clinical and radiographic disease progression will be evaluated., 2 years
Durable response rate (DRR), objective response lasting continuously 6 months, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The overall survival for each patient receiving treatment will be calculated., 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Determination of the ORR will be calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR using the RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by investigators., 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR will be calculated based on the proportion of patients achieving CR, PR, or who have SD at least 6 weeks after receiving first dose of study treatment., 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DOR will be calculated from the time of initial response (CR or PR) documentation to the time of progressive disease (PD). If a subject who had CR or PR dies without the evidence of disease progression, the case will be censored at the time point of death when analyzing DOR, 2 years|Immune-progression-free survival (iPFS), Time after treatment to disease progression using the iRECIST will be evaluated., 2 years|Toxicity by CTCAE v5.0, Safety assessments should be conducted for all subjects who received treatment at least once. Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0., 2 years
