ASG-15ME is a Study of Escalating Doses of AGS15E Given as Monotherapy in Subjects With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
The objectives of this study are to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of AGS15E in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer who failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.

Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA), Up to 26 months|Tumor response, Incidence of tumor response defined as either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST criteria (version 1.1) that should be confirmed ≥ 28 days later, Up to 26 months|Objective response rate, Defined as the percentage of subjects who experience a best response of either CR or PR in that cohort. CR and PR should be confirmed ≥ 28 days later, Up to 26 months|Disease control rate, Defined as the percentage of subjects who experience a best response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), Up to 26 months|Progression free survival, Time from the date of first infusion to the earliest date of documented disease progression per radiological evidence or death from any cause, Up to 36 months|Duration of response, Time from the date of the first response CR or PR to the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, Up to 36 months
All subjects will receive a single intravenous infusion of AGS15E once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks. A cycle is 4 weeks. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of AGS15E, investigator decision, or consent withdrawal.

In subjects who discontinue therapy without documented disease progression and who still consent to study procedures, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by radiographic imaging until progression is documented, or new anticancer therapy, or death. All subjects will continue to be followed for survival until withdrawal of consent or study closure.

If assessed as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per local review a confirmatory scan will be performed no less than 4 weeks from previous scan and preferably at week 5. Tumor imaging should also be performed whenever disease progression is suspected.

Images will be sent to a central third party imaging vendor for an independent assessment per RECIST version 1.1. Although the imaging studies will be reviewed by a central third party imaging vendor in a retrospective fashion, all clinical decisions will be based on the interpretation of the investigator at the site treating the subject.

Post-Treatment Follow-up Progression Free Survival:

Subjects who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than radiographic disease progression will continue for a maximum of up to 12 months following the last dose of study drug until radiologically confirmed progression, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, death, loss to follow-up or withdraw consent for further follow-up, whichever of these events occurs first. The purpose of the post-treatment follow-up is to ascertain the duration of progression-free survival for all subjects enrolled in the study.
