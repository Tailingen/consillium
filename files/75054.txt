MagnetisMM-3: Study Of Elranatamab (PF-06863135) Monotherapy in Participants With Multiple Myeloma Who Are Refractory to at Least One PI, One IMiD and One Anti-CD38 mAb
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether single-agent Elranatamab (PF-06863135) can provide clinical benefit in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Elranatamab is a bispecific antibody: binding of Elranatamab to CD3-expressing T-cells and BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cells causes targeted T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
