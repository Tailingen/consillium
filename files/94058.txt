A multicenter, single-arm, prospective, open-label study to detect the efficacy and safety of 70mg dasatinib by measuring rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months in patients with CML-CP in China. Approximately 65 Patients will be recruited consecutively from the study sites during the enrollment period and will be given dasatinib 70 mg QD. The duration of patient participation will be 12 months.
