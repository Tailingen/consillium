Rucaparib Hepatic Impairment Study in Patients With a Solid Tumor
Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, PK, safety and tolerability study in patients with an advanced solid tumor and either normal hepatic function (Group 1, n = 8) or moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2, n = 8) according to the NCI-ODWG criteria. Patients in Group 1 and Group 2 may be enrolled in parallel, with preferential enrollment of Group 2 patients before Group 1 patients. The study will consist of 2 parts: a single-dose PK part (Part I) and a continuous rucaparib treatment part (Part II).

In Part I, eligible patients will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg rucaparib followed by intensive plasma PK sampling up to Day 7 (hour 144). In Part II, patients may continue to receive continuous oral rucaparib in 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all Group 1 patients will be 600 mg BID. The first 2 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2) that enter Part II will receive a starting dose of 400 mg BID rucaparib; a lower dose of rucaparib may also be set based on PK results observed in Part I. If this initial starting dose is determined to be safe and tolerable as determined by real-time PK data and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during the first 28 days of rucaparib, the starting dose of rucaparib may be increased in subsequent Group 2 patients. The starting dose for Group 2 patients may also be lowered, based on the patients' real time PK and emerging safety data. The Sponsor and key clinical research organization (CRO) staff will review available adverse event, laboratory, and PK data to determine the starting dose for subsequent Group 2 patients, as well as allowing intra-patient dose escalation of rucaparib after Cycle 1.Treatment with rucaparib will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or other appropriate clinical reason for discontinuation.
