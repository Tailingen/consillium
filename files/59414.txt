A Study of Atezolizumab Administered in Combination With Bevacizumab and/or With Chemotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This open-label, Phase Ib study that has six treatment arms is designed to assess the safety, pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PDL1\] antibody) administered with bevacizumab (Arm A) and with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFOX) (Arm B), with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C), with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Arm D), with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm E), and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm F) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study includes dose escalation cohort for establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and then expansion cohort will be initiated based on a selected dose level at or below the MTD or MAD.
