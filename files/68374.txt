Prevention of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) in Subjects Receiving Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The study aims to investigate whether prophylaxis with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome®) can reduce the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) who are undergoing their first remission induction.
Invasive Fungal Disease
DRUG: Liposomal amphotericin B|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Participants With Proven or Probable IFIs During Remission-induction Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Diagnoses of proven or probable invasive fungal infections (IFI) were assessed according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria by the independent data review board (IDRB) who were blinded to treatment assignment.

The duration of remission-induction chemotherapy was defined as the period from the initiation of remission-induction chemotherapy administration to the start of consolidation or salvage therapy., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Pulmonary Infiltrates According to the Central Image Reader, During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Diagnosed With Proven or Probable IFIs According to the EORTC/MSG Criteria, as Assessed by the Investigator, During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Time to Diagnosis of Proven or Probable IFIs According to the EORTC/MSG Criteria, as Assessed by the IDRB., Time to diagnosis of proven or probable IFIs is presented as the median (Q1,Q3) days to diagnosis of those participants who experienced a proven or probable IFI. Median was not reached if \< 50% of participants had an event; Q1 was not reached if \< 25% of participants had an event; Q3 was not reached if \< 75% of participants had an event., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Requiring Antifungal Treatment During Remission-Induction Chemotherapy, During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Who Died Due to Fungal Infection; Causality as Assessed by the IDRB., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Who Died Due to Fungal Infection; Causality as Assessed by the Investigator., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Time From Beginning of Remission-induction Chemotherapy Until the Beginning of Consolidation Therapy, This endpoint was to evaluate the potential impact of IFI prevention on the efficacy of remission-induction chemotherapy for ALL., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission at the End of Remission Induction, This endpoint was to evaluate the potential impact of IFI prevention on the efficacy of remission-induction chemotherapy for ALL., During remission-induction chemotherapy (average 7 weeks)
