Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of HIFU Combined With REGOTORI for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study intends to perform high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with REGOTORI in patients with multiline drug-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer to explore the safety and efficacy of patients. Patients receive HIFU local treatment combined with REGOTORI treatment, and receive corresponding clinical data collection at different follow-up points, including necessary data from various laboratories, CT/MRI, and immune function tests that are exactly the same as before surgery collection.
