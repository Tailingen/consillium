A Real-world Study of Selinexor-based Regimens for Treatment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of selinexor-based regimen in patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Lymphoma|DLBCL|T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Selinexor
Objective response rate(ORR), the percentage of patients with complete response and partial response, throughout the study, an average of 1 year|incidence of adverse events/ serious adverse events, identify patterns of incidence in adverse events, throughout the study, an average of 2 year
incidence of dose delays or interruptions, calculate incidence and present the occurrence of dose modifying toxicities by cycles and overall, throughout the study, an average of 2 year
duration of response (DOR), DOR is calculated as the time from initial response (complete response or partial response) to date of progression or death, whichever is earlier, throughout the study, an average of 2 year
this study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of selinexor-based regimen in patients with DLBCL or T cell lymphoma. This study is a non-interventional real world, observational study and all registered data are collected from real clinical practice cases. The medical data includes patient demographic, tumor characteristics, laboratory examination, history of treatments, adverse reactions, efficacy results and possible prognostic factors.
