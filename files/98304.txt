A Study of the Clinical Activity and Safety of JNJ-64041809, a Live Attenuated Listeria Monocytogenes Immunotherapy, in Combination With Apalutamide Versus Apalutamide in Subjects With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the anti-tumor activity of JNJ-809 combined with apalutamide is improved compared with apalutamide alone for subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant
DRUG: JNJ-809|DRUG: Apalutamide
Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression will be measured using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)., approximately 2 years
PSA Doubling Time (PSADT), The PSADT will be determined using the method as recommended by PCWG3 criteria., approximately 2 years|Radiographic Progression-free Survival, Radiographic progression-free survival, is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic progression or death, whichever occurs first., approximately 2 years|Time to Unequivocal Clinical Progression, Time to unequivocal clinical progression defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of unequivocal clinical progression as evaluated by the investigator., approximately 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival defined as time from the date of randomization to death from any cause., approximately 2 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Comparison of the AE profiles of the two treatment groups., approximately 2 years|Blood Culture and Shedding Profile of JNJ-809 From Cultured Samples of Feces, Urine, and Saliva, Blood culture samples will be collected after the mandatory prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Bacterial shedding will be evaluated from cultured samples of feces by stool or rectal swab, urine, and sputum., approximately 2 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the anti-tumor activity of JNJ-809 combined with apalutamide is improved compared with apalutamide alone for subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
