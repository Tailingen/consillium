Study of XIAP Antisense for Advanced Cancers
This study is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose, safety and toxicity profile, and to identify any dose limiting toxicities of AEG35156 administered in 2-hour infusions to patients with advanced cancers.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: AEG35156
Dose level at which AEG35156 is well tolerated based upon development of toxicities during the first cycle of therapy unless delayed or cumulative toxicity is encountered. Assessments done weekly., 1 year
Determine the impact of AEG35156 on inhibition and apoptosis in tumour biopsies or circulating tumour cells., 1 year|Determine the occurence of XIAP knockdown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells., 1 year|Determine the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of AEG35156., 1 year|Determine the possible anti-tumour activity of XIAP., 1 year
This is a Phase I study, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation study to establish the recommended dose and activity of AEG35156 administered as a 2-hour daily infusion over 3 days initially followed by weekly 2-hour intravenous infusions in patients with advanced cancers. Subjects eligible for study entry must have proven advanced or metastatic cancer refactory to conventional treatment or for which no conventional therapy exists. The starting dose will be a fixed dose of 60 mg/day with escalation by steps of 50 to 100% in successive cohorts. Approximately of 30 patients will be entered in the study to determine the maximum tolerated dose.
