Tumor Response Prediction in Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Using Metabonomics Analysis
This study suggested an effective application of pattern recognition, which figured the possible biological function of potential bio-markers of rectal cancer found in our study based on their chemical structures. Hence, this study identified the precursor protein and metabolic mechanism of these bio-markers and may contribute to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation of locally advanced rectal cancer
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
TRG, Tumor regression grade, Surgery scheduled 6-8 weeks after the end of chemoradiation
