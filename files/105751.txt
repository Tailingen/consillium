Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Participants Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-859/KEYNOTE-859)-China Extension
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3745) in combination with chemotherapy (Cisplatin combined with 5-Fluorouracil \[FP regimen\] or oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine \[CAPOX regimen\]) versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX regimens) in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in adult Chinese participants.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS).
Stomach Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Placebo for Pembrolizumab
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 65 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to approximately 65 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 65 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 65 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), Percentage of participants experiencing an AE defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 65 months|Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to AEs, Percentage of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE., Up to approximately 36 months
The China extension study will include participants previously enrolled in China in the global study for MK-3475-859 (NCT03675737) plus those enrolled during the China extension enrollment period. A total of approximately 231 Chinese participants will be enrolled.
