A Study to Evaluate NT219 Alone and in Combination with ERBITUX® (Cetuximab) in Adults with Advanced Solid Tumors and Head and Neck Cancer
This is a phase 1/2, multi-center study with an open-label, dose escalation phase followed by a single-arm expansion phase to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of NT219 alone and in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in adults with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors.
