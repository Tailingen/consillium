Measure of Outcomes in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer According to Homologous Recombination Status and Matched Therapies in a Real-world Scenario
This is a retrospective and prospective, multicenter, observational, two-cohorts study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes and safety of patients diagnosed with advanced high grade ovarian cancer whose tumor was tested for the homologous recombination (HR) status using a validated HR deficiency test between January 2021 and January 2026.

* Cohort A: Homologous Recombination Deficient (HRD) ovarian cancer patients treated with Olaparib plus Bevacizumab as maintenance therapies after partial or complete response to first line platinum-based chemotherapy.
* Cohort B: Homologous Recombination Proficient (HRP) ovarian cancer patients treated as for standard clinical practice at clinician's choice.

Cohort A: Homologous Recombination Deficient (HRD) ovarian cancer patients treated with Olaparib plus Bevacizumab as maintenance therapies after partial or complete response to first line platinum-based chemotherapy.

Cohort B: Homologous Recombination Proficient (HRP) ovarian cancer patients treated as for standard clinical practice at clinician's choice. Alive patients who have finished the first line treatment (including maintenance) with or without disease progression while signing the informed consent form will be enrolled retrospectively. Alive patients candidate to receive a first line therapy will be enrolledprospectively as soon as molecular data (BRCA status and HRD) are available.
