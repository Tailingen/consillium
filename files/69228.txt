Study of Smoking Trajectory in Newly Diagnosis Lung Cancer Patients
1. Understanding the smoking change patterns among the newly diagnosis lung cancer patients after cancer diagnosis.
2. Explore the related factors of the smoking change patterns.
3. The type of smoking trajectory impact on survival and quality of life.
Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer|Smoking, Cigarette|Survival|Quality of Life
BEHAVIORAL: smoking
Changes From Baseline Smoking Behavior at 1,2,3,4,5,6 Months, Self-reported smoking during the last 30 days was a dichotomous variable., baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month, 6-month
Changes From Baseline Quality of Life at 1,2,3,4,5,6 Months, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung, Version 4 (FACT-L v. 4) was a 36-item ordinal scale, five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). There were 5 domains: Physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being; lung cancer subscale (symptoms, cognitive function, regret of smoking). Subscale scores added to obtain total score, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month, 6-month|Proportion of participants with Overall Survival up to 2 years, survival, follow up to one or two years
This was a prospective longitudinal design study. The investigators used the structure questionnaires to collect the data from a consecutive sample of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.
