A Study to Investigate Safety and Clinical Activity of Belantamab Mafodotin in Combination With Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone and Nirogacestat in Patients With Transplant Ineligible Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase 1/2, open-label study designed to assess the safety and clinical activity of different belantamab mafodotin doses in combination with lenalidomide, dexamethasone and nirogacestat in patients with transplant ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

This will be a 2-part study. In part 1 participants will be enrolled in one cohort to receive belantamab mafodotin in combination with lenalidomide, dexamethasone and nirogacestat and will determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be further evaluated for safety and clinical activity in the dose expansion cohort. The RP2D dose will be used in future studies in the transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) setting. In the dose expansion phase (Part 2) an expansion cohort will be treated with the RP2D. The expansion cohort will randomize participants (1:1) in two groups to evaluate two alternate dose modification guidelines for corneal AEs. Part 2 of the study will also evaluate an alternative dose modification guideline for corneal adverse events (AEs).

Overall, approximately 36 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participant follow-up will continue up to 3 years after the last participant is enrolled (follow-up period range: 3-4 years). The estimated accrual period will be 12 months, corresponding to an approximate total study duration of 4 years.

Part 1 and 2: Lenalidomide Relative Dose Intensity (RDI), The RDI is defined as the percentage of the total administered over the total planned lenalidomide dose., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Nirogacestat Relative Dose Intensity (RDI), The RDI is defined as the percentage of the total administered over the total planned nirogacestat dose., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Cumulative dose of bentalamab mafodotin, Cumulative administered dose of belantamab mafodotin in combination with lenalidomide, dexamethasone and nirogacestat i.e., the total dose of belantamab mafodotin that was administered., Up to 4 years|Part 1: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment, Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Time To Response (TTR), TTR as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population). TTR is defined as the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the first evidence of confirmed response (PR or better) for participants who achieve a response (i.e., confirmed PR or better)., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time (months) from first evidence of confirmed PR or better until the earliest date of: documented disease progression (PD) per IMWG response criteria; or death due to PD among participants who achieved a response of PR or better. For alive and progression-free participants, data will be censored at the date of initiation of the subsequent line of treatment or at the last date of FU that the participant was known to be alive and progression-free., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR or sCR. The denominator will be the total number of participants in each population and group respectively., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better, VGPR or better as per IMWG by Investigator Assessment (ITT population).

PFS is defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the earliest date of documented PD per IMWG, or death due to any cause. For participants who neither progress nor die, the PFS will be censored at the date of their last adequate disease assessment. For participants who start a new anti-myeloma treatment, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment before the start of the new treatment. For a randomized participant who does not have any post-baseline disease assessments and who has not died, PFS will be censored at the randomization date., Up to 4 years|Part 1 and 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose/randomization until death due to any cause.
