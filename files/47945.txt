Phase I Dose Escalation Study of VS-5584 in Subjects With Advanced Non-Hematologic Malignancies or Lymphoma
This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of VS-5584, a PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor, in subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies or lymphoma. This clinical study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended Phase II dose), pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-5584 in subject's blood) and the anti-cancer activity of VS-5584. Biomarkers (genes or proteins that may predict or show how subject's body may respond to VS-5584) will also be assessed in archival tumor tissue, tumor biopsies (in consenting subjects), and blood samples.
Non Hematologic Cancers|Metastatic Cancer|Lymphoma
DRUG: VS-5584
Assess the safety and tolerability of VS-5584 in subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies or lymphoma, Serious Adverse events, Adverse events and their frequency, duration and severity, physical examination, laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECGs as determined based on CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) V4.03. A Safety Monitoring Committee will review safety information., From start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 6 weeks|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of VS-5584 administered to subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies or lymphoma, The RP2D will be determined based on the MTD of VS-5584 as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities related to VS-5584. Observations related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and any VS-5584 related toxicities may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D and schedule and will not exceed the MTD., From start of treatment to end of Cycle 1 (21 day cycles)
Assess the pharmacokinetics of VS-5584, PK (pharmacokinetics) parameters, including but not limited to plasma concentration, clearance, AUC (Area Under Curve, 0-24 and 0-t), Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2, Time points on Day 1, 2, 3, 17, 18
Evaluate the efficacy of VS-5584, Response rate and progression-free survival as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 or by the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Every 6 weeks to end of treatment, expected average of 6 weeks|Evaluate the time to new lesion, Expected average of 6 weeks from start of treatment to end of treatment|Evaluate duration of response to VS-5584 compared with duration of response to prior therapy, Expected average of 6 weeks from start of treatment to end of treatment|Examine the pharmacodynamic effect of VS-5584 on target proteins in platelet rich plasma and tumor biopsies, Pharmacodynamic and predictive response biomarkers intended to demonstrate inhibition of the molecular target and determination of the mechanism of action will be assessed in archival tissue and tumor biopsies and platelet rich plasma samples., Platelet rich plasma time points: Day 1, 2, 8, 17; Tumor biopsies time points: Screening, Day 22, and at the time of progression|Examine if tumor genetic alterations and/or plasma biomarkers correlate with response to VS-5584 therapy, Tumor genetic alterations and/or plasma biomarkers compared with response to VS-5584, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 or Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 6 weeks
