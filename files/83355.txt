Yttrium Y 90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, and an AHSCT in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients
RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies together with etoposide and cyclophosphamide before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when given together with etoposide and cyclophosphamide followed by an autologous stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Number of Patients Achieving Complete Response (CR), Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of all measureable evidence of non-evaluable disease. No new lesions. No disease related symptoms. No evidence of non-evaluable disease, including normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. All measureable, evaluable and non-evaluable lesions and sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline., Assessed up to 5 years post-ASCT|Number of Patients With Grade 3 or Greater Toxicity, The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version 2.0) are used. The patients, whose toxicities are grade 3 or greater and at possibly related to the study treatment, are reported., From initial of study treatment to Day 100 post-ASCT|5-Year Overall Survival (Phase II), Overall survival (OS) was measured from peripheral stem cell infusion to death from any cause. It was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the 95% confidence interval was calculated using Greenwood's formula. \[Breslow NE, Day NE.

In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Disease-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the 95% confidence interval was calculated using Greenwood's formula \[Breslow NE, Day NE.

OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new preparative regimen of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in combination with high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for treatment of patients with poor-risk, relapsed, or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan which can be given with high-dose etoposide and high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by ASCT in patients with NHL.
* To perform dosimetry study to estimate the radiation dose delivered to the tumor and normal organs.
* To evaluate the short-term and long-term complications of this new preparative regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I does-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by an open-label phase II study.

* Preparation for transplantation: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are collected via leukapheresis. Samples are analyzed by cytogenetic studies, immunophenotyping, and gene rearrangement. Patients with an adequate number of collected CD34-positive cells (â‰¥ 3 times 10\^6 /kg) proceed to radioimmunotherapy.
* Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV on days -21 and -14. Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy and dose estimation on day -7.
* Chemotherapy: Patients receive etoposide IV on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -2.
* Transplantation: Patients undergo reinfusion of PBSCs on day 1.
* Growth factor therapy: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.

Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
