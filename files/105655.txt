Electron Beam Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Following Chemoradiation in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer With Vascular Involvement
This research study is studying an intervention as a possible treatment for pancreatic cancer.
Pancreas Cancer
RADIATION: IORT
2 Year Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from IORT to death due to any cause, or is censored at the date of last follow-up, when applicable., 2 years
Median Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of IORT until the first evidence of local progression or distant metastasis (determined by imaging or biopsy) or death, and is censored at date of last follow-up when applicable., 2 years|Local Control, Local control is the absence of local failure, defined as evidence of growth or regrowth of the primary tumor and/or extension to regional lymph nodes that meets criteria for progressive disease beyond that present in pre-IORT imaging studies., 2 years|Adverse events associated with IORT, Adverse events will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4)., 2 years
In this research study, the investigators are researching how well IORT during surgery works in treating pancreatic cancer after 3-6 months of chemotherapy and external radiation therapy. IORT works by delivering radiation therapy to the tumor while reducing the amount of healthy tissue exposed to the radiation therapy. The investigators believe that the administration of IORT after 3-6 months of chemotherapy will help to stop the cancer cells from growing.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved IORT for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
