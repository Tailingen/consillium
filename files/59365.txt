Safety and Immunogenicity Study of V503 (GARDASIL™9, 9vHPV Vaccine) Administered to 9- to 26-Year-Old Females and Males in Vietnam (V503-017)
This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of V503 (GARDASIL™9, 9vHPV vaccine) administered to 9- to 26-year-old females and males in Vietnam. The study hypothesis states that V503 induces acceptable anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 seroconversion at 4 weeks postdose 3.

BIOLOGICAL: 9vHPV vaccine
Seroconversion Percentages to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 at Month 7, Seroconversion was defined as a participant who was anti-HPV seronegative at Day 1 and became seropositive at 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7). Anti-HPV antibodies were measured using a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)
Percentage of Participants With a Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study vaccine or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure was also an AE. The participant or the parent/guardian of the participant were to record the presence of any vaccination report card (VRC)-prompted injection-site AEs that occurred in the 5 days after any vaccination. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (erythema, pain, and swelling) was summarized., Up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With a Solicited Systemic Adverse Event, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study vaccine or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure was also an AE. The only solicited systemic AE was in response to results of daily oral temperature assessments. The participant or the parent/guardian of the participant will be asked to record the participant's oral temperature in the evening after each study vaccination and daily for 4 days after each study vaccination on VRC. The percentage of participants that had an AE due to an elevated oral temperature \[(≥ 37.8 °C (100.0 °F)\] was summarized., Up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With a Vaccine-related Serious Adverse Event, A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that is life-threatening, requires or prolongs an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is another important medical event deemed such by medical or scientific judgment. The percentage of participants that experience at least one SAE that was reported as at least possibly related to the study vaccine was summarized., Up to 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)|Geometric Mean Titers of Serotype-specific Antibodies: Predose Day 1, Anti-HPV Type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antibodies are measured using a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay. Titers are reported in milli Merck units/mL (mMU/mL)., Day 1 (predose)|Geometric Mean Titers of Antibodies to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 at Month 7, Anti-HPV Type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antibodies are measured using a Competitive Luminex Immunoassay. Titers are reported in mMU/mL., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)
