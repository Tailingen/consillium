A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of GDC-1971 in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of GDC-1971 when administered in combination with atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The study will have 2 stages- dose finding stage and expansion stage. In expansion stage participants with non-small cell lung cancer programmed death ligand -1 high (NSCLC PD L-1 high), NSCLC PD L-1 low, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) PD L-1 positive, BRAF wild type (BRAF WT) melanoma and any locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled.
