Study for the Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Assessment of Oxidative DNA Damage in Relation to Antioxidant Usage
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for the reported good effects of antioxidant supplementation. A blood test using Mass Spectrometry will measure DNA damage which is expected to decrease with antioxidant administration and therefore decrease the risk of cancer.
Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: 1 tablet composed of antioxidants and minerals
To establish a base line level for 5 DNA modifications of White blood cells, 2 years
In this pilot study, the overall purpose is to establish the molecular basis for the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a risk factor for cancer. This will be achieved by establishing base line levels of oxidative DNA damage in a population of healthy individuals before and after taking antioxidant and mineral supplements for 8 weeks.
