A Study of Apalutamide (Adjuvant Treatment) and Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Participants Who Have Undergone Radical Prostatectomy (RP) for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer and Who Are at High Risk for Metastases
Main Study: The purpose of main study is to assess if the combination of apalutamide and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in participants with high-risk localized prostate cancer improves the biochemical recurrence (BCR) free rate.

Sub-study: The purpose of the sub-study is to assess if the co administration of apalutamide and relugolix is able to maintain castrate levels of testosterone.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: ADT|DRUG: Relugolix
Confirmed Biochemical Recurrence (BCR)-Free Rate at Month 24, Confirmed BCR-free rate was estimated from primary efficacy variable, time to confirmed BCR. This was measured as the interval between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of the first occurrence of confirmed prostate specific antigen (PSA) greater than (\>) 0.2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL). Confirmation of the PSA value was conducted within 3 to 4 weeks, regardless of study visit and timing. Participants without confirmed PSA \> 0.2 ng/mL (including those who were lost to follow-up) were censored on their last PSA measurement date during the treatment phase of the study., At Month 24|Sub-study: Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Testosterone Level Less Than (<) 50 Nanograms Per Deciliter (ng/dL) Through Day 28, Percentage of participants maintaining testosterone level \<50 ng/dL through Day 28 were reported., From Day -14 through Day 28
Confirmed Biochemical Recurrence (BCR)-Free Rate at Month 12, Confirmed BCR-free rate was estimated from primary efficacy variable, time to confirmed BCR. This was measured as the interval between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of the first occurrence of confirmed PSA \>0.2 ng/mL. Confirmation of the PSA value was conducted within 3 to 4 weeks, regardless of study visit and timing. Participants without confirmed PSA \> 0.2 ng/mL (including those who were lost to follow-up) were censored on their last PSA measurement date during the treatment phase of the study., At Month 12|Serum Testosterone Recovery (>=150 ng/dL) at Months 18 and 24, Percentage of participants with serum testosterone recovery (\>=150 ng/dL) at Months 18 and 24 were reported. Testosterone recovery was defined as a serum testosterone level greater than or equal to (\>=)150 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL)., At Months 18 and 24|Sub-study: Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product and it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. TEAEs were defined as any AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study intervention through the day of last dose in sub-study., From 1st dose of study intervention (relugolix on Day -14) up to end of sub-study (Day 28)
