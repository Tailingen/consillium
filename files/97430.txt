Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Autoimmune Disorders and Advanced, Metastatic, or Unresectable Cancer
This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and to see how well it works in treating patients with autoimmune disorders and cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

False discovery rate, if appropriate, will be used to control for multiple testing., Up to 100 days|Clinical measures of interest, The association between demographic and clinical measures of interest with overall response rate and toxicity will be evaluated using logistic regression modeling to identify potential predictors of outcomes., Up to 100 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the overall safety, and toxicities associated with the use of the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody nivolumab in patients with varying severity of dermatomyositis (DM)/systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (ulcerative colitis \[UC\] and Crohn's disease \[CD\]), multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjogren's syndrome \[SjS\], Psoriasis (PsO)/Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and other autoimmune diseases.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab in terms of objective response rates (ORRs), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer and DM/SSc, RA, SLE, IBD (UC and CD), MS, SjS, PsO/PsA, and other autoimmune diseases.

II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. III. To propose dosing recommendations for anti-PD-1 antibodies based on the severity of the autoimmune disorder.

IV. To evaluate the impact of nivolumab on the disease severity indices for: DM/SSc, RA, SLE, IBD: UC and CD, not specified (NS), MS, SjS, PsO/PsA.

V. To identify biomarkers of response and toxicity.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo collection of blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tissue, stool, and urine samples throughout the trial.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
