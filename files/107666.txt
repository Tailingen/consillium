Partial Volume High-Dose Irradiation in Renal Cell Carcinoma for Intra-TUmoural Control ALongside Current Management
Prospective, randomised, feasibility study of patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comparing standard palliative dose radiotherapy to a high-dose hypofractionated regime.

Primary aim

• To demonstrate feasibility of a randomised study comparing high-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy versus standard palliative dose radiotherapy in localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma The aim is to recruit a minimum of 24 patients; 12 to the control arm and 12 to the high-dose regime.

2 treatment arms, no placebo:

* Control arm - standard palliative-dose radiotherapy, 30Gy in 10 fractions in 3Gy per fraction over 2 weeks
* High-dose arm - high-dose radiotherapy, 30Gy in 5 fractions in 6Gy per fraction on alternate days/2-3 fractions a week over 2 weeks

PROCEDURE: radiotherapy
Primary Outcome, To demonstrate feasibility of recruitment (assessed by 35% of eligible patients accepting the offer of recruitment). To calculate the proportion of patients that accept the offer of recruitment to the study. The denominator is the number of eligible patients that have been approached for the study, 24 months
Secondary aim, To evaluate acute ≥Grade 3 CTCAE v5.0 toxicity by treatment group. 'Acute' is defined as less than or equal to 3 months post-completion of radiotherapy., 24 months|Secondary aim, To evaluate late ≥Grade 3 CTCAE v5.0 toxicity by treatment group. 'Late' is defined as over 3 months from completion of radiotherapy., 24 months|Secondary aim, To demonstrate completion of quality of life (QOL) validated EORTC forms by patients under study, by reporting upon the proportion of patients completing quality of life (QOL) questionnaires at baseline and follow up, 24 months
HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesise that it is feasible to recruit to a study of localised and metastatic renal cell carcinoma comparing a high-dose short fractionation radiotherapy regime (30Gy in 5 fractions in alternate day fractions over 2 weeks) in comparison to the standard palliative dose-fractionation (30Gy in 10 fractions in daily fractions over 2 weeks).

AIMS Primary aim

• To demonstrate feasibility of a randomised study comparing high-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy versus standard palliative dose radiotherapy in localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma

Secondary aim

* To report acute and late toxicity in both treatment groups
* To demonstrate completion of quality of life (QOL) validated EORTC forms by patients under study

STUDY DESIGN

* Randomised 1:1
* The study is unblinded for the trial investigators and participants.

VISITS (in line with routine standard care):

* 1 Pre-treatment appointment
* 1 CT planning scan (immobilisation/mould room as required dependent on anatomical site)
* 10 radiotherapy treatment appointments (Control Arm) / 5 radiotherapy treatment appointments (Experimental Arm)
* 2 on-treat clinic reviews (week 1 and week 2)
* End of Treatment/Safety follow up (4 weeks post-radiotherapy)
* Follow-up at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

INVESTIGATIONS

* Quality of Life questionnaires
* Blood tests
* Clinical/Physical Examination
