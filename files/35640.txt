Lateral Prostate Capsule Sparing Versus Non Nerve Sparing Robot-assisted Radical Cystectomy-orthotopic Ileal Neobladder for Bladder Cancer in the Male
To compare the perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between non nerve sparing and lateral prostate capsule sparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder in male patients with bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: lateral prostate capsule sparing
day-time and night-time continence rate, Patients were considered continent when they required 0 or 1 safety pad during the day or at night., 6 months|postoperative sexual function, The sexual function are evaluated by the international index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5)., 6 months
perioperative complication rate, 3 months|operative time, 24 hours|estimated blood loss, 24 hours|overall survival, 1 year|recurrence-free survival, 1 year
This study will enroll male patients with bladder cancer who will undergo robot-assisted radical cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder. The patients will be distributed into two comparable groups according to surgical procedures: non nerve sparing group and lateral prostate capsule sparing group. Patient demographics and pathologic, perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes will be compared between the two groups.
