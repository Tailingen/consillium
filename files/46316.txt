A Clinical and Biological Prospective Database of Patients Treated With Anticancer Immunotherapy and Follow up of Their Immune-related Adverse Events irAE
The number of patients affected by cancer and treated with immunotherapy is continuously increasing. With the advent of these new therapies, the investigators observe the emergence of new and unexpected toxicities. The care of patients treated with these molecules require the development of multidisciplinary skills and the introduction of a professional network capable of taking care of immunotherapy related toxicity (irAE) that can affect different organs and for which immediate and effective interventions are necessary for patient survival.

IMMUCARE-BASE will comprehensively enable the collection, of clinical and biological data of patients treated with anticancer immunotherapy. The creation of this database is essential to identify clinico-biological factors predisposing to toxicity, and to define the best strategies to prevent the early onset of irAE and/or to treat them. Ultimately, the objective of this database is to collect enough data to be able to personalise in the future the immunotherapy treatment according to the benefits and to anticipate risks for each patient.

The objective of the biological collection is to perform ancillary studies for understanding mechanism leading to toxicity and for the development of research programs in the field of immunotherapy.
Cancer
OTHER: Estimation of the incidence of the irAE
Estimation of the incidence of immunotherapy-related toxicities (all grades, of all organs, in real life) in patients treated for the first time with anticancer immunotherapy and enrolled in the "IMMUCARE-BASE" clinical database, Patients can be treated with immunotherapy alone, or in association with other immunotherapies, or association with chemotherapies, targeted therapies or radiotherapy. It will include all types of cancers that can be treated with immunotherapy, also including patients that are in clinical trials., 10 years
