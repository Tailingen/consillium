Evaluation of Outcomes for Quality of Life and Activities of Daily Living for BKP in the Treatment of VCFs
The study objective is to collect and report 12-month outcomes pertaining to activities of daily living, quality of life, and safety parameters in a Medicare population to be treated with balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of painful, acute, vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs) associated with either osteoporosis or cancer. The primary objective is to show statistically significant improvement from baseline in the four co-primary endpoints (SF-36v2, PCS, EQ-5D, NRS back pain and ODI) at 3-months; study success will be declared if the primary objective is met. New radiographic fractures, non-surgical management received, VCF-related healthcare resource utilization, and vertebral body height restoration data will also be collected.
Compression Fracture of Vertebral Body|Osteoporosis|Cancer
DEVICE: Balloon kyphoplasty
Back Pain Change From Baseline at 3 Months, Back pain was measured using NRS. Patients rated their back pain on a scale from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing "no pain" and a score of 10 representing "pain as bad as it could be.", Baseline, 3 months after surgery|Back Function Change From Baseline by Oswestry Disability Index at 3 Months, ODI Questionnaire was used to assess patient back function. The ODI score ranges from 0-100. The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 100 (maximum disability)., Baseline, 3 months after surgery|SF-36v2 Physical Component Summary Change From Baseline at 3 Months, Quality of life was assessed by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) version 2.0. The SF-36 v2 physical component summary (PCS) score is between 0 and 100, with higher scores denoting better quality of life., Baseline, 3 months after surgery|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life by the EQ-5D Index at 3 Months, EQ-5D index scores range from 0 to 1.0 on a scale where 0 = death and 1.0 = perfect health., Baseline, 3 months after surgery
Back Pain, Back pain was measured using NRS. Patients rated their back pain on a scale from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing "no pain" and a score of 10 representing "pain as bad as it could be.", Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months|Back Function (ODI), ODI Questionnaire was used to assess patient back function. The ODI score ranges from 0-100. The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 100 (maximum disability)., Baseline, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months|Quality of Life by SF-36v2 PCS, Quality of life was assessed by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) version 2.0. The SF-36 v2 physical component summary (PCS) score is between 0 and 100, with higher scores denoting better quality of life., Baseline, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months|Quality of Life by EQ-5D Index Score, Baseline, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months|Percentage of Subjects Having Daily Living Activities Limited Due to Back Pain in the Previous 2 Weeks, Baseline, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|The Number of Days With Limited Activities and Bed Rest Due to Back Pain in the Previous 2 Weeks;, Baseline, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Ambulatory Status, Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months|Barthel Index (Only for Subjects With Osteoporosis), For subjects with osteoporosis, the Barthel index was used for rating subject activities of daily living on a scale from 0 (maximum disability) to 20 (no disability)., Baseline, 30 days, 3 months 6 months, and 12 months|Karnofsky Performance Scale, For subjects with cancer, the Karnofsky performance scale was used for rating subject activities of daily living.The Karnofsky performance scale rates a subject on an 11-step scale from 0 (dead) to 100 (normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease), and a score of 70 is a clinically meaningful threshold for self-care., Baseline, 30 days, 3 months 6 months, and 12 months|Vertebral Body Height Restoration (Absolute Height Restored as Percent, AHRP), AHRP (Absolute height restored as percent) was the amount of height restored in the vertebral body expressed as a percent of estimated pre-fracture (EP) height. Measurements were assessed at anterior, medial, and posterior locations on the vertebral body., Baseline, pre-discharge, 3 months, and 12 months|Vertebral Body Angle, The vertebral body kyphosis angle (VBA) was defined as the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the caudal and cranial fractured vertebral body endplates., Baseline, pre-discharge, 3 months, and 12 months|Local Cobb Angle, The local Cobb angle (LCA) was defined as the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the superior endplate of the vertebral body above and the inferior endplate of the vertebral body below., Baseline, pre-discharge, 3 months, and 12 months|Subsequent Radiographic Fractures, A subsequent VCF was defined as any fracture at an index or non-index vertebral body occurring after the initial procedure as compared to baseline. The percentage of subjects having one or more subsequent VCFs is presented., 3 months and 12 months|Neurological Success Rate, Neurological functions were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. Each of the individual functions was comprised of a number of elements. Investigators evaluated whether observations in each function category was normal or abnormal, and documentation of abnormal findings were required for each element in that function. Success for each component was defined as maintenance or improvement from preoperative for all elements. Success for overall neurologic status was defined as successful in all components., Pre-discharge, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
