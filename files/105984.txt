Phase Ib Study of Olaparib Plus Weekly Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the investigational agent, olaparib, to give in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer or uterine cancer. Furthermore, the investigators intend to study the safety and tolerability of the study treatment, response to treatment, time to disease progression, and overall survival.
