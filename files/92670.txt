Study of SQZ-eAPC-HPV in Patients With HPV16+ Recurrent, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open label, multicenter study to assess safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, and immunogenic and pharmacodynamic effects of SQZ-eAPC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic HPV16+ solid tumors. The study includes patients with head and neck, cervical, anal, vulvar, or penile cancer.
