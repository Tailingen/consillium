TuLip : Role of the Tumor Environment in Cancer-related Fat Loss
Cancer cachexia is defined as a weight loss of more than 5% over the last 6 months, a loss of body fat and muscle atrophy. It is found in 80% of patients with advanced cancer. In this context, white adipose tissue is a particularly interesting target since its depletion precedes the loss of muscle mass, and is sufficient to induce a decrease in the response to anti-cancer treatments and in the survival of patients.

This cachexia is associated with advanced tumors that present acidosis and metastasis. In this clinical study the investigators would like explore the acid environment effect on the human adipose tissue depletion and more specifically on adipocyte lipolysis.

The main objective of the "TuLip" clinical study is therefore to validate in human subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes that factors secreted by tumor cells cultivated in acid tumor environment stimulate the release of lipids from adipose tissue. Adipocytes retrieves from this study will also be used to validate identified potential lipolytic factors derived from these cells.

PROCEDURE: Nissen Fundoplication, cholecystectomy
Evaluation of the lipolytic response of adipocytes isolated from human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to factors derived from cancer cells in acid environment by the glycerol measurement, Measure ex-vivo of the lipolysis of subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes in the presence of factors derived from cancer cells. The lipolysis will be assessed by the measure of glycerol (in mol/L) released by adipocytes., Up to 100 days after the adipose tissue collection"|Evaluation of the lipolytic response of adipocytes isolated from human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue to factors derived from cancer cells in acid environment by the fatty acid measurement., Measure ex-vivo of the lipolysis of subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes in the presence of factors derived from cancer cells.

This study is a monocentric clinical study. Patients with BMI \< 30 kg/m2 will be recruited in the context of programmed abdominal surgery. In this context, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue pieces (1-2 cm3) will be collected to explore the lypolytic response of adipocytes ex-vivo to factors secreted by human cancer cell lines.
