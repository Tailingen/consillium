TAK-788 as First-Line Treatment Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations
The purpose of this study is to compare effectiveness of TAK-788 as first-line treatment with that of platinum-based chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors has epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups- TAK-788 group or Platinum-based chemotherapy group.

Participants will receive TAK-788 orally and pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin via vein until the participants experience worsening disease (PD) as assessed by blinded independent review committee (IRC), intolerable harmful effects or another discontinuation criteria.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the first date at which the criteria for progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST Version 1.1 are met or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) per RECIST Version 1.1, Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who are confirmed to have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Confirmed responses are responses that persist on repeat imaging ≥4 weeks after initial response., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from the date of randomization until death., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the first date at which the criteria for PD according to RECIST Version 1.1 are met or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator, Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who are confirmed to have achieved CR or PR. Confirmed responses are responses that persist on repeat imaging ≥4 weeks after initial response., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Duration of Response, as Assessed by the Blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) and the Investigator, Duration of response is defined as the time interval from the time that the measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that PD or death (whichever occurs first) is objectively documented., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Time to Response, as Assessed by the Blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) and the Investigator, Time to response is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the initial observation of CR or PR., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by the Blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) and the Investigator, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) (in the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks) after the initiation of study drug., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Patient-reported Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific questionnaire which comprises of 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting); and a global health status/quality-of-life (QoL) scale. Six single-item scales are also included (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Raw scores will be converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QoL scale, higher scores represent better HRQoL, whereas for the symptom scales lower scores represent better HRQoL (i.e., a low level of symptomatology/problems)., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized|Participant-reported Symptoms as Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire, Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13), EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a cancer-specific questionnaire which comprises of 13 questions assessing lung cancer-associated symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and use of pain medication. Raw scores will be converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent a high level of symptomatology/problems., Up to approximately 40 months after the first participant is randomized
The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. TAK-788 is being tested to evaluate the efficacy as a first line treatment compare with platinum-based chemotherapy in the participants with locally advanced or NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

The study will enroll approximately 318 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups-

* TAK-788 Group (Arm A)
* Platinum-based Chemotherapy Group (Arm B)

The participants will be administered with TAK-788 orally in arm A and pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin intravenously (IV) in arm B until the participants experience progressive disease (PD) as assessed by blinded independent review committee (IRC), intolerable toxicity or another discontinuation criteria. Participants in the chemotherapy group may cross over to treatment with TAK-788 after IRC-assessed PD is documented. Randomized treatment with TAK-788 or platinum-based chemotherapy may be continued after PD, at the discretion of the investigator and with the sponsor's approval, if there is still evidence of clinical benefit.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States (US), Europe, and Asia. The overall time to participate in this study is until 3 years after the last participant is randomized. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be followed for survival, subsequent anticancer therapy, subsequent disease assessment outcome until disease progression on a subsequent anticancer therapy, and participant-reported health status (EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels \[EQ-5D-5L\]) for 3 years after the last participant is randomized in the study and 30 days after the last dose of study drug for safety follow-up.
