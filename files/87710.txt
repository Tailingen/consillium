A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of MRG003 in Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer.
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG003 in patients with EGFR-positive, HER2-negative, inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.
Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer|Advanced or Metastatic Gastroesophageal Junction Carcinoma
DRUG: MRG003
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR is defined as the proportions of patients with a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30(for AE) and 45(for SAE) days after the last dose of study treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator, ORR is defined as the proportions of patients with a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportions of patients achieving CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 24 months)|PK parameter for MRG003: (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|PK parameter for MRG003: (AUClast), Area under the curve up to the last validated measurable plasma concentration, Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|PK parameter for total antibody (TAb): Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|PK parameter for TAb: AUClast, Area under the curve up to the last validated measurable plasma concentration, Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|PK parameter for Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE): Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|PK parameter for MMAE: AUClast, Area under the curve up to the last validated measurable plasma concentration, Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|The proportion of patients with positive of anti-drug antibody (ADA), The proportion of patients with positive ADA immunogenicity results., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
Approximately 6054 patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG003. Patients will receive 2.0 mg/kg dose of MRG003 intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) and may receive up to 24 months of MRG003 if there is evidence of clinical benefit to the patients.
