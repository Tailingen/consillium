About This PDQ Summary
Incidence
Chordoma is a  very rare tumor  of bone. It arises from remnants of the notochord within the clivus, spinal vertebrae, or sacrum. The most common site in children is the cranium.[
1
]  The incidence in the United States is approximately 1 case per 1 million people per year. Only 5% of all chordomas occur in patients younger than 20 years.[
2
,
3
] Most pediatric patients have the classical or chondroid variant of chordoma, while the dedifferentiated variant is rare in children.[

Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis
Patients with chordomas usually present with pain (headache or sacrum) or diplopia. Patients may also present with or without neurological deficits such as cranial or other nerve impairment.[
1
]
The diagnosis of a chordoma is straightforward when the typical physaliferous (soap bubble–bearing) cells are present.  The differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult and includes dedifferentiated chordoma and chondrosarcoma. Childhood chordoma has been associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.[

Prognosis and Molecular Features
Younger children with chordomas  appear to have a worse outlook than older patients.[
1
-
6
] The survival rate ranges from about 50% to 80% for children and adolescents with  cranial chordomas.[
2
,
3
,
5
] However, in a National Cancer Database review, the overall survival (OS) of pediatric and adult patients with cranial chordomas was similar (70% at 10 years).[
7
]
A retrospective literature review and review of institutional patients identified 682 patients with spinal chordomas. The median age of patients was 57 years.[
8
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Age younger than 18 years, sacral spine tumor location, dedifferentiated pathology, and treatment with chemotherapy were associated with a lower probability for progression-free survival (PFS).
Younger age (<18 years), older age (>65 years), bladder or bowel dysfunction at presentation, dedifferentiated pathology, disease recurrence or progression, and metastatic disease were associated with a worse OS.
Histopathology is also an important prognostic factor. Patients who have tumors with typical or chondroid pathology have worse outcomes than patients who have tumors with classical pathology.[
9
][
Level of evidence C1
]
A multicenter retrospective study identified 40 children with chordomas (median age, 12 years).[
10
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Most of the patients had the histologically classical form of chordoma (45.5%).
Most of the chordomas were located at the skull base (72.5%).
The OS rates were 66.6% at 5 years and 58.6% at  10 years.
The PFS rates were 55.7% at 5 years and 52% at 10 years.
Total resection correlated with a better outcome (log-rank
P
= .04 for OS and PFS).
Loss of BAF47 immunoexpression appeared to be a significant independent adverse prognostic factor (
P
= .033 for PFS).
A retrospective analysis identified seven children with poorly differentiated chordomas.[
11
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The median survival of these patients was 9 months.
All poorly differentiated chordomas showed loss of
SMARCB1
expression by immunohistochemistry. Copy number profiles were derived from intensity measures of the methylation probes and indicated 22q losses affecting the
SMARCB1
region in all poorly differentiated chordomas.
Inactivation of the
SMARCB1
gene is common in poorly differentiated chordomas of childhood, and it is associated with a poor prognosis.[
11
]
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) analyzed germline DNA from a cohort of 24 patients with chordomas who were referred to the NCI (age range, 5–57 years).[
12
]
Pathogenic variants in cancer predisposition genes were identified in 9 of the 24 patients (38%).
Germline pathogenic variants in
CHEK2
were found in three patients. Six patients had germline pathogenic variants in other genes, one each in
BRCA2
,
RET
,
FANCA
,
RAD51C
,
FH
, and
BAP1
.
A retrospective study analyzed whole-exome and mitochondrial DNA genome sequencing of 29 chordomas from 23 pediatric patients. The findings were compared with the results of whole-genome sequencing of chordomas from 80 adult patients.[
13
]
In the pediatric chordoma cohort, 81% of the somatic mitochondrial DNA variants were observed in NADH complex genes, which are significantly enriched compared with the rest of the mitochondrial DNA genes (
P
= .001).

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.

Treatment of Childhood Chordoma
In This Section
Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Therapy
Chemotherapy
One report described the value of using a multidisciplinary clinic for patients with these very rare tumors.[
1
] Treatment options for childhood chordoma include the following:
Surgery with or without radiation therapy
.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy
.
Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy
Standard treatment includes surgery and external radiation therapy, often proton-beam radiation.[
2
,
3
]  Surgery is often not curative in children and adolescents because of the likelihood of the chordomas arising  in the skull base, rather than in the sacrum, making them relatively inaccessible for complete surgical excision. However, if gross-total resection can be achieved, outcome is improved.[
4
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The best results have been obtained using proton-beam therapy (
charged-particle radiation therapy
) because these tumors are relatively radiation resistant, and radiation-dose conformality with protons allows for higher tumor doses while sparing adjacent critical normal tissues.[

Evidence (surgery and/or radiation therapy):
In a retrospective study of 20 children with skull-based chordomas, the median age at diagnosis was 12 years. The most common presenting symptoms were diplopia, headache, and swallowing difficulties.[
11
] Five patients had locally recurrent tumors. Twelve patients underwent surgery with an endoscopic endonasal approach alone, and eight patients underwent other procedures. All but two patients received radiation therapy. Fourteen patients had gross-total resections, ten of whom developed surgical complications.
No differences in recurrence rates were seen between patients who presented with a new diagnosis and patients who had  recurrent disease or between patients who underwent a gross-total resection and patients who underwent a near-total resection.
Of patients who received postoperative radiation therapy, none had a recurrence.
Comparatively, of  the 11 patients who either did not receive radiation therapy or were treated preoperatively, 4 had a recurrence (
P
= .09).
Three patients developed distant metastases, and three patients died of disease.
A high Ki-67 index was more prevalent among patients with dedifferentiated chordomas. Two of the three patients who died had an elevated Ki-67 index.
Pediatric patients with base-of-skull chordomas were treated with proton-beam therapy or a combined proton/photon approach (proton-based; most received 80% proton/20% photon) at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1981 to 2021. Of 204 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 11.1 years (range, 1–21 years).[
12
]
The chordomas presented in the upper and/or middle clivus in 59% of the patients, lower clivus  in 36%, craniocervical junction in 4%, and nasal cavity in  1%.
The median overall survival (OS)  was 26 years, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 years. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year OS rates were 84%, 78% and 64%, respectively. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year PFS rates were 74%, 69%, and 64%, respectively.
In multivariable actuarial analysis, prognostic factors associated with worse OS included poorly differentiated subtype, radiographical progression prior to radiation therapy, larger treatment volume, and lower clivus location.
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Therapy
Chordomas overexpress
PDGFRA
,
PDGFRB
, and
KIT
. Because of this finding, imatinib mesylate has been studied in adults with chordomas.[
13
,
14
]
In one study, 50 adults with chordomas were treated with imatinib and evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. One patient had a partial response  and 28 additional patients had stable disease at 6 months.[
14
]  The low rate of RECIST responses and the potentially slow natural course of the disease complicate the assessment of the efficacy of imatinib for chordoma.[
14
]
Other TKIs and combinations involving TKIs have been studied in adults.[
15
-
17
]
One multicenter French retrospective study reported five patients who had partial responses to treatment with either imatinib, sorafenib, or erlotinib. The median PFS was 36 months.[
18
]
Chemotherapy
There are only a few anecdotal reports of the use of cytotoxic  chemotherapy after surgery alone or surgery plus radiation therapy.  Treatment with ifosfamide/etoposide and vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide was beneficial in some reports.[
19
,
20
] The role for chemotherapy in the treatment of this disease is uncertain.
Recurrences are usually local but can include distant metastases to the lungs or bone.
