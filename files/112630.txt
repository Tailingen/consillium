Mechanism of Gastric Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma Based on Microproteomics
Gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC) possesses unique epidemiology and pathogenesis in the field of cancer, but its incidence is low. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of systematic research focusing on the prognostic proteomic features of GSRCC. Given this knowledge gap, this study aims to comprehensively characterize the proteomic landscape of GSRCC using a reliable and reproducible DIA-PCT method. This study objectives include characterizing the heterogeneity of GSRCC, performing molecular typing, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and providing a resource for stratified analysis of GSRCC. To achieve these goals, the investigators selected a cohort of 112 GSRCC patients from a pool of over 10,000 gastric cancer patients and conducted a proteomic analysis using the DIA-PCT method. This meticulous approach revealed four novel proteomic subtypes of GSRCC, each exhibiting unique molecular characteristics. Additionally, the investigators discovered that PRDX2 and DDX27 can serve as predictive biomarkers for GSRCC, which were further validated in an independent cohort of 75 GSRCC patients. Furthermore, the investigators paid particular attention to the MLT-GSRCC subgroup and identified three distinct proteomic clusters among MLT-GSRCC patients. Subtype 2 within this subgroup demonstrated the poorest prognosis. Through a rigorous screening process, the investigators determined potential targets for the treatment of GSRCC. In conclusion, these findings contribute to the investigators understanding of the heterogeneity of GSRCC and provide valuable resources for future clinical stratification and targeted treatment strategies.

OTHER: Without any intervention
The proteome of tissue, The samples diagnosed as GSRCC by pathology were selected as the samples with signet ring cell content \> 70% as judged by 2 pathologists of associate chief physician or above and without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Tumor tissues and paired nat were collected from the same patient at the time of tumor resection and stored in formalin-fixed paraffin embedding (FFPE). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to detect the proteomics in the samples. The proteins in the samples were extracted, and the proteomics in the samples was detected by LC-MS. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed to detect the types and content of proteins in the samples., Lc-MS/MS was used to detect the types of proteins in the samples and the relative amounts in the samples compared with Normal adjacent tissue, an average of one month
