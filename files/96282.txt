Pembrolizumab + Defactinib In Pleural Mesothelioma
This research study is studying a new drug combination of Pembrolizumab and Defactinib followed by surgical resection possible treatment for resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM).

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Pembrolizumab
* Defactinib
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Defactinib
Maximum Tolerated Duration (MTD), standard 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated duration (MTD) of oral defactinib when combined with 2 cycles of pembrolizumab, 56 days|Biomarker activity in response to the MTD of defactinib in combination with pembrolizumab, Pre- versus post-treatment changes may be analyzed using the sign test or Wilcox on signed-rank test to assess whether the biomarker distribution has changed following treatment., 56 days
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxcities, NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, 56 Days|Response Rate, Modified RECIST criteria for mesothelioma, 56 Days
The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Pembrolizumab
* Defactinib

The Investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

The dose of the study drug, pembrolizumab, will not change no matter when the participant is enrolled into the study.

The order in which the participant is enrolled to the study will determine the cohort assigned to:

* Run-In Cohort: Pembrolizumab only followed by surgery
* Cohort 1: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery
* Cohort 2: Pembrolizumab and defactinib followed by surgery
* Expansion Cohort: Pembrolizumab and defactinib at the maximum dose as determined from the previous cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2)
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved defactinib as a treatment for any disease.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
