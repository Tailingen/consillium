Evaluating and Monitoring Immune and Clinical Responses in Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemo-immunotherapy With Pembrolizumab
This research study is a prospective, single arm, pilot study, designed to evaluate the correlation between the immune and clinical responses of subjects with untreated Stage II-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing standard of care neoadjuvant chemo- immunotherapy.
Breast Cancer Triple Negative|Breast Cancer Stage II|Breast Cancer Stage III|Breast Cancer Invasive
Change in the cytokine milieu in the blood, The change in the cytokine milieu specifically IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-6 and TGF-β in the blood during standard of care neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy and its association with pathologic complete response in the tissue, From baseline within 24 hours of surgery
Change in the transcriptomic signatures in the tissue, The transcriptomic signatures of TGF-β induced genes and innate interferon inducible genes/effector CD8 in the tissue specimens collected at baseline (archival tissue obtained prior to standard of care neoadjuvant chemo- immunotherapy) and after completion of treatment at the time of surgery., From baseline within 24 hours of surgery
Primary Objective:

I. To determine whether standard of care neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy leads to the induction of a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu (characterized by high IFN- γ, IFN-α, IL-6 and low TGF-β) in the blood which is induced within 24 hours of treatment initiation, persists through the course of the therapy and is associated with pathologic complete response in the tissue.

Secondary Objectives:

I. To determine whether the spatially resolved tissue TGF-β induced transcriptomic signatures or lack of innate interferon inducible genes/effector CD8 modules are abundant in tumors from TNBC patients that do not show pathologic complete response in the tissue at the end of standard of care neoadjuvant chemo- immunotherapy.
