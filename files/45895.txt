A Dose Escalation Study of Lenalidomide in Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of lenalidomide and to define the maximum tolerated escalation dose level (MTEDL) when administered by a stepwise dose-escalation schedule in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell CLL.
