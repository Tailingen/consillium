Effect of Exercise on Cardiometabolic Profile in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal and metabolic disorder that has been shown to affect women's fertility. It can also share many symptoms with pre-diabetes, and women with PCOS often have an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart attack and stroke.

This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of exercise intervention and increased lifestyle physical activity to improve cardiovascular disease risk factors in women with PCOS.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle Physical Activity
Recruitment rate, Recruitment rate will be calculated by dividing the number of women eligible and consenting by the recruitment period., One year|Attrition Rate, Attrition rates will be established as discontinuation of the intervention and loss to follow-up measurement for both conditions., One year|Compliance to intervention, Compliance will be monitored by session attendance and monitoring the data from recorded daily physical activity, with examination of reasons for drop-out or non-compliance, One year|Suitability of allocation and measurement procedures, Reasons for drop-out will be used to assess the suitability of allocation procedures. Suitability of measurement procedures will be evaluated by completion rates and reasons for missing data., One year

This is a three arm feasibility study in which participants will be allocated to an exercise group, an increased lifestyle physical activity group, or a control group. We will determine the appropriateness of procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement and retention for the intervention procedures in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

The investigators will also determine if we are able to detect changes in blood lipid profile, inflammation, and hormonal and metabolic profile as a result of the intervention(s) using blood biomarkers.
