The aim of this study is to determine prospectively the value of a recently identified proteomic signature in identifying those patients with lung cancer, who are likely to benefit from and respond favourably to erlotinib therapy.

This is a prospective study of serum proteomics as a predictor of response to erlotinib therapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Value of a recently identified proteomic algorithm, Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment, Change in CT scans taken at baseline, 2 and 4 months post commencement of therapy and one year after treatment with erlotinib will be analyzed with the emphasis on identification of disease progression.
Screening/Baseline

1. Routine blood tests (Haematology and Biochemistry) as per hospital practice
2. Research serum sample for proteomic studies (10ml blood sample)
3. Routine pre-treatment CT but with formal RECIST/WHO measurements of tumour size

2 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

4 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

1 year Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib (as per current standard of care): Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

Response Assessment: CT scans at baseline, at 2 and 4 months post commencement of therapy and one year after treatment with erlotinib will be analyzed with the emphasis on identification of disease progression.

Follow Up: Subsequent follow-up as per routine.
