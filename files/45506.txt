Phase II Clinical Trial of De-Intensified Therapy in Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
HPV-associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) is a type of cancer that affects parts of the throat, like the tonsils and the base of the tongue. The treatments for OPSCC, which may include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, often cause serious side effects, such as loss of taste, dry mouth, and long-term problems with swallowing. These side effects can lower patients' quality of life and make it difficult for them to eat and speak normally.

This study aims to explore whether using lower doses of radiation after surgery can help improve long-term swallowing function in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC. By doing this, the study team hopes to reduce treatment-related side effects while maintaining good cancer control.

Assess oncologic outcomes of a de-intensified post-surgical adjuvant treatment by measuring overall survival., Overall survival will be monitored., from enrollment to 5 year follow-up|Safety and tolerability, The study will use the CTCAE version 5.0 for reporting of non-hematologic adverse events., from enrollment to 5 year follow-up|Assess oncologic outcomes of a de-intensified post-surgical adjuvant treatment by measuring progression free survival., Assess oncologic outcomes of a de-intensified post-surgical adjuvant treatment by measuring progression free survival., from enrollment to 5 year follow-up|Assess oncologic outcomes of a de-intensified post-surgical adjuvant treatment by measuring locoregional control., Locoregional control (LRC) is defined as time from treatment initiation to local or regional recurrence, from enrollment to 5 year follow-up
Evaluate how changes in serum HPV ctDNA are associated\ with HPV-positive OPSCC recurrence, ctDNA will be measured at baseline and at several points during follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity and concordance of the HPV ctDNA results in relation to the clinical and pathologic disease status (presence/absence) will be corelated., from enrollment to 5 year follow-up
