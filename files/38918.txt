A Dual Tandem Study - SC vs. CAD-EYE vs. CAD-EYE With G-EYE
Single-center, four-arm dual-tandem, randomized, open-label study involving the following devices:

1. The Standard Colonoscope is a high-definition colonoscope employing advanced optical filtering and enhancement techniques - blue light imaging (BLI) and linked color imaging (LCI).
2. CAD-EYE is an artificial intelligence software, used in real-time during the colonoscopy procedure for aiding the identification and characterization of polyps and adenomas.
3. The G-EYE® balloon is a reusable (reprocessable) balloon permanently installed on the distal tip of a standard colonoscope, and is also intended to assist in flattening colonic folds and control the colonoscope's field of view and tip positioning.

Additional adenoma detection yield, additional adenoma detection yield (represented by the miss rate) of CAD-EYE and G-EYE® colonoscopy over standard coloscopy compared to the additional adenoma detection yield of CAD-EYE aided colonoscopy over standard colonoscopy, 6 weeks
