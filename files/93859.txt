Randomized Trial Comparing Robotic and Open Radical Cystectomy
The purpose of this study is to determine if using robotic surgical technology during bladder cancer surgery helps to reduce complications during and after the surgery. The removal of the bladder and lymph nodes will be done by a robotic or by an open technique. It may be a Robotic-assisted Radical Cystectomy (RARC) and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection. Or it may be an Open Radical Cystectomy (ORC) and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: open radical cystectomy|PROCEDURE: robotic-assisted radical cystectomy
To compare surgical complications of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy and open radical cystectomy., intraoperative and 90-day postoperative period
To examine clinical and pathological outcomes of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy and open radical cystectomy., 2 years|Intra-operative performance (surgical time, blood loss), time from anesthesia induction to final skin closure|Pathologic findings, including the stage specific, soft tissue surgical margin rate and number of lymph nodes removed., 1.5 years|Bladder cancer recurrence (local, upper tract and distant disease), 2 years|complications grade 2-5, A secondary analysis will be used to determine if the total burden of grade 2-5 complications in the robotic arm is different from the open arm., 2 years|complication grade 3-5, Determine if there is a difference in either the number of patients with grade 3-5 complication or the total number of grade 3-5 complication in the two arms of the study., 2 years
