Early Metabolic Response in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer Undergoing Induction Chemoradiotherapy
Early metabolic response evaluation may predict clinical and histopathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Its value in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is unknown. Our aim was to assess the value of early metabolic response after one cycle of chemotherapy using 18-FDG-PET-CT to predict pathological response and outcome in cT2-4 N0/+ esophageal cancer treated by neoadjuvant CRT and esophagectomy.

early metabolic response to predict pathological response and outcome, assess the value of early metabolic response with 18-FDG-PET-CT (i.e. a decrease of â‰¥ 35% of SUVmean) after a single cycle of chemotherapy followed by neoadjuvant CRT and esophagectomy as a tool to predict pathological response and outcome in patients with cT2-4N0/+ carcinoma of the esophagus and GE-junction (GEJ).
