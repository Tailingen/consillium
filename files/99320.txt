Chemopreventive Action of Mesalazine on Colorectal Cancer: a Pilot Study for an "in Vivo" Evaluation of the Molecular Effects on β-catenin Signaling Pathway.
The purpose of this study is to obtain an "in vivo" confirmation that mesalazine induces the gene expression of μ-protocadherin and other related genes in the colon mucosa, as demonstrated in some "in vitro" experiments. .
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Mesalazine
Molecular analysis of gene expression levels of μ-protocadherin and other related proteins, Molecular analysis (quantitative RT-PCR) of gene expression levels of μ-protocadherin, protocadherin 19, protocadherin 24, cadherin E, TCF7L2, TCF4, c-myc, Cyclin D1, p21waf1, VEGF, CD44, Met, KLF4 e CEBP-α and comparison of the levels assessed at the end of the treatment period with the baseline., 3 months
Evaluation of protein expression level of μ-protocadherin, Ki-67, Caspase-3 and Histone H2AXγ, evaluation of DNA oxidative damage and intra-mucosal concentration of 5-Acetylsalicylic acid, These parameters will be examined using molecular analysis of the oxidation and depurination levels of the DNA and chromatographic analysis of the intra-mucosal concentration of 5-Acetylsalicylic acid, in biopsies of normal mucosa of the colon taken before and after the treatment of patients with 5-Acetylsalicylic acid:

* quantification of the percentage of cells expressing the following proteins by immunohistochemical analysis: μ-protocadherin, Ki-67, Caspase-3 and Histone H2AXγ;
* quantification of number of AP sites per 100000 DNA bp
* quantification of nanograms di 8-OhdG (8-hydroxyguanine) per micrograms of DNA, 3 months
Pilot Trial, single-blind, parallel group on biopsy specimens of healthy colon mucosa in patients with precancerous lesions of the colon and rectum (adenomas) treated with mesalazine.
