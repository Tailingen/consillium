Autologous Dendritic Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma remains incurable disease in most patients . Cellular immunotherapy using dendritic cells is emerging as a useful immunotherapeutic modality to treat multiple myeloma. Vax-DC/MM is an potent immunotherapeutic agent generated by dendritic cells loaded with the ultraviolet B-irradiated autologous human myeloma cells. The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Vax-DC/MM in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Vax-DC/MM
Number of participants with adverse events, Adverse events were assessed using the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTC) for adverse events version 4.0 every injection of Vax-DC/MM, 1 years
Clinical response after completion of Vax-DC/MM injection, The International Myeloma Working Group uniform criteria were used to assess the clinical response., 2 year|Progression free survival, Progression free survival was defined as the period from the start of treatment until the end follow-up or death from any cause., 2 year
* To create the Vax-DC/MM, myeloma cells will be obtained from the bone marrow of the participants, and leukapheresis will be performed to obtain dendritic cells
* Not everyone who participants in this study will be receiving the same dose of study vaccine. A small group of patients will be enrolled into the study and given a certain dose. If they tolerate it, the next group of patients enrolled will received a higher dose.
* Before the first injection of Vax-DC, low dose cyclophosphamide will be administered to stimulate immune response.
* Participants will be received a certain dose of Vax-DC weekly four times.
