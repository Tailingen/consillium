Impact of Immunonutrition on Nutritional Status in Colorectal Cancer Patients
Colorectal cancer is among the top three types of cancer that are most common and causes death worldwide.Nutritional support is widely used in elective colorectal surgery patients, as nutritional status is an important factor affecting clinical outcomes. European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN, 2016) emphasizes that nutritional supplementation with compounds such as amino acids, arginine, glutamine, and fish oil (omega 3) improves postoperative recovery.

Glutamine; it becomes an essential amino acid under stress. It is an energy substrate for cells such as intestinal mucosal cells and lymphocytes, a material for glutathione synthesis, and a potent antioxidant, which also increases heat shock protein expression. In stressful conditions, arginine is the primary fuel source for T cells and is required for nitric oxide synthesis; therefore, it helps maintain immune function. Omega 3; It plays a role in the treatment of inflammation and improves wound healing. In addition, EPA and DHA increase the immune response by improving lymphocyte function. RNA; They are essential for maturation, proliferation, and function in nearly all biochemical processes, in rapidly proliferating cells such as T cells. studies have shown that immunonutrition (IMN) formulas enriched with biologically active compounds may be more effective in reducing infection complications and shortening postoperative hospital stays.

This study aimed to investigate the additional effects of perioperative compared with preoperative immunonutrition on anthropometric, nutritional, and biochemical parameters, complications, and the length of hospital stay in patients with colorectal cancer.

Nutritional Status, The nutritional status of patients was evaluated according to the score determined from the NRS 2002 screening tool. Score \>3: The patient is at risk for nutrition and a nutrition facility is started Score \<3: one should be scanned.

Colorectal cancer is one of the five most common cancer types in men and women worldwide. Cancer malnutrition is seen in patients with colorectal cancer, and this adversely affects the prognosis of the disease. Major operations performed may lead to dysfunction in body homeostasis, impaired defense mechanisms and inflammatory response, increasing the risk of postoperative complications and prolonging hospital stay. Nutritional support products enriched with special compounds such as arginine, glutamine, and omega3 may contribute to the daily energy intake of patients, as well as support the immune system, increase wound healing, and reduce the risk of infection. It is well-documented that preoperative and perioperative compared to no immunonutrition effectively reduce the risk of developing infectious complications and the length of hospital stay. Unless, studies on this subject are very few, especially in our country, Turkey, and their results are contradictory.

The aim of this study is to investigate the additional effects of perioperative compared with preoperative immunonutrition (IMN) on anthropometric, nutritional, biochemical parameters, hospital stay and postoperative complication in patients with colorectal cancer.

The hypotheses of this study are as follows:

H0: There is no difference between the consumption of perioperative compared with preoperative immunonutrition (IMN) on anthropometric, nutritional, biochemical parameters, hospital stay and postoperative complication in patients with colorectal cancer.

H1: Perioperative immunonutrition compare to preoperative has a positive effect in improving the anthropometric measurements, nutritional and biochemical parameters, hospital stay and postoperative complication in patients with colorectal cancer.

Primary purpose: To evaluate the effects of IMN on anthropometric measurements, nutritional and biochemical values of participants in groups.

Secondary purpose: To evaluate the effects of IMN on postoperative complications and length of hospital stay in groups.

The study was conducted as a single-blind prospective randomized controlled clinical trial at a single institution, Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital General Surgery Clinic, Istanbul, Turkey, between November 2020 and October 2021. The participants included consecutive patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.
