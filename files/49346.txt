A Study of Pembrolizumab and Cryoablation in People With Mesothelioma
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the combination of pembrolizumab and cryoablation is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects in people with mesothelioma. The researchers will also look at whether the combination of pembrolizumab and cryoablation is effective against participants' cancer.
