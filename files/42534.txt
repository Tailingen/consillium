STA-4783/Paclitaxel or Paclitaxel Alone in Melanoma
This study is designed to assess the efficacy of a weekly treatment regimen of STA-4783 and paclitaxel in comparison to paclitaxel alone on tumor response in metastatic melanoma patients.
Melanoma
DRUG: STA-4783|DRUG: Paclitaxel
STA-4783 is a taxane potentiator, enhancing the effect of antitumor response of paclitaxel. In an attempt to improve efficacy, paclitaxel is sometimes used in combination with other anticancer agents. When paclitaxel is combined with other anticancer agents, although response rate is usually increased, side effects are usually increased as well. There is an urgent need for agents that can enhance the antitumor effects of paclitaxel without further increasing undesirable side effects.
