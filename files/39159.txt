Safety and Efficacy of L19TNF Plus Temozolomide Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to explore the safety profile and establish a recommended dose (RD) for phase II of the antibody-cytokine fusion protein L19TNF plus standard TMZ chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

The study will be conducted in three consecutive parts: a dose finding part to determine the RD of L19TNF in combination with chemoradiotherapy, followed by a signal seeking part that investigates first signs of activity and then an activity evaluation part that studies the efficacy of L19TNF in combination with chemoradiotherapy against chemoradiotherapy alone.
