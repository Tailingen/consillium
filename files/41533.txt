Study of ORIC-944 in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-944 as a single agent and in combinations with ARPIs in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

ORIC-944 is a potent, highly selective, allosteric, orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of PRC2 via binding the embryonic ectoderm development (EED) subunit.

This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of ORIC-944 as a single agent (Part I) or in combination with an Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitor (ARPI) (Part II) to establish the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-944 as a single agent and in combination with ARPIs in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Part III of the protocol (dose optimization) will explore two potential dose levels of ORIC-944 selected from Part II in combination with ARPIs to select the final RP2D for each combination across two separate patient populations.
