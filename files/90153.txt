Identification of Predictive Gene Expression Profile of Sunitinib Response in Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Carcinomas
Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 2-3% of all cancers in western countries. Brazilian kidney cancer data show an incidence of 6,270 new cases for 2018. New target-molecular therapies have emerged in recent years for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Due to the heterogeneity of these patients and the lack of specific markers, therapeutic is currently based on clinical and laboratory analysis. The research for predictive biomarkers may better characterize the kidney cancer therapeutic management. The objectives are to identify a predictive gene expression profile in patients with advanced clear cell renal carcinoma treated with first-line sunitinib and correlate it with rate response, seeking to identify a predictive gene expression profile. As secondary objectives, the investigators will compare the gene expression profile found, with global survival and clinical-pathological characteristics. Materials and methods: To determine through systematic data collection the epidemiological profile, clinical-pathological characteristics, response rate, disease free survival and overall survival of 60 patients with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma who used sunitinib in the first line between 2009 and 2018 at the Barretos Cancer Hospital. For evaluation of gene expression profile, the investigators will use a panel of a panel with 770 genes related to disease progression using nanostring technology.
