Comparative Study of Alternative Antiandrogen (AA) Therapy and Early Initiating of Enzalutamide for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) After Combined Androgen Blockade (CAB) Therapy.
The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide or alternative AA therapy in CRPC participants who were previously treated with a combined androgen blockade therapy which included bicalutamide (Bic-CAB). Efficacy and safety of enzalutamide and alternative AA therapy will be evaluated, and effective therapy against CRPC after treatment with Bic-CAB will be investigated.
