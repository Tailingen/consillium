Application of Diffusion Weighted MRI Versus CT in Evaluation of the Effect of Treating Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ADC value of diffusion weighted MRI in comparison of conventional treatment assessment criteria in evaluation of chemotherapy. Moreover, the investigators aim to clarify the correlation of ADC value with histologic type and grade of lung cancer and survival of patients.
Lung Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Change from baseline in ADC value, Change from baseline in ADC value in 4,8,12 weeks(every two cycles of chemotherapy) post initial treatment when compared with RECIST (based on the CT examination), thus it can be estimated that the accuracy of ADC value in evaluating chemotherapy., 4,8,12 weeks post initial chemotherapy
ADC value, The correlation of ADC value in 1 day before initial chemotherapy with histologic type and grade of lung cancer, 1 day before initial chemotherapy
Change from baseline in ADC value, Change from baseline in ADC value will be documented at date of first documented progression, assessed up to 12 months post initial chemotherapy., At the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 12 months
In recent years, lung cancer is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease, Advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches have been made, but the long-term survival rate remains low. Although effective mass screening of high-risk groups could potentially be of benefit, randomized trials of screening with the use of chest radiography with or without cytological analysis of sputum specimens have shown no reduction in lung-cancer mortality. Currently, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by CT is the most commonly used to evaluate chemotherapy of lung cancer patient, but patients have to be exposed to radiation. For this reason, the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, a specific parameter of radiation-free diffusion weighted MRI, in comparison of RECIST, and its correlation with histologic type and grade of lung cancer as well. Furthermore, the investigators investigate its correlation with Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in patients.
