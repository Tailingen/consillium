Personalized Preventive Support for Cognitive Impairment in Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer (EFACog)
EFACog is a single-center prospective cohort feasibility study conducted on a single group of patients to study the feasibility of a personalized support program by a nurse conducted over 9 months, using face-to-face and telephone interviews. The objective of this support program is to prevent the occurrence of post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment. After a pre-inclusion visit, patients with no pre-existing cognitive impairment will be included in the study and will receive a 9-month follow-up after the first course of chemotherapy. All follow-up visits (telephone or face-to-face) will be scheduled in conjunction with those taking place in the care setting.
