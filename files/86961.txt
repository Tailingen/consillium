A Study of the Effects of Inhibiting Platelet Function on Circulating Cancer Cells in Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Plavix and aspirin in women with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Plavix|DRUG: Aspirin
Platelet Inhibition of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Measured by the Number of Patients With Detectable CTCs, Measured by number of patients who have detectable circulating tumor cells, Week 4|Safety and Tolerability of Aspirin and Plavix Measured by the Number of Patients Who Discontinue the Study Drug, Measured by number of patients who discontinue administration of study drug because of toxicity and the incidence categorized by type., Maximum of 6 months
Percentage of Patients With a Given Absolute Number of Circulating Tumor Cells (Broken Into Categories) Plotted Against Time, Percent of patients with a given number/range of CTCs ( 0, 1-5 \>+ 5) vs. time baseline 2-weeks and 1 month for plavix \& Aspirin arm and observation only, Baseline, 2 weeks and 1 month|Mean Aspirin-Mediated Platelet Inhibition vs. Time Plotted for Plavix and Aspirin and Observation Groups, Mean platelet inhibition vs. time plotted for Plavix \& Aspirin Arm and Observation group. Citrated whole blood is added to a test carriage containing fibrinogen-coated beads and a platelet activator (arachidonic acid to synthesize thromboxane A2). Using a turbidimetric-based optical detection system, aggregation of activated platelets to fibrinogen-coated beads increase light transmittance which is reported in Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU)., Baseline, 2 weeks and 1 month|Clopidogrel-Mediated Percent of Platelet Inhibition vs. Time Plotted for Aspirin and Plavix and Observation Groups, Mean Clopidogrel-Mediated platelet inhibition (% inhibition) vs. time for Aspirin and Plavix and Observation groups, Baseline, 2 weeks and 1 month|Progression Free Survival, Maximum of 6 months
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Plavix and aspirin in women with metastatic breast cancer.
