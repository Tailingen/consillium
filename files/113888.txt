Nimotuzumab Concurrent With Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Patients diagnosed with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who failed to induction chemo(immuno)therapy had poor prognosis. Radiotherpy was an important and effective treatment in treating ESCC. The present study is a one-arm trial that seeks to evaluate the efficacy in patients with unresectable ESCC. The study objectives include R0 resection rate, complete pathological response and treatment toxicity, etc.

Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Its efficacy and safety in patients with esophageal cancer have been confirmed by many studies.

The current prospective phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen comprising chemotherapy with nimotuzumab and S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy for patients who are not sensitive to induction chemo(immuno)therapy.
