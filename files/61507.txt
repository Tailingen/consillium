Influence of Adiposity on IGF-1 and Fitness Response to Exercise in Cancer Survivors
This is a pilot feasibility study of an investigation of the influence of excess adiposity on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and metabolic responses to a standardized aerobic exercise program in cancer survivors. This investigation attempts to isolate the influence of adiposity on these responses. We will enroll overweight, obese, and normal weight cancer survivors with a primary diagnosis of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer who have completed all cancer-related treatment. Participants will engage in a 15-week aerobic exercise intervention with pre- and post-intervention assessments.
