Perioperative Intravenous Lidocaine in Liver Surgery
This is a randomized double blinded placebo-controlled study, conducted in Lund, Sweden. Patients will be randomized in two groups, with a ratio of 1:1. The experimental arm will receive intravenous Lidocaine perioperatively, and the Control arm will receive placebo, i.e. normal Saline. Postoperative both arms will get routine pain Control with PCA, Patient Controlled Analgesia with an intravenous Oxycodone-infusion. Outcome-measures will include patients pain intensity scoring, and opioid consumption.

Patientes will be randozied in blocks of eight.

The experimental arm will receive a bolus of 1,5mg/kg before induction of anesthesia, immediately followed by an infusion of 1,5mg/kg/h until 1 hour post surgery. The placebo arm will receive the same amount of normal Saline instead. Pain intensity scoring, measured by Numerical Rating Scale, NRS, will be conducted at 1, 2, 4 hour postoperatively, and each morning and night until discharge, or for a maximum 5 Days.
