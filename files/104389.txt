Disease assessments were performed by central review according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the Week 9/10 assessment visit and a corresponding CR or PR confirmed at the Week 13/14 assessment visit for the Q2W/Q3W regimens. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: Either the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease (PD; ≥ 25% increase in lesion size) and no new lesions, or, at least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions., Week 9 with confirmed response at Week 13 for the FOLFIRI and panitumumab Q2W regimen or at Week 10 with confirmed response at Week 14 for the irinotecan and panitumumab Q3W regimen.|Best Overall Response Rate, Best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) while on study. Tumor response was assessed by CT scan or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and all other sites of disease. Disease assessments were performed by central review according to the modified RECIST criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: Either the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or PD (≥ 25% increase in lesion size) and no new lesions, or, at least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions., Response was assessed at Weeks 9 and 13 and then every 8 weeks for the Q2W regimen, or at Weeks 10, 14, 22 and then every 9 weeks for the Q3W regimen until the end of treatment; median treatment duration was 13 and 17 weeks in each group respectively.|Rate of Disease Control at First Scheduled Assessment, Tumor response was assessed by CT scan or MRI of the abdomen, pelvis, and all other sites of disease. Disease assessments were performed by central review according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at the Week 9/10 assessment visit and a corresponding response (CR or PR) confirmed at the Week 13/14 assessment visit for the Q2W/Q3W regimens. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage or increase in target lesions to qualify for PR or PD, with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions., Week 9 with confirmed response at Week 13 for the FOLFIRI and panitumumab Q2W regimen or at Week 10 with confirmed response at Week 14 for the irinotecan and panitumumab Q3W regimen.|Time to Treatment Failure, Time-to-treatment failure is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of any of the following events: discontinuation of study therapy due to any reason (except for complete response and curative surgery), progression of disease, or death due to any cause. Participants who did not discontinue, who were still alive, and who did not have disease progression were censored at the date of last contact. Time to treatment failure was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.|Time to Progression, Time from the date of randomization to the date of observed disease progression or death due to disease progression. Participants who did not have documented disease progression were censored at the date of last tumor assessment; participants who died for reasons other than disease progression while on study were censored at the date of death. PD: At least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions, recorded since the treatment started, or at least a 25% increase in size of non-target lesions and the lesion(s) measure \> 10 mm in one dimension, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

Time to progression was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. This analysis excludes any data collected during follow-up for participants who began third-line treatment., From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Participants who did not die while on study or who were lost-to-follow-up were censored at their last contact date. Overall survival was analyzed using all data regardless of whether it was collected during second- or third-line treatment., From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.|Progression-free Survival, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of observed disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever comes first). Participants who were alive and had not progressed while on study were censored at the date of last progression-free tumor assessment., From randomization until the end of study; median time on study was 31 weeks and 41 weeks in each treatment group respectively with a maximum time on study of 97 weeks.|Change From Baseline in Overall Dermatologic Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Score, Skin-related quality of life was assessed using the DLQI. The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that their skin condition has affected their quality of life in the last week. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); The DLQI score is calculated by summing the scores for all questions, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; higher scores indicate a more impaired quality of life., Baseline and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
