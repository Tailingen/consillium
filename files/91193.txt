Neoadjuvant Therapy of Pembrolizumab + Ramucirumab for PD-L1 Positive Stage IB-IIIA Lung Cancer (EAST ENERGY)
The efficacy and safety of the neoadjuvant therapy of pembrolizumab+ ramucirumab
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IB|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage II|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage ⅢA
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Ramucirumab|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Major pathologic response (MPR) rate by central review, Determination of major pathologic response rate is based on the method by Hellmann et al. on the pathological section. The percentage of residual tumor cells is calculated as viable tumor cells / tumor area × 100 (%). Tumor area includes viable tumor cells and interstitial tissue such as fibrosis, necrosis, and inflammatory cells., 1 year 7 months
Proportion of incidence of adverse events, The incidences and types of adverse events that occur during neoadjuvant therapy and perioperative period (within postoperative 30 days and 90 days) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 1 year 7 months|Major pathological response (MPR) rate by institutional report, Determination of major pathologic response rate by institutional report, 1 year 7 months|Pathological complete response rate (pCR rate), Pathological complete response rate (pCR rate), 1 year 7 months|Pathological complete resection rate (R0 rate), Pathological complete resection rate (R0 rate), 1 year 7 months|Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST and iRECIST, Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST and iRECIST, 1 year 7 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), 5 years|Recurrence-free survival (RFS), Recurrence-free survival (RFS), 5 years
To demonstrate the antitumor activity and safety of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus ramucirumab followed by surgery in patients with PD-L1 positive stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer
