Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of GDC-0032 When Given Alongside Tamoxifen
This study is designed as a phase 1 dose escalation study followed by a randomised phase II study. The study will be performed in three different centres: Addenbrooke \& Cambridge university (Cambridge, UK), Netherlands Cancer Institute Amsterdam), and Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona, Spain).

Three to six patients will be followed for one completed cycle of therapy (28 days) and subsequent enrolment of new cohorts will be based on the safety assessment in that first cycle and the documentation of dose limiting toxicities. To determine the safety and efficacy of tamoxifen in combination with the isoform selective Pi3K inhibitor GDC-0032 compared with tamoxifen alone.
