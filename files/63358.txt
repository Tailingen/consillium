Registry to Evaluate Long-Term Outcomes in Patients Who Undergo 68-Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Imaging Evaluations
The purpose of this observational research registry is to understand the real-world use of Illuccix PET/CT in prostate cancer, and how results from this testing impact patient's treatment and prostate cancer journey over time. It will follow subjects and the diagnostic testing and therapy they receive for their prostate cancer.

Subjects will not be administered any medical diagnostic testing or therapy that they would not have normally undergone outside of participation in the registry.
