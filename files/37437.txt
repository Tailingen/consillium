The Adverse Event of Mitotane Therapy in Patients With Adrenocortical Carcinoma
This work will evaluate the adverse effects of mitotane treatment in patients treated for ACC with mitotane therapy. All of the individuals were treated at Ruijin Hospital between May 2023 and May 2024.
Adrenocortical Carcinoma
Documentation of adverse effects, Adverse effects will be documented using the NCI CTC AE v5, from starting mitotane treatment until discontinuation of mitotane (since this is very variable from patient to patient no specific number of days or weeks can be entered (standard therapy would be about 2 years)
Tumor treatment response, According to RECIST (version 1.1)., 2 years
Background: Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy of the adrenal cortex. The annual incidence of ACC is thought to be between 0.5-2.0 cases per million. Adjunctive therapy with mitotane may be offered post- surgically to minimise risk of recurrence.

Aims: Evaluate the adverse effects of mitotane treatment in patients treated for ACC with mitotane therapy. All of the individuals were treated at Ruijin Hospital between May 2023 and May 2024.

Methods: Cortisol, ACTH, Gastrointestinal reactions and CNS Toxicity will be measured. SPSS v27 and GraphPad Prism v9.3.1 will be used for analysis and illustrations. Patients will be included, within ACC with mitotane. Data will be tested for normality, described as MeanÂ± SD, compared using paired sample t-test with 5% p-value for significance and 95% confidence interval (CI).
