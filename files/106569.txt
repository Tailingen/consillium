Cancer Stem Cell Biomarkers as a Predictor of Response to Trastuzumab in Samples From Patients With Breast Cancer Previously Treated in the NSABP-B-31 Trial
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers as a predictor of response to trastuzumab in samples from patients with breast cancer previously treated in the NSABP-B-31 trial.
Breast Cancer
GENETIC: fluorescence in situ hybridization|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: immunologic technique|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
ALDH1 expression (percentage of stem cells within the tumor) and association with outcomes regardless of HER2 staining, approximately 4 years
HER2 expression in cells with stem cell-like properties as a determinant of aggressiveness and response to trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting, approximately 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine if stem cellness identifies a poor prognostic subgroup of women with early-stage breast cancer who have been uniformly treated with either adjuvant doxorubicin hydrochloride \& cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (the "control arm" of B31), or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.

Secondary

* To conduct exploratory analyses to assess, to the extent possible, if co-localization of stem cellness, as determined by ALDH1 positivity, and HER2 identifies a group of patients previously considered to have HER2-negative cancers (using classical definitions) who benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab.

OUTLINE: Archived breast cancer stem cells samples and terminally differentiated cells from tissue samples are analyzed for HER2 and ALDH1 expression by dual-staining quantitative immunofluorescence using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) , IHC, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
