The profiling of the expression of signal transduction biomarkers, gene expression, gene copy numbers and effect of mutations of the VHL gene in renal cancer and their relationship to clinical outcomes., 5 years
Renal cancers have different clinical outcomes. The principal research objective is to study tumour tissue from renal cancer patients and try and understand why some cancers progress more rapidly than others. Further, another key aim of this study is to try and understand why some patients respond to treatment and others do not.
