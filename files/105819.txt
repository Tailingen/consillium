A Phase 1 Study of Mixed Bacteria Vaccine (MBV) in Patients With Tumors Expressing NY-ESO-1 Antigen
This was a phase 1, open-label, multiple dose, single-arm study. The mixed bacteria vaccine (MBV) was administered at a starting dose of 250 EU (1 µL) and escalated in each subject to a dose inducing the desired pyrogenic effect, defined as a body temperature of 38°C to 39.5°C. The primary objective was to determine the safety profile of MBV in subjects with malignant tumors that expressed the NY-ESO-1 antigen and to identify the dose that induced the desired pyrogenic effect. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the immunological effects and tumor response of subjects following vaccination.

Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported from clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs from pre-treatment through 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment., Up to 3 months|Number of Participants With Pyrogenicity at Each Dose Level Tested in the Intrasubject Dose Escalation Performed Over a Dose Range of 250 to 547,000 EU, Intrasubject dose escalation performed over a dose range of 250 to 547,000 EU until achievement of the desired pyrogenic effects (i.e., body temperature increase to 38°C to 39.5°C). Of note, the median pyrogenic dose was 60,800 EU., Weeks 1 through 6
Number of Participants With Serum NY-ESO-1-specific Immune Responses, Serum NY-ESO-1-specific immune responses evaluated by humoral immunity (antibodies measured by ELISA), cellular immunity (CD8+ T-cell and CD4+ T-cell measured by ELISPOT), and cytokine activation (measured by ELISA) from pre-treatment through 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. \[Note: CD = cluster of differentiation; IFN =interferon; IL = interleukin; TNF = tumor necrosis factor\], Up to 3 months|Number of Participants With Best Overall Tumor Response, Tumor responses evaluated using computed tomography and categorized according to RECIST version 1.0 at pre-treatment and 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions \[no evidence of disease\]; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria., Up to 3 months
Subjects in Cohort 1 were enrolled to receive MBV subcutaneously at a starting dose of 250 EU (1 µL; dose level 1) administered twice weekly. In the absence of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the MBV dose was escalated in each subject to the MBV dose that elicited the desired pyrogenic effect, or up to the maximum dose of 547,000 EU (dose level 8). Once the desired pyrogenic effect was observed, subjects received MBV twice weekly for 4 doses at the pyrogenic dose level.

Subjects in Cohort 2 were enrolled to receive MBV at the pyrogenic dose level (determined to be 60,800 EU \[dose level 6\]) twice weekly for 6 weeks. Vaccinations were injected intralesionally if possible and subcutaneously if intralesional injection was not possible. If a fever of 39.5°C to 40°C was observed, the subject's dose was reduced to dose level 5 (20,300 EU \[81 μL\]).

Subjects were observed at the clinic for up to 6 hours following each vaccination, with vital signs measured hourly. At baseline and throughout the study, subjects were assessed for NY-ESO-1-specific humoral and cellular immunity, chemistry, hematology, and cytokine analysis (interleukin \[IL\]-1, IL-6, interferon \[IFN\]-γ, and tumor necrosis factor \[TNF\]-α). Safety was monitored continuously throughout the study.
