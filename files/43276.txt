Dose Exploration of Ciprofol for Sedation in Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Diagnosis and Treatment of Obese Patients.
Ciprofol is a new anesthetic, which combines with γ- Aminobutyric acid-a (GABAA) receptor. Ciprofol has shown equivalent anesthetic efficacy of propofol at 1/4 to 1/5 of the dosage. Ciprofol has the pharmacodynamic characteristics of rapid onset, stable and rapid recovery. Phase III clinical results showed that the incidence of injection pain and respiratory and circulatory depression of ciprofol was lower than that of propofol. Therefore, ciprofol has a good application prospect in sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, especially for obese patients. In the current study, we would explore the proper dose of Ciprofol in sedated gastrointestinal endoscopy in obese patients.
