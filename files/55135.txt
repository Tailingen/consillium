Oncology-patient-reported Anxiety, Mood, and QoL During the COVID-19 Pandemic
ONCOVID is a prospective cohort study investigating oncology-patient-reported anxiety, mood, and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants complete a survey consisting of sociodemographic information and self-administered questionnaires (COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, and WHO Quality of Life-BREF). Data collection occurs at baseline and follow-up surveys are performed after 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
