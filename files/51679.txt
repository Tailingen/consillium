Protocol for Postmenopausal Women at Increased Risk of Developing Breast Cancer
A study to examine the potential associations between common single nucleotide polymorphisms and pre-cancerous conditions in breast tissue specimens from postmenopausal women.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Fine needle aspiration
Correlation of SNP patterns with cytlomorphology of breast fine needle aspirates., develoment of algorithm for prediction of risk of developing breast cancer., ongoing
A study to examine the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting steroid and carcinogen metabolism and benign breast tissue cytomorphology collected via random periareolar fine needle aspiration in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer and taking hormone replacement therapy.
