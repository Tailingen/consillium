Efficacy and Safety of Nintedanib Combined With Paclitaxel Chemotherapy for Patients With BRAF wt Metastatic Melanoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II trial designed to characterize the safety and estimate the efficacy of nintedanib when combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy compared with paclitaxel chemotherapy alone in patients with BRAF wild type metastatic melanoma not previously treated with taxanes or kinase inhibitors.

Study Phase I: Run-In-Phase Based on acceptable safety data for nintedanib monotherapy, a rapid dose finding will be conducted in a classical 3+3 design. Predefined dose levels are 150 mg (dose level 1) and 200 mg (dose level 2) nintedanib, twice daily, with weekly paclitaxel 90 mg/m2.

Study Phase II Patients with advanced (unresectable Stage III or IV) BRaf V600 wild type melanoma (n=120) will be randomized (1:1) to receive either Nintedanib (150 or 200 mg BID depending on results of phase I) in combination with paclitaxel or Placebo in combination with paclitaxel.

Total study duration per patient: approximately 12 months of therapy + Follow up until end of study

All patients enrolled in either phase I or phase II will be treated according to the following treatment plan:

Week 1 - 24:

Chemotherapy with paclitaxel combined with nintedanib/placebo

Week 25 - 48:

Extended monotherapy with nintedanib/placebo

Week 52 (or approximately 4 weeks after last treatment dose):

End of Treatment visit

Follow up:

After end of treatment the survival, disease status and further therapies of each patient will be assessed every 3 months until death, progression of disease or end of study whichever occurs first
