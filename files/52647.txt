A Randomized Controlled Trial of Acupuncture for Insulin Resistance in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
To determine the efficacy and safety of 2 different treatment modalities: 1) acupuncture plus lifestyle management (treatment group), 2) placebo plus lifestyle management (control group) in the treatment of insulin resistance in PCOS patients.

A prospective, randomized controlled trial design was used to select women with polycystic ovary syndrome as the research subjects. 144 subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly divided into an acupuncture plus lifestyle intervention group (treatment group) and a placebo plus lifestyle intervention group (control group). The differences in glucose metabolism and reproductive endocrinology were compared between the two groups.

1. To verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture intervention on insulin resistance in PCOS;
2. To explore the effects of acupuncture on androgen and lipid levels, ovarian function, reproductive dysfunction, mood and quality of life in women with PCOS.
