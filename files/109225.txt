Safety and Efficacy Study of a Hydrogel, Applied Following Removal of Myomas During Gynecologic Surgery, Administered for the Prevention/Reduction of Postoperative Adhesion Formation
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adhesion prevention gel was safe to use, and was effective for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation that typically occurs following gynecological surgery to remove myomas

Postoperative adhesions are a common medical complication of gynecologic and pelvic surgeries, and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal obstruction and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Adhibitâ„¢ Adhesion Prevention Gel versus the standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing myomectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy. Subjects were scheduled to return within 6-8 weeks after the initial surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed for postoperative adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American Fertility Society (mAFS) scoring method.
