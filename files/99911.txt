Evaluation of the Efficacy of Duodenal Prostheses Not Covered Over 6 Years
To assess the efficacy of duodenal prostheses for duodenal stenosis established for endoscopic pyloric or duodenal stenosis on dysphagia
Digestive or Non-digestive Neoplasia Leading to Symptomatic Duodenal Stenosis
DEVICE: uncovered metal duodenal prosthesis
Dysphagia assessment, GOOSS = Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System, 7 years
Rate of complications, Rate of complications, 7 years|postoperative survival, defined as the time between the date of duodenal prosthesis insertion and the date of death or the latest news, 7 years|Permeability duration of the duodenal stent, defined as the time between the date of the laying of the duodenal stent and date of patient's death or RED or surgery (exceptional case) or latest news, 7 years|Rate of duodenal endoscopic resection at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, Rate of duodenal endoscopic resection at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, at 1 and 3 months postoperatively|Rate of biliary endoscopic resection at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, Rate of biliary endoscopic resection at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, at 1 and 3 months postoperatively
Duodenal prostheses have become, since the 2000s, the first-line treatment of unresectable duodenal tumoral stenosis. The technical success is greater than 90%, however the endoscopic revisions that are duodenal or biliary are frequent. The IPC as a center of interventional endoscopy is very often in charge of these stenoses. We wanted to evaluate the efficiency and the duration of this effectiveness in current situation. Is there still room for gastrojejunal gastrojejunal surgery or for the development of endoscopic gastrojejunal anastomoses?
