A Study of Changes in Thinking Related to Aging and Cancer in Breast Cancer Survivors (TRAC)
The purpose of this study is to look at how differences in cognitive (mental) function develop over time in breast cancer survivors compared to volunteers without a history of cancer (healthy volunteers). Both cancer survivors and healthy volunteers (who are the same age as the cancer survivors) will participate in this study so the researchers can compare the results of neurocognitive testing (which looks at memory, attention, and information processing) on each group of participants.
Breast Cancer Survivors
OTHER: Assessments|OTHER: Assessment (Survivors Only)|OTHER: APOE and DNA Isolation
examine cognitive effects, of remote cancer diagnosis and treatment and potential association with increased/accelerated deficit accumulation in older survivors.The primary outcome is cognitive performance, as measured by CogSuite aggregate intra-individual variability, the average intra-individual variability across the subtests. Cognition will be assessed using the CogSuite battery of five subtests: 1) Attention Network Test; 2) Mental Rotation; 3) Stop Signal Delay; 4) N-back; and 5) Psychomotor Speed measures., within 45 days of participant consent
measure levels of smoking exposure, by testing cotinine (an important metabolite of nicotine) in urine samples to examine possible interactions of smoking history with genetic variants, e.g., APOE Îµ4+, on cognition, within 45 days of participant consent
