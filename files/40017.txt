Nab-paclitaxel Versus Sb-taxanes As First-Line Treatment in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based taxanes as first-line treatment for patients with advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), primary peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma.
Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Stage III|Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Stage IV|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma Stage III|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma Stage IV|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma Stage III|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma Stage IV
DRUG: nab-paclitaxel combined with carboplatin
Progression Free Survival, Disease progression as first failure, 20 months
Objective Remission Rate, The target lesion disappeared for at least 4 weeks,Tumor volume reduced by at least 30 percent., 12 months|Survival, Overall survival (all-cause death), 3 years, 5 years|Adverse events, Treatment-related symptoms, 3 years, 5 years
One of the major challenges related to solvent-based taxanes administration in clinical practice is the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Nab-paclitaxel has showed its considerable survival and low toxicity profiles in first-line treatment for several solid tumors and is recommended as a treatment for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We focus on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of nab-paclitaxel in current clinical studies of primary EOC treatment and aim to explore the potential feasibility of nab-paclitaxel as the first-line treatment for EOC, primary peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma.
