Study of Volrustomig as Monotherapy or in Combination With Anti- Cancer Agents in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
eVOLVE-02 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of volrustomig as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cancer agents in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

Duration Of Response (DOR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed response (which is subsequently confirmed) until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Investigator or ICR, or death due to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study intervention until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Investigator or ICR, or death due to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study intervention until the date of first documented objective response, which is subsequently confirmed per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by Investigator or ICR., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study intervention until the date of death due to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|PK of volrustomig, Concentration of Volrustomig in serum., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|The immunogenicity of volrustomig, Incidence of ADAs against volrustomig in serum., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Objective response rate (ORR) in participants with different expression levels of PD-L1, Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, as determined by Investigator per RECIST 1.1 (For cervical cancer sub-study 1), Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Objective response rate (ORR) in participants with different expression levels of PD-L1, Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, as determined by Investigator per RECIST 1.1 (For HNSCC sub-study 2), Through study completion, an average of 3 years
eVOLVE-02 study will evaluate volrustomig monotherapy or volrustomig-based combination therapy in various advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

In sub-study 1, volrustomig will be evaluated as monotherapy in approximately 30 evaluable participants with cervical cancer.

In sub-study 2, volrustomig will be evaluated as monotherapy in approximately 20 evaluable participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

In sub-study 3, Volrustomig in Combination with Chemotherapy will be evaluated in approximately 60 evaluable participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
