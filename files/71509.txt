Proton Radiation for Chordomas and Chondrosarcomas
The objectives of this study are 1) To evaluate the feasibility and acute side effects of proton therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas and 2) To evaluate clinical outcomes and long term side effects of proton beam radiation for treatment of chordomas and chondrosarcomas.
Chordomas|Chondrosarcomas
RADIATION: Proton Therapy
Feasibility of proton RT for chordomas and chondrosarcomas, Treatment completion, Up to 10 days|Acute Toxicity, Any grade 3 or higher toxicity observed within 90 days from start of therapy., 90 days
Late toxicity, Any grade 3 or higher toxicty observed later than 90 days from completion of therapy., 90 days
This trial will be conducted in two phases: a feasibility then a phase II trial. Once feasibility and safety are established in the first 12 pts. the phase II study will begin. Proton therapy at standard doses is not known to improve clinical outcome but will likely reduce fatigue and toxicity.
