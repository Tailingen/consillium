Phase I/II, FIH, Dose Escalation Trial of TL-895 and Expansion of TL-895 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy With Navtemadlin in Tx-Naïve and R/R CLL/SLL Subjects
The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TL-895. There are 2 parts of this study. Part 1 tested increasing doses of TL-895 to identify the recommended safe dose for participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies who failed at least 1 but no more than 3 prior therapies. Part 1 of this study is no longer enrolling participants.

Arms 1 \& 2 of Part 2 of this study will test different doses of TL-895 in participants with R/R CLL or SLL who have failed at least 1 prior therapy. Arms 1 \& 2 of Part 2 of this study is randomized (like the flip of a coin) to receive a specific treatment dose. If someone participates in arms 1 or 2 of Part 2, the dose they receive will be either 100mg twice a day or 150mg twice a day.

Arms 3 and 4 of Part 2 of this study will test the 150mg and 100mg BID dose of TL-895, respectively in treatment naïve participants with CLL/SLL.

Arms 5 and 6 of Part 2 will test 150mg TL-895 BID in combination with 240 mg navtemadlin QD in participants with relapsed/refractory and treatment naïve without 17p(del). Arm 7 will test 150mg TL-895 in combination with 240 mg navtemadlin QD in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL with 17p(del).

Every participant in this study will receive TL-895.

DRUG: TL-895|DRUG: Navtemadlin
Part 1 (Dose Escalation): DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicities) during Cycle 1, DLT is defined as any of the adverse event (AEs) of a certain grade or above, related to drug., Baseline up to the end of cycle 1 (28 days)|Part 2 (Dose Expansion): Overall Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects achieving CR, CRi, nodular partial response (nPR), partial response (PR), or PR with lymphocytosis (PR-L) at any time while on the study based on iwCLL response criteria (2), as assessed by investigators, Baseline up to end of study (2 years after last patient enrolled)
Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Best Overall Response (BOR)/Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined by the length of time during the treatment of the disease, that a participant lives with the disease but it does not get worse based on investigator assessments, Baseline up to 6 months on treatment|Part 2 (Dose Expansion): Overall CR/CRi rate, The proportion of subjects achieving CR/CRi based on iwCLL response criteria, Baseline up to end of study (2 years after last patient enrolled)|Part 2: Duration of Clinical Response (DOR), Time from initial response to disease progression or death from any cause, Baseline up to end of study (2 years after last patient enrolled)|Part 2: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Incidence, nature, severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and deaths, including cause of death, from screening up to the end of study visit of participants with CLL/SLL who have failed at least 1 line of therapy, Baseline up to end of study (2 years after last patient enrolled)|Part 2: Assessment of Safety and Tolerability via Clinical Measurements, Assessments including but not limited to clinical laboratory measurements, ECGs, vital signs, and ECOG performance, Baseline up to end of study (2 years after last patient enrolled)
