Evaluation of Multi-Cancer Early Detection Testing in a High-Risk Population: The INFORM Study
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the possible benefits and harms of screening with an investigational blood test designed to detect many types of cancer early.

The name of the screening blood test being studied is:

-GRAIL Galleri test
Cancer Predisposition Syndrome|Predisposition, Genetic
OTHER: GRAIL Galleri Test
Cancer Detection Rate, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the number and types of cancers diagnosed by GRAIL Galleri MCED testing., Up to 2 years
Stage of Invasive Cancer Diagnosis, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the stages of invasive cancer that are diagnosed by GRAIL Galleri MCED testing and assessed by medical record review., Up to 2 years|Positive Predictive Value At 12 Months, Positive Predictive Value is defined as the proportion of participants with cancer diagnosis out of all participants with "signal detected" on GRAIL Galleri MCED test results., At 12 months|Positive Predictive Value at 24 Months, Positive Predictive Value is defined as the proportion of participants with cancer diagnosis out of all participants with "signal detected" on GRAIL Galleri MCED test results., At 24 months|Time to Diagnostic Resolution, Defined as the time required to achieve diagnostic resolution following a "signal detected" GRAIL Galleri MCED test result., Calculated from the date of return of screening results (up to 4 weeks from baseline) until up to 24 months post screening|Test Type Utilization to Diagnostic Resolution, Per participant the count of the number and types of diagnostic tests required to achieve diagnostic resolution following a "signal detected" GRAIL Galleri MCED test result., Up to 24 months|Change in Participant Anxiety, Changes in anxiety following the GRAIL Galleri MCED test result and assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Emotional Distress Anxiety - Short Form 6a, which is a 6 item survey that is rated on a 5-point Likert scale with answers ranging from "Never" to "Always". The range of scoring is from 6 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety., Up to 24 months|Change in Participant Health-related Quality of Life, Changes in health-related quality of life following the GRAIL Galleri MCED test result and assessed by PROMIS Scale v1.2 - Global Health, a 10 item survey that is rated on a 5-point Likert scale with answers ranging from "Excellent/Completely/Never/None" to "Poor/Not at all/Always/Very Severe" and includes a pain average question rated on a scale of 0 "No Pain" to 10 "Worst Pain Imaginable." The range of scoring is from 9 to 45 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life., Up to 24 months|Cost of Follow-up Testing, Defined as the dollar cost, per participant, of follow-up testing to achieve diagnostic resolution following a "signal detected" GRAIL Galleri MCED test result., Up to 24 months|Institutional Reimbursement of Follow-up Testing, Defined as the dollar cost, per participant, of the institutional reimbursement of follow-up testing to achieve diagnostic resolution following a "signal detected" GRAIL Galleri MCED test result., Up to 24 months
This is a prospective, interventional study to assess the use of the GRAIL's Galleri multi-cancer early detection (MCED) Test, an investigational blood test designed to detect many types of cancer, for participants that are considered at slightly higher than average risk of developing certain types of cancers. The test looks for small pieces of genetic material called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the blood that may indicate the presence of cancer.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, blood tests, questionnaires, and clinic visits.

Participation in this research study is expected to last up to 3 years.

It is expected that about 1,000 people will take part in this research study.
