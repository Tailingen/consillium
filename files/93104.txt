SPEARHEAD 2 Study in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of ADP-A2M4 in combination with pembrolizumab in HLA-A\*02 eligible and MAGE-A4 positive subjects with recurrent or metastatic Head and Neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
GENETIC: ADP-A2M4 in combination with pembrolizumab.
Efficacy: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of complete responses or partial responses as assessed by RECIST v1.1, 2.5 years
Best overall response (BOR), BOR defined as the best response recorded from the date of T cell infusion until disease progression., 2.5 years|Time to response (TTR), TTR defined as the duration between T cell infusion and the initial date of the confirmed response., 2.5 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR defined as the duration from the initial date of the confirmed response to the date of PD (or death)., 2.5 years|Duration of stable disease (DoSD), DoSD defined as the duration from the date of T cell infusion to the date of PD (or death)., 2.5 years|Progression- free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the interval between the date T cell infusion and the earliest date of disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., 2.5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS defined the duration between T cell infusion and death due to any cause., 2.5 years|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADP-A2M4 with pembrolizumab by determining incidence of Adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), Determination of incidence, severity and duration of adverse events through assessment of adverse events including SAEs. Adverse events will be collected and graded as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, 2.5 years|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADP-A2M4 with pembrolizumab by determining the incidence, severity and duration of the AEs of special interest, Adverse events of special interest will be listed along with duration and toxicity grade., 2.5 years|To evaluate safety of ADP-A2M4 with pembrolizumab through measurement of Replication-competent Lentivirus in genetically engineered T-cells, Evaluation of RCL using PCR-based assay in peripheral blood., 15 years
This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of ADP-A2M4 in combination with pembrolizumab in HLA-A\*02 eligible and MAGE-A4 positive subjects with recurrent or metastatic Head and Neck cancer.
