Conmana Combined With Thalidomide to Treat NSCLC
Our study the NSCLC harbors EGFR-mutation with Conmana combined with thalidomide as first-line treatment, is expected to improve further EGFR-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) response rate (ORR), prolong time to progression (PFS), improve patient survival.
NSCLC
DRUG: Conmana|DRUG: Thalidomide
5 years the progression-free survival (PFS) rate of the combination of thalidomide with gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR mutations., 5 years
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy, survival and side effects of the combined therapy, and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thalidomide with Conmana in patients who harbors EGFR mutations.
