Docetaxel (Taxotere), Vinorelbine, and Bevacizumab, as Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Patients With Resected Stage I-III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of the drugs docetaxel (Taxotere ® ), plus vinorelbine (Navelbine ® ), will result in fewer side effects than cisplatin chemotherapy, thereby improving delivery of chemotherapy in patients.

Another purpose of this study is to determine whether a third drug, bevacizumab (Avastin®), may be delivered safely with docetaxel plus vinorelbine in patients who are eligible to receive bevacizumab.

DRUG: Bevacizumab (Avastin), Taxotere (Docetaxel), Vinorelbine Tartrate (Navelbine)
To Measure the Number of Cycles, Cycle delivery is a surrogate for drug delivery. Both cycle delivery and drug delivery will be measured in this study. However, cycle delivery (up to 4 cycles) is the common way drug delivery is measured in the literature, and therefore cycle delivery has been chosen as the primary endpoint for this study.Two doses of both docetaxel plus vinorelbine, delivered over 4 weeks, constitutes one cycle. If either drug is discontinued, the subject will remain on study, however that patient will not get credit for completing subsequent cycles of therapy. If the dose of either drug is reduced, the subject will remain on study and get credit for subsequent cycles., 2 years
