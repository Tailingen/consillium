Safety Evaluation Study for Patients With Aggressive NK-cell Leukemia
This is Phase I/II Dose-Escalation Study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of PPMX-T003 in aggressive NK-cell leukemia.
Aggressive NK Cell Leukemia
DRUG: PPMX-T003
Number of incidence of AEs and DLTs by PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (the first course), In order to evaluate tolerability and safety of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration in the first course, incidence of AEs and DLTs by the treatment are measured., 7days after the administration
Number of incidence of AEs and DLTs by PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (the second course or later), In order to evaluate tolerability and safety of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration in the second course or later, incidence of AEs and DLTs by the treatment are measured., From the second course to the final course (Max. 35days after the first administration)|Efficacy of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (1) Liver volume evaluated by CT scan, As a part of efficacy evaluation of the treatment, percentage change in the product of the maximum long and short diameters of the liver measured by CT (assessed by the primary physician), 35 days|Efficacy of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (2) improvement in liver function as assessed by the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD and MELD-Na), 35 days|Efficacy of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (3) Survival duration at 6 months, 6 months|Efficacy of PPMX-T003 repeated continuous intravenous administration (4) Percentage of subjects who were able to transition to chemotherapy, 35days after the treatment|Serum drug concentration during repeated continuous intravenous PPMX-T003 administration, 35 days|Anti-drug antibody production (Immunogenicity), 35 days
