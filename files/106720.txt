Ivosidenib + mFOLFIRINOX in Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This study is a single-arm, phase I trial, up to 16 participants with resectable PDA. The study will examine the efficacy of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib, in conjunction with standard-of-care mFOLFIRINOX in the neoadjuvant setting.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Ivosidenib|DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX
Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), Evaluate by the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) strategy to identify the MTD., Up to 24 months from the start of treatment
RECIST version 1.1 response rates., Number of participants with the progression-free occurrence., Up to 24 weeks from the start of treatment|Major pathologic response rates, Number of participants in whom historical treatment's response rate of 10%, Up to 24 weeks from the start of treatment|Biochemical response rates, Number of participants with normalization of serum tumor markers during treatment and after surgery., Up to 24 weeks from the start of treatment
Currently, the standard of care treatment for resectable PDA is surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The use of mFOLFIRINOX in this setting has extended survival significantly. Giving ivosidenibwith mFOLFIRINOXmay work better than treating participants with mFOLFIRINOX alone.
