Eversion in Dermatologic Surgery: Is Cosmetic Appearance Improved?
The investigators hypothesize that everting wound edges while suturing surgical sites will result in more aesthetic scars. Additionally, we also hypothesize that small to moderate wound irregularities present at 3 months will resolve by 6 months after surgery with no intervention
Basal Cell Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Everted suture technique|PROCEDURE: Non-everted suture technique
Everted versus non-everted suturing techniques, Primary outcome measures for this study are the post operative scar width measured at 1 cm from the midline on both sides of the scar., 3 and 6 months|Mean score of sum of 2 blinded observers POSAS scores, The mean summed total of two blinded reviewers Physician Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) scores for each side of the wound., 3 and 6 months|Scar measurements (height, width, length), Scar volume will be measured in centimeters on both sides of the wound, 3 and 6 months|Scar induration, Scar induration area will be measured in centimeters for both sides of the wound, 3 and 6 months|Scar erythema, Scar erythema area will be measured in centimeters for both sides of the wound, 3 and 6 months|Wound contour irregularities, Wound contour irregularities will be measured in terms of volume in cubic centimeters via a length, width and height measurement, 3 and 6 months|Stand cone volume, The volume of standing cones will be measured via length, width and height measurements in centimeters, 3 and 6 months|Uneven edge measurement, The area of uneven edges will be measured via a length x height measurement in centimeters, 3 and 6 months|Hyperpigmentation area, areas of hyperpigmentation will be measured via a length x width measurement in centimeters, 3 and 6 months
Infection, Infections occurring anytime during the study period will be recorded, up to 6 months|wound dehiscence, incidence of wound infection will be recorded anytime during the study period, up to 6 months|spitting sutures, spitting sutures will be counted for each side of the wound at 3 and 6 months, 3 and 6 months
