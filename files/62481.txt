A Clinical Trial of TQB2618 Injection Combined With Penpulimab Injection and Chemotherapy Versus Penpulimab Injection Combined With Chemotherapy in First-line Treatment of Relapsed/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2618 injection combined with Penpulimab and chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of relapsed/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared to Penpulimab combined chemotherapy.

Progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) were the primary efficacy endpoints.
Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck|Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: TQB2618 injection, Penpulimab injection, Paclitaxel, Cisplatin or Carboplatin|DRUG: Penpulimab injection, Paclitaxel, Cisplatin or Carboplatin
Progression free survival (PFS), The time period from the first administration of the drug to disease progression or death event (whichever occurs first)., Baseline to up to two years.|Objective response rate (ORR), According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and iRECIST, the proportion of subjects whose tumors are evaluated as complete response(CR) and partial response(PR) by subcenter imaging evaluation. It is recorded from the first administration of the drug to disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer treatment., Baseline to up to two years.
PFS rate at 9 months, Proportion of survived participants without progression at 9th months., Baseline to 9 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from the randomization to death from all causes., Baseline to up to two years.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 6 weeks or more as determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1., Baseline to up to two years.|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), The percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 6 months or more as determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1., Baseline to up to two years.|Duration of Remission (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Baseline to up to two years.|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), All adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug may be manifested as symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but are not necessarily causally related to the investigational drug, evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute standard for common toxic criteria \[NCI-CTC v5.0\]., Baseline to up to two years.|Severity of adverse events (AEs), All adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug may be manifested as symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but are not necessarily causally related to the investigational drug, evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute standard for common toxic reactions \[NCI-CTC v5.0\]., Baseline to up to two years.|Serious adverse events (SAEs), It refers to adverse medical events such as death, life-threatening, permanent or serious disability or loss of function, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, and congenital abnormalities or birth defects after the subject receives the experimental drug., Baseline to up to two years.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2618 injection combined with Penpulimab and chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of relapsed/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma compared to Penpulimab combined chemotherapy.
