A Phase I Study of Ixabepilone in Combination With Capecitabine in Japanese Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine in Japanese participants with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ixabepilone|DRUG: Capecitabine
Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as any ixabepilone and/or capecitabine related events requiring study discontinuation during the first two treatment cycles., From initiation of drug through last day of Cycle 2 (Day 42)|Participants Achieving the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The MTD was defined as the highest dose evaluated for which less than 1/3 of the participants experienced DLT during the first two treatment cycles. If toxicities (e.g. hand-foot syndrome, existing peripheral neuropathy, etc.) occurred or became more severe in later cycles, the recommended Phase II dose was to be determined after due consideration of their severity., At the end of Cycle 2 (Day 42)
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AE = any new untoward medical occurrence/worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE = any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in development of drug dependency or drug abuse, is an important medical event. Treatment-related=Possible, Probable, or Certain relationship to drug, Baseline to Day 42, continuously|Participant Tumor Response at Study Endpoint, Tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in which complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and stable disease (SD) = small changes that do not meet above criteria., At baseline and after every 42 days (every 2 21-day cycles) after baseline|Mean Ixabepilone Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) in One Dosing Interval, Cmax = maximum observed plasma concentration of ixabepilone as determined from participant serum samples in one dosing interval., During Cycle 1 at specified timepoints (Day 1 to Day 8).|Mean Ixabepilone Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC INF) in One Dosing Interval, AUC = the average area under the concentration curve (AUC \[INF\]) of ixabepilone as determined from participant serum samples in one dosing interval over 24 hours., During Cycle 1 at specified timepoints (Day 1 to Day 8).|Mean Ixabepilone Terminal Elimination Half Life (T 1/2) in One Dosing Interval, T 1/2 = terminal elimination half life as determined from participant serum samples in one dosing interval., During Cycle 1 at specified timepoints (Day 1 to Day 8).|Mean Ixabepilone Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) in One Dosing Interval, Vss = volume of distribution at steady state determined from participant serum samples from one dosing interval., During Cycle 1 at specified timepoints (Day 1 to Day 8).|Mean Ixabepilone Total Body Clearance (CLT) in One Dosing Interval, CLT = total body clearance as determined from participant serum samples in one dosing interval., During Cycle 1 at specified timepoints (Day 1 to Day 8).
The purpose of this study is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose of ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine in Japanese participants with metastatic breast cancer.
