Safety, Tolerability & Potential Anti-cancer Activity of Increasing Doses of AZD5363 in Different Treatment Schedules
This study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of a new drug, AZD5363, in patients with advanced cancer - and to identify a dose and schedule that can be used in the future. This study will also investigate how the body handles AZD5363 (ie, how quickly the body absorbs and removes the drug). This study will also investigate anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 in patients with advanced / metastatic breast, gynaecological cancers or other solid cancers bearing either AKT1 / PIK3CA or PTEN mutation.

To characterise AZD5363 PK following single & multiple dosing by assessment of maximum plasma concentration,time to Cmax, terminal rate constant, terminal half life,area under the plasma concentration-time curve,plasma clearance & volume of distribution., Sample:Part A&B:Cycle0Day1(predose,30min,1,2,4,6,8,10-12,24&48h postdose),C1D1(predose),D8/Last wkly dose(predose,30min,1,2,4,6,8,10-12h postdose),D15/Last wkly dose+7(predose),Part C,D,E&F:C1D1(predose,2,4h postdose)&D11(predose,2,4h postdose)|Parts A,B,C,D,E&F: To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 via use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, Tumour assessment by RECIST at 6,12,18,24wks then at 12 weekly intervals until discontinuation of study therapy
A Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-tumour Activity of Ascending Doses of AZD5363 under Adaptable Dosing Schedules in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies.
