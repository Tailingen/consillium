Number of Participants Scored as Responder in Maintenance Phase., A "responder" is a participant in the study that:

1. completed 28 days of the maintenance phase
2. had a numeric rating scale score below 5 on the 11 point scale (where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates worst possible pain. This twice daily current pain score was averaged over Day 18 to Day 43.
3. did not use more than 20 mg of rescue medication per day on average in the 28 day maintenance period (from Day 18 to Day 43).

A participant that met all 3 of the above-mentioned criteria is counted as a responder, in other words the participant benefited from the assigned drug treatment. A participant that failed to meet only 1 of the 3 criteria is not counted as a responder., Day 18 through Day 43 (End of Maintenance Phase)

The physical components of withdrawal are primarily evaluated and based on questions and clinical observations. The possible opioid withdrawal effects are assessed using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS). The COWS is a clinician rated 11-item scale that primarily evaluates the physical components of opioid withdrawal and is based on questions and clinical observations. Responses are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 4 or 5 depending on the item. The total COWS score is the sum of all individual items.

The following withdrawal categories are based on the total COWS score:

* None: total score below 5;
* Mild: total score from 5 to 12;
* Moderate: total score 13 to 24;
* Moderately Severe: total score 25 to 36;
* Severe: total score above 36. The investigator completes the COWS after participants discontinued trial medication 2 to less than 5 days after last intake of trial medication., Day 14 (End of Titration Phase)|Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score (COWS) at the End of the Maintenance Phase., This instrument was developed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Participants are asked "How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?" e.g. "Pain in your stomach". There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 questions on rectal symptoms and 5 questions on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The changes in overall mean and in each of the mean sub-scores vary theoretically from -4 to +4 (where a change of +4 would indicate a change from not present to very severe symptom). If the changes in the overall or subscale mean scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation from the start to the end of the titration phase., Day 1 (Start of Titration); Day 14 (End of Titration Phase)|Change in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) During the Maintenance Phase, The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation.

Normally chronic tumor related pain is controlled when participants receive repeated doses of opioid analgesics. However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression. Tapentadol (CG5503), a newly synthesized drug with an prolonged release (PR) formulation, also acts as a centrally acting pain reliever but has 2 mechanisms of action. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety (side effects) of tapentadol (CG5503) PR compared with no drug (placebo) and corresponding dose of morphine (an opioid commonly used to treat tumor related pain). This trial is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor patient will know which treatment was received), active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized withdrawal design, multicenter trial.

The trial includes a 2 week titration phase starting with either 40 mg morphine (PR) bid (bid = twice daily dosing, one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening) or 100 mg tapentadol (CG5503) PR bid. Based on effectiveness and side effects subjects can up-titrate in steps of 50 mg tapentadol (CG5503 PR) to a maximal dose of 250 mg tapentadol (CG5503) PR bid or 100 mg morphine PR bid. If participants meet the stabilisation criteria at the end of the titration phase they will be re-randomized to either placebo or active treatment and will continue 4 weeks at the last dose level in the maintenance phase. Only participants on tapentadol in the titration phase will be re-randomized to either matching placebo or to tapentadol. To maintain the blinding nature of the trial participants in the morphine arm during the titration phase will also be re-randomized however they will all remain on morphine controlled release in the maintenance phase. Placebo to match tapentadol tablets, as well as placebo to match morphine capsules, will be used to mask the treatment allocation.

Participants will be issued with an electronic diary (eDiary) to capture Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain intensities.

Assessments of pain relief include the pain intensity numeric rating scale (NRS) and patient global impression of change (PGIC). Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms. Venous blood samples will be collected for the determination of serum concentrations of tapentadol (CG5503).
