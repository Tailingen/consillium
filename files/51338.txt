Adoptive Transfer of Specific Melanoma Antigens CD8+ T Cells in Metastatic Melanoma Patients: a Phase I/II Study
This study evaluates the safety as well as the potential clinical efficacy of an adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells, sorted with HLA-peptide multimers and specific for Melan-A and MELOE-1 melanoma antigens, to patients suffering from advanced metastatic melanoma (stages IIIc and IV).
Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Melanoma antigens-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes
Clinical and biological safety defined by the NCI (Common Toxicity Criteria - Version 4.0, may 2009, http:// ctep.cancer.gov), Serious adverse effects of grade 3 and 4 will be considered to decide the suspension of inclusion, Until disease progression during the follow-up period of the study (12 months)
Progression-free survival, From the date of the first treatment until the date of the first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Overall survival, From the date of the first treatment until the date of death, assessed up to 2 years|Overall tumor response (complete response, partial response, stable disease) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) and immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), At 12 months|Duration of clinical responses defined as the time interval between the evaluation of the first objective response or stable disease and the first evaluation of disease progression, At 12 months|Persistence of injected specific T cells evaluated by immunomonitoring, At 3 months
