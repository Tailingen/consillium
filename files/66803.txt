Cardiac Dysfunction in Childhood Cancer Survivors
This multicenter, prospective cohort study evaluates early cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of childhood cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that cardiac dysfunction can be detected earlier when using speckle tracking echocardiography as novel echocardiographic technique compared to conventional echocardiography.

Cardiovascular disease including cardiac dysfunction is the leading non-malignant cause of death in childhood cancer survivors. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction is important to identify those in need for medical intervention to improve outcome. This study invites adult childhood cancer survivors to a clinical appointment to the University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. A detailed, standardized cardiac assessment including conventional and novel echocardiographic techniques (speckle tracking) as well as cardiopulmonary exercise testing is performed. Cardiac dysfunction is evaluated in survivors who have had cardiotoxic cancer therapy with anthracyclines and/or chest radiation (high risk) and in survivors who have had chemotherapy other than anthracyclines (standard risk).
