Outcomes After Esophageal Cancer Surgery
Background

* Esophageal carcinoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer -related mortality and the eighth most common cancer worldwide
* The incidence is increasing rapidly
* The overall 5-year survival ranges from 15% to 25% in the literature and poor outcomes are related to diagnosis at advanced stages.
* Surgery used to be the cornerstone of treatment of resectable esophageal cancer, but treatment of esophageal carcinoma remains challenging and need to be considered through a multimodal approach. However the modalities and the impact of this multimodal approach at a national level are unknown Primary objective: To identify predictors of recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery

Secondary objectives :

* 5-year recurrence free survival
* 5-year overall survival
* Predictors of postoperative mortality and morbidity after surgery
* Impact of pCR on recurrence and survival
* Impact of neoadjuvant treatments on recurrence and survival
* Impact of patient preconditioning (such as nutritional support, esophageal prosthesis, mini-invasive approach...) on outcomes

Methodology : European French-speaking retrospective multicentric study Inclusion criteria: All consecutive patients operated on, for a histologically proven carcinoma of the esophagus, the oesophago-gastric junction (Siewert type I and II), in surgical investigator centers between January 2000 and December 2010 Exclusion criteria: Siewert III type carcinoma of the oesophago-gastric junction , non surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma Planned study period: The data will be collected over a 11-year period from January 2000 to December 2010. Follow up will be ascertained in May 2013.

PROCEDURE: Esophagectomy
To identify predictors of recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery, clinical factors linked to 5-year recurrence will be identify through univariable and multivariable analysis, 30 May 2012
5 year recurrence free survival, events: death and recurrence at 5 years after surgery, 30 May 2012|5 year overall survival, all causes for death at 5 years after surgery, 30 may 2012|Predictors of postoperative mortality and morbidity after surgery, 30-day postoperative mortality and 30-day overall postoperative morbidity, 30 May 2012|Impact of pCR on recurrence and survival, pathological complete response within the tumor and nodes, 30 May 2012|Impact of neoadjuvant treatments on recurrence and survival, looking at the impact of neoadjuvant chemo and/or chemoradiation on oncological outcomes, 30 May 2012|Impact of patient preconditioning (such as nutritional support, esophageal prosthesis, mini-invasive approachâ€¦) on outcomes, looking at the impact of nutritional support, endoscopic and surgical procedures on outcomes, 30 May 2012
Patients with an esophageal or junctional carcinoma (including SIewert type I and II) with surgical resection of the primary tumor inclusion date will be date of surgery all patients will be followed during 5 years after surgery or time of death
