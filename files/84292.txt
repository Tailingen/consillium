A Study of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab) in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (D-Vd) in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of JNJ-54767414 (daratumumab) in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (D-Vd) in Japanese participants with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not responding to treatment) multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab)|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Approximately 2 years
Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab), The Cmin is the maximum observed serum concentration of JNJ-54767414., Approximately 2 years|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab), The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of JNJ-54767414., Approximately 2 years|Serum Concentration of JNJ-54767414 (Daratumumab) Antibodies, Serum levels of antibodies to Daratumumab for evaluation of potential immunogenicity., Approximately 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response or partial response according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria, during or after study treatment., Approximately 2 years|Percentage of Participants with Complete Response (CR) or better, CR is Defined as the proportion of Participants achieving CR (including sCR) according to the IMWG criteria., Approximately 2 years|Percentage of Participants with a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better, VGPR is defined as a greater than 90% reduction in serum myeloma protein (M-protein) plus urine myeloma protein less than 100 milligram (mg) per 24 hours., Approximately 2 years|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of observed response (CR or PR)., Approximately 2 years
This is an open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of the study treatments) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study in Japanese participants. The study will include a Screening Phase (21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1); open-label treatment phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 until study treatment discontinuation, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons), and a Follow-up Phase. Bortezomib and Dexamethasone will be administered along with JNJ-54767414 for first 8 treatment cycles. Follow-up Phase begins immediately following the End-of-Treatment Visit, and will continue until 8 weeks after last study treatment, death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal for study participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
