A First-in-human, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study of SAR445877 in Adult Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multiple cohort study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of SAR445877 as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer therapies for participants aged at least 18 years with advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

The study will include 2 parts:

A dose escalation Part 1: for finding the therapeutic dose(s) of SAR445877 in a monotherapy given every 2 weeks (Q2W) or weekly (QW) and in combination with other anticancer therapies when applicable.

A multicohort dose expansion/dose optimization Part 2: for the assessment of safety and preliminary efficacy of SAR445877 in monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab: 2 recommended doses for expansion/optimization of SAR445877 identified from dose escalation part 1 will be tested in different indications in monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer therapies as applicable.

Approximately 291 participants will be exposed to the study intervention: approximately 75 participants in part 1, up to 210 participants in expansion/dose optimization part (part 2) and up to 6 participants in Japan cohort F.

The duration of the study for a participant will include:

Screening Period: up to 28 days Treatment Period: enrolled and exposed participants will receive continuous treatment until progressive disease (PD), or an occurrence of an unacceptable AE, a withdrawal of consent, or until other permanent discontinuation criteria described in the protocol are met.

The End of Treatment (EOT) visit will occur 30 days Â±7 days from the last IMP administration or prior to the initiation of further therapy, whichever occurs first.

The follow-up period will occur until disease progression, the start of new anticancer therapy, death, or withdrawal of participant's consent, whichever comes first.
