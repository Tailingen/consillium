A Real-World Observational Study: Zevorcabtagene Autoleucel Injection in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, post-marketing, Phase IV, prospective, observational clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the post-marketing product zevor-cel as treatment for subjects with R/R MM in the real world.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Zevorcabtagene Autoleucel
To evaluate long-term survival benefits of zevor-cel in subjects with R/R MM, Statistical analysis of OS will be performed, survival curves of OS will be plotted, and 1-year and 2-year survival rates will be calculated. The median, 25% quantile, and 75% quantile of OS will be calculated with their 95% confidence intervals., 24 months
Primary study endpoints:

Overall Survival Rate (OS Rate) at 24 months after infusion：Survival rate from the start of cell infusion to 24 months after infusion.

Secondary study endpoints:

Incidence and Severity of Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TEAEs) for zevor-cel Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) related to study treatment Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study treatment

Other efficacy endpoints of zevor-cel:

Overall response rate (ORR)：Proportion of subjects with a partial response (PR) or above.

Complete response or stringent complete response rate (CR/sCR) ：The proportion of subjects with the best response of CR/sCR.

Duration of Response (DOR)：The time from first response to disease progression or death caused by any reasons in subjects with the best response of PR and above.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) Overall survival (OS)： The time from the start of cell infusion to death due to any cause.
