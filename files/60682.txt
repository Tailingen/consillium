Perineal Versus Rectal Approach for Prostate Biopsy to Prevent Iatrogenic Infections
Retrospective reports from literature have shown a lower rate of infections for transperineal versus transrectal approach for prostate biopsies in the setting of prostate cancer suspicion.

The aim of this study would be to compare in a prospective randomized trial the rate of infection with transperineal versus transrectal approach.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Transperineal prostate biopsy|PROCEDURE: Transrectal prostate biopsy
Rate of post-biopsy infection from Baseline to four weeks after prostate biopsy, Urinary infection will be assessed based on urinanalysis : 10\^5 germs and 10\^4 leucocytes minimum), Four weeks post-biopsy
Presence of antibiotic resistant germ, Antibiotic resistant germ will be assessed on urinanalysis, One week, two weeks and four weeks post-biopsy|Presence of complication post-biopsy : hematuria, urinary retention, rectoragy, any other complication, Presence of complication will be assessed during phone interview with the patient, One week, two weeks and four weeks post-biopsy
Retrospective reports from literature have shown a lower rate of infections for the transperineal versus transrectal approach for prostate biopsies in the setting of prostate cancer suspicion.

Post-biopsy infection is becoming a more and more challenging situation due to the increase of incidence and development of antibiotic resistant germs.

The aim of this study would be to compare in a prospective randomized trial the rate of infection with transperineal vs transrectal approach.

Patient presenting an indication of prostate biopsy (PSA elevation, suspicious lesion at digital rectal, suspicious lesion on MRI) would be randomized 1:1 among transrectal vs transperineal biopsies.

Post-biopsy infection would be monitored by systemic urine analysis at one, two and four weeks after procedure and in case of clinical symptoms.
