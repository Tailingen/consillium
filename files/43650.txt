Magnetic Resonance Imaging Screening in Li Fraumeni Syndrome
This study is aimed at exploring the use of whole body MRI for early cancer detection in TP53 mutation carriers and population controls, with the hypothesis that more cancers will be detected in the TP53 mutation carrier group. A secondary end-point will be the number of incidental findings detected and subsequent investigations required. A series of questionnaires will be used to assess the psychological impact of screening on both the study and control group.
