Role of CX3CR1-expressing Cells in Hematologic Malignancy
This study evaluates the clinical significance of CX3CR1-expressing myeloid and lymphoid cells in patients of hematologic malignancy.

Tumor cells either express membrane molecules or release tumor-derived soluble factors able to alter myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. Myeloid cells expressing CD11b play a critical role in sustaining cancer progression. Also, the fractalkine (CX3CL1; Fkn)/CX3CR1 axis plays an important function in the pathophysiology of various forms of cancers. Fkn is the only known ligand for CX3CR1, and it triggers recruitment of CX3CR1-positive cells through its unique receptor, CX3CR1. Therefore, the investigators focused the prognostic significance of CD11b+ myelo-monocytic cells expressing CX3CR1 and CD3+ lymphoid cells expressing CX3CR1 in the clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Multiple myeloma (MM).
CX3CR1 Protein|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
progression free survival, 3 years
overall survival, 3 years|Death, 3 years
Bone marrow aspirates will be obtained from newly diagnosed MM and DLBCL patients at the time of diagnosis and relapse. Peripheral blood will be obtained at the time of diagnosis, finishing treatment, 3 months after treatment and relapse.

The investigators will analyze the cell fractions of CD11b+ CX3CR1+ cells and CD3+CX3CR1+ cells in blood samples by flowcytometry. The investigators will find out the relationship between the tested cells and clinical outcome in MM and DLBCL.
