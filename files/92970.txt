Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy With YESCARTA in the Outpatient Setting
We hope to demonstrate that YESCARTA can be safely administered in the outpatient setting if we closely monitor subjects with physical exams, wearable devices, and telemedicine visits and only admit those who meet specified criteria
Large B-cell Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Telemedicine Visit|PROCEDURE: Vital sign measurements|PROCEDURE: Out-Patient Clinic Visit|PROCEDURE: Blood pressure and pulse oximeter|BIOLOGICAL: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Number of Participants That Received YESCARTA, The number of participants that received YESCARTA as outpatient therapy, Approximately 6 weeks|Participants That Required Hospitalization at 72 Hours Post Infusion, Number of subjects that were admitted to hospital at 72 hours post infusion, at 72 hours|Participants That Required Hospitalization at 7 Days Post Infusion, Number of subjects that were admitted to the hospital at 7 days post infusion, at 7 days|Participants That Required Hospitalization at 14 Days Post Infusion, Number of subjects that were admitted to the hospital at 14 days post infusion, at 14 days|Participants That Required Hospitalization at 30 Days Post Infusion, Number of subjects that were admitted to hospital at 30 days post infusion, at 30 days
Count of Risk Factors That Preclude Out-patient Administration of YESCARTA, Reasons as to why a participant did not receive YESCARTA in the out-patient setting, Approximately 30 days|Participants That Experienced Cytokine Release Syndrome Events, Count of participants that had cytokine release syndrome events, Approximately 30 days|Participants That Experienced Immune Effector Cell-associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome Events, Count of participants that had an immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome event, Approximately 30 days|Incidence of Steroid Administration During YESCARTA, Count of participants that were administered steroids during treatment, Approximately 30 days|Cost Per Patient of Administering YESCARTA in the Out-patient Setting, Cost includes hospital clinic charges and CAR-T acquisition. It was pre-specified to report a single dollar amount that every participant was changed. The amount entered was the amount that each patient was charged. It was not planned to assess this amount separately for each participant., Approximately 30 days
Primary Objectives

* To explore the feasibility of treating subjects with YESCARTA in the outpatient setting and guide the development of a subsequent, larger study that will determine the tolerability and safety profile of YESCARTA in the outpatient setting.
* To determine the time to specific interventions post infusion and the number of subjects who remain outpatient through 72 hours, 7, 14, and 30 days.

Secondary Objectives:

* Identify risk factors that preclude outpatient administration, and to obtain clinical data that will guide the development of guidelines by which YESCARTA treatment in the outpatient setting can be done safely.
* Assess the impact of close monitoring with telemedicine and twice-daily physical exam on specific outcomes including CRS and ICANS in subjects treated with YESCARTA in the outpatient setting.
* Cumulative steroid exposure within 28 days post YESCARTA infusion.
* To calculate the estimated cost of YESCARTA administered in the outpatient setting.

Exploratory Objectives:

* Time from YESCARTA infusion to the following: fever, fever with neutropenia, fever without neutropenia.
* Time from fever to Tocilizumab, fever to ICU admission, fever to low BP, fever to IV Fluid, fever to vasopressor, fever to onset to arrhythmias and fever to hospitalization.
* Calculate modified Neutropenic Fever Symptom Burden (NFSB) score for days 1-3 for each subject. Appendix D
* Obtain subject reported outcomes measured by Subject-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS; Appendix F) \[16, 17\]
* Feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor vital signs in the outpatient setting. Data collected are for research only
