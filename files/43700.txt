Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin Compared With Etoposide Plus Cisplatin for Extensive Stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
This study is aimed to evaluate the progression-free survival(PFS) and also survival of IP and EP (head-to-head) as the first line therapy for extensive stage small-cell lung cancer and to explore the reasonable first-line therapy for Chinese population. An open-label, multi-center study will be conducted with dynamic randomization of approximately 1:1 ratio with an estimation of 308 eligible participants.
