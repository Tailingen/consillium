Adherence Improving Self-Management Strategy (AIMS) in Breast Cancer Patients Using Adjuvant Endocrine Treatment (AET)
Background of the study:

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Dutch women. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) substantially improves chances for survival after primary breast cancer. In practice, many women experience difficulties to adhere to treatment: besides missing single or multiple doses of medication, up to 50% of patients stop treatment prematurely due to decreased treatment motivation over time and burden of side effects. Together with patients and health care professionals, we adapted a cost-effective behavior change intervention (AIMS) for women using adjuvant endocrine therapy after breast cancer to an add-on module in regular follow up care.

Objective of the study:

The primary aim of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of the AIMS-AET intervention versus usual treatment on medication adherence in breast cancer survivors on adjuvant endocrine therapy. Intervention effects on psychosocial determinants and user experiences will be evaluated. The feasibility of testing the AIMS-AET intervention in a bigger RCT will be assessed. The secondary objective is to assess (preliminary) intervention effects on adherence, physical activity and on quality of life.

Study design:

A pilot randomised controlled trial comparing AIMS AET to usual care with an extensive mixed-methods process evaluation.

Study population:

Female outpatients of 2 Dutch hospitals with a prescription for adjuvant endocrine therapy after primary breast cancer. Intervention (if applicable):

An in-person delivered intervention imbedded in regular follow-up care during 9-months. Patients will receive an electronic monitoring System to track medication intake and a pedometer to count daily amount of steps. During the baseline visit, the health care professional (HCP) will use pre-tested materials for informing and motivating patients; and collaboratively set goals and plans for medication adherence and physical activity. During regular follow-up consultations with the HCP, personalized visual reports of medication intake and amount of steps will be evaluated to enhance patients awareness of their (non-)adherence and (in)activity and identify any problems and solutions to reduce undesired behaviour. The control group will receive usual treatment only.

BEHAVIORAL: Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy|OTHER: Regular care
Intervention effects on psychosocial determinants (beliefs, motivation, social norm), degree of agreement with statements about beliefs and motivation towards treatment and social norm assessed with a self-developed questionnaire, change from baseline at 12 months|Intervention effects on self-efficacy, degree of agreement with statements about self-efficacy regarding treatment measured with the Self Efficacy of Appropriate Medication use Scale (SEAMS) and additional self-developed items. Higher scores indicated higher levels of self-efficacy for medication adherence., change from baseline at 12 months|Delivery of the intervention in everyday context, Quantitative assessement of intervention steps and content measured with a self-developed checklist for health care professionals, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Satisfaction of HCPs with the intervention, Qualitative assessment (semi-structured interviews) measuring to which extend HCPs perceive the intervention as acceptable practical and sustainable, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Satisfaction of patients with the intervention, Qualitative assessment (semi-structured interviews) measuring patient experiences with the intervention regarding acceptability and feasibility, through study completion, an average of 1 year
(preliminary) intervention effects on adherence, days of missed medication, 1 year|(preliminary) intervention effects on physical activity, assessing habitual activity with the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity (SQUASH). Higher scores indicate more time spended on habitual physical activity., change from baseline at 6 and 12 months|(preliminary) intervention effects on quality of life, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES). Higher values reflect a better quality of life., change from baseline at 12 months|(preliminary) intervention effects on social support, assessed with the Sociale Steun Lijst - Discrepanties (SSL-D). A higher score indicates a higher lack of social support., change from baseline at 12 months|(preliminary) intervention effects on self-management, assessed with the Patient Activiation Measurement (PAM-13). A higher score indicates a higher level of self-management., change from baseline at 12 months|Treatment as usual, Treatment as usual will be assessed by the Treatment as usual questionnaire (an open ended questionnaire) in HCPs, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Satisfaction of patients with usual care, qualitative semi-structured interviews with participants of the control group about their experiences of delivered care, through study completion, an average of 1 year
