A Study of FCN-338 in Patients With Chronic CLL/SLL
This study is being done to evaluate the Tolerability、Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary antitumor activity of oral FCN-338 for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), who have failed or are intolerant to one or more lines of established therapy or for whom no other treatment options are available.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: FCN-338
The occurrence of treatment-related adverse events meeting the criteria for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 1 (28 days)|To establish the recommended MTD dose and Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FCN-338 for future clinical trials in patients with advanced CLL/SLL, Up to 24 months|The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) reported in all subjects who received study drug, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|The occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs), From first dose up to 30 days after last dose
Pharmacokinetic variables including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1 (28 days)|Pharmacokinetic variables including minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), Cycle 1 (28 days)|To quantify the last time point with a quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of FCN-338, Cycle 1 (28 days)|To measure the time to reach the highest plasma concentrations (Tmax) of FCN-338, Cycle 1 (28 days)|To quantify the terminal half-life (T1/2) of FCN-338 after administration as a single agent, Cycle 1 (28 days)|To quantify the plasma clearance (CL/f) of FCN-338 after administration as a single agent, Cycle 1 (28 days)|To determine the best overall response rate (ORR) by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in subjects with Chronic CLL/SLL, Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled in the study
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study of Tolerability、Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary antitumor activity of FCN-338 in ascending cohorts to determine the MTD or recommended dose in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL patients. This is to be followed by a cohort expansion phase at the MTD or recommended oral dose.
