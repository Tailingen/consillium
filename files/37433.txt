A Study of the Efficacy of ABT-199 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia With the 17p Deletion
This was an open-label, multicenter, global study to determine the efficacy of ABT-199 (Venetoclax) monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harboring 17p deletion.

DRUG: ABT-199 (Main Cohort)|DRUG: ABT-199 (Safety Expansion Cohort)
Overall Response Rate (Main Cohort), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with an overall response (complete remission \[CR\] + complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery \[CRi\] + nodular partial remission \[nPR\] + partial remission \[PR\]) per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) in the first 70 participants treated in the Main Cohort., Up to 36 weeks|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (Safety Expansion Cohort), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of study drug., From the first dose of study drug until 30 days following last dose of study drug (up to 69 months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Safety Expansion Cohort), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with an overall response (complete remission \[CR\] + complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery \[CRi\] + nodular partial remission \[nPR\] + partial remission \[PR\]) per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Complete Remission (CR) Rate, Complete remission was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a CR or Complete Remission with Incomplete Marrow Recovery(CRi ) per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria. Participants who did not achieve a CR or CRi were considered to be non-responders in the calculation of CR rate., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Partial Remission (PR) Rate, PR rate was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a nodular partial remission (nPR) or PR per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria. Participants who did not achieve a nPR or PR were considered to be non-responders in the calculation of PR rate., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response (DoR) was defined as the number of days from the date of first response (CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) by either CT scan or physical exam determination to the earliest recurrence (progressive disease; PD) or death. For participants who had a PR before CR, CRi, or nPR in subsequent visits, the DoR was computed from the earliest PR. If a participant was still responding, then their data was censored at the date of their last available disease assessment. To be included in the DoR analysis, participants must have had a response per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria (CR, CRi, confirmed nPR, or confirmed PR). For participants who never experienced response, their data was not included in the analysis., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Progression-free Survival, Duration of progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression or death. All disease progression was included regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was taking ABT-199 or had previously discontinued ABT-199. If the participant does not experience disease progression or death, then the data was censored at the date of last disease assessment. Data for participants without any disease assessments performed after the baseline visit were censored at the date of first dose plus 1 day., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression, death, or start of a new anti-leukemic therapy. If the specified event (disease progression, death, start of a new anti-leukemic treatment) did not occur, participants were censored at the date of last disease assessment. Data for participants without any disease assessments performed after the baseline visit were censored at the date of first dose plus 1 day., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression. All disease progression was included regardless of whether the event occurred while the participant was taking ABT-199 or had previously discontinued ABT-199. If the participant did not experience disease progression, then the data was censored at the date of last available disease assessment. Data for participants without any disease assessments performed after the baseline visit were censored at the date of first dose plus 1 day., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Time to First Response, Time to first response was defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of the first sign of response (CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) given the participant has had a CR, CRi, confirmed nPR, or confirmed PR per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL)/National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-CWG) criteria. The first response could have been an assessment by physical exam as long as the results were later confirmed per the 2008 Modified IWCLL NCI-WG criteria. For participants who never experienced a response, the participant's data were not included in the analysis., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Time to 50% Reduction in Absolute Lymphocyte Count, Time to 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was defined as the number of days (hours if applicable) from the date of first dose to the date when the ALC had reduced to 50% of the baseline value. Only participants with a baseline of ALC \> 5 Ã— 10\^9 /L were included in the analysis. For participants who never achieved a 50% reduction in ALC, the participant's data were not included in the analysis., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death. For participants who did not die, their data was censored at the date of last study visit or the last known date to be alive, whichever was later., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 December 2020, approximately 7.5 years of follow-up|Percentage of Participants Who Moved on to Stem Cell Transplant, The percentage of participants who moved on to stem cell transplant was summarized., Up to the data cutoff date of 15 June 2017, approximately 4 years of follow-up
This study was designed to enroll approximately 150 participants in 2 cohorts: a main cohort of approximately 100 participants, and a safety expansion (SE) cohort of approximately 50 participants. The primary objective of the main cohort was to evaluate the efficacy of ABT-199 monotherapy in participants with R/R CLL harboring the 17p deletion. The primary objective of the safety expansion cohort was to evaluate the safety of ABT-199 in approximately 50 participants with R/R CLL harboring 17p deletion treated per updated tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis and management measures.
