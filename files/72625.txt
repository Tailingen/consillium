Comparative Study of Gemcitabine,Cisplatin and Radiation Versus Cisplatin and Radiation in Cancer of the Cervix
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two methods of treating cancer of the cervix. Half the patients will receive gemcitabine plus cisplatin while undergoing radiation therapy, followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin and the other half will receive cisplatin along with radiation therapy without adjuvant therapy.
Cancer of Cervix
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Brachytherapy|RADIATION: Pelvic radiation
Number of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause at 3 Years, Original outcome was Progression-Free Survival (PFS) probability at 3 years. PFS=time from baseline to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. Probability is not an accepted "Measure Type", so number of progression-free patients still at risk and cumulative number of patients that had an event (PD or death of any cause) are presented., Tumor assessments at baseline, weekly during chemoradiation & brachytherapy, on Day 1 of adjuvant Cycles 1&2 for Arm A, at the 30-day post-study visit, every 4/6 months for 12/48 months of the short/long post-study follow-up periods respectively
Number of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death Due to Disease Under Study at Various Time Points, Original outcome was Time to Progressive Disease (TTPD), which is the time from baseline to event (progressive disease or death due to study disease). The median TTPD was not achieved and therefore the cumulative number of participants with event (and those still at risk) at various time points are presented., Tumor assessments at baseline, weekly during chemoradiation & brachytherapy, on Day 1 of adjuvant Cycles 1&2 for Arm A, at the 30-day post-study visit, every 4/6 months for 12/48 months of the short/long post-study follow-up periods respectively|Local Failure Rate, Local failure rate (LFR) was defined as the the proportion of per-protocol participants who had progressive disease (PD) in the cervix or pelvis. LFR = The number of (a) participants who progressed in the cervix or pelvis divided by (b) the number of participants in each arm. (LFR=a/b)., Tumor assessments at baseline, weekly during chemoradiation & brachytherapy, on Day 1 of adjuvant Cycles 1&2 for Arm A, at the 30-day post-study visit, every 4/6 months for 12/48 months of the short/long post-study follow-up periods respectively|Tumor Response, Tumor response rate (TRR) defined as number of qualified responder patients with confirmed complete or partial response., Tumor assessments at baseline, weekly during chemoradiation & brachytherapy, on Day 1 of adjuvant Cycles 1&2 for Arm A, at the 30-day post-study visit, every 4/6 months for 12/48 months of the short/long post-study follow-up periods respectively|Number of Participants Who Died From Any Cause at Various Time Points, Original outcome was Overall Survival, which was defined as time from baseline to death from any cause., baseline to date of death from any cause (includes 60 month follow-up period)|Number of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause at Various Time Points, Original outome was Progression-Free Survival, which was defined as time from baseline to progressive disease or death due to any cause., Tumor assessments at baseline, weekly during chemoradiation & brachytherapy, on Day 1 of adjuvant Cycles 1&2 for Arm A, at the 30-day post-study visit, every 4/6 months for 12/48 months of the short/long post-study follow-up periods respectively
