Evaluation of Improved Onboard Patient Imaging
The primary objective of radiation therapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of radiation precisely to the target while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissues. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) involves acquiring cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans just before or during treatment sessions. By comparing the CBCT images with the reference images from the treatment planning process, clinicians can make necessary adjustments to ensure precise targeting and account for any changes that may have occurred since the initial planning. Conventional CBCT technology is, however, limited by several factors including long acquisition times that result in motion artifacts in the image, smaller fields of view that limit the volume of anatomy that can be imaged, poor image quality that limits soft tissue visibility, and artifacts created by dense metal implants. This study will evaluate a novel CBCT imaging solution ("HyperSight") that has the potential to address the challenges of conventional CBCT.

Fraction of patients whose HyperSight CBCT images meet the criteria for CBCT-based treatment planning., To evaluate the feasibility of HyperSight CBCT as a method for CBCT-based re-planning by measuring the fraction of patients whose HyperSight imaging meets criteria for potential CBCT-based treatment planning using HyperSight CBCT. The criteria include visibility of all key anatomical structures, image quality sufficient to contour anatomical structures, and clinically acceptable dose accuracy., 1 year
Fraction of patients whose HyperSight CBCT images meet the criteria for CBCT-based treatment planning by anatomical site, To break down the fraction of patients that meet criteria for potential CBCT-based treatment planning using HyperSight CBCT by anatomical site (head/neck, breast, lungs, upper GI tract, and pelvis)., 1 year|Image noise, To evaluate the imaging noise in HyperSight CBCT using clinical images and to compare this aspect of image quality to simulation CT images., 1 year|Image low-contrast resolution, To evaluate contrast between adjacent anatomical structures in HyperSight CBCT using clinical images and to compare this aspect of image quality to simulation CT images., 1 year|Image contrast-to-noise ratio, To measure the contrast-to-noise ratio of HyperSight CBCT using clinical images and to compare this aspect of image quality to simulation CT images., 1 year|Qualitative assessment of motion artifacts, To evaluate the severity of motion artifacts observed in HyperSight CBCT using clinical images and to compare motion artifacts to simulation CT. Qualitative assessments will be performed by independent observers using a 5-point Likert scale., 1 year|Qualitative assessment of metal artifacts, To evaluate the severity of metal artifacts observed in HyperSight CBCT in head \& neck patients with dental fillings and pelvis patients with hip prostheses and compare metal artifacts between HyperSight CBCT and simulation CT. Qualitative assessments will be performed by independent observers using a 5-point Likert scale, with a score of 1 representing very severe metal artifacts and a score of 5 representing little or no artifact.., 1 year|Comparison of anatomical structure contours defined on HyperSight and conventional imaging., To evaluate concordance of anatomical structures contoured on HyperSight with anatomical structures contoured on simulation CT as measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient., 1 year|Comparison of anatomical structure contours defined on HyperSight and conventional imaging., To evaluate concordance of anatomical structures contoured on HyperSight with anatomical structures contoured on simulation CT as measured by Hausdorff Distance., 1 year|Breath hold tolerance, To evaluate the number of breath holds required for patients with breast, thoracic, and upper GI malignancies during HyperSight CBCT imaging., 1-9 weeks|Patient experience of HyperSight imaging, To evaluate patient experience of HyperSight imaging. Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. Questions will use a 5-point Likert scale., 1-9 weeks
