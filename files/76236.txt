middle progression free survival, To evaluate the median progression-free survival (middle) of tislelizumab combined with bevacizumab and platinum-based pemetrexed in treatment-naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with sensitive EGFR mutations and high PD-L1 expression. progression free survival (mPFS), Estimated about 6 months
A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with bevacizumab and platinum-based pemetrexed in the treatment of naïve patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutations and high PD-L1 expression Prospective, open-label, single-arm phase II clinical study;

Research purposes:

Main purpose: To evaluate the median progression-free rate of tislelizumab combined with bevacizumab and platinum pemetrexed in treatment-naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with sensitive EGFR mutations and high PD-L1 expression Survival (middle progression free survival, mPFS)

Secondary purpose:

* Evaluation of objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST version 1.1;
* Evaluation of disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST version 1.1;
* Assess overall survival (OS);
* Assess Duration of Response (DOR);
* Evaluate the safety of the treatment using NCI-CTCAE v5;

Exploratory Purpose:

• Assess potential predictive biomarkers.
