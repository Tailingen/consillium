Real World Pharmacokinetics of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Rationale: Real-world pharmacokinetic data from cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are sparse. Moreover, pharmacokinetic parameters may be associated with response to ICI treatment and may act as a predictive or early response biomarker.

Objective: To describe the real-world pharmacokinetics of ICIs in patients eligible for ICI treatment or already treated with ICIs.

Study design: A low-interventional cross-sectional pharmacokinetic study. Study population: Patients treated with ICIs. Intervention: A maximum of 13 blood samples (39 mL) will be derived from subjects on treatment. After discontinuation of ICI treatment, a maximum of 7 blood samples (21 mL) will be derived.

Main study parameters: Real- world pharmacokinetic parameters of ICIs: clearance, volume of distribution, serum exposure (serum concentration - time curve).
