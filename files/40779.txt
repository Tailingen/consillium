Monitoring Salivary Gland Injury in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients After Radiotherapy Using Multi-Modal Radiomics
This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the role of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) techniques in monitoring salivary gland injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients undergoing radiotherapy. The study will recruit patients diagnosed with NPC who are receiving standard radiotherapy, and quantitative imaging data will be collected using IVIM and MRF techniques at multiple time points, including pre-treatment, during radiotherapy, and post-treatment. The primary objective is to analyze changes in salivary gland structure and function and to identify early imaging biomarkers indicative of radiation-induced injury. The findings are expected to provide new insights into the dynamic progression of salivary gland damage, establish predictive models for the risk of xerostomia, and guide the development of personalized therapeutic strategies to mitigate long-term complications.

Primary Outcome Measure • Title: Quantitative assessment of salivary gland changes using IVIM and MRF imaging • Time Frame: From baseline to 6 months post-radiotherapy • Description: Quantification of salivary gland microstructural, perfusion, and re, IVIM Imaging: Quantification of salivary gland microstructural and perfusion changes using IVIM-derived parameters (D, D\*, f values) to evaluate radiotherapy-induced changes.

MRF Imaging: Quantification of salivary gland relaxation properties using MRF-derived relaxation times (T1 and T2 mapping) to evaluate radiotherapy-induced changes.

Unit of Measure:

IVIM: D, D\*, f values MRF: T1 and T2 relaxation times Analysis: Changes in salivary gland microstructure and perfusion (IVIM parameters) as well as relaxation properties (MRF parameters) will be assessed separately from baseline to 6 months post-radiotherapy., From baseline to 6 months post-radiotherapy
This is a prospective study designed to investigate the application of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) imaging techniques in monitoring salivary gland injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after radiotherapy. The study aims to quantify and assess salivary gland function changes during and after radiotherapy using advanced imaging technologies, with the goal of identifying early imaging biomarkers associated with radiation-induced damage.

Patients diagnosed with NPC and receiving standard radiotherapy will be recruited. Imaging data will be acquired at three time points: prior to radiotherapy (baseline), during radiotherapy (mid-course), and after radiotherapy (post-treatment). IVIM and MRF sequences will be performed to collect data on salivary gland microstructure, perfusion, and relaxation properties. These parameters will be analyzed to detect early changes in salivary gland function and correlate them with the development of xerostomia.

This study is expected to provide valuable insights into the utility of IVIM and MRF imaging in predicting and monitoring radiation-induced salivary gland damage. The findings may facilitate early intervention strategies and contribute to personalized radiotherapy planning aimed at minimizing xerostomia risk in NPC patients.
