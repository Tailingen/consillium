A Study of LY3022855 In Participants With Breast or Prostate Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how the investigational drug, LY3022855, affects the immune system in participants with advanced breast or prostate cancer that has not responded to other treatments. Treatment may last up to 6 cycles (cycle = 6 weeks).

DRUG: LY3022855
Percentage Change From Baseline in Peripheral Blood Immune Cell (PBIC) Subsets, The immunomodulatory activity of the drug was documented by examining markers that include, but are not limited to: Live-Dead, Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, Foxhead Box p3 (FoxP3), PD-1, Ki-67, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4), Human Leukocyte Antigen-D-relate (HLA-DR), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and Inducible T-cell COStimulator (ICOS). The expression of these markers was quantified by flow cytometric analysis with an antibody panel., Baseline to Day 8 after 1st dose|Percentage Change From Baseline in Serum Cytokines, The immunomodulatory activity of the drug was measured in participants with advanced, refractory breast or prostate cancers using serum cytokines. Serum cytokine levels was determined by MSD multiplex cytokine immunoassay technology or ELISA, and that may include but not be limited to Interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)., Baseline to Day 8 after 1st dose|Serum Cytokine Levels, The immunomodulatory activity of the drug was measured in participants with advanced, refractory breast or prostate cancers using serum cytokines. Serum cytokines will be determined by MSD multiplex cytokine immunoassay or ELISA. The markers to be measured using these technologies include, but are not limited to: CSF-1, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-34, and TNF-α., Day 8
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Curve of LY3022855, Area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to tau (τ) of LY3022855 (AUC\[0- τ\]), where tau is dosing interval of (0-14 days)., 0, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 29|Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Disease Control Response (Disease Control Rate), Disease control rate is the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR or SD, as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion; SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Disease control rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR or SD divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., Baseline up to 6 cycles (cycle = 6 weeks)
