Study of Anti-PD-L1 in Combination With Chemo(Radio)Therapy for Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative treatment with durvalumab combined with neoajuvant therapy (carboplatin, paclitaxel with/without radiation) in locally advanced resectable oesophageal squamous carcinoma.
