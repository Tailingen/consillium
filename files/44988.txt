Predictors of One-Year Mortality After Curative Surgery in Patients Aged 80 Years or Older With Non-Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to determine which preoperative factors are associated with one-year postoperative mortality in patients aged ≥80 years undergoing curative surgery and compare outcomes between patients with or without risk factors.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Curative intent surgery
Preoperative factors associated with one-year postoperative mortality, Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify preoperative factors associated with one-year postoperative mortality., From operation to one year after the surgery
Colorectal cancer is common among older adults, and with the aging global population, the number of elderly individuals diagnosed with this condition continues to rise. Current treatment guidelines identify surgery as the primary approach for managing non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that factors like advanced age, frailty, comorbidities, and nutritional status can predict surgical outcomes. However, in patients over 80 years old with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, questions remain regarding the definition of advanced age and frailty, the applicability of existing assessment tools to this specific group, and the determination of optimal cut-off values, all of which require further validation. Furthermore, there is a shortage of effective outpatient screening tools to identify vulnerable patients and provide reliable guidance for predicting postoperative survival. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine which preoperative factors are associated with one-year postoperative mortality in patients aged ≥80 years undergoing curative surgery and compare outcomes between patients with or without risk factors.
