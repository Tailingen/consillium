Evaluating Serum Sestrin in Leiomyoma Patients
Leiomyomas are the most common benign neoplasms of women's reproductive system affecting 20-30% of women within the reproductive ages. Sestrins are serum proteins which are highly expressed under circumstances of DNA damage, hypoxia and oxditive stress and play an important role in autophagia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of serum sestrin proteins with development of leiomyomas.
Uterine Leiomyoma
OTHER: Determination of serum sestrin levels
Evaluating the role of autophagia in the development of leiomyomas by evaluating the serum sestrin levels., Increased levels of serum sestrin proteins are associated with impaired autophagia. This association will be evaluated in the context of leiomyoma patients by measuring serum sestrin levels in blood samples obtained from these patients and comparing them with the sestrin levels measured in healthy subjects., 2 months
Leiomyomas are the benign neoplasms of uterus and the role of genetics, estrogen levels and obesity has already been shown in their development. Higher levels of serum sestrin proteins have already been associated with DNA damage, hypoxia and oxidative stress and sestrin plays an important role in autophagia. In order to evaluate the role of serum sestrin in the development of leiomyomas 30 patients between 18-45 years of age who were diagnosed with uterine leiomyomas with transvaginal ultrasonography will be included in the study group. Their serum sestrin levels will be determined and compared with that of 30 healthy subjects recruited during the same study period at the same clinic.
