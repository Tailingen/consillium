A Study of Alpelisib and Fulvestrant to Treat Endometrial Cancer
This is a 2 stage multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant in patients with PIK3CA-mutated ER-positive endometrioid endometrial cancers by estimating the objective response rate (ORR). Treatment will continue until either unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or investigator/patient request for withdrawal.
Endometroid Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Alpelisib Pill|DRUG: Fulvestrant injection
Response rate, To determine the objective response rate of the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant in patients with advanced, persistent or recurrent PIK3CA-mutated ER-positive endometrioid endometrial cancer. Respnse criteria based on RECIST Version 1.1 (complete or partial response)., Response to treatment is assessed by RECIST Version 1.1 criteria every 8 weeks with CT scan or MRI through completion of treatment (complete or partial response). Patients receive treatment until disease progression and are followed for 5 years.
Drug Toxicity (Side Effects), Drug toxicity will be assessed by collecting adverse event data every 4 weeks, Side effects are monitor from the start of treatment to discontinuation of treatment assessed every 4 weeks. Patients are treated until disease progression and are followed for 5 years.
