A Safety and Efficacy Study of Obinutuzumab Alone or in Combination With Chemotherapy in Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This multicenter, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in participants with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This is a Post-Authorization Safety Study. Participants will receive 6 cycles of single-agent obinutuzumab or obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion. Each participant will be followed until 30 months after the last participant has been enrolled. Total length of the study is anticipated to be approximately 5 years.

Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. AEs, including AEs of Special Interest and AEs of Particular Interest, were reported based on the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for AEs, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v4.0).
