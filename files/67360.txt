Olaparib in Combination With Pembrolizumab and Carboplatin as First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous-Cell Carcinoma
In this study, patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma will receive first line treatment with olaparib, pembrolizumab, and carboplatin. The primary hypothesis is that olaparib, pembrolizumab and carboplatin will result in an overall response rate (ORR) higher than the historical ORR observed with pembrolizumab, platinum and 5-FU.
