Natural History of Lung Nodules Seen on CT Scans From Participants at High-Risk of Developing Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Comparing lung CT scans from participants with lung nodules at high-risk for lung cancer may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better methods of treatment.

PURPOSE: This trial studies the natural history of lung nodules using CT scans from participants at high-risk for lung cancer.
Lung Cancer|Precancerous Condition
OTHER: medical chart review|PROCEDURE: computed tomography|PROCEDURE: computer-aided detection/diagnosis
Natural evolution of lung nodules, 5 year review period
Lung cancer detection rate, 5 year review period|Appearance of new nodules, 5 year review period
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluation of lung nodules (target and non-target lesions) detected during annual low-dose (ld) computed tomography (CT) scans and measured for three years after study completion in subjects enrolled in a randomized, phase IIb, placebo-controlled trial with inhaled budesonide (both person-specific and lesion-specific analyses will be performed).

Secondary

* Lung cancer detection rate in the two arms.
* Appearance of new nodules in the two arms.

OUTLINE: Low-dose CT scans are analyzed retrospectively for the natural progression of undetermined lung nodules. Nodule dimension will be evaluated according to maximum diameter and volume, when feasible. Volume measurements are performed using an automatic and semi-automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Lesion-specific and person-specific analysis are performed by measure of average change in size of the target lesions or number of lesions.
