Palliative Short Course Radiotherapy for Advanced Thoracic Cancer
The study wants to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of a short course radiation therapy in patients with symptomatic advanced thoracic cancer.
Palliative Care
RADIATION: Short course radiotherapy
Maximum tolerated dose, The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level below the highest administered dose associated with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in at least one third of patients, 1 year
Acute toxicity, Acute toxicity after treatment is evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Values range from 1 (minimum acute toxicity) to 5 (maximum acute toxicity)., 1 year|Quality of life, Quality of life after the treatment is evaluated according with the Cancer Linear Analog Scale (CLAS). Values range from 0 (better status) to 10 (worst status)., 1 year|Pain relief, Pain after treatment is evaluated with the Visual Analogic scale (VAS). Values range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum possible pain)., 1 year|Late toxicity, Late toxicity after the treatment is evaluated with the Toxicity criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC). Values range from 1 (minimum late toxicity) to 5 (maximum/severe late toxicity)., 1 year
The study wants to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a conformal short course accelerated radiation therapy delivered in twice daily fractions and 2 consecutive days, and the feasibility of this fractionation in term of safety and efficacy for symptomatic palliation of advanced thoracic cancer.
