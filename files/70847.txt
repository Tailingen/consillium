Different Lugol's Solution Concentration for Image Quality of Esophageal Lesions in Chromoendoscopy With Iodine Staining
The purpose of this study is to assess whether lower Lugol's solution concentration can perceive the same image quality of early esophageal squamous neoplasia.

DRUG: 1.2% Lugol's solution|DRUG: 1.0% Lugol's solution|DRUG: 0.8% Lugol's solution|DRUG: 0.6% Lugol's solution|DRUG: 0.4% Lugol's solution
Image Quality of Esophageal Lesions, Evaluated by Image J software (National Institutes of Health), seven months
Questionnaire of endoscopists' subjective assessments, The picture will be rated for quality according to color contrast of esophageal lesions after iodine sprayed by the endoscopist performing the examination, intraoperative|Complete resection/R0 resection rate, 1 month|Mucosal change of the stomach in white-light endoscopy after Lugol's solution sprayed., The endoscopic findings of the greater curvature of the gastric body where the agent collected will be evaluated based on the following findings:fold thickening, exudates, ulcers, and hemorrhage., intraoperative|The amount of Lugol's solution, intraoperative|Severe adverse events (allergic reactions, esophageal burns, spasms and even perforation), 1 month
Chromoendoscopy using Lugol's solution is effective for the detection of early esophageal squamous neoplasia. However, this modality may cause severe chest pain and discomfort owing to mucosal irritation.

This study was to test whether a lower concentration of Lugol's solution can provide satisfied image quality of early esophageal squamous neoplasia and has lower mucosal irritation.
