Docetaxel in Combination With Iressa in Previously Treated Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what activity the combination of docetaxel and Iressa have against metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic Pancreatic Carcinoma
DRUG: ZD 1839|DRUG: Docetaxel
To determine the response rate of Iressa and docetaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer following failure of gemcitabine-based therapy, 3 years
To determine the safety, radiologic response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with Iressa and docetaxel
Iressa will be taken orally once daily without interruption. Docetaxel will be administered intravenously once weekly for two out of every three weeks. Patients will also receive dexamethasone the night prior, morning of, and the evening after docetaxel treatment to help prevent an allergic reaction.

Every week that chemotherapy is given, blood tests and vital signs will be taken.

After the first 6 weeks of therapy a CT scan (or other radiological procedure) will be done to assess the progress of the disease. If the cancer is responding to the treatment and no unacceptable side effects have occured, treatment with Iressa and docetaxel will continue.

CT scans (or other radiological procedure) will be performed at week 12 and every 9 weeks thereafter to monitor the progress of the disease.
