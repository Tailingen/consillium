Safety and Efficacy of the Olympus CADe System in Real-time Colonoscopy
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized Trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the Olympus Endoscopy Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) system, OIP-1, in the detection of colorectal neoplasia's during real-time colonoscopy. The aim of this system is to improve physician performance in the detection of potential mucosal abnormalities during colonoscopy performed for primary Colorectal Cancer screening or postpolypectomy surveillance.
Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: OIP-1
Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR), Proportion of patients with at least one histologically confirmed adenoma (including advanced adenomas) or carcinoma in the CADe assisted colonoscopy (CADe+ arm) versus conventional colonoscopy without CAD (CADe- arm)., During procedure|Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Number of histologically confirmed polyps (i.e. adenomas, SSLs, or large (\>10mm) hyperplastic polyps divided by the total number of resections., During procedure
Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC), Number of histologically proven adenomas (including advanced adenomas) or carcinomas divided by the total number of colonoscopies, During procedure|Total Procedure Time, Time from procedure start (insertion of the colonoscope) until colon inspection during a typical withdrawal from cecum to rectosigmoid including any time needed for interventional procedures (biopsies, resection)., During procedure|Endoscope withdrawal time, Time from deepest point of insertion (cecum) needed for complete inspection of the colon, excluding time spent on therapeutic intervention., During procedure
Adverse events (AEs), Device-, or procedure-related AEs and Serious AEs (SAEs) reported as incidence (%) and frequency (n)., During procedure|Non-neoplastic resection rate, Number of patients with no histological confirmation of adenoma, advanced adenoma, SSL, large hyperplastic polyp or carcinoma in any excised lesion divided by the number of colonoscopies where at least one polyp was resected, During procedure
This Study aims to provide insight into whether the application of Artificial Intelligence (Olympus Endoscopy Computer-Aided Detection (CADe) system) increases the detection rate of adenomatous polyps in screening and / or surveillance colonoscopy procedures.
