Dead Space Closure With Quilting Suture Versus Conventional Closure With Drainage
The objective of this study is to compare quilting suture of the "dead space" without drainage of the pectoral area to conventional closure with drainage to prevent post-operative seroma requiring intervention (aspiration or surgical intervention) within 21 days after mastectomy for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Quilting suture without drainage|PROCEDURE: Conventional closure with drainage
Wound seroma requiring aspiration or surgical intervention, A seroma is defined as a postoperative fluid collection via palpation on clinical examination. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is a descriptive terminology that can be used for adverse event reporting provide a grading scale for seromas (lymphoceles).

Only grade 2 and 3 seromas i.e. seromas requiring one or more aspirations or a surgical intervention will be considered as primary outcome., Within 21 days following mastectomy
Wound seroma requiring aspiration or surgical intervention, Within 9 months following mastectomy|Wound seroma whatever their type (requiring or not intervention), Within 21 days following mastectomy|Wound seroma whatever their type (requiring or not intervention), Within 9 months following mastectomy|Other wound complications, Within 21 days following mastectomy|Other wound complications, Within 9 months following mastectomy|Surgical morbidity, During surgical intervention|Pain, Visual Analogue Scale, Before surgery, day 1, 21 days and 9 months following mastectomy|Homolateral shoulder movement, The range of arm movement scored from 1 to 4 according to estimated angles of arm abduction as 1 (less than 90째), 2 (90-134째), 3 (135-179째) and 4 (180째), Before surgery, 21 days and 9 months following mastectomy|Cosmesis results, Cosmetic results will be documented by patient,surgeon and by an blinded adjudication committee with possible response = poor, acceptable, good and excellent, 21 days, 9 months following mastectomy|Health related quality of life : EQ-5D-5L, The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions : mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems, Before surgery, day 1, 21 days and 9 months following mastectomy|Cost-effectiveness assessment, Incremental net monetary benefice, During the whole follow-up period i.e. 9 months following mastectomy
Eligible patients are patients with operable breast cancer (invasive carcinoma and/or carcinoma in situ) for whom mastectomy is recommended or preferred by the patient either alone or in association with sentinel lymph node biopsy or standard level I/II axillary node dissection

Randomization will be stratified by center and by type of surgery (mastectomy alone/ mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy / mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection).

Two follow-up visits will be performed: at 21 days and 9 months after surgery, these appointments are conventional, thus our trial will not modify usual follow-up.
