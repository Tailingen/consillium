FMT+SOX+Sintilimab As First-line Treatment for Advanced Gastric Cancer
the investigators plan to initiate a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study, recruiting 198 patients with advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment. Randomly divided into two groups, one group is the group of fecal microbiota transplantation(FMT)+SOX+Sintilimab, and the other group is the group of SOX+Sintilimab. Compare the 2-year OS rates of the two groups to verify whether the addition of FMT to first-line treatment can improve the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.

the investigatorse plan to initiate a prospective, multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study, recruiting a total of 198 patients with previously untreated unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in our hospital and 14 other hospitals. Randomly divided into Group A and Group B, Group A received FMT+SOX chemotherapy regimen +Sintilimab immunotherapy regimen, Group B only received SOX chemotherapy regimen+and Sintilimab immunotherapy regimen. If there is no progression of the disease after 4-6 cycles of first-line treatment, both groups of patients will enter the first-line maintenance treatment stage: S-1+Sintilimab, until disease progression, intolerance, or death occurs. The aim is to explore the efficacy and safety of FMT combined with SOX and Sintilimab in the treatment of advanced first-line gastric cancer patients.
