Personalized Medicine for Advanced Biliary Cancer Patients
The object of this trial is to evaluate whether the introduction of a targeted therapy after 4 cycles of the current standard-of-care treatment for advanced biliary cancer is superior to continuing with the standard treatment.

The trial is composed of two phases: (i) An initial screening phase to identify a suitable patient population, during which a molecular profile of the patient's tumour will be obtained, and (ii) a randomised comparative trial in which patients with disease control after 4 cycles of standard treatment, and whose tumour harbours a targetable molecular alteration, will be randomised (2:1) to receive either a matched targeted therapy or to continue with the standard treatment.

Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomisation to the first documented progression of disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From randomisation to disease progression or death, up to 5 years.
Overall Survival (OS), The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomisation to death, up to 5 years.|Objective response rate, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (according to RECIST v1.1). Objective response rate will be presented as the best response achieved compared to the disease assessment performed at randomisation., From randomisation, up to 5 years.|Time to treatment failure, Time from patient starting their allocated treatment to the date at which a patient first experiences a treatment failure event. The following will be considered as treatment failure events: early treatment discontinuation (regardless of reason), disease progression, death, starting a new treatment after completing scheduled treatment, withdrawal from the study due to any reason or loss to follow-up., From randomisation to treatment failure event, up to 5 years.|Progression-free survival after next line of treatment (PFS2), Time from randomisation to the date of second disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., From randomisation to second disease progression or death, up to 5 years.|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time from first documented response (compared to baseline measurement taken at randomisation) until the date of disease progression, as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause whichever occurs first., From response to disease progression or death, up to 5 years.|Disease control rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of randomised patients achieving CR, PR, stable disease (SD)/no evidence of disease (NED) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., From randomisation, up to 5 years.|Percentage change in tumour size, Taking the measurements at randomisation as the reference., From randomisation, up to 5 years.
Feasibility of molecular screening, The proportion of patients with an available MTB proposition at the time of the 3-month standard of care treatment evaluation., Up to 3 months from start of treatment|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., From baseline, every 3 cycles (every 9 weeks) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year|Quality of life Questionnaire - Biliary tract cancer module (QLQ-BIL21), This EORTC cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The QLQ-BIL21 contains 21 items to assess symptoms. All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale., From baseline, every 3 cycles (every 9 weeks) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year|EuroQOL EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, Developed by the EuroQol group, the self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials consists of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).

The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each dimension has 5 levels (1 = "no problems", 2 = "slight problems", 3 = "moderate problems", 4 = "severe problems", and 5 = "extreme problems"). This questionnaire provide a 5-digit score which generate a health state profile. The VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the score range from 0 (The best health you can imagine) to 100 (The worst health you can imagine). The VAS is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement., From baseline, every 3 cycles (every 9 weeks) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year|Incidence of Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of the treatment will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5). NCI-CTCAE is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., From randomisation, up to 5 years
This is a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial to evaluate whether the introduction of molecular targeted therapy (MTT) as maintenance after 4 cycles of standard-of-care first-line systemic therapy (1L SoC) is superior to continuation of 1L-SoC in the treatment of patients with ABC. The trial is composed of two phases: (i) An initial screening phase to identify a suitable patient population, and (ii) a randomised comparative trial.

The aim of the screening phase is to identify a medically suitable population, to obtain a molecular profile of the patient's tumour, to collect baseline data concerning patient demographics and disease characteristics and to obtain pre-treatment blood and tumour samples for further translational research.

A genetic profile will be obtained from tumour-derived DNA and RNA samples by next-generation sequencing and from circulating tumour DNA. The trial Molecular Tumour Board will determine whether each patient harbours a targetable molecular alteration for one or more of the trial MTTs.

Patients with disease control after 4 cycles of 1L-SoC, who did not experience limiting toxicity, and whose tumour harbours at least one targetable molecular alteration, will be invited to participate in the randomised phase of the trial in which 159 eligible patients will be randomised (2:1) to receive either maintenance therapy with a matched MTT or to continue 1L-SoC treatment.
