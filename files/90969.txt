Rebeccamycin Analog and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors
This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of rebeccamycin analog and oxaliplatin in treating patients with refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as rebeccamycin analog and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: becatecarin|DRUG: oxaliplatin|OTHER: pharmacological study
Maximum tolerated dose defined as the highest dose tested in which none or only one patient experienced dose limiting toxicities as measured by Common Toxicity Criteria, 21 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of XL119 given in conjunction with oxaliplatin.

II.To determine the dose limiting toxicities of this combination. III. To determine the pharmacokinetics of these 2 agents when given in combination.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rebeccamycin analogue and oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

Patients are followed annually for survival.
