Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV mantle cell lymphoma.
Contiguous Stage II Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: antineoplaston A10|DRUG: antineoplaston AS2-1|PROCEDURE: alternative product therapy|PROCEDURE: biological therapy|PROCEDURE: biologically based therapies|PROCEDURE: cancer prevention intervention|PROCEDURE: complementary and alternative therapy|PROCEDURE: differentiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with serious or immediately life-threatening stage II, III, or IV mantle cell lymphoma.
* Evaluate the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive gradually escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 intravenously 6 times daily until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the third and fourth years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
