QUILT-3.040: ETBX-011 (Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-CEA(6D)) Vaccine in Combination With ALT-803 (Super-agonist IL-15) in Subjects Having CEA-Expressing Cancer
This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ETBX-011 vaccine used in combination with ALT-803 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic CEA-expressing cancers whose tumor has recurred after standard-of-care treatment.

BIOLOGICAL: ETBX-011|BIOLOGICAL: ALT-803
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities, 9 weeks
Duration of Response, The duration of overall response was measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD was objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Up to 11 weeks|Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first. Subjects who did not have disease progression or did not die at the end of follow up were to be censored at the last known date the subject was progression free., Up to 11 weeks|Overall Survival, OS was evaluated by dose cohort and overall using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause. Subjects who were alive at the end of follow up were to be censored at the last known date alive., Up to 6 months
The trial will consist of a phase 1b study with ETBX-011 as a fixed dose with a dose escalation of ALT-803 unless de-escalation is required. The proposed phase 2 expansion study will give additional safety data for the MTD as well as preliminary efficacy data. Subjects will receive treatments unless they experience progressive disease, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), withdraw consent, or if the investigator determines it is no longer in their best medical interest to continue treatment.
