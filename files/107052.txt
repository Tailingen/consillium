High Resolution Imaging for Early and Better Detection of Bladder Cancer
The goal of this study is to develop, optimize, and validate a High Resolution Imaging System in the bladder that displays images in real-time, providing automated diagnostic criteria for bladder cancer screening. High resolution images of normal bladder tissue and suspicious bladder lesions will be collected from patients who present to the study site for clinical evaluation.
