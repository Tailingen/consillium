Neoadjuvant Sunitinib Treatment for Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
The purpose of this study is to see whether neoadjuvant administration of Sunitinib reduces the size of the primary kidney tumor in patients with metastatic disease undergoing cytoreductive surgery. The study will also assess the safety of neoadjuvant Sunitinib, objective response rate, respectability of primary tumor, quality of life, and survival advantages.
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma|Metastasis
DRUG: Sunitinib
Response rate of primary tumor based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, within first 1 week (plus or minus 5 days) after 2 cycles of Sunitinib treatment (1 cycle: 4 weeks on + 2 weeks off)
Overall survival rate after Sunitinib therapy, 2 years|Pathologic evaluation after Sunitinib therapy, After nephrectomy (within 1-6 week after 2 cycles of Sunitinib treatment)|Quality of life (QoL) assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Korean version), 2 years|Resectability based on R0 resection rate, on nephrectomy (within 1-6 week after 2 cycles of Sunitinib treatment)
Primary objectives :

1. Response rate of primary tumor based on RECIST criteria

Secondary objectives :

1. Resectability based on R0 resection rate (negative margin)
2. Toxicities of therapy with neoadjuvant Sunitinib in renal cell carcinoma
3. Quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire Korean version
4. To assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy of Sunitinib by evaluating time to progression
5. Overall survival rate after Sunitinib therapy
6. Pathologic evaluation after Sunitinib therapy: the change of necrosis and microvessel density
