Evaluate AMXT1501 and DFMO on PD biomarker by evaluating the level/concentration of polyamine uptake., Will evaluate the effect of AMXT1501 and DFMO on pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of polyamine uptake in the blood starting at Cycle 1 through the end of Cycle 2 and again at the beginning of each new cycle., 6 months
The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral AMXT 1501 dicaprate (AMXT1501) in combination with IV DFMO in patients with advanced solid tumors, or DIPG/DMG. Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and other biomarker efficacy assessments of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with IV DFMO on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells). To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and other biomarker efficacy profiles of orally-administered AMXT 1501 and IV DFMO. Approximately, 56 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and IV DFMO in combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is stopped.
