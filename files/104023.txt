Proliposomal Intravesical Paclitaxel for Treatment of Low-Grade, Stage Ta, Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a single-arm, phase 1/2a study of formulated paclitaxel in subjects with low-grade, noninvasive papillary carcinoma (stage Ta) of the bladder.

Part 1 of the study will enroll 6 subjects (3 per cohort) with low-grade, stage Ta transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder who will receive escalating doses of paclitaxel formulated as TSD-001 every 2 weeks for 6 treatments until Dose Limiting Toxicity (or until the Maximum Deliverable Dose) is observed (Maximum Tolerated Dose established).

Part 2 of the study will enroll an additional 10 subjects with low-grade, stage Ta (uni-or multifocal) TCC of the bladder who will receive weekly TSD-001 for 6 weeks at the highest nontoxic dose (i.e., MTD) established in part 1 of the study. May meet definition of low grade without histological tissue diagnosis if on cystoscopic assessment they have a solitary papillary tumor.

Part 3 of the study will continue to track subjects enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 to determine rates of disease-free survival.

DRUG: TSD-001
Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Dose immediately preceding the dose at which DLT occurs or when a MDD is reached., 12 weeks|Part 2: Marker Lesion Response Rate, Determine the marker lesion response rate using the MTD established in part 1., 12 weeks
Part 1: Determine paclitaxel concentrations, Determine the local (bladder urine) and systemic (peripheral blood) paclitaxel concentrations before and after intravesical exposure to TSD-001 at all doses. Blood and urine samples will be collected 15 (± 15) minutes before and 2 hours (± 10 minutes) after each instillation., 10 weeks|Part 2: Determine paclitaxel concentrations, Determine the local (bladder urine) paclitaxel concentrations 15 (± 15) minutes before, and 2 hours (± 10 minutes) after the third intravesical instillation of TSD-001.

Determine the systemic (peripheral blood) paclitaxel concentration 2 hours (± 10 minutes) after the first intravesical instillation of TSD-001. Determine the systemic (peripheral blood) paclitaxel concentrations 15 (± 15) minutes before, and 2 hours (± 10 minutes) after the third intravesical instillation of TSD-001., 5 weeks|Severity and Frequency of Adverse Events, Characterize the severity and frequency of AEs following intravesical administration of TSD-001., Part 1: 16 weeks, Part 2: 13 Weeks
Part 3: Rates of disease-free survival, Long term follow-up (2 years post initial treatment) to determine when histological tissue diagnosis evidence of recurrence occurs for subjects exposed to TSD-001 in part 1 or part 2. Cystoscopic surveillance will be performed as standard of care approximately every 3 months from last endoscopic assessment in part 1 or part 2 until 24 months (from initial instillation)., 2 years
