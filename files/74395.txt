Ketogenic Diet in Combination With Standard-of-care Radiation and Temozolomide for Patients With Glioblastoma
Enrolled subjects will be placed on a 16-week ketogenic diet (subject specific as prescribed by RD) while receiving standard of care cancer treatment (Radiation + Temozolomide). Study dietitians will create personalized meal plans for each patient with the goal of achieving and maintaining protocol defined metabolic ketosis. Subjects will be monitored for safety, nutrition, quality of life, and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the study.

Safety of the intervention, Proportion of participants experiencing a 10% decrease in weight or body mass index AND have a BMI \<18.5 within one month from initiation of the ketogenic diet., Four Months|Safety of the intervention, Number of related adverse events based on CTCAE v.5., Four months
Feasibility of the intervention, Proportion of enrolled patients able to maintain blood ketone levels \>0.3 mM for over 50% of days on study starting 2 weeks after initiation of the ketogenic diet., Four Months|Overall Survival, Time (in months) from initiation of the ketogenic diet to date of death, Sixty months|Time-to-progression, Time (in months) from baseline to progressive disease over study duration (estimated 4 months)

Enrolled subjects will be placed on a 16-week ketogenic diet (subject specific as prescribed by RD) while receiving standard of care cancer treatment (Radiation + Temozolomide). Study dietitians will place patients on a strict and controlled diet that manages daily macronutrient breakdown and increases the ratio of dietary fat relative to protein and carbohydrate consumption. Dietitians will provide guidance and teaching of the diet, as well as, monitoring and diet adjustment to ensure metabolic ketosis. Dietitians and study physicians (and their staff) will monitor subjects for safety, nutrition, quality of life, and standard of care tumor assessments over the course of the study.
