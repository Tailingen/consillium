Etoposide Plus Benmelstobart Followed by Maintenance Therapy of Benmelstobart Plus Anlotinib in First-line Treatment of Elderly Patients with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: a Single-arm, Prospective Trial
This is a prospective, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etoposide in combination with bemosubezumab and sequential Benmelstobart in combination with Anlotinib as first-line treatment for elderly patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer.

Participants who met the inclusion criteria were selected to enter the study and received etoposide combined with Benmelstobart followed by bemosubezumab combined with Anlotinib. The primary endpoint was PFS (Progression-free Survival), the secondary endpoint was OS (Overall Survival) and safety (CTCAE 5.0), and the exploratory endpoint was the screening of various potential molecular markers.

Progression-free survival time, It is the time that passes from a certain date (generally the first day of treatment, or the day in which a patient is enrolled in a clinical trial) and the date on which disease "progresses" or the date on which the patient dies, from any cause., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 18 months
