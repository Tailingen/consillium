A Phase II Study for p16+ Oropharyngeal Cancer PerSonalized De-escalation Treatment at University of MIchigan (CuSToMIze)
Single center, non-randomized Phase II study enrolling Stage I-II p16+ oropharyngeal cancer patients to one of two de-escalation treatment paradigms: (1) receive surgery followed by observation or risk-adjusted adjuvant radiation (+/-chemo), or (2) individualized adaptive definitive chemoradiation (CRT).

PROCEDURE: Surgery|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Chemoradiation|OTHER: Observation|RADIATION: Post-operative radiation
Loco-regional recurrence free survival (LR-RFS) rate, LR-RFS is defined as the difference between the date of the first treatment to the date of the first of the following events: death (any cause) or loco-regional progression. LR-RFS rates will be reported using Kaplan Meier (KM) estimates at 2 years., 2 years
Progression free survival (PFS) rate, PFS is defined as the difference between the date of the first therapy to the date of the first of the following events: death (any cause) or disease progression (local, regional, distant, defined as per section 7.1). PFS data will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment on study for subjects who do not have objective tumor progression and who do not die while on study., 2 years|Disease specific survival (DSS) rate, DSS is defined as the difference between the date of the first treatment intake to the date of death due to oropharyngeal cancer., 2 years|Overall survival (OS) rate, OS is defined as the difference between the date of the first treatment intake to the date of death (any cause)., 2 years|Patterns of failure (locoregional relapse versus distant), Defined as the proportion of patients who progressed in any location and whether the first progression was local, regional or distant or in multiple locations., 2 years|Acute toxicity, Defined as the proportion of patients with available toxicity data and the proportion of all treated patients through cumulative incidence estimates with death treated as a competing risk and censoring for patients lost to follow-up (FU)., up to 3 months post definitive treatment completion {section 2.4.2 of protocol states only 3 months but 2.2 states 3 and 6 months - will clarify with study team}|Late toxicity, Defined as the proportion of patients with available toxicity data and the proportion of all treated patients through cumulative incidence estimates with death treated as a competing risk and censoring for patients lost to follow-up (FU)., up to 24 months post definitive treatment completion
