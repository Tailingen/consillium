Bronchoscopic Approach to the Peripheral Lung Nodule - An Alternative Approach
Patients presenting with solitary or multiple lung nodules often require tissue confirmation in order to guide further management and determine if the lesion is benign or malignant. Several bronchoscopic techniques have emerged which have significantly improved the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in this setting, and in particular the combination of peripheral Endobronchial Ultrasonography (pEBUS) and Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (ENB) has resulted in diagnostic yields of nearly 90%. In an attempt to reduce the significant cost of this combined approach, the sequential use of pEBUS followed by the more costly ENB technique only if a lesion is not identified on the ultrasound image could be as accurate. This study aims to determine the diagnostic yield of this sequential approach in patients with lung nodule(s).
