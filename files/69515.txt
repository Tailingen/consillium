Study of the Combination of Binimetinib and Encorafenib in Adolescent Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600-mutant Melanoma
This is a multicenter Phase 1b, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy of binimetinib and encorafenib co-administered to adolescent patients with BRAF V600-mutant advanced/metastatic melanoma. The study consists of a Safety Run-in Phase to determine the RDE (recommended dose in expansion), followed by an Expansion Phase.

The study did not recruit the desired number of subjects and as a result does not have sufficient data for quantitative statistical analyses. Additionally, results data cannot be reported because doing so would risk re-identification of the participant.
