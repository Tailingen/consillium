Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Quality of Recovery and Analgesia After Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery
Dexmedetomidine is a selective α2 adrenergic agonist that can be considered analgesics, anxiolytic,and anti-stress effect . This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intraoperative dexmedetomidine for improvement of quality of recovery and analgesia from surgery. Patients scheduled to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) will be enrolled. Patients will be recruited before the date of their surgery and will complete the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire before their surgery and at 24 and 48 hours post op. They will also complete clinically significant pains score and oxygenation from the postanesthetic recovery unit (PACU).
