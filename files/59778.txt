Study of Targeted Therapy Using Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases in Cervical Precancerous Lesions
This is an single arm clinical study of the safety and efficacy of T512 to possibly treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN).
Human Papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: T512
Safety-Number of participants with Adverse Events, Number of participants who report adverse events as a measure of safety, 6 months
Change of HPV16 DNA titers, Blood samples will be taken at the indicated times, Baseline, 3 and 6 months|Number of dysplastic cells mearsured by ThinPrep Pap Test, From high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) to Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL), or from LSIL to negative, Baseline, 3 and 6 months|Change of cervical histological results, Colposcopy Biopsy will be conducted at the baseline and month 6 on each subject, Baseline and 6 months
Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPVs),especially types 16 and 18,may lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN).HPVs expresses the oncoproteins E6 and E7, both of which play key roles in maintaining viral infection and promoting carcinogenesis. Previous studies showed that using designated TALENs (T27 and T512) targeted HPV16 E6 and E7 produced disruption of HPV16 E6 and E7 DNA, decreased the expression of E6 and E7 proteins, and induced cell apoptosis.

This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of and T512 in treating HPV Persistency and HPV16-positive CIN.
