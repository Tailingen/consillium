A Prospective, Randomized, Open, Parallel-controlled, Superior-efficacy Clinical Study of Radical Sigmoidectomy for Sigmoid Cancer Versus Radical Sigmoidectomy Combined with Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging Lymphatic Tracing Dissection in the Treatment of Sigmoid Cancer
he purpose of this study is to explore the clinical outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer using in laparoscopic radical sigmoidectomy for sigmoid adenocarcinoma (cT2-T4a N0 M0，T1-T4a N+ M0).
Sigmoid Cancer
PROCEDURE: indocyanine green fluorescence imaging lymphatic tracing
Disease-free survival rate, odisease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to the time of recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years after the surgery
Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, Compare total number of retrieved lymph nodes in both group, 14 days after the surgery|Number of Metastasis Lymph Nodes, Compare number of positive lymph nodes in both group., 14 days after the surgery|The number of lymph nodes at each station, 14 days after the surgery|The rate of fluorescence, The number of fluorescent lymph node in experimental group is divided by the total number of lymph nodes in active experimental group, 14 days after the surgery|Positive rate, The number of positive lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in experimental group, 14 days after the surgery|False positive rate, The number of negative lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in experimental group, 14 days after the surgery|Negative rate, The number of negative lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in experimental group, 14 days after the surgery|False negative rate, The number of positive lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in experimental group, 14 days after the surgery|Morbidity rate, This is for the early postoperative complication, 30 days after the surgery|mortality rate, mortality, which defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery, 30 days after the surgery|Pathological outcomes checklist, Quality of the mesorectum specimen, number of harvested lymph nodes, status of circumferential resection margin, and distal resection margin, 14 days after the surgery|3-year Overall survival rate, Overall survival was defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause, 3 years after the surgery|5-year Overall survival rate, Overall survival was defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause, 5 years after the surgery|5-year Disease-free survival rate, 5 years after the surgery|Local recurrence rate, Local recurrence was defined as radiologic or histopathologic evidence of any recurrent disease deposit located in the pelvis in the prior area of dissection following a primary rectal cancer resection, with or without distal metastasis., 3 years after the surgery|Postoperative function (voiding function, sexual function) and quality of life, 3 years after the surgery|The correlation between the number of lymph nodes and 3-year overall survival rate and 3-year disease-free survival rate, 3 years after the surgery|Minimal Residual Disease, MRD, 3 years after the surgery
he purpose of this study is to explore the clinical outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer using in laparoscopic radical sigmoidectomy for sigmoid adenocarcinoma (cT2-T4a N0 M0，T1-T4a N+ M0).
