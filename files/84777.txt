Two Center Study to Determine Effect of G17DT on Plasma Gastrin Levels in Patients With Colorectal Cancer.
Pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancers have all been shown to overexpress the gastrin gene and to be sensitive to the trophic effects of the gastrin in animal models. The hypothesis of this study is that G17DT will elicit specific and high-affinity antibodies that will bind gastrin-17, thus preventing the trophic activity of cancer cells.
