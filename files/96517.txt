Safety Study of XmAb速2513 to Treat Hodgkin Lymphoma or Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
An open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, Phase 1 dose escalation study of XmAb速2513 was conducted to define the MTD or recommended dose(s) for further study, to determine safety and tolerability, to characterize PK and immunogenicity, and to evaluate antitumor activity of XmAb2513 in patients with HL and ALCL (non-cutaneous) and who have received two or more prior therapeutic regimens. There will be no intra-patient dose escalation.
