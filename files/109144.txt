Evaluation of Impedance Cardiography for Assessing Hemodynamic Shifts in Patients With LA-NSCLC During Treatment.
This study aimed to investigate the role of impedance cardiography (ICG) in evaluating hemodynamic changes during the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who underwent combined concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and immunotherapy. Additionally, It sought to analyze the predictive significance of cardiac parameters to both treatment toxicity and survival prognosis.
