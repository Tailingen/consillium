Niclosamide in Pediatric Patients With Relapsed and Refractory AML
Protocol is designed to evaluate a niclosamide dose escalation scale in combination with cytarabine as a therapeutic modality for pediatric subjects with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

DRUG: Niclosamide
Dose-limiting toxicity, Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are defined as any events ≥ Grade 3 that are at least possibly, probably, or definitely related to niclosamide treatment, 30 days

* Complete response (CR) = \< 5% blasts in BM, with no evidence of extramedullary disease.
* Partial response (PR) = ≥ 5% to ≤ 25% blasts in BM with decrease in BM blast percentage by 50%, and no evidence of extramedullary disease.
* Resistant disease with clinical benefit (RD-CB) = either ≥ 5% to ≤ 25% blasts in BM OR a decrease in blast percentage by 50%, either with no evidence of extramedullary disease.
