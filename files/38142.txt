Safety and Efficacy of ThisCART7 in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed T Cell Malignancies
This is a single dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ThisCART7(Allogeneic CAR-T targeting CD7) in patients with refractory or relapsed CD7 positive T cell malignancies.
T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: ThisCART7 cells
Incidence of Treatment-related gradeâ‰¥3Adverse Events or SAE, Therapy-related adverse events or SAE will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., within 4 weeks after infusion
Objective Response Rate, Description:

For T-ALL, Objective response rate(ORR) is the percentage of patients who achieve CR or CRi, determined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines in oncology Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (2020.V1) ;

For lymphoma, ORR is the incidence of either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Response will be assessed using the 2014 Lugano criteria., 4 to 6 weeks after infusion
Progression free survival time, The interval between administration and disease progression or death., 3 years|Overall survival time, The interval between administration and death caused by any reason., 3 years|Event-free survival, EFS is calculated from administration to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever comes first, or last visit., 3 years
This is a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ThisCART7 in patients with refractory or relapsed CD7 positive T cell malignancies, such as T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma and T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The dose range is 0.5-6 x 10\^6 cells per kg body weight.
