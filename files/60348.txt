FS222 First in Human Study in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with advanced tumours to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of FS222. This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed to systematically assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for FS222 in participants with advanced tumours. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be assessed.
