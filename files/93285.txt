Safety and Efficacy of Imatinib Added to Chemotherapy in Treatment of Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Imatinib is safe and effective in association with intensive treatment of Ph+ALL in children.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Philadelphia Chromosome
DRUG: Standard chemotherapy + Imatinib
Disease free survival (DFS). DFS will be calculated as the time from inclusion to either one of the following events: relapse, death in CCR, second malignancies., 2 years
Compare long term outcome between patients treated by BFM-chemotherapy and patient undergoing more intensive chemotherapy (protocole COGAALL0031 : Children Oncology Group-USA)., 2 years|Long-term clinical outcome : Disease free survival (DFS), Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in each risk groups., 2 years|Pattern of molecular response (MRD), 5 time points between S4 and S22|Conversion rate to CR in patients resistant to the first part of the induction phase of chemotherapy included in the Poor-risk group., 2 years
Recent advances in treatment have increased the cure of childhood ALL to 75% or better. However, attempts to improve results for resistant subtypes of ALL, such as Ph+ ALL, have been largely unsuccessful. Imatinib, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, is currently being tested in several phase I, II and III trials covering most Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patient populations and patients with overtly relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL. Pediatric patients with Ph+ALL will receive Imatinib, added to intensive, post-induction BFM-type chemotherapy. The endpoint will be the evaluation on the long-term clinical outcome, in particular on the Disease Free Survival (DFS).
