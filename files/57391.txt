18F-mFBG PET Imaging in the Evaluation of Pheochromocytoma
The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance and tumor burden of 18F-metafluorobenzylguanidine (18F-MFBG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with pheochromocytoma.

Pheochromocytoma highly expresses norepinephrine transporter (NET) which is targeted by function alanalogue of norepinephrine, 123/131I-MlBG. However, low spatial resolution of 123/131I-MlBG and inaccurate attenuation correction of single photon emission tomography (SPECT/CT) will affect the image quality of MlBG SPECT and lead to poor diagnosis of small lesions. In addition, 123l-MlBG imaging is usually performed at 24h after injection, while 131I-MlBG is performed at 48h or even 72h after injection. The procedure is complicated and takes a long time, which limits clinical application. 18F-labeled MFBG is an ideal tracer to show the expression of NET. Preliminary data show that 18F-MFBG imaging is safe and has favorable biodistribution and kinetics with good targeting of lesions. Patients can undergo PET 0.5 hours after injection without special preparation. Our study will assess the safety profile, image quality and evaluate the diagnostic performance and tumor burden of 18F-MFBG. Patients with suspected or histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma will be enrolled in this study.
