Multiomics Tumor Evolution Model of NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine the evolutionary mechanism of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and establish an accurate prognostic model and a recurrence monitoring system by multiomics analysis, which can be helpful for the individual and whole management of lung cancer patients and improve the overall prognosis.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Disease-free survival (DFS), Time from randomization to disease recurrence or death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Relationship between translational biomarkers and clinical outcome, To evaluate if the translational biomarkers can be prediction tools for the clinical outcomes., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer and surgery is still the main treatment strategy. This study will determine the evolutionary mechanism of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and establish an accurate prognostic model and a recurrence monitoring system by multiomics analysis, which can be helpful for the individual and whole management of lung cancer patients and improve the overall prognosis.
