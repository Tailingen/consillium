Role of PET/MRI in Head and Neck Cancer
Study aim was to investigate the diagnostic role of Positron Emission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) in head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer|Benign Neoplasm|Malignant Neoplasm
RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Difference in Apparent diffusion coefficient value between benign and malignant lesions, Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured from benign and malignant lymph nodes by drawing region of interest (ROI) on the most homogeneous and most solid part in the target lymph node. Higher ADC value in Benign lymph node means that there are more water molecules movement inside the lymph node, more water molecules movement resulting in higher Apparent diffusion coefficient value. in malignant nodes and due to more tumor tissue, the result is to have lower water molecules motion so, lower ADC value., Baseline
This study was assessed the role of Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in discriminating between benign and malignant lesions in Head and neck cancer as well as studying the relationship between glucose metabolism (18F-FDG) and Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for better tumor assessment.
