Autologous Transplant for Multiple Myeloma
This is a study of a regimen of melphalan and autologous stem cells for patients with multiple myeloma. We hypothesize that this particular regimen will improve the survival of these patients.

Number of Patients With Extended Disease-free Survival, Extended disease free survival will be defined as percentage of patients surviving more than 36 months without relapse or disease progression., 36 Months|Number of Participants With Overall Survival, The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for a disease, such as cancer. Also called survival rate., 1 year|Number of Participants With Overall Survival, The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for a disease, such as cancer.

Also called survival rate., 3 years|Count of Participants Experiencing Transplant Related Mortality, In the field of transplantation, toxicity is high and all deaths without previous relapse or progression are usually considered as related to transplantation., 1 year|Number of Participants Experiencing Incidence of Relapse, The return of disease after its apparent recovery/cessation., 1 year|Number of Participants With Disease Progression, Myeloma Response Definitions - Using International Uniform Response Criteria:

Progressive Disease (PD)

For patients not in CR or sCR, progressive disease requires one or more of the following:

* \>25% increase in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 0.5 g/dL.
* \>25% increase in 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 200 mg/24 hours.
* Absolute increase in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dl), only in patients without measurable paraprotein in the serum and urine.
* \>25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine biopsy, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 10%.
* Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas., 1 year|Time to Progression, Mean number of days among patients progressing, 1 year|Time to Relapse, Mean number of days among patients relapsing, 1 year|Number of Participants With Absolute Neutrophil Recovery, Hematologic recovery is defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>2500/μl and platelets \> 100,000/μl, Day 42|Time to Attainment of CR, Mean (STD) among patients achieving complete remission (CR)

* If the only measurable non-bone marrow parameter is FLC, greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels or a 50% decrease in level, 12 months post transplant|Duration of Maintenance Treatment, During study|Dropout Rate From Maintenance Therapy, Post transplant phase|Number of Participants With Toxicities, Occurrence of toxicities by first 100 days of transplant, By first 100 days|Number of Participants With Infections, Occurrence of infections in the patients by the first 100 days of transplant, By first 100 days
Before starting treatment in this study, the bone marrow transplant (BMT) doctor will check the subject's general health. Subjects will have the following tests and evaluations to find out if they can participate:--Medical history and physical examination, including height and weight.--Blood tests (approximately 4 - 5 tablespoons) --Urine tests--Chest x-ray--Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)--Heart Scan (MUGA)--Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)--Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates. --If Female subjects of child-bearing age will have a serum pregnancy test performed. After eligible patients have been completely staged and exercised consent, they may undergo one cycle of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and Mesna) and growth factor (G-CSF) to effect cytoreduction and mobilization of PBSC for collection. All patients will receive high-dose melphalan followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). Blood tests will be performed frequently to evaluate the subject's response to treatment and possible side effects of treatment. If necessary, platelet and red cell transfusions will be given to maintain adequate levels and antibiotics will be given to treat or prevent infection. Subjects may also require intravenous nutritional support and pain medications during or after transplantation. The study coordinators will collect health information over three years. They will collect information every week for 100 days, then at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years.
