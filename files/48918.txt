CAPOX Plus Sintilimab and Bevacizumab Biosimilar (IBI305) for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been recommended by a series of treatment guidelines for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced G/GEJ cancer. Although with clinical efficacy, the pCR and long-term survival rates are still unsatisfactory and perioperative treatment mode for locally advanced G/GEJ cancer still needs further optimization. In this study, we will explore the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab biosimilar (IBI305) in the neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced G/GEJ cancer.

This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial. A total of 58 patients will be enrolled. Eligible patients will be registered and receive three cycles of CAPOX plus sintilimab and bevacizumab biosimilar (IBI305) regimen. Radical D2 gastric cancer resection will be performed 6-8 weeks after the last administration of chemotherapy plus plus sintilimab and bevacizumab biosimilar (IBI305). The primary endpoint of the study is the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary endpoints include R0 resection rate, major pathological response (MPR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and safety profile of the neoadjuvant regimen.
