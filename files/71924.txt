Magseed Enabled Long-Term Localization of Axillary Lymph Nodes
The purpose of this study is to provide prospective evidence that the use of Magseed/Sentimag in marking axillary lymph nodes and guiding surgical localization in patients with breast cancer following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is effective.

Retrieval rate of clipped node and Magseed in the excised specimen, The retrieval rate of the clipped node and Magseed in the excised specimen. This is defined as the number of subjects in whom the clipped node and Magseed are retrieved in a single excised specimen divided by the total number of subjects., Time of surgery

This is a post-market, prospective, open-label, single arm study of Magseed and Sentimag in patients with breast cancer with biopsy-proven axillary node metastases who had a clip placed to mark the metastatic node and are having that clipped node selectively removed at surgery following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Subjects will have the Magseed placed to mark axillary lymph nodes with biopsy-proven metastasis under ultrasound guidance before initiating NAC. After completion of NAC, the Magseed will be localized using the Sentimag system during surgery and removed with the targeted lymph node.
