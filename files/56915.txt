Study of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Alone in Locally Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Patients
The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good or bad) may come from a new way of doing radiation therapy for lung cancer. This study is for patients who are not able to get surgery or chemotherapy with their radiation. The way of doing radiation therapy in this trial is called hypofractionated radiation therapy which is a standard approach, but this study allows the actual tumor to get an extra radiation dose while still protecting the organs that are near the tumor.

Presence or Absence of In-Field Progression, In-field progression is defined as growth of the targeted lesions beyond the treated volume. The treated volume will be defined as the 28.75 Gy isodose line (50% of 57.5 Gy). Pathologic confirmation of tumor progression is preferred, but can be determined radiographically by Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program consensus if biopsy of the lesion in question is not feasible or safe. Investigators will compare the proportion of the sample with any in-field progression at 2 years to the historical control proportion of 0.5, using a one-sample z-test., At 2 years
Proportion of Participants Experiencing Grade 2 or Higher Toxicities, Toxicities will be evaluated per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 constructed with a 95% confidence interval., 25 months|Proportion of Participants That Experienced Local Progression, Participants who have experienced local progression by 13 months (1 year following first post-radiotherapy scan) and by 25 months (2 years following first post-radiotherapy scan), and will also compute the same two proportions considering regional progression, distant progression, and any (of the 3 categories) progression. A 95% confidence intervals around these proportions will be constructed. Participants for whom investigators are unable to determine progression status at 1 and 2 years (e.g., because they do not return for the necessary scans, or because they die without evidence of progression) will be left out of these analyses., At 1 and 2 years after first post-radiotherapy scan|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival will be evaluated by considering the time from registration to progression of disease or death; those who do not experience either outcome will be censored at date of last visit. Using the Kaplan-Meier lifetable method, and will estimate median survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals; investigators will also explore simple Cox proportional hazards models of this survival outcomes, to examine the predictive influence of variables such as age, gender, ECOG performance status, stage at diagnosis, planning target volume (PTV) 7000 volume, and planning target volume (PTV) 5750 volume., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be evaluated by considering the time from registration to death from any cause; those who do not die will be censored at date of last visit. Using the Kaplan-Meier lifetable method, and will estimate median survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals; investigators will also explore simple Cox proportional hazards models of this survival outcomes, to examine the predictive influence of variables such as age, gender, ECOG performance status, stage at diagnosis, planning target volume (PTV) 7000 volume, and planning target volume (PTV) 5750 volume., Up to 2 years
Primary Objective:

â€¢ To determine the in-field control of hypofractionated radiotherapy consisting of 70 Gy in 25 fractions without concurrent chemotherapy measured at two years after the first post- radiotherapy scan.

Secondary Objective(s):

* To determine the toxicity profile of thoracic hypofractionated radiotherapy consisting of 70 Gy in 25 fractions as graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0
* To determine proportion with local, regional, and distant progression at 1 and 2 years after the first post-radiotherapy scan, and compute progression-free and overall survival (progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively).
