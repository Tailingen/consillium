Assessment of Complete Response MRI Criterion After Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Standard care for locally advanced rectal cancer consists in a neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery. Morbidity and mortality remain high after rectal surgery, and often linked with quality of life impairment. 10 to 30% present a pathological complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. Some surgical teams propose "watch and wait" approach for patients selected with clinical complete responses criterion. The problem is to be sur the response is complete. MRI seems to be accurate to select complete responders. We will try to find MRI criterion of complete responses.
Rectal Neoplasms
Complete response MRI criterion, We selected several objective MRI criterion among literature and compared them between the two groups., Day 0: immediately after the procedure
MRI accuracy, Calculated Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value., Day 0: immediately after the procedure
