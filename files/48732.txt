Precision Radiotherapy for Tumours Using Magnetic Resonance-guided Linear Accelerator (MR-Linac)
Aim to observe the application of MR-Linac for precision radiotherapy of tumours, analyse its therapeutic effect, toxic and side effects,Characteristics of dosimetric parameters etc.
Overall Response Rate|Oncology|Radiation Toxicity|Quality of Life
DEVICE: MR-Linac
overall response rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume reduction reached the predetermined value and maintained the minimum time limit requirement was the sum of CR (Complete Response) and PR (Partial Response) proportions., 3months， 6months，12months，24months，36months，60months
Progression-Free Survival, The time from the start of treatment until objective tumor Progression or patient all-cause death, 3months， 6months，12months，24months，36months，60months|Disease Control Rate, The percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or remains stable over time, 3months， 6months，12months，24months，36months，60months|Overall survival, Overall survival of participating patients will be obtained from the hospital information systems, 3months， 6months，12months，24months，36months，60months|Incidence of adverse reactions, Disease-specific toxicity is obtained from the hospital information system. Toxicities are reported according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) dictionary, 3months， 6months，12months，24months|Patient reported Health related quality of life (HRQoL), Patient reported health related quality of life is captured through a questionnaire the Generic European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. It is a core scale applicable to all cancer patients. It contains a total of 30 items, items 1 to 28 are divided into 4 grades and scored 1 to 4 points, items 29 and 30 are divided into 7 grades and scored 1 to 7 points. The 30 entries are divided into 15 domains, including 5 functional domains (i.e., somatic, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom domains (i.e., fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting), 1 quality of life domain, and 6 single entries/domains. A high score on functional or global health status scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning., 3months，6months，12months，24months|Dosimetric parameters：dose of target volume（TV）, Dose of target volume（TV）includes gross target volume（GTV），clinical target volume（CTV），internal target volume(ITV) and planning target volume（PTV）,Measured by cGy., During Radiotherapy|Dosimetric parameters：OAR, Limited dose of organ at risk（OAR） ，includes mean dose（Dmean）, maximum dose（Dmax）and minimum dose（Dmin），Measured by cGy.

Volume dose limitation，Measured by percent（%），for example， lung V20≤30%., During Radiotherapy|Dosimetric parameters：γ passing rate, The gamma passing rate evaluates the coincidence between the calculated and measured dose distributions by utilizing the percent dose difference (DD) and distance to agreement., During Radiotherapy
Primary endpoint:

· Overall response rate (ORR) : It refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume reduction reaches the pre-specified value and can maintain the minimum time requirement, which is a Complete Response (CR) and a partial response (PR). Partial Response) sum of the proportions.

Secondary points:

* Progression-free Survival (PFS) : the time from the start of treatment until objective tumor Progression or all-cause death of the patient.
* Disease Control Rate (DCR) : The percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or remains stable over time.
* Overall Survival (OS) : the time from the start of treatment to all-cause death.
* Incidence of adverse reactions: toxicity according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).
* Quality of life: The EORTC Quality of Life measure -QLQ-C30-(V3.0) was used, and the higher the score, the higher the quality of life.
* Dosimetric parameters： include gross target volume（GTV）， clinical target volume（CTV），internal target volume(ITV),planning target volume（PTV），γ-passing rate，and limited dose of organs at risk (including average dose, maximum dose, etc.)
