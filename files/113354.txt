A Study of HX008 Plus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in the First-Line Treatment of Subjects With Stage IV (M1c) Melanoma That is Metastatic to the Liver
The main purpose of this study is to compare the clinical benefit, as measured by Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival(OS), achieved by HX008 Plus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) or Temozolomide Plus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) in the First-Line Treatment of Subjects With Stage IV (M1c) Melanoma That is Metastatic to the Liver.
