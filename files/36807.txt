SYD985 vs. Physician's Choice in Participants With HER2-positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that SYD985 \[(vic-)trastuzumab duocarmazine\] is superior to physician's choice in prolonging progression free survival.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: (vic-)trastuzumab duocarmazine|DRUG: Physician's choice
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression by central assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier., baseline until primary analysis data cut-off date of 31March2021
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause., baseline until final Overall Survival analysis data cut-off date of 30June2022|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a centrally assessed best overall response of complete response or partial response according to RECIST v1.1., baseline until primary analysis data cut-off date of 31March2021|Investigator Assessed Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier., baseline until primary analysis data cut-off date of 31March2021|Patient Reported Outcomes for Health Related Quality of Life, Change in the global health status/Quality of Life (QoL) scale score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 from baseline (cycle 1). The raw score (1 to 7) has been transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100. A higher score means a better outcome: hence a positive change from baseline means an improvement in global health status/Quality of Life and a negative change from baseline means a worsening of global health status/Quality of Life., baseline until primary analysis data cut-off date of 31March2021
This study is designed as a randomized, active-controlled, superiority study in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The patients should have had either progression during or after at least two HER2-targeting treatment regimens for locally advanced or metastatic disease or progression during or after (ado-)trastuzumab emtansine treatment.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive SYD985 or physician's choice treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or study termination by the Sponsor. During treatment, patients will have to visit the clinical site to assess efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and safety using standardized criteria.
