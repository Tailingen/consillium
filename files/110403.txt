A Study of FF-10501-01 in Combination with Azacitidine in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The primary objective of the study is to determine the response rate according to the International Working Group Response criteria for the combination of FF-10501-01 and azacitidine in patients previously untreated with hypomethylating agents, with Int2/High risk MDS according to the IPSS, and Intermediate/High/Very-High risk MDS according to the IPSS-R, or who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: FF-10501-01|DRUG: Azacitidine
Response Rate, The primary efficacy assessment will be the objective response rate, composed of those patients who achieve a best response of CR, mCR, PR or HI based on the Modified IWG Response Criteria in MDS, 24 months
Hematologic Improvement Rate, Determination of the hematologic improvement rate for erythroid, platelet and/or neutrophil response. The number of patients who achieve trilineage hematologic improvement will be reported, as will the number who achieve improvement in each of the cell series (i.e., erythroid (HI-E), platelet (HI-P), and/or neutrophil (HI-N)., 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response will be measured from the date of initial response until failure (includes death from any cause), relapse (after CR or PR) or progression, as defined by the Modified IWG Response Criteria in MDS., 24 months|Event-Free Survival, Duration of event free survival will be measured from the start of treatment until failure (as defined in the Modified IWG Response Criteria) or death from any cause., 24 months|Progression-Free Survival, Duration of progression free survival will be measured from the start of treatment until progression (as defined in the Modified IWG Response Criteria) or death from MDS., 24 months
This is an open-label, Simon 2-stage clinical study of the combination of FF-10501-01 and azacitidine in previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS, or in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine in the judgment of the Investigator. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will be preceded by a Phase 1 "run-in" to evaluate the safety of the combination of FF-10501-01 plus azacitidine.
