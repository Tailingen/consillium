ctDNA-guided Surveillance for Stage III CRC, a Randomized Intervention Trial
IMPROVE-IT2 is a randomized multicenter trial comparing the outcomes of ctDNA guided post-operative surveillance and standard-of-care CT-scan surveillance. The hypothesis of this study is that ctDNA guided post-operative surveillance combining ctDNA and radiological assessments could result in earlier detection of recurrent disease and identify more patients eligible for curative treatment.
