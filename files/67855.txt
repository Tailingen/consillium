A Study to Identify Participants With Urothelial Cancer and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Gene Aberrations
The purpose of this non-interventional study is to identify participants with urothelial cancer (UC) and selected fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) aberrations through molecular testing of their archival tumor tissue.
Urothelial Cancer|Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor
