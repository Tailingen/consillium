The Research on 89Zr-ABT806 PET Imaging in High Grade Glioma
The epidermal growth factor receptor variant Ⅲ(EGFR vⅢ) is commonly detected in high-grade gliomas, which is also an important epitope in EGFR-targeted therapies and correlated to poor prognosis. However, detection of this mutant usually needs resected tumor samples. For biopsy samples, test results may not represent the EGFR vⅢ status of the whole tumor tissues because of the heterogeneity of tumor. It is also not applicable for patients who are not suitable for surgical procedure due to the tumor location or patients' general conditions. Because of the importance of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal pathway in oncogenesis, maintenance, and progression of high grade glioma, there has been an intense effort to develop noninvasive molecular imaging approach for the selection and monitoring of EGFR-targeted therapies.

Based on investigators' previous study, investigators plan to perform PET scanning on the participants with high grade gliomas after the injection of the second generation of EGFR tracer ,89Zr-ABT806, which can be specifically binded to EGFR vⅢ . After fusing the PET and MRI images, investigators precisely obtain the tissue from the"hot-spot" on the PET image through multimodal-neuronavigation-guided tumor biopsy. EGFRvⅢ status will be detected by molecular methods to analyze the correlation with the 89Zr-ABT806 PET image qualitatively and quantitatively. Investigators' final goal is to detect EGFR vⅢ by noninvasive molecular imaging procedure for the clinical outcome prediction and the selection of EGFR-targeted therapies.
