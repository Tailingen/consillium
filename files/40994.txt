Fluorescence Guided Surgery in Breast Cancer - The MARGIN-2 Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to intraoperatively visualize tumour tissue in breast cancer patients using fluorescence imaging with the tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW and thereby enhance real-time clinical decision making, preventing postoperative tumour-positive margins.
Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer Invasive
PROCEDURE: Fluorescence guided detection of tumor positive margins.
Detection, To determine whether real-time tumor visualization using targeted fluorescent imaging during breast conserving therapy in breast cancer patients can be achieved intraoperatively and results in adequate assessment of the tumor margin., 1 year
Detection ex-vivo imaging, To determine whether ex-vivo fluorescence imaging can adequately show tumor-positive margins in resected tissue samples., 1 year|Detection in-vivo imaging, To determine whether in-vivo fluorescence imaging can adequately show residual tumor in the cavity., 1 year|Radical resection rate, To analyze whether patients that in standard-of-care would have tumor-positive margins and needed additional treatment postoperatively, had a radical resection after biopsy using fluorescence guided surgery., 1 year
