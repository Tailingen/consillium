Comprehensive Evaluation of Tumor Oxygenation, Metabolism and Blood Supply of High Grade Glioma and Cervical Cancers Using Dynamic FAZA PET and Multiparametric MR
Primary Objectives To investigate the relationship between dynamic MRI, brain tumor perfusion (DSC) and permeability (DCE), and dynamic 18F-FAZA PET uptake.

Secondary Objectives To investigate the relationship between tumors with greater hypoxia defined by qBOLD and 18F-FAZA PET and pathological features including proportionate necrosis, Ki-67 and IDH mutation status

To investigate the correlation between the hypoxic tumor region delineated using 18F-FAZA PET and qBOLD
