Effect of Ultrasound-guided Left Stellate Ganglion Block on Rapid Recovery in Patients With Liver Lobectomy and Its Mechanism
Lobe resection of complex process Traumatic big liver door block causes the body's nervous system very excited or inhibit the endocrine system, immune excessive activation of inflammatory cells, triggering and cause dysfunction of the immune inflammatory reaction, of patients with injury of tissues and organs and affect its repair, increase the risk of complications after liver resection, affected lobe resection in patients with postoperative rapid recovery. Stellate ganglion block has been widely used in the treatment of various systemic diseases due to its advantages of simple operation and obvious effect. SGB has broad application prospects and can promote postoperative recovery of patients undergoing major surgery, but its effect on the rapid recovery of patients undergoing liver lobectomy and its mechanism remain to be further explored.
Left Stellate Ganglion Block on Rapid Recovery|Possible Molecular Mechanism of Left Stellate Ganglion Block
PROCEDURE: Stellate ganglion block
Postoperative complications, pulmonary infection, oxygenation injury, arrhythmia, bleeding, intestinal paralysis, incision infection, renal insufficiency, cognitive dysfunction, etc., Within one week after surgery|mortality rate, mortality rate, Within 30 days after surgery|Plasma concentrations of IL-6,IL-10 and TNF-α, Plasma concentrations of IL-6,IL-10 and TNF-α were measured before operation, 6 h after operation, 24 h after operation, and 72 h after operation, Within three days of the surgery
Stellate ganglion, also known as cervicothoracic sympathetic ganglion, is a fusion of the subcervical sympathetic ganglion emitted from C3-C7 and the first thoracic sympathetic ganglion, located in the lateral lateral of the transverse tubercle of the 7th cervical vertebra and the cervical protubertion of the first rib, and receives THE T1-T2 nerve SGB, which is mainly manifested in the central and peripheral nerves The central function is to maintain the stability of internal environment by regulating the activity of hypothalamus. The peripheral effect is mainly manifested by blocking the preganglionic and postganglionic fibers, which inhibits the muscle tension, cardiovascular movement and bronchoconstrictor glands in the distribution area to secrete pain conduction, so as to achieve the purpose of treating diseases such as heart, lung, head and neck. The study also found that SGB can regulate the endocrine system autonomic nervous system and immune system, and play an important role in maintaining the stability of the body's internal environment. SGB is considered a very important weapon for modern anesthesiologists. The clinical application of SGB is not only for the pain treatment of head, face, neck, shoulder and limb, but also for the treatment of arrhythmia, traumatic stress and the control of hypertension. SGB has been shown to be effective in treating ventricular arrhythmias, stopping ventricular tachycardia in patients with long QT syndrome, and ventricular fibrillation with recurrent acute myocardial infarction. SGB has a certain therapeutic effect on pulmonary hypertension by down-regulating sympathetic activity and improving endothelial dysfunction. SGB can regulate gastrointestinal dysfunction, promote gastrointestinal motility recovery, and has obvious curative effect on gastrointestinal diseases. Studies have confirmed that SGB can significantly decrease serum inflammatory cytokines IL-1B,IL-6 and TNF-α. Planetary ganglion block in patients with severe trauma showed significant downregulation of inflammatory factors IL-1B,IL-6 and TNF-α in patients with 6, 24 and 72 hours, suggesting that SGB has a regulatory role in the early inflammatory response of trauma and improves the prognosis of acute trauma. SGB can reduce the inflammatory response, improve gastrointestinal dysfunction and promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function after surgery by reducing stress response, inhibiting the synthesis of cytokines inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide synthase
