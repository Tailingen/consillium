The impact of donor-recipient ABO compatibility on transplant outcomes had been evaluated in different transplant settings, but had shown different results. The investigators set out to investigate the impact of ABO incompatibility on post-transplant outcomes, engraftment kinetics and blood product requirements, transfusion independence, the incidence of poor graft function (PGF) in anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) based haplo-SCT with PBSC grafts.
