Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Intact Brain Metastases
This is a randomized study to determine if not treating planning target volume (PTV) margins during radiation therapy worsens progression free survival rates in patients with brain metastases.
Brain Metastases
PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Progression free survival (PFS) rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method at 6 months, Progression free survival (PFS) rates will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the 0-mm and 2-mm groups will be compared via the log-rank statistic with a one-sided test of significance, using follow-up data up to 6 months., 6 months
Progression free survival (PFS) rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, Progression free survival (PFS) rates will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the 0-mm, and 2-mm groups will be compared via the log-rank statistic with a one-sided test of significance, using follow-up data up to 6 months., 2 years|Overall survival rates, Time from Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) completion to death., 2 years|Rates of radiation necrosis, To evaluate the superiority of frameless LINAC-based SRS using 0 mm margins compared to 2 mm margins in reducing rates of radiation necrosis., 2 years|Rates of pseudoprogression, To evaluate the superiority of frameless LINAC-based SRS using 0 mm margins compared to 2 mm margins in reducing rates of radiation pseudoprogression., 2 years|Local failure rates, Local failure and OS rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, comparing arms via the log-rank statistic., 2 years|Rate of acute central nervous system (CNS) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grade 2 and higher toxicities, Any acute CTCAE v4.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities, within 90 days of SRS completion (toxicity must be specified)., 90 days|Rate of late central nervous system (CNS) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grade 2 and higher toxicities, To compare rates of late (greater than 90 days from SRS) CTCAE v4.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities., 2 years|Rates of distant intracranial failure, The appearance of new non-target lesions ≥5 mm following completion of radiotherapy will be considered distant intracranial failure. If a non-target lesion \<5 mm is found on a later scan to have increased to ≥ 5 mm, distant intracranial failure will be declared at the date of the earliest scan showing the new lesion., 2 years|Rates of salvage therapy, Time to initiation of any combination of salvage Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Whole Brain Radiation Therapy WBRT, or neurosurgical resection for intracranial failure., 2 years|Association between dose and risk of radionecrosis or pseudoprogression, To determine association between V10Gy and V12Gy all tissue, whole brain and normal brain parameters and risk of radionecrosis or pseudoprogression., 2 years
