DRUG: MK-2206
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was any drug-related AE, regardless of grade, leading to a dose modification of MK-2206. Dose-limiting hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were defined differently and were based on events occurring during the first cycle of study drug administration. Hematologic DLT defined as any Grade (Gr) 4 or greater hematologic toxicity except neutropenia described as follows: Neutropenia that was Gr 4 lasting for ≥7 days, or Gr 3/Gr 4 with fever \>38.5°C and/or infection requiring antibiotic or anti-fungal treatment considered DLT. Gr 4 thrombocytopenia (≤25.0 x 10\^9/L) was also considered DLT. Non-hematologic DLTs were defined as any Gr 3, 4, or 5 nonhematologic toxicity, with the specific exceptions of: Gr 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration occurring with inadequate supportive care and lasting \<48 hours; alopecia; inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions; and Gr 3 elevated transaminases of ≤1 week in duration. A participant could have more than one DLT., Day 1 to Day 28 (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants With One or More Adverse Events (AE), An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.

Phosphorylated Protein Kinase B (pAkt) Level on Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) After Treatment With MK-2206 at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To determine the inhibition of pAkt by MK-2206 in participants treated at the MTD, levels of Akt phosphorylated at the serine 473 residue (pAkt Ser473 Akt) were measured in snap-frozen tumors collected at baseline and Day 15 of Cycle 1 using a MesoScale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
