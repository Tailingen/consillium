Neoadjuvant Ensartinib in ALK Positive Resectable Stage II to III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This single-arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ensartinib as neoadjuvant treatment in ALK positive, resectable for stage II to III non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Ensartinib
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, pCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved pathologic complete response (with no residual viable tumor in lung primary or lymph nodes as evaluated by central pathology laboratory of surgical specimens) in all participants., Within 2 month after surgery
Major Pathological Response (MPR) rate, MPR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (less than or equal to 10% of residual viable tumor in lung primary or lymph nodes as evaluated by central pathology laboratory of surgical specimens) in all participants., Within 2 month after surgery|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who attained complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator., Pre-operation|Incidence of Adverse Events, Toxicity will be graded by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0), Up to 1 month after surgery|Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the first day after radical surgery until the first date of disease recurrence (local or distant) or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 3 years postoperatively|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to death from any cause., 5 years postoperatively
This is a single-Arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study, the primary endpoint is pathological complete response (pCR). Participants will receive ensartinib at 225 mg orally once a day taken with or without food for 12 weeks before surgical resection.
