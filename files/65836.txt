A Study of Blue Light Flexible Cystoscopy With Cysview in the Detection of Bladder Cancer in the Surveillance Setting
The purpose of this study is to investigate if blue light cystoscopy with Cysview improves detection of tumors in patients with bladder cancer during surveillance cystoscopy, using the KARL STORZ D-Light C PDD Flexible Videoscope System. Another purpose is to investigate if Cysview and blue light is safe and effective when used repeatedly.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride|DEVICE: KARL STORZ D-Light C PDD Flexible Videoscope System
Proportion of Patients With Histologically Confirmed Malignancy Where Malignancy is Only Detected With Blue Light Cystoscopy With Cysview and Not White Light Cystoscopy, In the subsection of patients with histologically confirmed malignancy, the proportion of patients detected only by the use of blue light cystoscopy with Cysview is measured., At time of cystoscopy procedure
Proportion of Patients With Adverse Events Considered Causally Related to Cysview and/or Blue Light in the Surveillance Examination Compared With the OR Examination, At time of cystoscopy procedure|Proportion of Patients With One or More Carcinoma in Situ (CIS) Lesions Detected With Blue Light Cystoscopy With Cysview and None With White Light Cystoscopy, In the subsection of patients with histologically confirmed CIS, the proportion of patients detected only by blue light cystoscopy with Cysview is measured., At time of cystoscopy procedure
