Long-term Outcomes of Lidocaine Infusions for Post-Operative Pain (LOLIPOP) Trial
The LOLIPOP Trial is a large (n=4,300 patients) pragmatic, international, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assessment, safety and effectiveness superiority study.

The Trial's purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of lidocaine infusions commenced during surgery and extending up to 24 hours postoperatively, on the incidence of moderate or severe chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) detected one year following surgery in female patients undergoing elective breast cancer surgery. The trial has 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful (25%) reduction in the incidence of the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include safety events, analgesic efficacy (pain scores and opioid consumption), neuropathic characteristics of CPSP, and psychological and quality of life outcomes.
