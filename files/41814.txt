Contrast Sonography for Evaluation of Liver Tumors Prior to Radiofrequency Ablation
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Definity (perflutren lipid microsphere Injectable Suspension) ultrasound contrast agent in identifying small tumors (hepatomas \& metastases) within the liver.

Primary objective: To estimate the increase in conspicuity of small intrahepatic tumors with contrast-enhanced sonography

Secondary Objectives: To estimate the effect of tumor type, size, location and depth on the conspicuity of small tumors on contrast-enhanced sonography
Liver Neoplasms
DRUG: perflutren lipid microspheres
Percent of Tumors With Increased Echogenicity (Brightness) Following Contrast-enhanced Sonography, After the systemic iv injection of ultrasound contrast, the real time ultrasound images are visually evaluated, and small intrahepatic tumors are detected on the images. The images pre-contrast and post contrast are compared visually. One tumor per participant was analyzed., 15 min
Number of Participants With an Increase in Echogenicity (Brightness) of Small Intrahepatic Tumors Following Contrast-enhanced Sonography Based on Tumor Type, Size, Location and Depth, Visual estimation of the the effect of tumor type, size, location and depth on the conspicuity of small tumors on contrast-enhanced sonography using prior assessment or pathology for tumor type, 15 min
An estimated 75 patients (age 18 years of age or older) will be enrolled from the population of patients who present for ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of CT or MRI-confirmed multiple primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic carcinoma, with at least one of the tumors being â‰¤ 1.5 cm in diameter.
