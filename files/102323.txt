Phase II Trial of Alisertib With Induction Chemotherapy in High-risk AML
This research study is studying a targeted therapy (a form of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal cells) as a possible treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia.

The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

* Alisertib / MLN8237
* Cytarabine / Cytosine Arabinoside
* Idarubicin / Idarubicin hydrochloride
* Daunorubicin (Can be used in place of idarubicin)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Alisertib|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Idarubicin|DRUG: Daunorubicin
Number of Participants That Achieved Complete Remission, The number of participants that achieved a best overall response of complete remission while on study.

Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow showing less than 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, an ANC of at least 1000/μL and a platelet count of 100,000/μL, absence of blast in peripheral blood, absence of identifiable leukemic cells in the bone marrow, existing extramedullary disease. If possible, at least one bone marrow biopsy should be performed to confirm CR., From the start of treatment until the end of study treatment, up to approximately 10 months|Number of Participants That Achieved Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi), The number of participants that achieved a best overall response of CRi while on study.

Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi): Same as for CR but without achievement of ANC at least 1000/uL (CRi) and/or platelet count of 100,000/uL (CRp)., From the start of treatment until the end of study treatment, up to approximately 10 months
1 Year Overall Survival Rate, The percentage of participants alive at one year, 1 Year|Median Relapse Free Survival, The median amount of time from achieving a complete remission to the first of disease recurrence or death. RFS applies only to the subset of patients who achieve a CR+CRi at the end of induction therapy.

* Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow showing less than 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, an ANC of at least 1000/μL and a platelet count of 100,000/μL, absence of blast in peripheral blood, absence of identifiable leukemic cells in the bone marrow, existing extramedullary disease. If possible, at least one bone marrow biopsy should be performed to confirm CR.
* Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Same as CR but without achievement of specified ANC and/or platelet count
* Recurrence/ morphologic relapse: reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or \>5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause, From the time of treatment response until death or disease progression (up to about one year)|Median Duration of Remission, The median amount of time from first achieving remission to disease progression (with patients censored at death).

* Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow showing less than 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines, an ANC of at least 1000/μL and a platelet count of 100,000/μL, absence of blast in peripheral blood, absence of identifiable leukemic cells in the bone marrow, existing extramedullary disease. If possible, at least one bone marrow biopsy should be performed to confirm CR.
* Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Same as CR but without achievement of specified ANC and/or platelet count
* Recurrence/ morphologic relapse: reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or \>5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause, From the time of first remission to disease progression or death, median duration of 12.8 months|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, Adverse events were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4). Adverse events were considered to be Serious Adverse Events (SAE) if they were grade 3 or greater and deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment., From the start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of a study drug is received, up to approximately 11 months
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

As part of this research study, the participant will take alisertib in combination with conventional chemotherapies, idarubicin and cytarabine. Alisertib has not been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, cytarabine and idarubicin have both been approved by the FDA for treatment of AML. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved giving alisertib with idarubicin and cytarabine for use in participants, including participants with this type of cancer.

Earlier pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have suggested the alisertib may have clinical promise as a single agent in acute myeloid leukemia. Alisertib is a selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase, an enzyme which may play a role in the survival of leukemia cells. Alisertib is being studied for the treatment of advanced malignancies, including AML. Essentially, this means that alisertib may work to halt the growth of malignancy (abnormal cells dividing without control and invading nearby tissues) through a targeted mechanism. By combining alisertib with standard chemotherapy, the hope is to enhance the efficacy of current treatment used for acute myeloid leukemia. An earlier study of this combination has completed accrual, and demonstrated that the regimen is well tolerated.

Through this study, the investigators would like to determine if the addition of alisertib to standard 7+3 chemotherapy improves efficacy as measured by the rate of complete remission (a decreased or disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer).
