Pembrolizumab Plus Chemo in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Projects 2004, ECTOP-2004)
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant treatment in participants with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and to explore treatment resistance mechanisms.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin
Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, Pathologic complete response is used as surrogate efficacy endpoint and is assessed by the Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). PCR is defined as TRG1 plus no positive lymph node., Up to approximately 6 months (1-September-2022 till 1-March-2023)|Major hypoxia signals in baseline or post-treatment tumor samples from all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, Major hypoxia signals in tumor microenvironment (TME) are assessed by IHC methods, using tumor samples acquired pre- and post-treatment. Major hypoxia signals are to be compared between non-responders and responders to pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy. In this neoadjuvant study, we define that patients who fail to reach major pathologic response (mPR) before surgery are classified as non-responders, and patients who reach mPR before surgery as responders. MPR is assessed by the Mandard TRG. MPR is defined as combined TRG1 and TRG2., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)
PCR rate in eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC whose tumors are PD-L1 biomarker positive (CPS ≥1), Pathologic complete response is used as surrogate efficacy endpoint and is assessed by the Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). PCR is defined as TRG1 plus no positive lymph node. PD-L1 expression is measured by 22C3 clone PD-L1 IHC assay followed by combined positive score (CPS) scoring methods., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)|Event-free survival (EFS) in the 3-year follow-up of all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, EFS is defined as time from allocation to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, a second primary tumor, or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 48 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2026)|Cell lineage-specific hypoxia signals in baseline or post-treatment tumor samples from all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, Lineage-specific hypoxia signals in TME are assessed by multi-color flow cytometry in defined immune subsets and tumor, using surgical tumor samples acquired post-treatment. Lineage-specific hypoxia signals are to be compared between non-responders and responders to pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy. In this neoadjuvant study, we define that patients who fail to reach mPR before surgery are classified as non-responders, and patients who reach mPR before surgery as responders. MPR is assessed by the Mandard TRG. MPR is defined as combined TRG1 and TRG2., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)
Spatial proteomic measurement of hypoxia and defined cell lineages in baseline or post-treatment tumor samples from all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, Spatial proteomic measurement of hypoxia and defined cell lineages are assessed by multiplex IHC assay., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)|Single cell genomic measurement of hypoxia pathway genes in post-treatment tumor samples from all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC., Single cell genomic measurement of hypoxia pathway genes are assessed by single cell RNA sequencing., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)|PCR rate in eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC whose tumors are PD-L1 biomarker positive (CPS ≥10), PCR is used as surrogate efficacy endpoint and is assessed by the Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). PCR is defined as TRG1 plus no positive lymph node. PD-L1 expression is measured by 22C3 clone PD-L1 IHC assay followed by CPS scoring methods., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)|R0 resection rate in all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, R0 resection is defined as microscopically margin-negative resection, without remaining gross or microscopic tumor in the primary tumor bed., Up to approximately 12 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2023)|EFS in eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, stratified by PD-L1 biomarker expression (CPS ≥10, ≥1 and <1), EFS is defined as time from allocation to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, a second primary tumor, or death due to any cause. PD-L1 expression is measured by 22C3 clone PD-L1 IHC assay followed by CPS scoring methods., Up to approximately 48 months (1-September-2022 till 1-September-2026)
The overall primary efficacy hypotheses are as follows:

In all eligible participants with locally advanced ESCC, pathologic complete response (pCR) rate is non-inferior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with historical benchmark.

The overall primary translational hypotheses are as follows:

Major hypoxia signals are significantly higher in baseline or post-treatment tumor samples from non-responders to pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy, as compared to those samples from responders.
