Pembrolizumab in Ultramutated and Hypermutated Endometrial Cancer
Primary Objectives: To assess the antitumor activity (proportion of objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria) of pembrolizumab with objective tumor response in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer harboring an ultra-mutated or hyper-mutated (MMR gene-defective) phenotype identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of pembrolizumab as assessed by CTCAE in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma. Secondary Objective(s): To estimate the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Frequency of objective tumor response as assessed by RECIST 1.1, RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) is a set of published rules that define when cancer patients improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable") or worsen ("progression") during treatments., 4 years|Frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) are a set of criteria for the standardized classification of adverse effects of drugs used in cancer therapy., 4 years
Duration of progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression, death, or the date of last contact, whichever occurs first., 6 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of death or the date of last contact., 6 years
