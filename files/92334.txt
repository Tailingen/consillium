Randomized Study of Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Curative Resection of HCC With Narrow Margin (RAISE)
RAISE is a multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy for controlling postsurgical recurrence in HCC patients with narrow margin (â‰¤ 1 cm) after curative resection.

RAISE trial will recruit 148 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1) to two groups (the surgery group and the surgery-radiotherapy group). Random assignment was stratified by the condition of MVI and tumor size. All patients in the surgery-radiotherapy group received Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) within 1-3 months after surgical resection. The prescription dose was planned at 50 gray in 25 fractions over 5-6 weeks. The trial is to verify whether adjuvant radiotherapy prolongs recurrence-free survival in patients with a narrow resection margin.
