Phase 2 Trial of Afatinib Plus Prednisone for Advanced Squamous NSCLC
To determine the efficacy of combined afatinib and prednisone in previously treated advanced squamous NSCLC
Advanced Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Afatinib + Prednisone
Progression-free survival of combined afatinib and prednisone in previously treated NSCLC, Measure progression-free survival rate., From date of enrollment to date of documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Response rate of combined afatinib and prednisone in previously treated NSCLC, Measure response rate by evaluation of target lesions by measuring disease., From date of enrollment to date of documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival of combined afatinib and prednisone in previously treated NSCLC, Measure Overall Survival, as the time from the date of initiation of study treatment until death of any cause., From date of enrollment to date of documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Safety of combined afatinib and prednisone in previously treated NSCLC, Measure risk to study participants by completing blood test and assessing according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0., From date of enrollment to date of documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
This two-stage phase 2 study will determine the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose/maximum tolerated dose, preliminary efficacy and predictive/pharmacodynamic biomarkers of combined EGFR inhibition (afatinib) and TNF inhibition (prednisone) in previously treated NSCLC.
