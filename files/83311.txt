A Study of BMS-986488 as Monotherapy and Combination Therapy in Participants With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This purpose of this study is to determine if experimental treatment with BMS-986488, alone, or in combinations is safe, tolerable, and has anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Malignant Tumors
DRUG: BMS-986488|DRUG: Adagrasib|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Until the end of the Safety Follow-up period (up to approximately 100 days after last dose)|Number of participants with Serious AEs (SAEs), Until the end of the Safety Follow-up period (up to approximately 100 days after last dose)|Number of participants with AEs meeting protocol-defined Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) criteria, From first dose of study treatment until end of cycle 1 (1 Cycle = 28 Days)|Number of participants with AEs leading to discontinuation, Until the end of the Safety Follow-up period (up to approximately 100 days after last dose)|Number of deaths, From time of informed consent up to 52 weeks after end of treatment visit
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Until Cycle 4, Day 1 (1 Cycle = 28 Days)|Time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax), Until Cycle 4, Day 1 (1 Cycle = 28 Days)|Area under the concentration-time curve in 1 dosing interval (AUC(TAU)), Until Cycle 4, Day 1 (1 Cycle = 28 Days)|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), From time of informed consent up to 52 weeks after end of treatment visit|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a best response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, From time of informed consent up to 52 weeks after end of treatment visit|Duration of response (DOR), Defined as the time between the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented disease progression as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From time of informed consent up to 52 weeks after end of treatment visit
