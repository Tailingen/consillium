Efficacy and Safety Study of Recombinant Endostatin Combined With Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Studies suggest that the addition of antiangiogenic agents to conventional therapeutic strategies, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, or other tumor-targeting agents, will increase clinical efficacy. For advanced colorectal cancer,the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab has become an important treatment option and its combination with chemotherapy is now being one of the standard first line therapy. This phase II study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of another antiangiogenesis inhibitor rh-endostatin plus mFOLFOX6 in advanced colorectal cancer.

Rh-Endostatin (Endostar; Simcere Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, JiangSu,China) is a humanized recombinant endostatin which is a direct angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). A pivotal phase III study completed in China demonstrated that the addition of rh-endostatin to navelbine plus cisplatin conferred clinically significant improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), as well as response rate (RR), in patients with previously untreated metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In vitro, the combination of Endostatin and fluorouracil showed synergistic activity in inhibiting colon cancer. MFolfox6 was standard first-line regimen in advanced colorectal cancer. The investigators carried out a phase II trial to investigate the activity and safety of rh-endostatin plus mFOLFOX in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
