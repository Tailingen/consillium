Circulating Tumor DNA Collection From Patients With High Grade Gliomas
Improved outcomes for high-grade gliomas (HGG) require advances in our ability to monitor changes to tumour biology using non-surgical approaches. "Liquid biopsy" is a term used to describe a technique whereby tumour DNA, which has been shed off and then circulates through the blood stream, is detected and analyzed. Our goal is to develop a new type of liquid biopsy that is suitable for primary brain tumours that uses a method that is highly sensitive and allows for ongoing analysis of these tumours.
High Grade Glioma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy as per standard of care
Feasibility of measuring both the burden and key molecular features of high- grade gliomas (HGG) through profiling of plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), Feasibility in this context will be defined by 1) detecting ctDNA in samples from HGG patients and 2) measuring changes in levels of specific ctDNA fragments following HGG treatment, 2 years
The study objective is to determine the feasibility of measuring both the burden and key molecular features of HGG through profiling of plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). This will be determined by detecting ctDNA in samples from HGG patients, and measuring changes in ctDNA levels over time following HGG treatment. 50 eligible patients will be enrolled in the study at University Health Network, and up to 10 blood samples will be obtained; up to 2 blood samples prior to their radiotherapy treatment, and 8 blood samples after their radiotherapy treatment. If available, tissue samples that are stored at UHN will also be collected for DNA extraction.
