TCR-Redirected T Cells Therapy in Patient With HBV Related HCC
This is a single center. single arm, open-label study to determine the safety and clinical benefit of TCR-redirected T cell therapy in patient with HBV related HCC post hepatectomy or radiofrequency ablation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: TCR redirected T cells
Safety evaluation based in Incidences of adverse events/serious adverse events, Review the safety profile of T-Cell Therapy by assessing adverse/serious adverse events reported., Up to 1 month after the last infusion
Overall Response Rate, Tumour assessment will be according to mRECIST v1.1. This is based on percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) according to mRECIST v1.1 from baseline., Start of Treatment until first documented CR or PR, assessed up to 56 treatment weeks (protocol-defined treatment duration is until disease progression, death, or loss to follow up, whichever came first)|Overall survival rate, Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomisation until death by any cause. Participants will be followed up for survival follow up for at least five years., Up to 5 years from the last infusion
