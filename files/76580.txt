A Prospective, Open-label, Single-center, Single-arm Phase II Clinical Study of Cadonilimab (AK104) Combined With Monotherapy Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Negative Driver Genes and Failed Immunotherapy
The aim of evaluating the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab combined with monotherapy chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with negative driver genes who have failed previous immunotherapy is to provide a more effective and safe treatment option for these patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cadonilimab (AK104)
Objective Response Rate（ORR）, The objective response rate (ORR) refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor shrinks by a certain percentage (generally 30%) and maintains this reduction for a certain period of time (generally 4 weeks)., approximately 24 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a cancer or tumor who experience a reduction in the size of the disease, no progression of the disease, or stable disease conditions for a specified period of time after receiving a particular treatment. This typically includes patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR), which stands for Duration of Response, refers to the length of time from the point when a subject achieves a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the time when the first sign of disease progression or death due to any cause occurs., approximately 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment using response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive., approximately 24 months|Adverse event (AE), Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., approximately 24 months
Cadonilimab (AK104), China's first globally developed bispecific antibody targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4, has demonstrated manageable safety and promising anti-tumor activity in female cervical cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there is currently no available data on the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab combined with monotherapy chemotherapy for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with negative driver genes and previous immunotherapy failure. Therefore, this study aims to prospectively and openly evaluate the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab combined with monotherapy chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced NSCLC with negative driver genes and previous immunotherapy failure using a single-arm trial design. The goal is to provide a more effective and safe treatment option for these patients.
