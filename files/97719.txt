Endoscopic Biliary Co-axial Stent Placement Plus/Minus Use of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for Clearance of Occluded Self Expandable Metal Stents (SEMS) in Patients With Distal Biliary Obstruction From Unresectable Biliary-pancreatic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects good and/or bad of combining radiofrequency ablation with placement of a second stent, versus a second stent alone. The investigators will also look at the safety of the combination treatment, and see which treatment is better. In either case, the second stent will be placed inside the existing stent as is done in standard practice when treating a blocked stent for the first time.
