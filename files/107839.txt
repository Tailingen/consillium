Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Telomelysin (OBP-301) in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open labeled, multiple centers, two countries (Taiwan and Korea) non-comparative phase I trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In phase I part, a maximum of 18 patients will be recruited in this study.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
BIOLOGICAL: OBP-301
Evaluation of safety parameters (adverse events, laboratory data, EKG, body weight, vital signs) on patient-base., 14 weeks
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/ Maximum Feasible Dose (MFD) for patients using OBP-301., 16 weeks|Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) for patients using OBP-301., 28 weeks
After screening, each eligible patient will undergo a treatment of OBP-301 within 14 days and will automatically enter follow-up period.

The follow-up period is up to 12 weeks after the last injection in the phase I part.
