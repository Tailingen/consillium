PD-1 Antibody Expressing mesoCAR-T Cells for Mesothelin Positive Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a single-arm, open-label, one center clinical study, to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to target mesothelin and express PD-1 antibodies in adult patients with advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors, which were positive expression of mesothelin.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: PD-1 antibody expressing mesoCAR-T cells
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events of infusion of autologous PD-1 antibody expressing mesothelin-targeted CAR-Tcells, Incidence of treatment-related adverse events are assessed using the NCI CTCAE V4.0 criteria., 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR) of the treatment using PD-1 antibody expressing mesoCAR-T cells for advanced solid tumors, Objective response rate (ORR) of the treatment is assessed according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor version 1.1 (RECIST1.1), which contains complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., 2 years|Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which tumor progresses or the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which the patient dies for any cause., 2 years
Proliferation and persistence of mesothelin specific CAR-T cells in peripheral blood of the patients, CAR-T proportionin in peripheral blood of the patients is detected by flow cytometry assay to study the proliferation and persistence of mesothelin specific CAR-T cells., 6 months|PD-1 antibody level in peripheral blood of the patients after treatment, PD-1 antibody level are detected by ELISA assay to assess the expressing level of PD-1 antibody from CAR-T cells., 6 months
This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the safety and efficacy of the PD-1 antibody expressing mesoCAR-T for patients with mesothelin positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MesoCAR-T can specifically and effectively kill the mesothelin positive cancer cells, PD-1 antibody are secreted from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, and then activated and engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting mesothelin and PD-1 antibody. Cells are proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion therapy. A total of 50 patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 24 months.
