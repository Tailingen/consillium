Feasibility Study of Incorporating 18F-FDG-PET Imaging in Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to study fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)-based dose escalation using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
Head and Neck Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: FDG-PET-based dose escalation using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
Acute toxicity during radiotherapy until 3 months after the end of the radiotherapy, until 3 months after the end of the radiotherapy|Observation of chronic toxicity, until 3 months after the end of the radiotherapy
Therapy response (2-4 months after end of radiotherapy), 2-4 months after end of radiotherapy|Local control at 2 years, at 2 years|Pattern of recurrence, at 2 years
The dose escalation, based on the FDG-PET signal, is incorporated in the first ten fractions of the radiotherapeutic treatment. The total amount of fractions is 32, equal to a standard radiotherapeutic treatment for these types of cancers.
