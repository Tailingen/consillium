A Phase 2 Study of PLX3397 in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
The objective of this study is to evaluate the response of subjects with recurrent glioblastoma to continuous therapy of PLX3397.
Recurrent Glioblastoma
DRUG: PLX3397
Summary of Response Rates in Participants on Treatment With PLX3397, Response to treatment was evaluated using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. All participants were evaluated for progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The six-month PFS rate was defined as the number of subjects with PFS of at least 6-month duration, with PFS measured from the first day of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first, over a 6-month period and evaluated using the Kaplan Meier method. The rate of OS was defined as the number of subjects that survived until study exit., 6 months post dose|Mean Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PLX3397 After Oral Administration of 1000 mg/Day - Cycle 1 Day 15, A noncompartmental method of analysis was used to analyze the plasma concentrations of PLX3397. Mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, include time to maximum concentration (Tmax) and will be calculated from the Cycle 1, Day 15 values., Pre-dose and up to 6 post dose during cycle 1, Day 15|Mean Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PLX3397 After Oral Administration of 1000 mg/Day - Cycle 1 Day 15, A noncompartmental method of analysis was used to analyze the plasma concentrations of PLX3397. Mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters include maximum concentration (Cmax) and will be calculated from the Cycle 1, Day 15 values., Pre-dose and up to 6 post dose during cycle 1, Day 15|Mean Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PLX3397 After Oral Administration of 1000 mg/Day - Cycle 1 Day 15, A noncompartmental method of analysis was used to analyze the plasma concentrations of PLX3397. Mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters include an assessment of area under the curve over 0-4 hours (AUC0-4), and will be calculated from the Cycle 1, Day 15 values., Pre-dose and up to 6 post dose during cycle 1, Day 15|Mean Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PLX3397 After Oral Administration of 1000 mg/Day - Cycle 1 Day 15, A noncompartmental method of analysis was used to analyze the plasma concentrations of PLX3397. Mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters include an assessment of area under the curve over 0-6 hours (AUC0-6), and will be calculated from the Cycle 1, Day 15 values., Pre-dose and up to 6 post dose during cycle 1, Day 15
