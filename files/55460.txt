Study is Designed to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of AZD4547 at Increasing Doses in Patients With Advanced Tumours
This study is primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD4547 at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid malignancies and for whom no standard medication options are available. It also assesses the blood levels and action of AZD4547 in the body over a period of time.

Number of Patients Who Experienced at Least 1 AE, To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547. System organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT), duration and severity all recorded., AEs are monitored from screenng through to 30 day follow up period|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Causally Related AE., To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547. A causally related AE is an AE deemed to be causally related to AZD4547., AEs are continually assessed from screening up to 30 day FU period|Number of Participants With at Least 1 AE of CTCAE >=G3, To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547, Ongoing up to discontinuation up to 30 day FU.|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Causally Related AE of CTCAE >=G3, To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547, Ongoing up to discontinuation up to 30 day FU.|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One SAE, To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547. A SAE (Serious Adverse Event) is and AE (adverse Event) which fulfills one of the following criteria that the PI assesses closely such as results in death, immediately life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of, results in significant disability, results in birth defect, may jepardise the patient or require intervention to prevent any of the previous outcomes., Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are continually assessed from Screening up to the end of the 30 day FU period.|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Causally Related SAE, To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4547: SAEs are assessed and deemed as causally related or not to AZD4547, SAEs are continually monitored from screening to end of 30 FU period
AUC(0-infinity), To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4547 following a single administration and at steady state after dosing when given orally., PK samples out to 96 hours "0 to 96 hours post-dose" after single dose (in parts A & B only). Steady state PK profile 3 weeks after the start of BD dosing.|Tumour Response (Best Objective Response) - Number of Patients With a Confirmed Response of Partial Response (PR) or Confirmed Response (CR), To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti tumour activity of AZD4547 by evaluation of tumour response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. Objective response = CR + PR; CR=disappearance of all target lesions and PR is \>=30% reduction in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, Baseline assessment, then assessment every 6 weeks after start of treatment until objective disease progression.|Cmax (ng/mL), To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4547 following a single administration and at steady state after dosing when given orally., PK samples out to 96 hours "0-96 hours post dose" after single dose (in parts A & B only). Steady state PK profile 3 weeks after the start of BD dosing.|Css,Max (ng/mL), To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4547 following a single administration and at steady state after dosing when given orally., PK samples out to 96 hours "0-96 hours post-dose" after single dose (in parts A & B only). Steady state PK profile 3 weeks after the start of BD dosing.|AUC,ss(0-infinity), To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4547 following a single administration and at steady state after dosing when given orally., PK samples out to 96 hours "0-96 hours post dose" after single dose (in parts A & B only). Steady state PK profile 3 weeks after the start of BD dosing.
