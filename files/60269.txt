BEHAVIORAL: EMPOWER
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Positive Affect Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) Questionnaire, Participants will complete a self-reported questionnaire on psychological wellbeing for feelings that reflect a level of pleasurable engagement with the environment, such as happiness, joy, excitement, enthusiasm, and contentment over the past seven days. A mixed model adjusted for baseline to model the value of the outcome (positive affect) at each time point following the intervention. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline up to 4 months after intervention
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Questionnaire, Participants will complete a self-reported questionnaire to capture the negative aspects of anxiety in the past seven days. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline up to 4 months after intervention|Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Questionnaire, Participants will complete a self-reported questionnaire to capture the negative aspects of depression over the past seven days. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline up to 4 months after intervention|Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Life Satisfaction Questionnaire, Participants will complete a self-reported questionnaire to capture the positive (life satisfaction) aspects of emotional health. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline up to 4 months after intervention
The EMPOWER Intervention is composed of five components:

1. Noting daily positive event, capitalizing on and savoring positive events, and gratitude.
2. Mindfulness
3. Positive Reappraisal
4. Focusing on personal strengths, setting and working toward attainable goals
5. Small of Kindness

For subjects who do not receive EMPOWER components or only receive some of the EMPOWER components, they will be given inert content. The inert content will cover Cognitive changes during Cancer, Diet, Weight Management, Financial Literacy and Sun Protection. The trial is a composed of a full factorial design with 32 (2X2X2X2X2) experimental conditions. Adolescents and Young Adults will receive 0, 1,2,3,4 or 5 Empower components.

Primary Objective

â€¢ Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to positive affect among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

Secondary Objective

* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to depression and anxiety among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.
* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to life satisfaction and general self-efficacy among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

Exploratory Objectives

* Summarize adherence and retention by participants over the course of the EMPOWER intervention.
* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with social roles and responsibilities.
* Identify which of five components in the EMPOWER web based curriculum, contribute meaningfully to health behaviors (diet, exercise, sedentary behavior, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking).
* Examine the trajectory of change in positive affect, life satisfaction, general self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety among post-treatment adolescent and young adult cancer survivors post intervention by intervention component.
* Examine coping self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between EMPOWER intervention components and positive affect, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety.
* Examine potential moderators (age, gender, social support, general self-efficacy, stressors, and positive events) of the relationship between EMPOWER intervention components and positive affect, life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety.
