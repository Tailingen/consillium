Potential participants will be identified by Myeloma Canada using their database. Myeloma Canada is a registered non-profit organization created by, and for, Canadians impacted by multiple myeloma. As part of Myeloma Canada website, patients and caregivers can subscribe to a mailing list to receive their monthly newsletter and to participate in surveys. This database comprises about 5,000 individuals, including patients and caregivers.

An e-mail will be sent to 600 patients and 200 caregivers randomly selected to invited them to participate in the survey. Interested participants will be invited to visit the Participant Portal on the PROxy website (https://periproxy.com/en), to sign the informed consent form and complete online questionnaires. Upon request, paper-based documents (i.e., informed consent form and questionnaires) can also be sent by mail. The following questionnaires will be used:

Patients

* Patient Information Questionnaire (i.e., baseline characteristics)
* EORTC QLQ-C30
* EORTC QLQ-MY20
* EQ-5D-5L
* ESAS-R
* Patients Perspective

Caregivers

* Caregiver Information Questionnaire (i.e., baseline characteristics)
* CarGOQoL
* Caregivers Perspective

If the sample size (i.e., 300 patients and 100 caregivers) is not reached one month after the first e-mail, an invitation e-mail will be sent to an additional 600 eligible patients and/or 200 caregivers randomly selected. This scheme of participant identification will be performed until the sample size is reached.
