Cochlear Implantation After Gamma Knife Radiosurgery with EABR and Correlation to Postoperative Hearing Results - a Pilot Study
Patients undergoing cochlear implantation after radio surgery for vestibular schwannoma will be included in the study. Patients will undergo preoperative and intraoperative eABR measurement. Correlations to postoperative hearing results will be drawn.
Vestibular Schwannoma|Hearing Loss
OTHER: eABR
eABR correlation, eABR is correlated with postoperative hearing results eABR will be divided in three categories - good response, weak response, no response Hearing results will be measured with speech understanding in Freiburg monosyllables word test which is measured in % of monosyllables understanding at 65 and 80dB, 2 years
Patients treated with radio surgery for vestibular schwannoma often suffer from hearing loss. Especially when the contralateral side has progressive hearing loss assessment if cochlear implantation is feasible, should be carried out. Patients undergo extensive audiometric testing. Additionally, patients will undergo preoperative eABR. Intraoperatively eABR is carried out and cochlear implantation is performed. The eABR results will be correlated with postoperative hearing. EABR measurements are not part of the study. The results of eBAR will be categorized in three groups (good response, weak response and no response). The eABR results will then be correlated to speech understanding with cochlear implants measured with Freiburger monosyllables test.
