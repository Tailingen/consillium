CAR19BCMA CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of R/R Plasma Cell Neoplasms
This is a single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19/BCMA positive plasma cell neoplasms.
Relapsed or Refractory Plasma Cell Neoplasms
GENETIC: CAR19BCMA-T cells|DRUG: fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
According to the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) to evaluate the safetyof CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+BCMA+plasma cell neoplasms., Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) Description: Number and severity of adverse events graded according to CTCAE v5.0, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) graded by ASTCT criteria and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) graded by ASBMT criteria, up to 3 years|According to the determine the Maximal Tolerable Dose(MTD) to evaluate the safety of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+BCMA+ plasma cell neoplasms., MTD will be determined based on DLTs observed during the first 28 days of study treatment
According to the objective response rate (ORR) to evaluate the efficacy of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory CD19+BCMA+ plasma cell neoplasms., Overall response rate (ORR) Description: Multiple myeloma (plasma cell neoplasms, plasma cell leukemia) refers to the efficacy evaluation criteria in the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Myeloma (revised in 2024),ORR includes strictly defined proportions of complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), and minimal response (MR)., Within 3 months following infusion of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells
According to the pharmacokinetics (number of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood was measured to evaluate the persistence of CAR-T cells) to explore the kinetics and clonal evolution of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cells., Up to 12 months after CAR-T treatment
This study is an exploratory clinical trial of a single-arm, open, single-center treatment of CAR19BCMA CAR-T cell. 20 subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19/ BCMA positive positive plasma cell neoplasms will be enrolled and received CAR19BCMA CAR T cells injection therapy, and related data such as adverse reactions and therapeutic effects after medication were followed up. To evaluate its safety and efficacy.
