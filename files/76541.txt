Clinical Trial of TQB2928 in Combination With a Third-Generation Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers
This is a Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TQB2928 in combination with third-generation EGFR TKIs in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2CD).
