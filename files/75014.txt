LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
