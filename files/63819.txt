Predictors of Malnutrition in Patients With Haematological Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to conduct an exploratory study of which predictors are most significant for LBM loss in patients with lymphoma. Patients are measured by weight and bio impedance and furthermore, their physical activity, nutritional status, diet and quality of life during the course are estimated. This is done in order to determine any changes in the aforementioned factors during the course of the cancer treatment that may have a bearing on the loss of LBM.

It was assessed by the National Ethics Committee that the experiment was not subject to notification, cf. section 14 (1) of the Committee Act. 2. The project has been approved by the Ethical Research Committee for SUND and SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen.. The project was also approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency at Region Zealand with case no .: REG-166-2020. A data processor agreement was established between Region Zealand and thesis students.

Data is presented as mean +/- SD. Continuous data are analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis presented by correlation coefficient r and a p-value. Pearson correlation analysis is used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between normally distributed variables. A significance level of 5% is used.

Binary values are assigned for data assessing secondary endpoints. Subsequently, a multiple linear regression analysis is performed to examine the influence of discrete variables on the primary endpoint.

For statistical analysis and design of plots, the programs, R Studio (version 1.4.1106) and Excel (version 16.43) is used.
