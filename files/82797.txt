Antiminor Histocompatibility Complex (MiHA) T Cells for Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies Following Matched HSCT (Guided Lymphocyte Immunopeptide Derived Expansion)
This study will evaluate the safety of infusing an anti-MiHA T cell line in patients suffering from an hematologic malignancy that has relapsed following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched donor.

The GLIDE-201/44 trial primarily aims to test the safety of anti-MiHA T cell line in patients suffering from an hematologic malignancy that has relapsed following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched donor. The anti-MiHA T cell lines are derived from the matched donor for the patient, the original donor for a given patient. Both the patient and the matched donor will undergo screening to determine the expression of targetable MiHAs. Upon identification of the target MiHAs, donor cells will be collected through apheresis and primed against the selected MiHA. In this setting, the GLIDE 201/44 product will be cryopreserved, thawed and administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 4x10E+07 viable T cells/m2 (range of dose is 0.4 4x10E+07 viable T cells/m2). A second infusion can be offered to the patients after an observation period of 42 days upon clinical evaluation by the treating physician. In the absence of secondary adverse events following the initial infusion, a second infusion of the GLIDE 201/44 product could be administered at a dose level up to 3-5 fold the original dose.
