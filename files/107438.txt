Safety and Efficacy of LCL161 in Patients With Solid Tumors
The study will evaluate the safety of increasing doses of oral LCL161 in patients with solid tumors. It is primarily designed to evaluate the side effects and find the maximum tolerated dose of LCL161.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: LCL161
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities, Cycle 1
Frequency and type of adverse events, throughout the study|Comparison of amount of LCL161 that gets into blood stream from tablet formulation versus liquid formulation (bioavailability), 3 months|Blood assessments to determine how much LCL161 gets into the blood stream (pharmacokinetic parameters), 4 weeks|Pharmacodynamic measurements to determine how LCL161 interacts with proteins related to cancer such as cIAP, cytokines, and cell death markers; hair, skin and tumor samples will be evaluated for target inhibition, Intermittent throughout treatment period|Solid tumor response criteria will be used to identify any anti-tumor activity, After a minimum of 2 cycles
