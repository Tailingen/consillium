METASARC: Patterns of Care and Outcomes in METAstatic Soft Tissue SARComa
Well-designed observational studies of individuals with rare tumors are needed to improve patient care, clinical investigations, and the education of healthcare professionals.

The patterns of care, outcomes, and prognostic factors of a cohort of 2225 patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2013 and documented in the prospectively maintained database of the French Sarcoma Group will be analyzed with a focus on : number/frequency of systemic treatments per patient, number/frequency of patients with locoregional treatment of the metastasis, number/frequency of patients with chemotherapy, number/frequency of patients with an off-label drug.

Outcome (time-to-next treatment \[TNT\] and overall survival \[OS\]) will be reported according to histological subtype, as well as the association between TNT and OS.

Prognostic factors of OS will be investigated.

Correlation Between Time to Next Treatment (TNT) and Overall Survival (OS) Under First-line Treatment, TNT: time from the systemic treatment onset to the next treatment or death due to any cause, whichever came first.

OS: time from the systemic treatment onset to death, 2 years
