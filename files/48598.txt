A Phase 1 Study of Orca-Q in Recipients Undergoing Allogeneic Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of engineered donor grafts ("OrcaGraft"/"Orca-Q") in participants undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant transplantation for hematologic malignancies.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia|Myelofibrosis|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: OrcaGraft (Orca-Q)
Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Safety and tolerability of Orca-Q (formerly OrcaGraft) in adults undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (MA-alloHCT) will be evaluated by identification of the following dose limiting toxicities: Grade ≥ 3 infusion-related reaction or cytokine release syndrome, Grade ≥ 3 acute GVHD, Any Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related non-hematologic event not clearly related to the underlying malignancy, intercurrent infection, the HCT conditioning regimen, or other pre-existing medical condition, and by instance of primary graft failure, defined as being alive without recovery of neutrophils during the evaluation period, 28 Days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Primary Graft failure through Day +28 (dose expansion), Primary graft failure in the dose expansion phase, defined as being alive without recovery of neutrophils during the evaluation period, 28 Days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft
Neutrophil Engraftment through Day +28, Neutrophil engraftment defined as an absolute neutrophil count of \>/=500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days, 28 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Platelet engraftment through Day +50, Platelet engraftment is defined as achieving a platelet count \> 20,000/mm3 for 3 consecutive days without platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days, by Day +50, 50 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Secondary graft failure through Day +100, Secondary graft failure is defined as neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil counts \< 500 cells/μL, unresponsive to growth factor therapy, by Day +100, 100 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) through the safety reporting period, TEAEs categorized by System Organ Lass and graded according to the CTCAE v5.0, 100 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Acute GVHD through Day +100, Acute GVHD will be staged and graded per Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) Standardization criteria, 100 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Steroid-refractory acute GVHD through Day +100, Steroid-refractory acute GVHD will be defined as per the EBMT-NIH-CIBMTR Task Force position statement, 100 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Chronic GVHD through Day +365, Chronic GVHD will be diagnosed per 2014 International NIH Chronic GVHD Diagnosis and Staging Consensus Working Group criteria, 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) through Day +365, PTLD is defined as a biopsy consistent with the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of PTLD, 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) through Day +365, NRM is defined as death without evidence of disease recurrence, 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Incidence of disease relapse through Day +365, Recurrence of primary disease for transplant, 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) through Day +365, Survival free from GVHD and relapse, 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Disease-free survival (DFS) through Day +365, Disease-free survival is the time from date of transplant to death or relapse, whichever comes first., 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft|Overall survival through Day +365, OS is defined as the time from the date of transplant to the date of death from any cause or, for surviving patients, to the date of last follow-up., 365 days after administration of Orca-Q/OrcaGraft
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of engineered donor grafts ("OrcaGraft"/"Orca-Q") in participants undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant transplantation for hematologic malignancies.
