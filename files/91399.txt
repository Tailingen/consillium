Glioma Developmental and HyperActive Ras Tumor (DHART) Board
This study will collect medical records, scan results, and complete surveys to create a registry about people with a neurofibromatosis type 1-associated brain tumor (NF1-associated glioma). A registry is a collection of health information about individuals, and it is usually focused on a specific diagnosis or condition.

This registry study will help the researchers learn more about the diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life of people with NF1-associated glioma. The researchers want to understand what happens as a result of different treatments for NF1-associated glioma and how these treatments and the disease itself affect people's lives over a period of time. Information collected during this study could affect how doctors diagnose, test, and treat NF1-associated glioma, and the study could help future patients with this type of cancer.
