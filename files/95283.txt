A Phase III Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of First-Line Treatment With HLX10 + Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of HLX10(Recombinant Anti-PD-1 Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Injection) plus chemotherapy compared to the efficacy and safety of placebo plus chemotherapy in the treatment of adult women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. Chemotherapy regimens include: paclitaxel plus cisplatin and paclitaxel plus carboplatin.

The primary study hypotheses are that the combination of HLX10 plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy with respect to: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by the IRRC or, 2) Overall Survival (OS).
