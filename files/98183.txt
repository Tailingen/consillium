A Study of ILB2109 and Toripalimab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/IIa study. The first part of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ILB2109 and Toripalimab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. The second part of the study will evaluate the efficacy of ILB2109 and Toripalimab in patients with selected advanced solid malignancies.

This is a two-part study consists of dose escalation and expansion in selected indications. The dose escalation part adopts a 3+3 protocol design and consists of 2 cohorts. Based on the data obtained from the escalation study, selected dose cohort will be expanded in 10 tumor types to further investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy. Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy outcomes at pre-specified time points.
