BEHAVIORAL: Culturally Tailored Digital Resilience-Building
Usability, Use the System Usability Scale (range: 0-100) to assess the usability of the intervention. Higher scores indicate greater perceived usability by users., Immediately at the end of the think-aloud interview
Acceptability, Use the Acceptability E-scale to assess the acceptability of the intervention. Scale total scores range from 6 to 30, and higher scores indicate greater acceptance for the proposed intervention., Immediately at the end of the think-aloud interview
Advance care planning (ACP) is a process to facilitate decision-making for future care and document values and preferences. However, the advance directive completion rates in East Asian Americans are low, which may extend to disparities in end-of-life care, including rates of hospice use and prevalence of unwanted aggressive treatments. To address this, this study uses information technology to develop a culturally tailored digital resilience-building intervention with and for East Asian immigrants to help them engage in ACP discussions. There are two aims of this study: (1) Conduct semi-structured interviews with a total of 30 religious leaders to identify the barriers and facilitators associated with discussing ACP and death-related topics with immigrants from China/Taiwan, Japan, and Korea and (2) Develop a culturally tailored digital resilience-building intervention using think-aloud interviews with 27 pairs of East Asian immigrants with cancer and their family caregivers (9 pairs each for immigrants from China/Taiwan, Japan, and Korea).
