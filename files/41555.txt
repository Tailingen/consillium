Apatinib Combined With Chemotherapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer After the Failure of Standard Treatment
We conduct the clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with chemotherapy in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.

Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma in China. Treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor. New treatments were needed. Apatinib, which was approved by CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It competes with intracellular VEGFR-2's ATP binding sites highly and selectively, thereby blocking downstream signaling to achieve the goal of inhibiting neovascularization in tumor tissue. We have observed in clinical practice that some patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have benefited from the treatment of apatinib. So we conduct a phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with chemotherapy (platinum and fluorouracil) in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.
