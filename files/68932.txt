Surgery Impact on Circulating Tumor DNA in Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth cause of death by cancer in western countries. The only curative treatment is surgery but this one is possible only in 10 to 15 % of cases. To date, there are few biomarkers in circulating blood as prognostic or diagnostic markers in pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if the pancreatic tumor mobilization during its resection impacts the quantity of circulating tumor DNA in peripheral and portal blood.
Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
OTHER: Blood samples
Kinetic of circulating tumor DNA evaluation in resected pancreatic cancer., To analyse circulating tumor DNA rate in the portal vein and in peripheral blood at various times of pancreatic cancer resection. Kinetic to 1 day before surgery, during surgery and after surgery (1 day, 10days , one month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after surgery), Kinetic up to one year
Overall survival, to analyse correlation between circulating tumor DNA rate and overall survival and survival without recurrence. Kinetic to 1 day before surgery, during surgery and after surgery (1 day, one month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after surgery), Kinetic up to one year|Correlation between circulating tumor DNA rate and Ca19.9 dosage, to analyse correlation between circulating tumor DNA and Ca19.9 rate after dosage of C19.9. Kinetic to 1 day before surgery, and after surgery (on day, one month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after surgery), Kinetic up to one year
The investigators will analyze if the tumor mobilization increases circulating DNA rate in peripheral and portal blood. Moreover, circulating tumor DNA will be measured during 12 months after surgery in peripheral blood. They will use a gene mutation detection technique called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) which is more specific than a simple Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
