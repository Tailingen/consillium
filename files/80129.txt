Hematological toxicities:

* Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased lasting \>7 days
* Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia
* Grade ≥3 platelet count decreased with clinically significant hemorrhage.

BL-B01D1-LUNG-101 is a global, multi-center, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics , and initial efficacy of BL-B01D1 in participants with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC and Other Solid Tumors.

This study will be conducted in two different dosing schedules (Cohort A and Cohort B) and three parts (dose escalation, dose finding and dose expansion). Cohort A will be dosed on Day 1 and Day 8 of a continuous 21-day treatment cycle. Cohort B will be dosed on Day 1 of a continuous 21-day treatment cycle. Each Cohort has different dose groups.
