Primary Excision Combined With Preoperative Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy for Oligometastasis of Urothelial Carcinoma
treatment of primary focal resection plus lymph node dissection combined with chemotherapy and anti-programmed cell death 1(PD-1) for Oligometastasis of urothelial carcinoma.
Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: primary focal resection plus lymph node dissection|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine plus cisplatin
1 year overall survival(OS) rate, the percentage of patients who die of any cause within first year of treatment, 1 year
progression-free survival(PFS), time between the first objective recording of PD(progressive disease) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) from random group solstice, through study completion, an average of 1 year
The study is designed to demonstrate that Whether the perioperative comprehensive treatment of primary focal resection plus lymph node dissection combined with chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 can prolong the overall survival of patients, narrow the range of metastatic lesions and improve the quality of life of patients.

Compared with patients with extensive metastasis, 2-year tumor-specific survival and overall survival of patients with oligometastatic bladder cancer were significantly increased (53.3% vs 16.1%)；(51.9% vs. 15.4%).Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) regimen has been shown to bring clinical benefits in neoadjuvant therapy of metastatic UC（urothelial carcinoma）.

PD-1 inhibitors have been widely used in urothelial carcinoma in recent years, and positive data have been obtained in both advanced patients and neoadjuvant patients.

If successful in this trial, it will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient who have oligometastasis of urothelial carcinoma.
