Photodynamic Therapy With Metil 5-aminolevulinate for Actinic Cheilitis - Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Brazil is a tropical country, with high incidence of ultraviolet radiation throughout the year. Many Europeans migrated to Brazil escaping either war or economic crisis to live in the country searching for opportunities. Low phototype combined with high incidence of UV light is a combination that not only affect the skin but also the lips. The current study was designed to use photodynamic therapy with metil 5-aminolevulinate for actinic cheilitis in a phase 2 clinical trial.
