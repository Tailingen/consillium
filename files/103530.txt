Augsburg Longitudinal Plasma Study for the Evaluation of Liquid Biopsy as Diagnostic Tool.
A prospective observational trial of patients with metastatic cancer of various entities which aims at both clarifying the significance of liquid biopsy and establishing a foundation for translational research.

ALPS is a prospective observational trial to assess liquid biopsy as diagnostic tool in patients with various metastatic neoplasms. Liquid biopsy will be correlated not only with the tissue biopsy, but also to imaging modalities and classical tumor markers. In addition, the study aims to investigate clonal heterogeneity and evolution of different cancers during patient treatment courses. A third aspect of the study is to survey and assess patients' knowledge about biomarkers and personalized medicine in general and about liquid biopsy as a new diagnostic tool.
