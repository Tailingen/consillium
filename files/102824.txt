A Phase II Study of Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide and Vindesine With Valproic Acid in Patients With Refractory or Relapsing Small Cell Lung Cancer After Platinum Derivatives and Etoposide
The primary aim of this study is to determine if the addition of valproic acid to a combination of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vindesine could increase progression-free survival in patients relapsing after first-line chemotherapy including platinum derivatives, cisplatin or carboplatin, and etoposide.
