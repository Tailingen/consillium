An Image-guided SBRT for Adrenal Gland Metastasis in Oligometastatic Patients
The study is designed to to assess the efficacy of ablative SBRT delivered with VMAT technique in oligometastatic patients affected by adrenal gland metastases.
Adrenal Gland Metastases
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Control of local disease, Evaluation of proportion of patients free from progression from starting radiotherapy according to CTCAE v4.03, 5 years
Incidence of acute and late complications, Evaluation of early and late post treatment complications, 5 years|Endocrine mechanisms of hormonal production, Assessment acute and late toxicity in terms of maintenance of endocrine mechanisms of hormonal production according to CTCAE v4.03, 5 years
This is a phase II, single arm, trial for testing efficacy of ablative high hypofractionated dose delivered with VMAT technique in oligometastatic patients with adrenal gland metastases. The potential advantages of this approach include the possibility to lead an increased local control in irradiated adrenal gland metastases. Other purpose of this study is to assess acute and late toxicity in terms of maintenance of endocrine mechanisms of hormonal production.
