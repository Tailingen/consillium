The Dosing Regimen of Pyrotinib in HER2-positive Advanced First-line Breast Cancer: a Phase II Clinical Study
Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pyrotinib in the transition from low-dose to normal-dose regimen for HER2-positive advanced first-line breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib dose escalation|DRUG: Pyrotinib dose normal
Incidence of 2 cycles ≥ grade 3 diarrhea, Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent diarrhea incidence at the end of the first 2 cycles（each cycle is 28 days） according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) v5.0., From the date of enrollment to 2 cycles（each cycle is 28 days） of the treatment
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events include abnormal liver function, myelosuppression and so on., through study completion, an average of 1 year(From the date of enrollment to 30 days after the last dose)|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression as per local review and according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Patient report outcome, The rating is evaluated by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale. It contains questions in five dimensions, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 for each question, with higher scores generally indicating a better quality of life, through study completion, an average of 1 year(From the date of enrollment to the clinical outcome from patients' report)
This study is planned to include 102 patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer meeting the admission criteria between 2023-12-01 and 2024-11-01. Statistical software will be used by the randomization officers for 1:1 allocation to pyrotinib dose increasing trial group and normal pyrotinib dose control group .

The primary endpoint of this study was grade ≥3 treatment-emergent diarrhea incidence during the first 2 cycles according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, and secondary endpoints were adverse effects of pyrotinib during the study, efficacy (progression-free survival and overall survival), and patient-reported outcome.
