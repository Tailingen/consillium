OTL38 for Intra-operative Imaging of Folate Receptor Positive Ovarian Cancer
This is a phase 3, randomized, multi-center, single dose, open label, pivotal study in patients diagnosed with, or with high clinical suspicion of, ovarian cancer scheduled to undergo primary surgical cytoreduction, interval debulking, or recurrent ovarian cancer surgery.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: OTL38|DEVICE: near infrared camera imaging system|PROCEDURE: laparotomy
Efficacy Patient Level, Percentage of patients with at least one evaluable FR+ ovarian cancer lesion confirmed by central pathology (Standard of truth) that was detected using the combination of OTL38 and fluorescent light but not under normal light or palpation (Full Analysis Set), 30 days
Patient False Positive Rate, False Positive Rate at the patient level (FPRp) will be a major secondary efficacy endpoint and is defined as the percentage of women who underwent both normal light and fluorescent light (Intent-to-Image Set), 30 days
The Phase 3 study is to confirm the efficacy of OTL38 in combination with fluorescent light to detect additional Folate Receptor-positive (FR+) ovarian cancer lesions not detected by palpation and visualization under normal light in patients with FR+ ovarian cancer scheduled to undergo primary surgical cytoreduction, interval debulking, or recurrent ovarian cancer surgery
