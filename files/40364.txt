Intervention, Prognosis and Mechanism of Covid-19 Infection in Patients With Underlying Diseases
The goal of this observational study is to explore the influence of Covid-19 infection and risk factors of severe outcomes in vulnerable population including patients with chronic liver disease, malignant tumor, autoimmune disease, medical staff.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. The clinical characteristics of vulnerable population after Covid-19 infection.
2. Risk factors for severe illness in vulnerable groups after infection with the Covid-19.
3. The impact of Covid-19 infection on the progression of underlying diseases.

Information of participants will be collected such as gender, age, underlying diseases, medication status, vaccination status, clinical and biochemical indicators.

Researchers will compare the mild and severe outcomes after Covid-19 infection to identify the "truly vulnerable" population and explore the potential mechanism and intervention for these population.
