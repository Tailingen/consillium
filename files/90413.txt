Comparison of Efficacy and Frequency of Adverse Events of 1st Line Palliative Chemotherapy EOX and mDCF Regimens in Advanced HER2-negative Gastric Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to compare efficacy and safety of palliative chemotherapy EOX and mDCF regimens in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced HER2-negative gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
HER2 Negative Gastric Cancer
OTHER: EOX|OTHER: mDCF
Overall Survival, time from randomization until death from any cause, 3 years
Progression-free Survival, time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause, 3 years|Safety as assessed by adverse events according to CTCAE v4.0, occurrence of adverse events according to CTCAE v4.0, 3 years
The main purposes: to determine the overall survival (OS) of patients who have locally advanced inoperable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma treated with first-line EOX (epirubicin + oxaliplatin + capecitabine) or mDCF (docetaxel + cisplatin + leucovorin + 5fluorouracil) palliative chemotherapy regimens

The secondary purposes: to determine safety (as assessed by adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0) and the progression-free survival (PFS)
