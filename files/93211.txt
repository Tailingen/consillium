Study of AMG 160 in Subjects With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 160 and to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|NSCLC
DRUG: AMG 160
Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT were defined as any adverse event (AE) with an onset within first 28 days following first dose of AMG 160 meeting pre-specified criteria unless clearly attributable to causes other than AMG 160 treatment., Day 1 to Day 28|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Treatment-emergent AE (TEAE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. A TEAE is any AE that occurred on or after first dose of study treatment up to 30 days after the last dose or End of Study date or start of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier. A treatment-related TEAE is any TEAE that, per investigator review, has a reasonable possibility of being caused by the study treatment.

Any abnormal vital signs measurement or clinical laboratory test result, including those that worsened from Baseline, that were considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator were reported as an AE., Median (min, max) time from first dose to 30 days after the last dose, end of study or start of new anti-cancer therapy; whichever is earlier, was 66 (52, 100) days
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ORR per modified RECIST v1.1 was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on investigator assessment.

* CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.
* PR: Decrease of 30% or greater in tumor burden compared with baseline.

CR/PR must have been confirmed at least 4 weeks later.

Exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of study Day 1 until death due to any cause. OS time (months) = (date of death - study Day 1 + 1) x 12/365.25.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and percentiles were using Greenwood's formula to estimate the standard error of the landmark estimates using the method by Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Radiographic PFS per modified RECIST v1.1 was defined as the interval from study Day 1 to the earlier of a radiographic progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, based on investigator assessment; otherwise, radiographic PFS was censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment date.

- PD: Increase of 20% or greater in tumor burden compared with nadir and at least 5 mm absolute increase, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the presence of new lesions.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and quartiles were estimated using the method by Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Clinical PFS Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Clinical PFS per modified RECIST v1.1 was defined as the interval from study Day 1 to the earlier of a clinical PD or death from any cause, based on investigator assessment; otherwise, clinical PFS was censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment date.

- PD: Increase of 20% or greater in tumor burden compared with nadir and at least 5 mm absolute increase, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the presence of new lesions.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and quartiles were estimated using the method by Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Time to Response Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Time to response per modified RECIST v1.1 was defined as the interval from study Day 1 to the either CR or PR based on investigator assessment.

* CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.
* PR: Decrease of 30% or greater in tumor burden compared with baseline.

CR/PR must have been confirmed at least 4 weeks later., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Time to Progression Per Modified RECIST v1.1, Time to progression per modified RECIST v1.1 was defined as the interval from study Day 1 to PD, based on investigator assessment. Time to progression was censored at the last evaluable post-baseline tumor assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy; otherwise at study Day 1.

- PD: Increase of 20% or greater in tumor burden compared with nadir and at least 5 mm absolute increase, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the presence of new lesions.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and quartiles were estimated using the method by Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Time to Clinical Progression, Time to clinical progression was defined as the interval from study Day 1 to PD. Time to clinical progression was censored at the last evaluable post-baseline tumor assessment prior to subsequent anti-cancer therapy; otherwise at study Day 1.

- PD: Increase of 20% or greater in tumor burden compared with nadir and at least 5 mm absolute increase, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the presence of new lesions.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and quartiles were estimated using the method by Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Modified RECIST v1.1, DOR was defined as the time from the date of an initial objective response per modified RECIST v1.1 to the earlier of soft-tissue progression or death based on investigator assessment.

* CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.
* PR: Decrease of 30% or greater in tumor burden compared with baseline.

CR/PR must have been confirmed at least 4 weeks later. Participants who had not ended their response at the time of analysis had DOR censored at their last evaluable tumor assessment by CT/MRI scan., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days|Time to Subsequent Therapy, Time to subsequent therapy was defined as the time from study Day 1 to the time a participant started/received the subsequent cancer therapy/subsequent therapy; otherwise time to subsequent therapy was censored at the last known date of any of the study assessment prior to initiating the subsequent cancer therapy/subsequent therapy.

Subsequent therapy was defined any anti-cancer therapies intended to treat NSCLC, or any other anti-cancer therapies started after ending study treatment and prior to End of Study.

Medians and quartiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs for medians and quartiles were estimated using the method by Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Median (min, max) time from first dose to end of study was 100 (94, 122) days
