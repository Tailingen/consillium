Pilot Study of Short-Course Preoperative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a short-course of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) prior to surgical resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is feasible and well-tolerated.
Pancreatic Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Preoperative SBRT
Incidence of grade 2 or greater toxicity, Number of incidence of grade 2 or greater toxicity, 2 years
Number of Participants with no further growth of cancer at original site (Local control), Count subjects with no further growth of cancer at original site., 2 years|Count subjects with Recurrence of cancer in other body sites, Compare recurrence locations of treated patients relative to historical controls., 2 years|Time to Progression of pancreatic cancer, Duration of progression free survival of treated patients, 4 years|Time to death, Measure duration of survival of treated patients., 4 years
This will be a Phase 2, single center, prospective, single arm feasibility study of the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the preoperative treatment of surgically resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
