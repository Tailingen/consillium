Clinical Efficacy of Tumour Treatment Vaccine (TTV) Combined With PD-1 in the Treatment of Relapsed Refractory Advanced Solid Tumours
This study is intended to investigate the clinical efficacy of TTV vaccine combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in the treatment of relapsed and refractory advanced solid tumours from a clinical perspective.
Cancer|PD-L1 Gene Mutation
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor Treatment Vaccine; PD-1/L1 inhibitors
Relief degree of tumors, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST1.1）, immediately after the last treatment
The innovative invention of Tumour Treatment Vaccine (TTV) has been verified in previous studies that the TTV vaccine can play a good role in enhancing the anti-tumour effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and the tumour suppression rate of combined anti-PD-1 inhibitor reaches 75.96%. Therefore, this study is intended to investigate the clinical efficacy of TTV vaccine combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in the treatment of relapsed and refractory advanced solid tumours from a clinical perspective.
