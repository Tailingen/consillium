Genomic Study in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Brain Metastasis
The investigators collected the data from the investigators' center between January 2011 and October 2020. The study included all non-small cell lung cancer patients with surgically excised brain metastasis. The investigators analysis the correlation of gene mutation and the disease course.
NSCLC Stage IV|Brain Metastases
PROCEDURE: craniectomy
postoperative survival, From date of craniectomy until the date of patient deceased or date of last followed medical record, with median follow up around to 20 months
The investigators collected the data from from the investigators' center between January 2011 and October 2020. The study included all non-small cell lung cancer patients with surgically excised brain metastasis. The investigators analysis the correlation of gene mutation and the disease course. The investigators use Kaplan-Meier regression to analyze the overall survival, and the difference between the groups was calculated using log rank test. Cox proportional hazards method was used to create the regression model and estimate the hazard ratios.
