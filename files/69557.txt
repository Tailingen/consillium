Tipifarnib and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth and may make them more sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving tipifarnib together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: tipifarnib|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxic effects of tipifarnib when administered with radiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the 3-month clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

Patients receive oral tipifarnib once or twice daily on weeks 1-8. Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 2-8.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15 months.
