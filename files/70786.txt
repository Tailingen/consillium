Prognostic Significance of Lymph Node Ratio in Rectal Cancer on Overall Survival
This study was conducted to compare the significance of lymph node ratio and absolute count of positive lymph node count on overall survival in patients with rectal cancer who underwent resection with curative intent
Cancer, Rectum
OTHER: Surgical resection for cancer rectum
Overall Survival, Survival was calculated for each patient based on time of surgery to time of death., up to 10 years (From date of surgery to the date date of death)
Retrospective cohort study carried on 229 patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer, admitted in tertiary hospitals along 10 years, between 2012 to 2022, and underwent radical resection surgery with curative intent.

Exclusion criteria included patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, multiple synchronous or metachronous rectal cancers, early post-operative recurrence or death within 3 months. Demographic, histopathological, follow up and outcome data were collected.

Demographics included age, gender, family history, and chief complaint at presentation. Histopathological data included tumor site, grade, vascular-perineural invasion, total number of lymph nodes removed, and positive lymph nodes.

Lymph node ratio was defined as the ratio of positive lymph nodes to the total number of retrieved lymph nodes in histopathology specimen. Survival was calculated for each patient based on time of surgery to time of death

Statistical analysis will be used to evaluate the effect of lymph node ratio on overall survival.
