Prospective observational cohort study.

Little is known about end of life care (EOL) in patients with ovarian or other gynaecological cancers. Patients typically have a high symptom burden and following several prior lines of therapy or the development of platinum resistant disease response rates to further active treatment are limited. Eliciting patients' values and preferences for end-of-life care and shared decision-making are central elements of patient-centered EOL care. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of collecting data on patient satisfaction towards end of life. Preliminary data on patient and carer satisfaction with care, the importance of aspects of care, as well as end of life treatment will also be collected. The study will also assess the carer satisfaction with care during bereavement and with the patient's dying experience.

The study will recruit beyond the targeted number of 73 patients number if the study is progressing favourably. Ideally, each patient will nominate a carer to also complete questionnaires and the carer will be able to assist in completing the diary, although this is not mandatory.
