Comparison of Outcomes Between Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition
Short-term outcomes of parenteral and enteral nutrition for patients unable to eat normally were compared and analyzed.
Deglutition Disorders
DEVICE: Parenteral nutrition|DEVICE: Enteral nutrition
Mortality Calculated From Outcome Section From DPC Database at 90 Days, 90 days after the start of the procedure
Post-procedural Pneumonia, the incidence of post-procedural pneumonia occurring during hospitalization. Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected median of 3 weeks after procedure.|Post-procedural Sepsis, the incidence of post-procedural sepsis occurring during hospitalization. Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected median of 3 weeks after procedure.|Re-admission 30 Days, re-admission within 30 days of discharge.|Mortality Calculated From Outcome Section From DPC Database at 14 Days, 14 days after the start of the procedure|Mortality Calculated From Outcome Section From DPC Database at 30 Days, 30 days after the start of the procedure
Data were acquired from patients selected from a national inpatient database covering 1,057 hospitals in Japan. Participants had received artificial nutrition between April 2012 and March 2013, were 20 years or older, and did not have cancer. Participants were grouped into two groups: those receiving parenteral nutrition and those receiving enteral nutrition. The investigators performed one-to-one propensity-score matching between the groups. The primary outcome measurements were mortality rates at 30 and 90 days after the start of the procedure. The secondary outcomes were post-procedural complications, pneumonia, and sepsis. The investigators analyzed survival length of stay after the procedure using a Cox proportional hazards model.
