Solid Tumor|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: LGX818
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) for Solid Tumors as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, CBR for solid tumors was defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for greater than or equal to (\>=) 16 weeks. As per RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline., Up to 13.3 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) for Solid Tumors as Per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR for solid tumors was defined as the percentage of participants achieving an overall best response of CR or PR as assessed per RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as least a 30 % decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From the first dose study treatment until the first documented CR or PR (maximum up to 13.3 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for Solid Tumors as Per RECIST Version 1.1, PFS for solid tumors was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documented disease progression (PD) or relapse or death due to any cause within 30 days of the last dose. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. Participants who had no event were censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., From the date of first dose until the first documentation of PD, relapse, censored date or death, whichever occurred first (maximum up to 13.3 months)|Overall Survival (OS) for Solid Tumors, OS for solid tumors was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause. For participants who were alive at the time of analysis, the data was censored at the date of last contact., From date of the first dose until the date of death, censored date (maximum up to 13.3 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) for Solid Tumors as Per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR for solid tumors was defined as the time from the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented PD or relapse or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as least a 30 % decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., From first documentation of response to first documentation of PD or relapse or death (maximum up to 13.3 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Graded According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, severity was graded as Grade 1: asymptomatic/mild symptoms, clinical/diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local/noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated. TEAE was defined as event with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period. CTCAE Grade 5 (death) was not used in this study., Screening up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (maximum up to 13.3 months)|Change From Baseline in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in millimeter of mercury (mmHg) in sitting position was reported., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Change From Baseline in Sitting Pulse Rate, Change from baseline in pulse rate in beats per minute (bpm) in sitting position was reported., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Change From Baseline in Body Temperature, Change from baseline in body temperature in degree Celsius was reported., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Change From Baseline in Respiratory Rate, Change from baseline in respiratory rate in breaths per minute was reported., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Change From Baseline in Body Weight, Change from baseline in body weight in kilogram (Kg) was reported, Baseline, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Number of Participants With Shifts From Baseline in Hematology and Serum Chemistry Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with shifts from baseline in hematology and serum chemistry laboratory parameters, were graded and reported as low, normal and high as assessed by Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v4.03. 'Low' refers to participants with values that were below lower limit of normal with no observation above the upper limit of normal; 'High' refers to participants with values that were above the upper limit of normal with no observation below the lower limit of normal; 'Low and High' refers to participants with values that were below the lower limit of normal and values that were above the upper limit of normal., Baseline up to maximum of 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (up to 13.3 months)|Change From Baseline in QT Interval Corrected According to the Formula of Fridericia (QTcF), QT, QRS, and PR Duration, Change from baseline in QTcF, QT, QRS, and PR duration were reported. QT interval is the time from electrocardiogram Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole. QRS interval is the time from electrocardiogram Q wave to the end of the S wave, corresponding to ventricle depolarization. PR interval is the time between the beginning of the P wave and the start of the QRS interval, corresponding to the end of atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization., Baseline, Day 15 of Cycle 1, 2, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)|Change From Baseline in Heart Rate, Change from baseline in heart rate in terms of beats per minute was reported., Baseline, Day 15 of Cycle 1, 2, Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (each cycle of 28 days), and End of treatment (up to 7 days after study treatment discontinuation)
