Ivabradine to Prevent Anthracycline-induced Cardiotoxicity
Anthracyclines are associated with cardiotoxic effects. Previous studies suggest that enalapril, and or carvedilol, protect against cardiovascular effects of these drugs.

Ivabradine selectively reduces heart rate through inhibition of the cardiac pace maker IF channel, thus prolonging the duration of spontaneous depolarization in the sinus node. Additionally, ivabradine might preserve myocardial perfusion without negative inotropic effect and probably maintain cardiac contractility despite the reduction of heart rate.

Ivabradine has been shown to improve outcome in patients with heart failure and angina. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether ivabradine might prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.
