Efficacy of Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Poor-differentiated Early-stage Cervical Cancer
This study is aimed to enroll patients with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO 2018 IB1-IB2) who undergo radical hysterectomy and the postoperative pathology doesn't meet Sedlis criteria or the "four-factor" model but with poorly differentiated squamous/adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. The experimental group received 4 courses of paclitaxel and cisplatin (once every 3 weeks) for adjuvant chemotherapy within 4 weeks after surgery, while the control group don't not receive any adjuvant therapy but only received regular follow-up. The disease status of all patients will be evaluated within 4 weeks after the end of all treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter, including gynecological examination, laboratory indicators, imaging evaluation, and the prognosis of the two groups will be compared.
