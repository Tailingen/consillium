A Feasibility Study Using Four-Dimensional CT Imaging for Primary Lung Cancer
Eligible lung cancer patients: Undergo pre-treatment 4D-CT study for treatment planning

External Beam Radiation: standard fractionation (2Gy per day) or stereotactic body radiation therapy

Evaluation: Repeat 4D-CT study at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment

Primary objectives: To assess pre-treatment global and focal lung strain and correlate with changes post-treatment
Lung Cancer
RADIATION: 4D-CT pre-treatment scan
validate lung strain modeling using 4D-CT in a lung cancer patient population to correlate pre-treatment strain with post-treatment changes., The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess and quantify lung strain using 4D-CT treatment planning scans., Pre-treatment (baseline) up to 6 months post-treatment
correlate 4D-CT based lung strain modeling with standard lung function studies including pulmonary function tests and ventilation-perfusion scans., 4D-CT based lung strain modeling comparison with standard lung function, 2 years post treatment|correlate pre- and post-treatment strain with clinical toxicity, Toxicity correlation, Pre-treatment (baseline) to 2 years post treatment|correlate post-treatment strain with radiographic changes to the lung parenchyma, Lung parenchyma correlation, 2 years post-treatment
The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess and quantify lung strain using four dimensional CT (4D-CT) treatment planning scans. Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer will be planned using 4D-CT to assess lung and tumor motion. Standard radiation treatment plans will to delivered based on tumor stage. Patients will be reassessed both clinically and radiographically using 4D-CT imaging at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment. Following the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will be employed with clinical assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years post-treatment.
