ONC-392 and Pembrolizumab in Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
This is a study to test the safety and efficacy with the combination of a next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ONC-392, and anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients.
Ovarian Cancer|High Grade Serous Adenocarcinoma of Ovary|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: ONC-392|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess the efficacy of ONC-392 and pembrolizumab combination therapy in objective response rate per RECIST1.1., 24 months|Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAEs) and Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs), To assess the safety of ONC-392 and pembrolizumab combination therapy, 24 months
Duration of Response (DoR), To assess the efficacy of ONC-392 and pembrolizumab combination therapy measured by duration of response., 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To assess the efficacy of ONC-392 and pembrolizumab combination therapy measured by DCR., 24 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), To assess the efficacy of ONC-392 and pembrolizumab combination therapy measured by BOR., 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST., 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS as assessed from randomization to the time the subject expired., 24 months|Pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analysis, Drug concentration measurement in relation to safety and efficacy, 24 months
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to compare two doses of ONC-392 in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in participants with ovarian cancer who are resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy and have disease progression on line of therapy containing bevacizumab. Results from this study will be used to inform the study design, patient population, and dose selection for future studies in advanced ovarian cancer.
