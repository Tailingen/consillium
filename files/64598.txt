A Study of Fully Human BCMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor Autologous T Cell Injection (CT103A) in the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
It is a dose expansion, open-label, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicity of CT103A in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Fully human BCMA chimeric antigen receptor autologous T cell injection (CT103A)
Incidence and severity of adverse events, An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0, with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), CRS and ICANS will be evaluated according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus grading., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities, Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.
Overall response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a PR or better as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration from the date of CT103A infusion to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease or death due to any cause., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Overall survival (OS), Duration from the start of CT103A treatment to subject death (due to any cause)., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Duration of response (DOR), Duration from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Time to response (TTR), Time interval from the date of CT103A infusion to the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better), Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Time to complete response (TTCR), Time interval from the date of CT103A infusion to the date of initial documentation of a complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR)., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|MRD response assessment, The proportion of subjects achieved MRD-negativity., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|The duration of MRD-negativity, The duration of MRD-negativity is defined as the time interval between the first occurrence of negative MRD after infusion and the first reversal of negative MRD results to positive., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|CAR transgene level in peripheral blood., The CAR transgene level in peripheral blood both pre- and post- CT103A infusion will be measured and reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Soluble BCMA (sBCMA) in peripheral blood., The level of sBCMA in peripheral blood will be measured and reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.
CAR-positive cell counts in peripheral blood., CAR-positive cell counts in peripheral blood will be measured and reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Presence of human anti-CAR antibodies, The titer of confirmed positive anti-CAR antibodies in peripheral blood will be measured and reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.|Presence of RCL in peripheral blood., Presence of RCL in peripheral blood will be measured and reported., Up to 2 years after CT103A infusion.
A total of at least 12 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study. Each subject will proceed through the following study periods:

* Screening
* Leukapheresis
* Bridging therapy (at the discretion of the investigator)
* Pre-lymphodepletion assessment
* Lymphodepleting chemotherapy
* Pre-infusion Assessment
* CT103A infusion (Day 0)
* 28-Day safety evaluation period
* Post-treatment follow-up period (Day 29 through year 2)

All the subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy until disease progression, initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy, withdrawal, death, loss to follow-up, study completion, end of study, or study termination, whichever occurs first. Subjects except those that are deceased, lost to follow-up, or have withdrawn their ICF will enter the long-term follow-up (LTFU) under a separate protocol for at least 15 years.
