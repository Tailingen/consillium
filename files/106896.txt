Systemic Inflammation Response Index and C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
the goal of this observational study is Assesment of systemic inflammatory index (SII) , system inflammation response index (SIRI) and CRP Albumin ratio(CAR) as biomarkers for ALL prognosis.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) results from a clonal expansion of abnormal, immature lymphoid progenitors of B cell or T cell origin that invade bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, and extramedullary sites .

The incidence of ALL is highest among children aged 1-4 years and declines with age rising slightly after the age of 50. Several genetic alterations have been already found as drivers of ALL, uncovering the genetic heterogeneity of the disease.

It is the most common leukemia in the pediatric population, according for up to 80% of cases in this group vs. 20% of cases in adults. Treatment among adolscents and young adults is predominantly inspired by pediatric regimens with better survival rates .

Acute leukemia tends to present non-specifically, although the most common presenting features include fever, lethargy, and bleeding. Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and musculoskeletal symptoms (especially involving the spine and long bones) can also be clues to the diagnosis. Adults may also have more prominent anemia-related symptoms, such as shortness of breath, or symptoms related to thrombocytopenia, such as excessive bruising or increased bleeding tendency.
