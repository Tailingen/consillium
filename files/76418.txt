A Geriatric Assessment Electronic Platform for Older Patients With Cancer (eGAP - Electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform)
This project assesses the feasibility and usability of the geriatric assessment platform (electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform or eGAP in 50 older patients with cancer, their caregivers, and their oncology team. Using an iterative process, we will refine the eGAP based on input from stakeholders.

A geriatric assessment is a multidisciplinary diagnostic process that can detect medical, psychosocial and functional problems not identified by routine evaluation. This can subsequently guide management of the identified problems. However, the time and resources required to incorporate a geriatric assessment into clinic visits remain the primary barriers for implementation. There is a need to increase the adoption of the geriatric assessment among general oncologists and to address the associated resource limitations. Our long-term goal is to utilize an electronic platform to facilitate completion of the geriatric assessment. This project assesses the feasibility and usability of the geriatric assessment platform (electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform or eGAP) in 50 older patients with cancer, their caregivers, and oncology providers. Using an iterative process, we will refine the eGAP based on input from stakeholders (patients, caregivers, oncologists, nurses, advanced practitioners)
