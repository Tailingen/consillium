Neutron Radiation Therapy and Pembrolizumab in Treating Participants With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
This phase II trial studies how well neutron radiation therapy and pembrolizumab work in treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body. Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving radiation therapy and pembrolizumab may work better than radiation alone in treating participants with urothelial carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body.
Urothelial Carcinoma
OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Overall Response Rate Per Immune-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Overall response rate will be calculated as the percentage of patients achieving a partial response or complete response., Up to 1 year
Overall Survival, Final statistical analyses of OS will consist of Kaplan-Meier estimation., At 1 year|Progression-free Survival, Final statistical analyses of PFS will consist of Kaplan-Meier estimation., At 1 year
OUTLINE:

Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 22. On day 23, participants may undergo an optional tumor biopsy and receive 3-5 treatments of neutron radiation therapy over 2 weeks on days 23-42. Participants receive pembrolizumab IV on day 43 and continue per standard of care in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.
