Machine Learning Model Guided by TLS Predicts Survival and Immune Features in Gastric Cancer
This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning model that uses information from tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs)-specialized immune-related cell clusters found near tumors-to predict survival outcomes and immune characteristics in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. By analyzing clinical data, pathology, and imaging results, the model may help doctors better understand a patient's prognosis and personalize treatment strategies. The study will also explore how TLS-related immune patterns relate to the effectiveness of certain therapies, potentially offering new insights for immune-based treatment planning.
