A Study of NK012 in Patients With Advanced, Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced and metastatic triple negative breast cancer.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: NK012
Antitumor activity (overall response rate) of NK012, At baseline and after every 2 cycles; PR or CR must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the first response was recorded
Duration of response, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Rate and duration of disease control, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Time to disease progression, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Toxicity profile of NK012, Duration of study, and up to 30 days after discontinuation
This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter study of NK012 in patients with locally advanced non-resectable and metastatic breast cancer with ER-negative, PR negative and HER2-negative phenotype. NK012 will be administered by infusion over 30 minutes once every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle). Patients will be screened for UGT1A1 polymorphism prior to enrollment in order to determine their starting dose.
