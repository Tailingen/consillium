A Study of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin With or Without Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) in Previously Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine if participants with untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have a better outcome when treated with olaratumab in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin then when treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Olaratumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the day of randomization to the first evidence of progression by RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause. Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress and were subsequently lost to follow-up had their data censored at the day of their last tumor assessment. If there was no radiologic assessment at baseline or post baseline, participants were censored at the date of randomization. If death or progressive disease (PD) occurred after 2 or more consecutive missing radiographic visits, censoring occurred at the date of the last radiographic visit prior to the missed visits., Baseline to Measured PD or Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE), A summary of other nonserious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Baseline to Study Completion (Up to 43 Months)|Safety and Tolerability of Olaratumab Administered at a More Rapid Rate (25mg/Min With Minimum Infusion Time of 30 Minutes), Determined by Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events, Up to 43 Months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. If the participant is alive at the end of the follow-up period or is lost to follow-up, OS was censored on the last date the participants is known to be alive., Baseline to Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)|Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is equal to the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR), according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; PD was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria. Participants who had no post baseline tumor assessments were considered non-responders and included in the denominator when calculating response rate. Percentage of participants=(number of participants with CR+PR/total number of participants)\*100., Baseline to Measured PD or Study Discontinuation (Up to 31 Months)|Median Duration of Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for Complete Response (CR)/Partial Response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the criteria for PD are met (taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurement recorded since the treatment started), initiation of other/additional antitumor therapy is first reported, or death, is objectively documented., First Criteria Met for CR or PR to Measured PD Start of Other Antitumor Therapy or Death From Any Cause (Up to 31 Months)|Pharmacodynamics of Olaratumab, Pharmacodynamics of Olaratumab was determined by analysis of pharmacodynamic markers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)., Cycle 1: Days 1, 8, and 15 pre- and post-infusion of Olaratumab; Cycles 2-6: day 1 only, pre- and post-infusion of Olaratumab|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Olaratumab Antibodies, Participants with Treatment Emergent (TE) anti-olaratumab antibodies were participants with a 4-fold increase (2 dilutions) increase over a positive baseline antibody titer or for a negative baseline titer, a participant with an increase from the baseline to a level of 1:20., Baseline to Study Completion (Up to 8 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0-168 of Olaratumab, AUC(0-168) = area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 168 hours post dose., Cycle 3, Day 1: Predose, 30 minutes (min), 1.5 hours (hrs), 24,48,96,168 Hrs Post Dose|PK - Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Olaratumab, Cycle 3, Day 1: Predose, 30 min, 1.5 hrs, 24,48,96,168 Hrs Post Dose|PK - Half-Life (t1/2) of Olaratumab, Cycle 3, Day 1: Predose, 30 min, 1.5 hrs, 24,48,96,168 Hrs Post Dose|PK - Clearance (Cl) of Olaratumab, Cycle 3, Day 1: Predose, 30 min, 1.5 hr, 24,48,96,168 Hrs Post Dose|PK - Steady State Volume of Distribution (Vss) of Olaratumab, Cycle 3, Day 1: Predose, 30 min, 1.5 hrs, 24,48,96,168 Hrs Post Dose
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated participants with Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with olaratumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin in the first-line metastatic setting.
