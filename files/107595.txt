Intraperitoneal Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Zoledronic Acids for Gastric Cancer Malignant Ascites
This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneal injection of immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with zoledronic acid for the treatment of malignant ascites in gastric cancer.

This study is a phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneal injection of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with zoledronic acid in the treatment of malignant ascites in gastric cancer, which consists of two phases, firstly, the phase Ib safety study, which adopts the '3+3' drug-escalation experimental design, and after determining the safe and tolerable dose, it will proceed to the second part of the phase II efficacy study. The Phase II study was designed by Simon's two-stage approach to evaluate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with zoledronic acid in the treatment of malignant ascites in gastric cancer.
Cancer of Stomach, Adenocarcinoma|Ascites, Malignant
DRUG: zoledronic acid plus Sintilimab intraperitoneal injection
Rates of Adverse events according to CTCAE 5.0 in the Phase Ib stage, Adverse events were graded and recorded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. A general physical examination, measurement of vital signs, laboratory safety evaluation, and documentation of relevant adverse events were performed at each visit during the treatment period., 3 months after the last treatment|4-week objective response rate, Complete remission (CR): complete resolution of ascites and maintained for more than 4 weeks; complete disappearance of all target lesions; Partial remission (PR): the amount of CT-measured ascites decreased by more than 50% compared to pretreatment and the amount of ascites withdrawn again was less than 1/2 of the previous withdrawal and was maintained for more than 4 weeks; the sum of the diameters of all measurable target lesions was ≥30% below baseline; Objective Response Rate（ORR） = CR + PR, 4 weeks after last treatment
Rates of Adverse events according to CTCAE 5.0 in overall subjects, Adverse events were graded and recorded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. A general physical examination, measurement of vital signs, laboratory safety evaluation, and documentation of relevant adverse events were performed at each visit during the treatment period., 3 months after the last treatment|8-week objective response rate, 8 weeks after treatment|Time for ascites control, If PD was judged and ascites was not re-punctured and drained, the time of this follow-up visit was used as the time of ascites control; if the patient had undergone puncture and drainage prior to the follow-up visit due to intolerance of ascites symptoms, the time of re-puncture was used as the time of ascites control., 1 year|Immune cell changes, Immune cell changes in ascites, 4 weeks|Tumour markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA19-9, CA72-4, 8 weeks|Quality of Life Assessment, A quality of life score (QOL) for oncology patients was used. The quality of life score (QOL) of oncology patients contains 12 dimensions, including appetite, spirit, sleep, fatigue, pain, family understanding and cooperation, colleagues' understanding and cooperation (including leadership), own knowledge of cancer, attitude towards treatment, daily life, side effects of treatment, and facial expression, with the highest score of 5 and the lowest score of 1 for each dimension. Quality of life grading: Quality of life is scored out of 60, with 51-60 for good, 41-50 for better, 31-40 for average, 21-30 for poor, and \<20 for very poor quality of life., 1 year
