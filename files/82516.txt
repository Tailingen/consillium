emotional functions, symptoms of depression, first examination on admission|sleep functions, symptoms of insomnia, first examination on admission|heart rate, heart rate per minute, first examination on admission|heart rhythm, heart rhythm interpreting ECG (regular or irregular), first examination on admission|functions of arteries, carotid stenosis \[%\], first examination on admission|increased blood pressure, blood pressure value \[mm/Hg\], first examination on admission|functions related to the coagulation of blood., International Normalised Ratio (INR) testing, first examination on admission|Glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c \[%\], first examination on admission|lipid metabolism., LDL \[mg/dL\], first examination on admission
The original ICF assessment sheet contains CVD risk factor categories, such as comorbidities (depressive disorders, insomnia, heart rhythm and heart rate disorders, carotid artery disease, and hypertension), measures of liver and renal impairment, disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism). The evaluation criteria for each category were determined based on recommendations defined in the ESC, AHA, EFSD, and KIDIGO guidelines.
