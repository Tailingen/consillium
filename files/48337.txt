Orantinib In Combination With Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization In Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) for Orantinib in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus placebo in combination with TACE in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Orantinib (TSU-68)|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival(OS), The time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to three years after randomizationof the last patient
Time to Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Failure, Patients should not receive additional TACE therapy in this study after meeting any of the following conditions, at the Investigator's discretion.

1. The patient develops an intra-hepatic lesion that is uncontrolled by serial TACE
2. Deterioration in arterial pathways to treat HCC that makes additional TACE impossible
3. Severe vascular invasion occurs that makes additional TACE impossible
4. Extra hepatic spread considered relevant to life expectancy that requires another treatment modality for HCC
5. Liver function at grade Child-Pugh class C lasting for 28 days, The time from the date of enrollment to the date of event for TACE discontinuation, assessed up to three years after randomizationof the last patient
This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of Orantinib administered in combination with TACE in patients with unresectable HCC.

Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TACE given in combination with either Orantinib (200 mg orally, twice per day) or placebo.
