Phase I/II Clinical Trial of LBL-015 for Injection
A Multicenter, Open-label, Phase I/II Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of LBL-015 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors.
Advanced Malignant Tumor
DRUG: LBL-015 for Injections
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles. It was used to evaluate the tolerability., 28 days after the first dose.|Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. It was used to evaluate the safety., 28 days after the first dose
Cmax, Maximum serum concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Tmax, After taking a single dose, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Pharmacodynamic (PD) index, Evaluate the receptor occupancy of the drug, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy
This study is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, receptor occupancy, immunogenicity and efficacy of LBL-015 in patients with advanced malignant tumors.About 202 patients with advanced malignant tumor will be enrolled.

The study is divided into Phase I study stage (dose escalation/PK expansion stage) and Phase II study stage (indication expansion stage).

Patients with advanced or metastatic advanced malignant tumor who have failed previous standard treatment, are not suitable for standard treatment or have no standard treatment are included in the phase I study.

After obtaining the RP2D in Phase I study ,Phase II study stage (indication expansion stage) was initiated.
