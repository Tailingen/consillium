A Study for PD-1 Antibody JS001 in MSI-H Advanced or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer
To observe the efficacy of PD-1 antibody JS001 in the treatment of participants with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer, so as to provide sufficient evidence for MSI-H as a biomarker of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.
