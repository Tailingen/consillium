Reduction rate of hot flashes symptom score, Participants would complete self -report daily diary on which they record the number and severities (1 - 4 points) of hot flashes from baseline to week 5. Each symptom severities are multiplied by the numbers of symptoms to determine the daily hot flashes symptom score. The mean of daily hot flashes symptom score of one week is calculated and regared as a hot flashes symptom score for the week. The efficacy of Desvenlafaxine is assessed by comparing the reduction rate of weekly hot flashes symptom score (= hot flashes symptom score at week 5 - hot flashes symptom score at baseline / hot flashes symptom score of baseline) for each group., From baseline to Week 5 (Intervention is started from Week 1)
