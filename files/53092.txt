A Study of an FGFR2/3 Inhibitor (CGT4859) in Patients With Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug), pharmacodynamic (what the drug does to the body), and antitumor activity of CGT4859 in adult participants with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) or other advanced solid tumors with FGFR2 and/or FGFR3 genetic alternations.

DRUG: CGT4859
Phase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of CGT4859 - AEs, Incidence, severity, and seriousness or treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) leading to dose modification, Approximately 12 months|Phase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of CGT4859 - Laboratory results, Clinically significant changes or abnormalities observed from baseline in laboratory results in chemistry, hematology, and coagulation parameters, Approximately 12 months|Phase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of CGT4859 - ECG results, Clinically significant changes or abnormalities observed from baseline in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, Approximately 12 months|Phase 2: Evaluate antitumor activity of CGT4859 - Objective Response Rate (ORR), Approximately 8 months
Phase 1: Pharmacokinetics, Plasma concentration levels of CGT4859, Approximately 28 days|Phase 1: Evaluate antitumor activity of CGT4859 - Objective Response Rate (ORR), Approximately 8 months|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Evaluate antitumor activity of CGT4859 - Disease Control Rate (DCR), Approximately 8 months|Phase 2: Characterize the safety of CGT4859 - AEs, Incidence, severity, and seriousness or treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) leading to dose modification, Approximately 9 months|Phase 2: Characterize the safety of CGT4859 - Labs, ECG, Changes from baseline in key laboratory results and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, Approximately 9 months|Phase 2: Pharmacokinetics at RP2D, Plasma concentration levels of CGT4859, Approximately 28 days
