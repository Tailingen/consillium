Study of Lenzilumab and Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The primary objectives of this study are:

Phase 1: To evaluate the safety of sequenced therapy with lenzilumab and axicabtagene ciloleucel in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and identify the most appropriate dose of lenzilumab for Phase 2.

Phase 2: To evaluate the incidence of neurologic events with sequenced therapy given at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lenzilumab in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

CMR: positron emission tomography(PET)5-point scale(5PS) scores of 1(no uptake above background), 2(uptake ≤ mediastinum), 3(uptake \> mediastinum but ≤ liver) with/without a residual mass); no new sites; and no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow. CRR: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter (LDi) of a lesion; no extra lymphatic sites; absent non-measured lesion;organ enlargement regress to normal; no new sites; and bone marrow normal by morphology., First infusion date axicabtagene ciloleucel to data cut off date of 09 May 2022 (maximum duration: 22.3 months).|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per IWG Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, ORR: Percentage of participants with CR(CMR;CRR) or PR(partial metabolic response(PMR);partial radiologic response (PRR)).CMR:PET 5PS scores of 1,2,3 with/without a residual mass;no new sites;no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow.CRR:target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi of a lesion;no extra lymphatic sites;absent non-measured lesion;organ enlargement regress to normal;no new sites;bone marrow normal by morphology.PMR:5PS scores of 4(uptake moderately higher than liver),or 5(uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions),with reduced uptake compared to baseline and residual masses of any size;no new sites;residual update \> update in normal bone marrow but reduced compared with baseline.PRR:≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of perpendicular diameters of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites;absent/normal, regressed, but no increase of nonmeasured lesions;spleen regressed by \> 50% in length beyond normal;no new sites., First infusion date axicabtagene ciloleucel to data cut off date of 09 May 2022 (maximum duration: 22.3 months).|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR) in Participants Who Experience an Objective Response Per IWG Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, DOR is defined only for participants who experience an objective response after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and is the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death from any cause. Objective response is defined in outcome measure (OM) 7., First infusion date axicabtagene ciloleucel to data cut off date of 09 May 2022 (maximum duration: 22.3 months).|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per IWG Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per Lugano classification or death from any cause., First infusion date axicabtagene ciloleucel to data cut off date of 09 May 2022 (maximum duration: 22.3 months).|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death., First infusion date axicabtagene ciloleucel to data cut off date of 09 May 2022 (maximum duration: 22.3 months).|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Pharmacodynamics: Peak Serum Level of CXCL10, Granzyme B, IFN-gamma, IL-1 RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF Alpha, GM-CSF, and MCP-1, Peak is defined as the maximum post-baseline level of the analyte from baseline to Week 4., Baseline up to Week 4|Phase 1 and Phase 2: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Pharmacokinetics: Peak Level of Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells in Blood, Peak is defined as the maximum number of CAR T cells in blood measured after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion., Baseline up to Month 3
This study was intended to be a Phase 1/2, but the planned Phase 2 part has been canceled.
