Comprehensive Therapy to Relieving the Risk of Recurrence and Metastasis for Colorectal Cancer
Comprehensive therapy of traditional Chinese medicine (CTTCM) could relieve risk of recurrence and metastasis for stage II \& III colorectal cancer, the investigators take this clinical trial with retrospective-prospective cohort study based on previous studies by international multi-center way.

If the study shows a positive result, a pragmatic randomized controlled study with prospective, multi-centre and large-sample design will be given continuously. The aim is to establish recommended programs suggested by CTTCM strategies under conventional Western medicine therapy (CWMT) for stage II \& III colorectal cancer.
