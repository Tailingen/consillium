Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the response and toxicity of carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. This cycle is repeated every 3 weeks. Patients may receive 6-8 cycles of therapy in the absence of toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 eligible patients will be accrued in approximately 18 months.
