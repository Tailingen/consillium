Adjuvant Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy After Trans-arterial Chemoembolization in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study investigates the adjuvant SBRT following TACE in early and intermediate stages HCC not amenable for surgical resection or orthotopic liver transplant.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: TACE|RADIATION: SBRT
1-year local control rate, After one year from the treatment, the precentage with alive subjects with no signs of local progression (the irradiated lesion).

Local progression defined as more than 20% increase in diameter of enhancing tumor on contrast-enhanced CT scan in arterial phase or a new tumor mass within the original tumor volume according to modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), 12 Months
Qualtiy of life based on EORTC QLQC30, alive subjects will fill quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQC30) before the treatment and after 3,6 and 12 months after.

The results before and after the treatment will be presented in comaprsion to the reference data., 12 Months|1- year progression free survival, After one year from the end of the treatment, the percentage of alive subjects without the apperance of new hepatic and/or extra-heaptic new lesions outside the SBRT-field.

This will be measured using contrast-enhanced CT scan Liver/Abdomen and Thorax, 12 Months|Quality of life based on EORTC QLQ-HCC18, alive subjects will fill quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-HCC18) before the treatment and after 3,6 and 12 months after.

The results before and after the treatment will be presented in comaprsion to the reference data., 12 Months
The study investigates the adjuvant SBRT following TACE in early and intermediate stages HCC not amenable for surgical resection or orthotopic liver transplant.
