This is an open-label, Phase I, first-in-human (FIH) multicenter, clinical study conducted in multiple parts to establish the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile (with and without food) and early signs of efficacy of Tuvuseritib (M1774) as monotherapy and in combination with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib.
