PETACC-8 miR-31-3p and miR-31-5p Ancillary Study
This is a prospective-retrospective study to determine if the expression of the miRNA's miR-31-3p and miR-31-5p are prognostic of patient outcomes or predictive of the benefit from anti-EGFR therapy in stage III Colon Cancer. The present study will utilize FFPE tumor samples collected from patients enrolled in the PETACC-8 study conducted by the Fédération Francophone de Cancérologie Digestive (FFCD). This phase 3 clinical trial prospectively randomized fully resected stage III colon cancer patients to receive adjuvant treatment with either FOLFOX-4 plus cetuximab or FLOFOX-4 alone.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: FOLFOX
Disease Free Survival (DFS), Difference in Disease Free Survival (DFS) for RAS/BRAF wild-type patients whose primary tumors have low miR-31-3p expression when treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 vs. FOLFOX-4 only ., From date of randomization until the date of first documented any signs or symptoms cancer relapse or date of death, whichever came first, assessed up to 7 years|Prognostic and predictive value of miR-31-3p expression on Disease Free Survival (DFS), If patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT), low miR-31-3p expression tumors treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 arm have improved DFS vs. patients treated with FOLFOX-4 alone, the predictive and prognostic value of miR-31-3p expression level on cetuximab efficacy relative to DFS in patients with RAS/BRAF WT tumors ., From date of randomization until the date of first documented any signs or symptoms cancer relapse or date of death, whichever came first, assessed up to 7 years
Overall Survival (OS), Difference in OS for RAS/BRAF wild-type patients whose primary tumors have low miR-31-3p expression when treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 vs. FOLFOX-4 only., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 7 years|Prognostic and predictive value of miR-31-3p expression on OS, If patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT), low miR-31-3p expression tumors treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 arm have improved OS vs. patients treated with FOLFOX-4 alone, the predictive and prognostic value of miR-31-3p expression level on cetuximab efficacy relative to OS in patients with RAS/BRAF WT tumors ., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 7 years|Survival after recurrence (SAR), Difference in Survival after Recurrence (SAR) for RAS/BRAF wild-type patients whose primary tumors have low miR-31-3p expression when treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 vs. FOLFOX-4 only., From date of the first documented recurrence to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 7 years|Prognostic and predictive value of miR-31-3p expression on SAR, If patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT), low miR-31-3p expression tumors treated with cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 arm have improved SAR vs. patients treated with FOLFOX-4 alone, the predictive and prognostic value of miR-31-3p expression level on cetuximab efficacy relative to SAR in patients with RAS/BRAF WT tumors ., From date of the first documented recurrence to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 7 years
miR-31-3p cut-off, If pre-established cut-off for miR-31-3p expression does not achieve statistical significance, cut-off value of miR-31-3p expression that discriminates RAS Wild Type and BRAF Wild Type population treated with FOLFOX-4 + cetuximab in terms of DFS, OS and SAR., From the date of randomization until 7 years, or date of death from any cause.|miR-31-5p cut-off, Cut-off value for miR-31-5p expression which discriminates RAS Wild Type and BRAF Wild Type population treated with FOLFOX-4 + cetuximab in terms of DFS, OS and SAR., From the date of randomization until 7 years, or date of death from any cause.|Distribution of miR-31-5p expression, Distribution of miR-31-5p expression in the patient population and the correlation of miR-31-5p expression (quantitative) and of miR-31-5p expression level (low/high) with clinically significant co-variates and with the expression of miR-31-3p., From the date of randomization until 7 years, or date of death from any cause.
