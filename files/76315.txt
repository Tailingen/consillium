A Dose Escalation Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD) and Clinical Activity of GSK525762 in Subjects With Relapsed, Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily (QD) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762. Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory hematological malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia \[AML\], non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma \[NHL\]and multiple myeloma \[MM\]), will be enrolled in the QD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. . Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily (BID) dosing cohorts may be opened to collect additional safety data and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of GSK525762 administered BID. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D; separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression \[double- and triple-hit lymphoma\]), and multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission.

Participants whose value category was unchanged, or whose value became normal, were recorded in the "To Normal or No Change" category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed "To Low" and "To High", so the percentages may not add to 100%. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants With Increase to Grade 3 From Baseline in Vital Signs: DBP and SBP, DBP and SBP were measured after resting for at least 5 minutes in a supine or semi-recumbent position. They were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. For SBP: Grade 0 (\<=120 millimeter of mercury \[mmHg\]), Grade 1 (121-139 mmHg), Grade 2 (140-159 mmHg), Grade 3 (\>=160 mmHg). For DBP: Grade 0 (\<=80 mmHg), Grade 1 (81-89 mmHg), Grade 2 (90-99 mmHg), Grade 3 (\>=100 mmHg). Higher grade indicates greater severity. Baseline was the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. An increase is defined as an increase in grade relative to Baseline grade. Number of participants with increase to Grade 3 from Baseline is presented., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants With Worst-case Post-Baseline Abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings (Investigator Reading), 12-lead ECGs were recorded with the participants in a supine position using an ECG machine. Number of participants with worst-case clinically significant and not clinically significant abnormal ECG findings have been presented. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as interval of time(in months) between date of first dose \& earlier of date of disease progression \& date of death due to any cause.Progression is participants(pt's)with MDS \& with \<5% blasts:\>=50% increase in blasts to\>5% blasts/pt's with 5-10% blasts:\>=50% increase to \>10% blasts, for pt's with 10-20% blasts:\>=50% increase to \>20% blasts,for pt's with 20%-30% blasts:\>=50% increase to \>30% blasts, for CTCL progression is \>=25% increase in skin disease from Baseline/new tumors (T3\[1 or more tumors(\>=1cm diameter\]) in pt's with T1(Limited patches,papules\&/or plaques covering \<10% of the skin surface;may further stratify into T1a \[patch only\] versus T1b \[plaque+-patch\]),T2(Patches,papules/plaques covering \>=10% of skin surface;may further stratify into T2a\[patch only\]versus T2b \[plaque+-patch\]) orT4(Confluence of erythema covering \>=80% body surface area) only skin disease/loss of response in those with CR/PR, increase of skin score of \> sum of nadir +50% Baseline score., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence response (CR or PR lasting 4 months for CTCL; and CR, marrow CR, CRp, Cri or PR for MDS) until the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of duration of response are presented., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of first dose and the date of death due to any cause. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of overall survival are presented., Up to 36.4 weeks
Part 2: Time to Progression (TTP) for Participants With MM, Time to Progression was planned to be analyzed., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 1: Changes in Cardiac QT Duration Corrected for Heart Rate by Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) and Other Safety Parameters in Relation to GSK525762 PK Concentrations, Changes in QTcF and other safety parameters in relation to GSK525762 PK concentrations was planned to be analyzed., Up to 86.9 weeks|Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose /Exposure Markers Related Change in Molecular Markers in Tumor Tissue and/or Peripheral Blood Samples, Number of participants with dose /exposure markers related change in molecular markers (e.g. gene transcription and/or expression of proteins regulated by Bromodomain \[BRD\] proteins) in tumor tissue and/or peripheral blood samples were planned to be analyzed., Up to 86.9 weeks|Part 2: Plasma Concentrations of GSK525762 in Relationship With Safety and Efficacy Parameters Derived From Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Model, Plasma concentrations of GSK525762 in relationship with safety and efficacy parameters derived from PK/PD model was planned to be analyzed., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants With Dose /Exposure Markers Related Change in Molecular Markers in Tumor Tissue and/or Peripheral Blood Samples, Number of participants with dose /exposure markers related change in molecular markers (e.g. gene transcription and/or expression of proteins regulated by Bromodomain proteins) in tumor tissue and/or peripheral blood samples were planned to be analyzed., Up to 36.4 weeks|Part 1: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (defined as the interval of time in months between the date of first dose and the date of death due to any cause) was planned to be analyzed., Up to 86.9 weeks
This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily (QD) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762. Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory hematological malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia \[AML\], non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma \[NHL\]and multiple myeloma \[MM\]), will be enrolled in the QD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. . Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily (BID) dosing cohorts may be opened to collect additional safety data and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of GSK525762 administered BID. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D; separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression \[double- and triple-hit lymphoma\]), and multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies are anticipated to result in a durable remission.
