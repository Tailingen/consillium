Blinatumomab in Combination With AMG 404 for the Treatment of Adults With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Precursor ALL
The primary objective of this phase 1b study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of blinatumomab and AMG 404 in combination in adults with R/R B-ALL and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMG 404 when combined with continuous intravenous infusion (cIV) blinatumomab.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab|DRUG: AMG 404|DRUG: Dexamethasone Premedication
Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Investigators determined whether an adverse event (AE) qualified as a DLT per pre-specified protocol defined criteria. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment., Cohort 1: Up to 67 days; Cohort 2a: Up to 56 days|Number of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-Emergent AEs (TEAEs), A TEAE was defined as any AE starting on or after first dose of blinatumomab or AMG 404. The investigator used clinical judgment to assess causal relationship. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as any AE that:

* results in death,
* immediately life-threatening,
* requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
* results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
* is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or
* other medically important serious AE.

AEs of interest (EOIs) for blinatumomab included capillary leak syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, decreased immunoglobulins, elevated liver enzyme, embolic and thrombotic events, immunogenicity, infections, infusion reactions without considering duration, leukoencephalopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, neurologic events, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, pancreatitis, and tumor lysis syndrome. EOIs for AMG 404 included non-infectious diarrhea and hemorrhages., Median (min, max) overall duration from first dose until 30 days after last dose is: 83.4 (40.2, 274.1) days
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Complete Remission (CR) or CR With Partial Hematological Recovery (CRh) (CR/CRh), Hematological remissions were defined by the following criteria:

CR:

* Less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM)
* No evidence of disease
* Full recovery of peripheral blood (PB) counts:
* Platelets \> 100 000/μl
* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1000/μl

CR with only CRh:

* Less than 5% blasts in the BM
* No evidence of disease
* Partial recovery of PB counts:
* Platelets \> 50 000/μl and
* ANC \> 500/μl

Percentage of participants with CR/CRh were summarized along with corresponding 95% exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method., Within the first 2 cycles: Up to approximately 86 days; across all cycles: Up to approximately 274 days|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved CR, Hematological remissions were defined by the following criteria:

CR:

* Less than 5% blasts in the BM
* No evidence of disease
* Full recovery of PB counts:
* Platelets \> 100 000/μl
* ANC \> 1000/μl

Percentage of participants with CR were summarized along with corresponding 95% exact CI using the Clopper-Pearson method., Within the first 2 cycles: Up to approximately 86 days; across all cycles: Up to approximately 274 days|Median Duration of CR in Participants Who Achieved CR Within First 2 Cycles, Duration of CR was calculated from the date CR was first achieved within the first 2 cycles until the earliest date of disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Months were calculated as days from date of CR to event/censor date, divided by 30.5.

Median time to event and 95% CI was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method., Up to approximately 274 days|Median Duration of CR/CRh in Participants Who Achieved CR/CRh Within First 2 Cycles, Duration of CR/CRh was calculated from the date CR/CRh was first achieved within the first 2 cycles until the earliest date of disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Months were calculated as days from date of CR/CRh to event/censor date, divided by 30.5.

Median time to event and 95% CI was summarized using the KM method., Up to approximately 274 days|Steady-state Concentrations (Css) of Blinatumomab, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were estimated using standard non-compartmental approaches and summarized by dose level as pre-specified in the protocol., Cohort 1: C1D1 and D8 (predose, 2 to 24 h postdose), and D11, D18 and D29; C2D1 (predose, 2 to 24 h postdose) and D29. Cohort 2a: C1D3 and D10 (predose, 2 to 48 h postdose), and D29, D30 and D31; C2D1 (predose, 2 to 24 h postdose), D13 and D29|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of AMG 404, PK parameters were estimated using standard non-compartmental approaches and summarized by dose level as pre-specified in the protocol., Cohort 1: C1D11 (predose, end of infusion to 48 h postdose), D18, D29, and D39 (predose and end of infusion).
