Human CD19-CD22 Targeted T Cells Injection for Refractory/Relapsed Central Nervous System Leukemia/Lymphoma Patients
This study is a open-label, dose-escalation trial to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics characteristics of Human CD19-CD22 Targeted T Cells by intravenous and intrathecal administration, and to preliminarily observe the efficacy of the trial drug in patients with central nervous system involvement of refractory/relapsed B cell malignancies.

Subjects with refractory/relapsed central nervous system involvement of B cell malignancies can participate if all eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility including disease assessments, a physical exam, Electrocardiograph, Computed tomography (CT) / Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) / Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Cerebrospinal fluid exam and blood draws. Subjects will receive preconditioning chemotherapy prior to the infusion of Human CD19-CD22 Targeted T Cells Injection. After the infusion, subjects will be followed for adverse events, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics characteristics, efficacy of Human CD19-CD22 Targeted T Cells Injection. Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
