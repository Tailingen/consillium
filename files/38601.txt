Biomarker Testing and Treatment Patterns Among Patients With PIK3CA Mutation in Advanced Breast Cancer
This was a retrospective observational study of patients with advanced breast cancer (BC). This non-interventional study was conducted using discrete structured data and medical record abstraction, if needed, from patients treated at Texas Oncology, the designated research organization and a community oncology practice. The first date of a new diagnosis of advanced BC (de novo or progressed to advanced BC) defined the study index date. To allow for an adequate potential duration of follow-up (retrospectively observed) after the index date over which PIK3CA testing and treatment patterns was observed, a minimum follow-up opportunity of 6 months after the diagnosis of advanced BC at the time of data pull and/or abstraction was required.
