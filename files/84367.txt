Remimazolam Versus Propofol for General Anesthesia Induction in Patients on Renin-angiotensin System Blockers Undergoing Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy
The investigators conduct a random assignment into either the remimazolam group or the propofol group. Depending on the group assignment, either remimazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or propofol (1.0 mg/kg) is administered. If necessary, additional doses of remimazolam (0.1 mg/kg) or propofol (0.5 mg/kg) are given. The standard anesthesia procedure of our institution is followed, and blood pressure data recorded during the surgery is analyzed (mean arterial pressure \<65mmHg is defined as hypotension).
