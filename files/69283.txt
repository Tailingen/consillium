This is a first-in-human, phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of STI-6643 administered by intravenous infusion in subjects with a relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumor.

The study will determine an MTD and RP2D using a conventional 3+3 study design with priming dose identification (PDI) stage and therapeutic dose (TD) escalation (TDE) stage. Dose limiting toxicity evaluated over the initial 28 days of STI-6643 administration.
