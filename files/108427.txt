Ph3 Study To Determine Safety,Tolerability&Tumor Response Of Oraxol Compared To Taxol In Metastatic Breast Cancer
To determine the safety and tolerability of Oraxol as compared to IV paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Oraxol|DRUG: IV paclitaxel
Tumor response as determined by response criteria, Tumor response is evaluated using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1 criteria)., 19 to 22 weeks|Safety and tolerability assessments of Oraxol compared with IV paclitaxel, as determined by laboratory, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) information, Safety assessments will consist of determining and recording all AEs and SAEs; laboratory evaluation of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine analyses; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); and the performance of physical examinations, as detailed in the schedule of procedures and assessments of the protocol, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to ~48 months (expected end of study).]
Progression-free survival (PFS), The endpoint of progression-free survival is defined as not having died or progression of disease. Lost to follow-up will be considered as censored., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to ~48 months (expected end of study).|Overall survival (OS), The endpoint of overall survival is defined as death, confirmed alive, and lost to follow-up. Alive and lost to follow-up will be considered as censored., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to ~48 months (expected end of study).
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, multicenter study in approximately 360 adult female subjects with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed breast cancer that is metastatic for whom treatment with IV paclitaxel monotherapy has been recommended by their oncologist. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled to provide 360 evaluable subjects. The subjects must have measurable metastatic target lesion disease as per RECIST v1.1 criteria. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Oraxol or IV paclitaxel (as Taxol or generic).
