L-DEP Regimen Combined With PD-1 Antibody as Induction Therapy for Epstein-Barr Virus-positive LA-HLH
The efficacy and safety of L-DEP (PEG-aspargase, liposomal doxorubicin, etoposide, and methylprednisolone) regimen combined with PD-1 Antibody an induction therapy for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lympohistiocytosis is a refractory immune disorder with high mortality. Without early intervention, the median survival time is less than 2 months. Currently, HLH-94 or HLH-04 are the standard HLH treatment regimens, which have improved the disease response rate to approximately 70% and increased the 5-year OS rate to 50%. However, approximately, 30% of the patients remain unresponsive to standard therapy, especially if HLH is lymphoma-associated. Therefore, we conduct a prospective clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of L-DEP (PEG-aspargase, liposomal doxorubicin, etoposide, and methylprednisolone) regimen combined with PD-1 Antibody an induction therapy for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
