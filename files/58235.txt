Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy vs Conventional Palliative Radiotherapy for Painful Non-Spine Bone Metastases
This study is being done to answer the following question: Is Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy or SBRT (a form of radiation therapy which can deliver high doses of radiation to the specific painful area of the body most affected by cancer, while keeping the radiation beams away from the healthy parts of the body that surround the cancer) better for pain relief than the standard treatment of conventional radiation therapy or CRT (a form of radiation therapy which delivers radiation to the painful area but can also negatively affect other parts of the body in the same area)

This is a multi-centre, phase III randomized controlled trial comparing SBRT to conventional palliative EBRT in patients with solid tumours and a dominant painful non-spine bone metastasis as defined by a worst pain score of 2 or greater. 230 participants will be enrolled to the study. Participants will have radiation for 5 treatments (conventional palliative EBRT 20Gy/5; SBRT 30Gy/5 or 35Gy/5) and then will be followed for pain response and radiological progression at 3 and 6 months post treatment.
