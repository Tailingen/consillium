A Phase II Study of AAA617 Alone and AAA617 in Combination With ARPI in Patients With PSMA PET Scan Positive CRPC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AAA617 alone (Lutetium \[177Lu\] vipivotide tetraxetan) and in combination with an Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors (ARPI) in participants with PSMA-positive, castration-resistant prostate cancer and no evidence of metastasis in conventional imaging (CI) (i.e., CT/MRI and bone scans). Approximately 120 participants will be randomized.

Metastatic Free Survival (MFS), MFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the first evidence of radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis by conventional imaging using RECIST 1.1 or death., From date of randomization until date of progression or date of death whichever occurs first, up to 5 years|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented radiographic disease progression by conventional imaging assessed using RECIST 1.1 or death., From date of randomization until date of radiographic progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as date of death due to any cause, From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, up to 5 years|second Progression Free Survival (PFS2), PFS2 defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression by investigator's assessment (PSA, radiographic, symptomatic, or any combination) on next line of therapy subsequent to MFS event or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From date of randomization until date of second progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 5 years|Time to symptomatic progression, Time to symptomatic progression will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented event for any of the following:

* Development of a symptomatic skeletal event (SSE)
* Pain progression or worsening of disease-related symptoms requiring initiation of a new systemic anti-cancer therapy
* Development of clinically significant symptoms due to loco-regional tumor progression requiring surgical intervention or radiation therapy, From date of randomization until development of a symptomatic skeletal event, new systemic anti-cancer therapy, surgical intervention or radiation therapy, whichever occurs first, up to 5 years|Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented dose of new cytotoxic chemotherapy being administered to the participant, From the date of randomization to the date of first documented dose of new cytotoxic chemotherapy administered to the participant, up to 5 years|Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (TTSSE), TTSSE is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From the date of randomization to the date of the first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, orthopedic surgical intervention, radiation therapy or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 5 years|Time to distant metastasis development, Time to distant metastasis development is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first evidence of radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis by conventional imaging using RECIST 1.1, From the date of randomization to the date of first evidence of radiographically detectable bone or soft tissue distant metastasis, up to 5 years|Time to local radiological progression, Time to local radiological progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented local radiographic disease progression by conventional imaging using RECIST 1.1, From the date of randomization to the date of first documented local radiographic disease progression, up to 5 years|Time to initiation or change in therapy, Time to initiation or change in therapy is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented dose of a new / change in therapy being administered to the participant, From the date of randomization to the date of first dose of a new / change in therapy, up to 5 years|Time to PSA response, Time to PSA response is calculated as the time from randomization to PSA response with a PSA nadir value of =\< 0.2ng/mL., From randomization to PSA response, up to 5 years|PSA50 response, PSA50 response is defined as the proportion of participants who have a \>= 50% decrease in PSA from baseline that is confirmed by a second (the next) PSA measurement \>= 4 weeks later, From date of randomization until end of efficacy follow-up, up to 5 years|PSA90 response, PSA90 response is defined as the proportion of participants who have a \>= 90% decrease in PSA from baseline that is confirmed by a second (the next) PSA measurement \>= 4 weeks later, From date of randomization until end of efficacy follow-up, up to 5 years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-P assesses symptoms/problems related to prostate carcinoma and its treatment. It is a combination of the FACT- General + the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS). The FACTGeneral (FACT-G) is a 27 item Quality of Life (QoL) measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), and Emotional Well-being (0-24). The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life., From date of randomization until end of efficacy follow-up, up to 5 years|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Radiotherapies (FACT-RNT) Questionnaire, The FACT-RNT is assessing treatment-related symptoms of special interest/associated with Radionuclides Therapies. The FACT-RNT contains 15 items assessing dry mouth, dry eyes, difficulty urinating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, fatigue, impact of fatigue, pain, bone pain, pain interference, bothered by of side effects of treatment and isolation due to illness or treatment., From date of randomization until end of efficacy follow-up, up to 5 years|Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire, The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item selfreport questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 \[no pain\] to 10 \[pain as bad as you can imagine\]). Pain severity progression is defined as an increase in score of 30% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use., From date of randomization until end of efficacy follow-up, up to 5 years
