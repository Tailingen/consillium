A Study of Adjuvant Atezolizumab or Atezolizumab Plus Tiragolumab in Solid Tumors with Resectable Disease with Intermediate-High Risk of Recurrence and High Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB-H) or Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H)
This study is being conducted to evaluate efficacy parameters (disease free survival \[DFS\] and overall survival \[OS\]) of atezolizumab and atezolizumab in combination with tiragolumab in TMB-H or MSI-H as adjuvant treatment after standard radical intended treatment in participants with intermediate-high risk of recurrence.
