Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Genz-644282 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion, to patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. Each 28 day cycle of treatment will consist of 3 consecutive weeks of treatment every 28 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days). Each 21 day cycle of treatment will consist of 2 consecutive weeks of treatment every 21 days(i.e., treatment will be administered on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days). Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. Approximately 110 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) for the 2 dosing schedules are established. To further evaluate safety, approximately 40 additional patients with advanced malignant solid tumors will be enrolled and treated at the MTDs (20 for each dosing schedule) during an expansion phase.

This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of Genz-644282, administered as an IV infusion, to patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. Drug will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of the 28 day treatment cycle, or on days 1 and 8 of the 21 day treatment cycle.

Treatment with Genz-644282 will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. Patients will be enrolled in escalating dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) are established.

Safety will be evaluated throughout the study.
