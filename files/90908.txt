Phase II Study Exploring Five Fractions of Post-operative Radiation Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to investigate a shorter radiation treatment schedule for head and neck cancers. The present study is a non -randomized phase II study that will enroll 50 patients and test feasibility of 30 Gy in 5 fractions of the primary disease and ipsilateral level I-III disease.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Five fraction of post operative radiotherapy
Severe late toxicity grade 3) at 2 year, Severe late toxicity \> 3 or higher grade 3) at 2 year, 2 years
Loco-regional control rate, Time to an event \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18, 21 and 24 months, 2 years|Disease free survival, Time to an event \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18, 21 and 24 months\], 2 years|Overall Survival, Time to an event \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18, 21 and 24 months\], 2 years|Regional recurrence at ipsilateral level IV, Time to an event \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18, 21 and 24 months\], 2 years|Acute toxicity, RTOG scale, Every week for first month|Late toxicity, RTOG scale \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months\], 2 years|Swallowing function, MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months\], 2 years|Quality of life EORTC QLQC30, EORTC QLQC30 module \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months\] The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.

Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. High score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., 2 years|Quality of life H&B35, EORTC H\&B35 module \[longitudinal assessment at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months\]

The head \& neck cancer module incorporates seven multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. There are also eleven single items. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems (i.e. there are no function scales in which high scores would mean better functioning). The scoring approach for the QLQ-H\&N35 is identical in principle to that for the symptom scales / single items of the QLQ-C30., 2 years
Radiotherapy (RT) is an integral cancer treatment and RT utilization rates for commonly occurring carcinoma include breast: 87%, cervical: 71%, head and neck: 84%, lung: 77%, and prostate: 58% \[1\]. Overall, 57.5% of global head and neck cancers occur in Asia especially in India \[2\]. Head and neck cancers in India accounted for 30% of all cancers. In India, 60 to 80% of patients present with advanced disease as compared to 40% in developed countries \[3\]. Inequitable radiotherapy availability in India leads to non-compliance in many cases, as patients need to travel long distances for treatment. The number of functional radiotherapy units in India is below the limit recommended by the World Health Organization \[3\]. This poses a serious barrier to radiotherapy access as well as timely delivery of multidisciplinary cancer care.

Post operative radiation treatment for head and neck patients requires 6 weeks of time and the patient has to travel to the radiotherapy department daily for 5 days a week. This long course of radiation can lead to significant side effects resulting in some people being unable to complete the course of treatment. The Accelerate trial has potential to provide a quick solution (by reducing 30 fractions of PORT to 5 fractions) and is particularly suitable for resource constraint and overburdened radiotherapy. Five fractions of radiotherapy has been proven to be equally efficacious to long courses at various cancer sites like rectal cancer, breast cancer \[4,5\]. With small volume disease and technological advances in delivery of radiotherapy it is possible to deliver 5 fractions of hypofractionated RT to prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer \[6-8\].

The present study is a non -randomised phase II study that will enroll 50 patients and test feasibility of 30 Gy in 5 fractions of the primary disease and ipsilateral level I-III disease.
