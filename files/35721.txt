Surufatinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Single-cell Sequencing of Tumor Samples
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label phase II study designed to assess the efficacy of surufatinib in participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma based on single-cell sequencing of tumor samples.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Surufatinib
Bioinformatics analysis of single-cell sequencing in hepatocellular carcinoma, Analysis of HCC molecular biology information using single cell sequencing technology., approximately 1 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression or death of any cause., approximately 1 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Rate of patients with complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) based on RESIST1.1., approximately 1 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (reduced or enlarged) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit., approximately 1 years|adverse events(AE), adverse events evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0., approximately 1 years
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label phase II study designed to assess the efficacy of surufatinib in participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma based on single-cell sequencing of tumor samples. The primary outcome measure of the study is the regulation of immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma, included the proportion of tumor cells, vascular endothelial cells, and various immune cell clusters (including monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils) in tumor samples before and after treatment with surufatinib, and the expression of related genes. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints include Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0.
