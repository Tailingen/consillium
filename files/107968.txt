68Ga-DOTATATE PET Scan Imaging in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors
Neuroendocrine cancer is an unusual disease and often goes undetected by routine imaging. The 68Ga-DOTATATE PET Scan is a novel scanning method that may have improved sensitivity and resolution specifically for neuroendocrine tumors. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors will be imaged with this agent and it will be compared to conventional imaging methods to determine the safety and efficacy of this radiopharmaceutical.
