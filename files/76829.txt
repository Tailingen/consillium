Trial of Pembrolizumab Following Weekly Paclitaxel for Platinum-resistant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer
The overall aim of the study is to demonstrate a clinically meaningful extension of progression free survival using maintenance pembrolizumab. The aim of the translational research is to study the immune microenvironment before and during pembrolizumab therapy.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) measured from start of study treatment to the date of objective progression (investigator assessed using RECIST 1.1) or date of death from any cause (in the absence of progression)., Progression free survival (PFS) measure from the first date of trial treatment to 6 months of treatment., 6 months
Overall survival measured from start of study treatment to the date of death from any cause, Overall survival (death from any cause) measured from the start of study treatment, 4 years|Disease response, Disease response investigator assessed by RECIST 1.1, from when a patient starts trial treatment until patients starts new anti-cancer treatment, 4 years
This study aims to investigate the effect of maintenance pembrolizumab in patients who have undergone treatment with weekly paclitaxel for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer and have either responded or have not progressed after a minimum of 4 cycles of treatment.

In this study patients will receive 3 weekly pembrolizumab until progression and the investigators will monitor the immune microenvironment by tumour biopsy and blood sampling before starting pembrolizumab and again before cycle 4 of treatment. The clinical endpoint will be to demonstrate a worthwhile improvement in the 6 month median PFS and to study possible predictive markers or response to pembrolizumab. This is a non-randomised phase II study, and the population may be different from those who received paclitaxel and bevacizumab.
