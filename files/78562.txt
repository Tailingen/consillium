NBTXR3 Activated by Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Borderline-Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
To find the recommended dose of NBTXR3 that can be given in combination with radiation therapy to patients with pancreatic cancer. To learn if the dose NBTXR3 found in Part 1 can help to control the disease.

OTHER: Hafnium Oxide-containing Nanoparticles NBTXR3|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Dose-limiting toxicities, Any grade \>= 3 adverse event related to NBTXR3 and/or radiation therapy. Any toxicity (grade \>= 3) that is at least possibly related to study drug (NBTXR3) is a DLT. Adverse events will be scored based on National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v 5.0)., 4 weeks after last radiation dose|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD will be determined as the dose for which the isotonic estimate of the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate 30%., Up to 1 year|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), Up to 1 year
Determination of the feasibility of NBTXR3 injection in pancreas, Feasibility refers to the ability to do intratumoral injection of NBTXR3. The outcome for each patient would be "feasible" or "not feasible.", Up to 1 year|Progression free survival (PFS), From NBTXR3 injection to local recurrence, local progression, distant progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), From NBTXR3 injection to death from any cause or EoS, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 1 year
Presence of hafnium, Will evaluation of the time-course dependent presence of hafnium in blood and urine following NBTXR3 intratumoral injection., Up to 1 year|Disease control rate, Defined as the proportion of patients without progression 6 months post NBTXR3 injection., 6 months|Proportion of locally advanced subjects who undergo surgical resection after receiving NBTXR3/radiation therapy (R3/RT), Up to 1 year|Resection status, Resection status as assessed macroscopically by surgeon R0- Macroscopically complete tumor removal with negative microscopic surgical margins, R1- Macroscopically complete tumor removal with positive microscopic margins (any or all), and R2- Macroscopically incomplete tumor removal with known or suspected residual gross disease., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

â€¢ To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or borderline-resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the safety and feasibility of NBTXR3 intratumoral injection activated by radiotherapy in locally advanced or borderline-resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
* To evaluate the anti-tumor response of NBTXR3 intratumoral injection activated by radiotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or borderline-resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
* To evaluate time-to-event outcomes in subjects with locally advanced or borderline-resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the body kinetic profile of intratumorally injected NBTXR3.
* To evaluate time to event outcomes for subjects with clinical staging of locally advanced, unresectable disease.
* To evaluate resectability conversion rates.
* To evaluate surgical outcomes in subjects who undergo surgery after radiation therapy.
* To associate radiomic measurements with outcomes.
* To evaluate biomarkers of response in subjects treated with NBTXR3/RT.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of NBTXR3.

Patients receive NBTXR3 intratumorally (IT) on day 1. Patients then undergo 15 fractions of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between days 15-43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
