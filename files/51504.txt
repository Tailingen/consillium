Learning Curve for Robot-Assisted Gastrectomy in Gastric Cancer
The investigators prospectively collected the clinical data of Da Vinci robot-assisted radical gastrectomy patients conducted by the same group of physicians from October 2017 to October 2018. The learning curve of the surgery was analyzed with the moving average method and the cumulative sum analysis (CUSUM). The short-term efficacy was then validated by comparing the perioperative and pathologic outcomes of patients in the two stages of the learning curve.
