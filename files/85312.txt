Phase 2b, Trial of Intravesical DTA-H19/PEI in Patients With Intermediate-Risk Superficial Bladder Cancer
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DTA-H19/PEI given as six intravesical instillations of 20 mg of plasmid DNA complexed with PEI into the bladder of patients with intermediate risk superficial bladder cancer \[recurrent stages Ta (low or high grade)and T1, (low grade) transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)\] who have failed prior intravesical therapies including either Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) or chemotherapy. The primary efficacy objective is to determine the effect of DTA-H19/PEI on the prevention of new tumors after the induction course of 6 weekly intravesical administrations of investigational product assessed 8 to 10 weeks after the start of treatment. Secondary objectives include assessing the ablative effect of DTA-H19/PEI on a marker tumor, safety assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events, determining the long-term (46 weeks) continued rates of absence of bladder cancer, and time to tumor recurrence in those patients who had a complete response (CR) after the induction course.
Superficial Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: BC-819/PEI
Complete Tumor Response Defined as the Absence of New Tumors, Tumor response evaluated at week 9 (range 8-10 weeks) during the first post induction course treatment cystoscopy or TUR of suspiciaous lesions, 9 Weeks
Time to Tumor Recurrence, The Time to Tumor Recurrence is defined as the interval between the date of the final tumor resection before the start of study treatments to the date when the cystoscopy was performed in which it was confirmed by histopathology that any suspicious lesions that were observed, were TCC of the bladder with the exception of the continued presence of the marker tumor at Week 9, 46 Weeks|Ablative Effect on a Marker Tumor, Complete disappearance of marker lesion, 9 weeks
DTA-H19, is a doubled stranded DNA plasmid that carries the gene for the diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the H19 promoter sequence. This is a Patient-Oriented, Targeted Therapy as DT-A chain expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription factors that are upregulated in tumor cells. The selective initiation of toxin expression results in selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition of protein synthesis in the tumor cell, enabling highly targeted cancer treatment.
