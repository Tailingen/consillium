Complete Lymph Node Dissection vs Watchful Waiting in Patients With Malignant Melanoma (Thickness of 1,0mm+ and Evidence of Metastases in the Sentinel Node)
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered as standard diagnostic procedure in melanoma patients carrying a reasonable risk for metastases. In numerous studies the prognostic role of micro metastases in the sentinel node (SN) was described. However, the prognostic value of a complete lymph node dissection in patients with a positive SN is still unclear.

This study was planned to analyse the survival outcome of patients with a positive SN receiving complete lymphadenectomy versus watchful waiting.
