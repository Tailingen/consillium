Carboplatin and Pemetrexed in Recurrent Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed have on patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
To assess the response rate of carboplatin in combination with pemetrexed in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or peritoneal cancer., This study has now been published: Matulonis U.A.,Horowitz N, Campos S, Lee H., Lee J., Krasner C., Berlin S., Roche M., Duska L, Pereira L, Kendall D, Penson R.

To assess time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival in this patient population|to assess toxicities of treatment with combination carboplatin and pemetrexed., 2 years
* Before patients receive any chemotherapy treatments they will be given three medications to prevent side effects from the chemotherapy drugs. These medications are vitamin B12, folic acid and dexamethasone.
* Chemotherapy treatments will be given intravenously in the outpatient clinic. Pemetrexed will be given first and will take 10 minutes to infuse followed by carboplatin which will take 30-45 minutes to infuse. These treatments will be repeated once every three weeks for 6 cycles of chemotherapy (18 weeks).
* Before each chemotherapy treatment the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical exam and medical history; evaluation of ability to undertake daily activities; and blood tests.
* After every 2 cycles of chemotherapy (every 6 weeks) patients will have a CT or MRI scan to measure how well their cancer is responding to treatment.
* The study treatment will last for 6 cycles of chemotherapy as long as the tumor does not grow and the patient isn't experiencing any severe side effects.
