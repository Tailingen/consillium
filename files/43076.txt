This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved prexasertib or LY3300054 as a treatment for any disease.

Prexasertib (LY2606368) is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by preventing the cancer cells from being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of a cell) which then leads to cell death.

A monoclonal antibody is a protein that is made in a laboratory that can target specific substances in the body. LY3300054 is a monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 is a protein often produced by cancer cells or surrounding cells that stops white blood cells from attacking the cancer cells. The drug blocks the protein, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells.
