QUILT-3.033: Haplo NK With SQ ALT-803 for Adults With Relapsed or Refractory AML
This is a multi-institutional Simon's optimal two-stage phase II trial of CD3/CD19 depleted, ALT-803 activated, haploidentical donor NK cells and subcutaneous ALT-803 given after lymphodepleting chemotherapy (CY/FLU) for the treatment of refractory or released acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: ALT-803
Number of Participants With Complete Remission With or Without Incomplete Platelet Recovery, To estimate the rate of complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) - defined as leukemic clearance and neutrophil recovery without platelet recovery - by day 42 after the infusion of CD3/CD19 depleted, ALT-803 stimulated, donor NK cells and subcutaneous ALT-803 given after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen for the treatment of refractory or released acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Day 42 post NK cell infusion
Incidence of in Vivo Expansion ≥100 of Donor Derived NK Cells Per /μl Blood, Number of patients with successful in vivo NK-cell expansion which is defined by measuring an absolute circulating donor-derived NK cell count of ≥100 cells/μl in patient's peripheral blood., Day 14 post NK cell infusion|Number of Participants Experiencing ALT-803 Associated Toxicity, Toxicity will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE), Day 0|Number of Participants Experiencing ALT-803 Associated Toxicity, Toxicity will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE), Day 5|Number of Participants Experiencing ALT-803 Associated Toxicity, Toxicity will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE), Day 7|Number of Participants Experiencing ALT-803 Associated Toxicity, Toxicity will be classified and graded according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE), Day 10|Number of Participants With Treatment Related Mortality, To evaluate the safety of the therapy as measured by rate of treatment related mortality (TRM) at 6 months, 6 months post-therapy
