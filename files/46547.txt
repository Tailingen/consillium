A Study to Evaluate the Combination of Nivolumab With ADG106 in Metastatic NSCLC
This is an open label, non-randomised phase 1b/2 study including patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti PD1/PDL1 with or without CTLA4 inhibitors) and platinum-based chemotherapy. The study medications include nivolumab, an anti-PD1 inhibitor and ADG106, an agonist antibody of 4-1-BB.

The investigators hypothesize that the combination of nivolumab and ADG106 would be tolerable, and demonstrate significant clinical anti-tumour activity in patients with NSCLC that has failed antiPD1/antiPDL1 immunotherapy and standard platinum-based chemotherapy. The investigators propose to conduct a phase 1b/2 study to investigate this strategy.
