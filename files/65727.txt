Study of DF6215 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase I/Ib, First-In-Human, Multi-Part, Open-Label Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Biological and Clinical Activity of DF6215 Monotherapy and in Combination Therapy in Patients with Advanced (Unresectable, Recurrent, or Metastatic) Solid Tumors; is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of DF6215 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study is open-label, meaning both participants and investigators are aware of the treatment being administered.

DRUG: DF6215|DRUG: pembrolizumab|DRUG: KEYTRUDA®
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of DF6215 Monotherapy and in Combination with Pembrolizumab, Determine the maximum tolerated dose of DF6215 both as monotherapy and when combined with pembrolizumab, by assessing the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities., First 28 days for monotherapy; first 42 days for combination therapy.|Safety and Tolerability of DF6215 Monotherapy and in Combination with Pembrolizumab, Evaluate the safety and tolerability of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab at various dose levels by monitoring the incidence, severity, and causality of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and TEAEs leading to discontinuation, per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Continuously throughout the study, up to 2 years.|Efficacy Expansion: Clinical Activity of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination of Pembrolizumab, To evaluate the clinical activity of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, measured by ORR per investigator assessment as defined by RECIST 1.1 in the efficacy expansion part., Assessed from the start of treatment until disease progression or study end, up to 2 years.
Clinical Activity: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Evaluate the clinical activity of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, measured by ORR, DCR, and CBR as per RECIST 1.1., Assessed every 8 weeks until disease progression or study termination, up to 2 years.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameters, Assess the PK of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab at multiple dose levels, measured by PK parameters such as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-t), maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin), time to reach maximum concentration (tmax), and half-life (t½)., Samples collected at predetermined time points across the first and second cycles and periodically thereafter.|Immunogenicity: Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs), To assess the immunogenicity of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, measured by incidence of patients with anti-drug antibodies against DF6215., Samples collected at predetermined time points across the first and second cycles and periodically thereafter.
This Phase I/Ib trial involves multiple parts and includes both dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DF6215, an investigational biologic agent, when administered either as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, a known immunotherapy drug, and evaluate the clinical activity of DF6215 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives include assessing pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy based on tumor response using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The trial will enroll adult patients with advanced (unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic) solid tumors, and the study design allows for dose modifications based on safety monitoring and the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The trial will also incorporate a safety monitoring committee to review data at regular intervals to ensure patient safety .
