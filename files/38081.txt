A Dose Escalation Study of AV-380 in Cancer Patients With Cachexia
This open label ascending dose study is designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of AV-380 in cancer patients with Cachexia. AV-380 is an immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) intended to bind circulating human growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine involved in cancer-induced cachexia.
