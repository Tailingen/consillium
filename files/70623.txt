Clinical Study for Energy Based Devices in Open Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
Surgery is the first standard treatment for stomach cancer, but it still has negative factors such as bleeding, leakage, closure, surgery part infection and cardiovascular and lung complication by general anesthesia.

electric cautery is used extensively in surgery room due to the utility of simultaneous severance and hemostasis. In some case, the electric current from vitality electrode may unexpectedly stimulate or damage nearby muscles and nerves. Ultrasonically activated shears (UAS) is a device to transform the protein of organ for organ incision or hemostasis. General advantages possibly include shortened operating time, decrease of operative blood loss, and relatively less damages to the normal organ. UAS is commonly used in the operation room, which is now considered as a secure and useful medical device for for tissue dissection and coagulation. Also, it is expected to lower the risk of surgery by reducing operating time and blood loss.

However, clinical evidence is not sufficient for this device until now. Therefore, in this study,

1. Evaluate the utility, efficacy, and safety of energy based device, in the case of open gastrectomy
2. Would like to compare the following two kinds of energy based devices. A. For conventional monopolar electrosurgery group : dissection and sealing will be conducted by conventional monopolar electrocautery device B. For UAS group : dissection and sealing will be conducted by UAS
