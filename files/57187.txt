Role of Activin A (ActA) in the Human Cancer Cachexia
The goal of the investigators study is to investigate the role of a hormone named Activin A (ActA) in the development of the skeletal muscle atrophy caused by cancer. According to the investigators hypothesis, ActA could be released by the tumor and activate a muscle atrophy gene program. To answer this question, the investigators plan first to compare circulating levels of ActA in cancer patients with and without cachexia. In a second step, the investigators would like to assess whether ActA circulating levels are predictive for the development of cachexia and short survival.
