In-Home Sensor Monitoring of Older Adults With Cancer
The investigators propose a pilot study of monitoring a sample of 6 older patients receiving active cancer treatment over a period of 6 months with in-home sensor monitors installed and maintained by Foresite Healthcare. The investigators also propose exploring the beliefs and attitudes of those who are not willing to allow in-home sensor monitoring by asking them to complete a brief survey related to in-home sensor monitoring. The investigators hypothesize that patients will find the equipment acceptable and unintrusive, that changes in home-monitored patient parameters will precede clinical events and that patient trajectories will be more fully characterized with the in home sensors.

OTHER: In-home sensor monitoring
Acceptability of in-home sensor monitoring as measured by a modified version of the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging Technology Survey (Arm A only), * 11 questions about how the participant would feel about in-home sensor monitoring, the participant can choose from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree. A higher score means the participant that does not feel comfortable with in-home sensor monitoring
* 2 questions about concerns about information gathered by the in-home sensor monitoring might be shared, answers range from 1 = very concerned to 4 = not concerned at all. A higher score indicates participants are uncomfortable with sharing of in-home sensor monitoring data.
* 4 questions about the participants experience with in-home sensor monitoring, the participant can choose from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree. A lower score indicates that the participant feels like in-home sensor monitoring interferes with their daily activities., 6 months|Heart rate (Arm A only), -A meaningful change is heart rate outside the normal range of 60-100, 6 months|Changes in gait speed of .1m/s or more (Arm A only), 6 months|Stride length (Arm A only), 6 months|Number of Falls (Arm A only), 6 months|Number of Hospitalizations (Arm A only), 6 months|Number of Emergency room visits (Arm A only), 6 months|Number of Infections requiring medical intervention (e.g. oral antibiotics) (Arm A only), 6 months|Number of grade â‰¥3 adverse events measured by CTCAE (Arm A only), 6 months|Patient reported outcomes of 10 common symptoms (Arm A), * The reported symptoms are decreased appetite, pain, decreased activity level, depressed mood, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, shortness of breath, and insomnia
* Patient reports on a scale of 1-5 with 1 indicating the symptom is absent and 5 indicating the symptom is severe, 6 months|Reason for not choosing in-home monitoring as measured by a modified version of the Intelligent Systems for Assessment of Aging Changes Technology Survey (Arm B only), * 11 questions about how the participant would feel about in-home sensor monitoring, the participant can choose from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree. A higher score means that the participant that does not feel comfortable with in-home sensor monitoring
* 2 questions about concerns about information gathered by the in-home sensor monitoring might be shared, answers range from 1 = very concerned to 4 = not concerned at all.
