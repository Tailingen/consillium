presence of detrusor muscle in the resected sample, yes/no, 1 year of follow up
The main objective of the study is to assess the quality of the resection, defined as the presence of detrusor muscle in the resected tissue.

The secondary objetives are:

* Compare the surgical time, hospital stay, urinary catheterization time and incidence of complications.
* Compare tumor recurrence after one year of follow up.
* Determine the number of re-TURB as a consequence of the absence of muscle layer in the sample or artifacts (Tx)
* Establish the incidence of conversions as a consequence of difficulties in the technique or intraoperative bleeding.
* Compare the degree of satisfaction of the surgeon
