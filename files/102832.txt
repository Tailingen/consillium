Afatinib and Cetuximab in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 Insertion Positive Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
This is a single arm open-label multi-center phase II study, investigating disease control rate after 18 weeks of treatment with afatinib/cetuximab combination therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Afatinib|DRUG: Cetuximab
Disease control rate after 18 weeks, To determine the disease control rate at 18 weeks of afatinib and cetuximab treatment in patients with NSCLC harboring an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation., 18 weeks
Objective tumor response, Objective tumor response (complete response and partial response)determined by RECIST v1.1., Scans every 6 weeks until tumor progression, start of another treatment or death.|Safety (intensity and incidence of adverse events), Safety as indicated by intensity and incidence of adverse events, graded according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03., Up to 30 days after last study drug intake.|Duration of response (DOR), Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, Scans every 6 weeks until tumor progression|Progression free survival, Time from the date of start treatment to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined by RECIST1.1, or death due to any cause, Until progression, every 6 weeks up to progression|Overall survival, Time form date of start treatment to the date of death from any cause, Every 6 weeks up to death
Genetic profiling to assess predictors of response and resistance - circulating free (cf)DNA, cfDNA samples will be collected to assess predictors of response and resistance., At baseline, cycle 1 day 15 and at treatment discontinuation (expected 6 months after start)
