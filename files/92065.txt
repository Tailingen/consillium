Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate both the efficacy and toxicity of infusional arsenic trioxide in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML). In addition, correlation between pharmacokinetic data and both therapeutic response and therapy-related toxicities will be sought.
Leukemia
DRUG: arsenic trioxide
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or minimum effective dose (MED), 6 weeks|Efficacy (response and survival) at the MTD - Phase 2 only, 18 weeks
Acute and chronic toxicities, 18 weeks|Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and their correlation with toxicities and response, 18 weeks|Evaluation of PML/RARA and PML protein redistribution and degradation following treatment and their correlation with response, 18 weeks
OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours daily for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest period. Patients may receive up to 3 courses of treatment.

Dose escalation continues in cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or minimum effective dose (MED) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The MED is defined as the dose at which 4 of 6 patients achieve a complete cytogenetic or molecular response. After the MTD or MED is determined, an additional 20 patients are enrolled at this dose level.

Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and every three months for an additional 1.5 years.
