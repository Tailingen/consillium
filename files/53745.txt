Study of AZD0466 Monotherapy or in Combination in Patients With Advanced Haematological Malignancies
The purpose of the study is to the evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of AZD0466 as monotherapy in partciapants with advanced haematological malignancies and also to assess drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential between AZD0466 and the azole antifungal voriconazole.

Module 1: Complete Response Rate (CR+CRi), To estimate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AZD0466 by assessment of complete response rate \[complete remission+complete remission with incomplete recovery (CR+CRi)\] defined as the proportion of participants with a best response of CR or CRi., Day 1 until post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 1: Time to Response (TTR), To estimate the preliminary antitumor activity of AZD0466 by assessment of TTR defined as the time from date of first dose until the date of first documented CR or CRi., Day 1 until post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 1: Duration of Response (DoR), To estimate the preliminary antitumor activity of AZD0466 by assessment of DoR defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or CRi) until date of documented progression, relapse or failure or death due to any cause., Day 1 until post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 1: Overall Survival (OS), To estimate preliminary anti-tumor activity of AZD0466 by assessment of OS defined as time from date of first dose until the date of death due to any cause., Day 1 until post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) and survival follow-up (every month after last dose) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 2: Area under the plasma concentration-curve (AUC) of AZD4320 after administration of AZD0466 alone and in combination with voriconazole, Assessment of AUC to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential between AZD0466 and the azole antifungal voriconazole., Cycle 1 Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and days 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and beyond (Cycle length 28-days) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 2: Maximum observed plasma (peak) drug concentration (Cmax) of AZD4320 after administration of AZD0466 alone and in combination with voriconazole, Assessment of Cmax to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential between AZD0466 and the azole antifungal voriconazole., Cycle 1: Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and days 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and beyond (Cycle length 28-days) (up to 3.5 Years)|Module 1 and Module 2: Plasma concentration of AZD4320, Assessment of AZD4320 to characterise the PK profile of AZD0466 following intravenous administration (via PK profiles of the active moiety AZD4320 in plasma)., Module 1: Cycle 1 Days 1-30 (Cycle length 21 days) to Cycle 3 Days 1-28, and beyond (Cycle length 28 days); Module 2: Cycle 1 Days 1-8, Days 15-19 (Cycle length 21 days), Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and beyond (Cycle length 28-days) (up to 3.5 Years)
The study consists of 2 individual modules as: Module 1 (AZD0466 monotherapy), and Module 2 (DDI study of AZD0466 with voriconazole).

Eligible participants will be assigned to study treatments across Modules 1 and 2.

1. Module 1: AZD0466 monotherapy will include 2 parts- Part A dose escalation cohorts and Part B dose expansion cohorts. Initiation of Part B will depend on the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and PK in Part A.
2. Module 2: AZD0466 and voriconazole DDI study.

All participants will receive AZD0466, and administration will continue until disease progression, initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or other reasons to discontinue study treatment.
