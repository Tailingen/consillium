Pharmacokinetics of Itraconazole in Pediatric Cancer Patients
This study investigated repeated-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxyitraconazole in pediatric cancer patients at risk for the development of invasive fungal disease.
Pediatric, Cancer
DRUG: Itraconazole
To investigate repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxyl itraconazole in pediatric cancer patients, 1. Itraconazole administration 1) Oral for prophylaxis: 2mg/kg/dose,q12hr 2) IV for empirical therapy : After more than 2 days of oral prophylaxis, patients with persistent neutropenic fever / Induction : 5 mg/kg/dose, q12hr X 4 doses / Maintenance : 5 mg/kg/dose,q24hr
2. Sampling 1) During oral : prior to the 5th dose 2) During IV : prior to the every induction and 1-5th maintenance doses, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24hr after the 3rd IV maintenance
3. Analysis of drug concentrations : Plasma concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyl-itraconazole are measured using HPLC., 28 days
To assess empirical antifungal efficacy and safety in pediatric cancer patients, 1. Efficacy evaluation : Treatment is considered successful if all five of the following criteria are met : treatment of baseline fungal infection, absence of breakthrough fungal infection, survival for 7 days after completion, resolution of fever (\<38Â°C for 48hrs) in neutropenia, and no premature discontinuation because of drug related toxicity or lack of efficacy.
2. Safety evaluation : Laboratory are performed at the time of enrollment, twice weekly during therapy, and 1 week after the end of therapy. Drug-related toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (v4.0)., 28 days
This study investigated repeated-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxyitraconazole in pediatric cancer patients at risk for the development of invasive fungal disease.
