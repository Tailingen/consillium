Biobank for Cholestatic Liver Diseases.
This study is a biobank of specimens and clinical data for use in current and future research to better understand the cholestatic liver diseases primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

This study is a biobank of specimens and clinical data for use in current and future research to better understand the cholestatic liver diseases primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

Blood, saliva, stool, and urine samples will be collected periodically during patient visits or via a mail-home kit. Bile and bile duct cells will be collected during clinically necessary Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Anticipated research will focus on multi-omics assessments of biospecimens to better define how these diseases start and progress in order to develop novel tests for early detection of complication and better disease prognostication.
