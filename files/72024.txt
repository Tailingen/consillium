Oncaspar/Doxil/Decadron in Patients With Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies
This is an exploratory study to study the efficacy of combination regimen of Oncaspar/Doxil/Decadron (ODD) in patients with refractory lymphoid malignancies. Patients with any form of lymphoid malignancy will be eligible: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia. Patients must have failed standard regimens for their cancers and could have had unlimited number of prior regimens. Patients will be staged appropriately for their disease with clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Both Oncaspar and Doxil will be given on day 1 and 15. Patients will be clinically evaluated prior to each cycle and will have disease assessments every 2 cycles. Responding patients will continue therapy until disease progression or excessive toxicity. Responders who are candidates for allogenic stem cell transplantation could go to conditioning chemotherapy and stem cell transplant after 4 cycles of ODD.

This phase II trial will study the effectiveness of a combination regimen which includes Oncaspar (PEG-asparaginase), Doxil (PEG-liposomal doxorubicin), and Decadron (ODD) in terms of disease response against refractory lymphoid malignancies. Asparaginase is an enzyme that depletes asparagines, a key amino acid for survival and growth of malignant lymphocytes. Its depletion results in death of the neoplastic cell. Asparagine depletion has induced a significant improvement of clinical outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and L-asparaginase has been a mainstay for more than 30 years in the treatment of ALL. Although this drug has been used primarily in ALL, promising results have been reported even in other non-ALL lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia, refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). One of the main goals of this trial is to measure the asparaginase level as a surrogate marker of asparagine depletion with Oncaspar, a PEG-enhanced version of E. coli L-asparaginase. The therapeutic value of the simple, non-pegylated form of L-asparaginase is limited by its short half-life and propensity to cause allergic reactions.
