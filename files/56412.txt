Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel Followed by Cetuximab for Head and Neck Cancer
A study of Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel followed by Cetuximab for head and neck cancer patients to determine their effect on the control and reduction of tumor size
Head and Neck Cancer|Carcinoma, Squamous
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Cetuximab
Efficacy Measured by Response Rate in Participants, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT and MRI:

* Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions;
* Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions;
* Stable Disease (NR/SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter since the treatment started;
* Progressive Disease (PD), A 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions (target lesions), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., 12 Weeks, 1 Year
This is a non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to assess the effects of oxaliplatin and docetaxel followed by epidermal factor-antibody (EGFR-AB) cetuximab on patients with previously treated recurrent /metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Head and neck tissue will also be tested to determine if the protein Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is present in the cancer cells.
