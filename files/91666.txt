Zoledronic Acid and Positron Emission Tomography in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: A positron emission tomography scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where tumor cells are found. This study is looking at whether the drug zoledronic acid interferes with the ability of a PET scan to find tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well positron emission tomography works when given together with zoledronic acid in finding tumor cells in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
OTHER: 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]FLT|PROCEDURE: Single photon emission computed tomography
PET Response Rate, FLT PET scan will be done 6-8 days after the dose of zoledronic acid
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the PET response rate after zoledronic acid in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 dose of zoledronic acid on day 1 followed by 3'-deoxy-3'-\[18F\]fluorothymidine/PET to determine standardized uptake value.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
