Study of RP3 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Therapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced or Recurrent SCCHN
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 2-cohort (Locoregionally Advanced Cohort or Recurrent/Metastatic Cohort) study evaluating RP3 in combination with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) followed by nivolumab (for the LA Cohort) or combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab (for the R/M Cohort) in patients with advanced, inoperable squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), including of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or unknown primary.

Each item is scored in a 5 point Likert-type scale: 0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Some-what, 3=Quite a bit, and 4=Very much. The higher the score, the worse the patient outcome., From Day 1 to 52 Weeks.|LA Cohort: Summary of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measured by EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire which consists of 2 pages: EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale which is numbered from 0 to 100. 0 means the worst health the patient can imagine. 100 means the best health the patient can imagine. The higher the score, the better the patient outcome., From Day 1 to 52 Weeks|LA Cohort: Frequency, Nature, and Severity of TEAEs and SAEs, Percentage of subjects with TEAEs and SAEs, From Screening through 60 days after last dose of RP3, or 100 days after last dose of nivolumab, or 28 days after last dose of either cisplatin, carboplatin, or paclitaxel, whichever occurs last|R/M Cohort: Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of progression of disease, which was subsequently confirmed, or death by any cause, whichever occurs first, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Progression-free Survival Rates at 6 and 12 Months, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of progression of disease, which was subsequently confirmed, or death by any cause, whichever occurs first, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 12 months)|R/M Cohort: Overall Survival Rates at 1, 2, and 3 Years, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of death by any cause, From Day 1 to date of death by any cause (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from documented response until the date of progression of disease, which was subsequently confirmed or with no further follow-up, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Duration of Clinical Benefit, Duration of clinical benefit is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to last progression of disease, which was subsequently confirmed or with no further follow-up for response, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, for subjects who achieve complete response, partial response, or stable disease, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Complete Response Rate, Percentage of subjects achieving a complete response, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Disease Control Rate, Percentage of patients achieving complete response, partial response, or stable disease, From Day 1 to documented progression of disease (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Number of Patients Who Undergo Attempted Definitive Resection, Number of Patients Who Undergo Attempted Definitive Resection, From Day 1 to end of study (up to 3 years)|R/M Cohort: Frequency, Nature, and Severity of TEAEs and SAEs, Percentage of subjects with TEAEs and SAEs, From Screening through 60 days after last dose of RP3, or 100 days after last dose of nivolumab, or 28 days after last dose of either cisplatin, carboplatin, or paclitaxel, whichever occurs last
RP3 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) that expresses exogenous genes (anti-CTLA-4 antibody, CD40 ligand and h4-1BBL) designed to directly kill tumor cells and generate a systemic anti-tumor immune response
