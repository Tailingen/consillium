The Association Between Calretinin and the Function of Ganglion Cells in Hirschsprung Disease
This study aims to compare the outcomes of patients with long segment Hirschsprung disease or total colonic aganglionosis who had negative calretinin staining and positive ganglion cells on the proximal resection margins to those who had both positive findings.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Calretinin staining
Long-term outcomes (Quality of life questionnaire), To determine if calretinin has a role in the function of ganglion cells in long segment Hirschsprung disease and total colonic aganglionosis.

HAQL (Hirschsprung's disease and Anorectal malformations Quality of Life) questionnaire. For each item the response is scored from 0 to 3 and then, linearly transformed to a 0 (minimum value) to 100 (maximum value) scale. Higher score suggests a better quality of life., 1 year
