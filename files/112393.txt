A Phase I Study of Bendamustine Hydrochloride in Patients With Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor effect of bendamustine hydrochloride (SyB L-0501) in patients with indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: bendamustine hydrochloride
Non-Hematological toxicity; > grade three(CTCAE v.3.0), during the treatment cycle (twenty one days)
All adverse events or adverse reactions, during the treatment cycle (twenty one days)|Pharmacokinetics profile
Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives for patients with indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
