Study of Pembrolizumab, Lenvatinib and Chemotherapy Combination in First Line Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single arm, 2 parts, phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib plus standard of care chemotherapy (with carboplatin and etoposide ) in subjects with histologically confirmed extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who have not previously received systemic therapy for this malignancy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Carboplatin
Part 1: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability) of lenvatinib 8 mg to be used in combination with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, Occurrence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria., From the subject's written consent to participate in the study through 90 days after the final administration of the drug|Part 2:To assess the efficacy of the treatment in terms of the Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by investigator per RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., From the date of the end of induction treatment until 12 months
Part 1 (for patients treated at part 2): Objective response per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator, Objective response is a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator per RECIST 1.1., From the date of the end of treatment until 12 months|Part 1 (for patients treated at part 2): Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever is earlier), for participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR or PR. Response will be determined by BICR per RECIST 1.1., From date of documentation of tumor response until date of first documented progression, assessed up to 12 months|Part 1 (for patients treated at part 2): Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of death from any cause., From the date of the end of treatment until 12 months|Part 2: Objective response per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator, Objective response is a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator per RECIST 1.1., From the date of the end of treatment until 12 months|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause (whichever is earlier), for participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR or PR. Response will be determined by BICR per RECIST 1.1., From date of documentation of tumor response until date of first documented progression, assessed up to 12 months|Part 2:Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of death from any cause., From the date of the end of treatment until 12 months|Part 2: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability) of treatment, Occurrence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, From the subject's written consent to participate in the study through 90 days after the final administration of the drug
A total of 85 subjects will be assigned to study treatment with pembrolizumab + lenvatinib + chemotherapy. Positive tumor programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression will not be required for enrollment; however, subjects' tumors will be screened for PD-L1 expression.

The primary endpoint for the Part 1 is to determine the safety of the combination. The primary endpoint for Part 2 is to determine the Progression Free survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1. assessed by investigator.

The sponsor estimates that the trial will require approximately 4 years from the time the first participant signs the informed consent until the last participant's last study-related telephone call or visit (2 years recruiting patients, 1 year of treatment and at least 1 year of follow up)
