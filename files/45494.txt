CS-7017 in Combination With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Subjects With Stage IIIb/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CS-7017 administered orally twice a day in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of CS-7017 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Best Overall Response and Objective Response Rate Following Administration of CS-7017 in Combination With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Chemotherapy-naïve Subjects With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), The best overall response is the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response \[CR\], confirmed partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], and progressive disease \[PD\]) among all overall responses from the start of treatment until the participant withdraws from the study. Participants who did not have a tumor assessment, the best overall response is Not Evaluable (NE). The response rate was defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR, ie, \[confirmed and unconfirmed, (CR + PR) / number of participants\]. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions, CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, PD was defined as ≥20 increase in the smallest sum of diameters, and SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Baseline up to Week 18 postdose|CS-7017-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in Participants in Any Treatment Group After Administration of CS-7017 and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Stage IIIb/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those adverse events that occur, having been absent before the study, or worsen in severity after the initiation of study drug. CS-7017-related TEAEs are those TEAEs that are related to CS-7017 in the relationship., Baseline to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 1 year
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CS-7017 administered orally twice a day in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of CS-7017 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
