A Phase II Study of MRG003 Injection Combined With Pucotenlimab Injection ± Cisplatin Injection in the Neoadjuvant Treatment Locally Advanced EGFR-positive Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
A Randomized, Phase II Study of MRG003 in Combination With Pucotenlimab Injection ± Cisplatin in Patients With Locally Advanced EGFR-positive Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration of MRG003 in Combination With Pucotenlimab Injection ± Cisplatin in HNSCC who are eligible for resection.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
DRUG: MRG003 combined with Pucotenlimab|DRUG: MRG003 combined with Pucotenlimab+Cisplatin
pCR, Pathological complete response rate, After surgery (approximately 9-10 weeks after start of study treatment)
EFS EFS, Event free survival, 1 years|ORR, Objective response rate, 9-10 weeks|OS, Overall survival, 2 years|Number of patients with Adverse Events (AEs), 79/5000 The incidence, severity and correlation of adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), immune-related adverse events (irAE), and laboratory index outliers were determined according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 standards, Up to approximately 1 years|Incidence of surgery-related AE/SAE (adverse events/serious adverse events), Rate of delayed or canceled surgery, length of surgery, length of hospital stay, method of surgery, and incidence of surgery-related AE/SAE (adverse events/serious adverse events) within 90 days after surgery, 90 days|Proportion of reduction in clinical stage after treatment, The proportion of clinical stage reduction after combination therapy in the target study population, 9-10 weeks
In this study, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the MRG003 Injection Combined With Pucotenlimab Injection treatment group (Cohort 1), or the MRG003 Injection Combined With Pucotenlimab Injection + Cisplatin treatment group (Cohort 2). Pathological response rate will be the primary outcome measures. Adverse events will also be recorded.
