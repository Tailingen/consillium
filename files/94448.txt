Taletrectinib Phase 2 Global Study in ROS1 Positive NSCLC
The main purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of taletrectinib (also known as AB-106 or DS-6051b) monotherapy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

This is a global Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of taletrectinib in patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.

About 224 patients will be enrolled and divided into 6 cohorts, depending on past history of ROS1 TKI treatment.

In the cohorts open to enrollment, taletrectinib will be administered either 400mg or 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. In one cohort, this will be in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed both administered by IV infusion in 21-day cycles for 4 cycles. Patients will continue with the treatment on taletrectinib until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.

The tumor response evaluation will be conducted on a regular basis until progression of disease. Long-term survival follow up will be conducted as well.
