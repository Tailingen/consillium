Clinical Study of CLDN18.2 PET/CT for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Gastric and Pancreatic Cancer
In this study, we will investigate the diagnostic efficacy and safety of \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-3A12 and \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-3A12 in metastatic gastric and pancreatic cancers, and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the use of \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-3A12 and \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-3A12 for diagnosing metastatic gastric and pancreatic cancers . This study will provide a new method for the noninvasive target-specific diagnosis of gastric and pancreatic cancer, and provide intuitive and clear imaging basis for clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment.

RADIATION: [18F]F-H3RESCA-3A12Âèä[68Ga]Ga-NOTA-3A12
To assess the sensitivity and specificity of using [18F]F-H3RESCA-3A12 and [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-3A12 for the diagnosis of metastatic gastric and pancreatic cancer, In this study, we will first investigate the safety and feasibility of \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-3A12 and \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-3A12 in metastatic gastric and pancreatic cancers. The secondary goal of the clinical trial is to preliminary assess the sensitivity and specificity of using \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-3A12 or \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-3A12 PET/CT imaging for the diagnosis of metastatic gastric or pancreatic cancers., 90mins from time of injection
