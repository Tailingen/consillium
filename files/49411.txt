A Study of Radiation Therapy Before CAR T Cell Therapy for People With B Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test whether radiation therapy given before standard CAR T cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for people with relapsed and refractory B cell lymphoma. The researchers will also study whether radiation therapy used in this study is a practical treatment option before standard CAR T cell therapy.
