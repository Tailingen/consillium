iNod™ Ultrasound-Guided Needle Biopsy System Study
The purpose of this study is to collect information on the iNod™ System's safety and ability to see the iNod™ biopsy needle in real-time in endobronchial lesions, peripheral lung nodules, or lung masses.
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule|Multiple Pulmonary Nodules|Biopsy, Fine-Needle
DEVICE: iNod™ System
Proportion of patients where the needle is visualized by the iNOD system inside the lesion, Successful "Tool in lesion", defined as visualization of the tracheobronchial biopsy needle (TBNA) inside the targeted lesion within the ultrasound field of view., Procedure|Adverse Events, Proportion of subjects with Adverse Events related to the iNod device and/or study procedure, as well as Adverse Events related to any subsequent crossover procedures., Procedure
Biopsy Yield, Diagnostic biopsy yield, defined as ability for histopathologist to report a specific benign or malignant diagnosis, stratified by concentric and eccentric lesion location., Procedure|Diagnostic Accuracy, Diagnostic accuracy at 12 months., 12 months post procedure|Device Rotation, Ability to reposition the needle into a different location within targeted lesions, if desired., Procedure|Crossover Rate, Crossover rate to radial EBUS or any alternative standard of care procedure., Procedure
This post-market study intends to further demonstrate the ability and safety of the iNod™ Ultrasound Guidance System and iNod™ Ultrasound Biopsy needle to perform transbronchial needle biopsy of endobronchial lesions, peripheral lung nodules, or lung masses under real-time ultrasound visualization. This is a prospective, multi-center case series of standard of care peripheral lung nodule biopsy procedures with up to 115 subjects at up to 10 centers.
