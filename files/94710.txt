Minimize Radioactive Iodine Ablation Of Remnant Thyroid in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
The researchers investigated the rate of biochemical remission in patients without radioactive iodine therapy compared to patients with low dose radioactive iodine treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer patients who underwent total thyroidectomy.
