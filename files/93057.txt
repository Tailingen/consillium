Optimization for the Treatment of Advanced Pulmonary Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
The primary endpoint is to compare the PFS (progress-free survival ) of etoposide plus carboplatin with paclitaxel combined with carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Pulmonary Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
DRUG: etoposide plus carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel plus carboplatin
Progression-free survival, Interval from randomization to disease progression, or untolerated toxicity, 6 months
Tumor response, Percentage of complete response and partial response, 2 months
The primary endpoint is to compare the PFS (progress-free survival ) of etoposide plus carboplatin with paclitaxel combined with carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

In addition, gene spectrum detection and Mini-PDX are applied for validation of pharmacodynamic.

Results of clinical trials and pharmacodynamic test will be analyzed to provide evidence for the precise treatment for LCNEC.
