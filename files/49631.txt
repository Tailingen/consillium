Study of Adding AMG 479 to First Line Chemotherapy in Patients With Optimally Debulked Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study will determine the value of adding AMG 479 (fully human monoclonal antibody against IGF-1R) to paclitaxel and carboplatin first line chemotherapy in patients with optimally debulked (\<1 cm) FIGO stage III and IV (positive pleural cytology only) ovarian epithelial (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) carcinoma.
Ovarian Neoplasms
DRUG: AMG 479|DRUG: AMG 479 Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS): Time From Randomization Until Date of Progression or Death., A patient may have been declared to have progressive disease on the basis of radiological measuremt of tumor lesions assessmt or CA125 evaluation (tumor measuremts taking precedence).Radiological progression was defined as per the RECIST guidelines (Therasse et al, JNCI2000) as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions(ref the smallest sum of the longest diam recorded since the treatmt started or since the appearance of at least 1 new lesion).Serum CA125 progression was defined, according to the 2005 GCIG def: pts with:

* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt and normalization of CA125 has to show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt which never normalized must show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* CA125 in the normal range pretreatmt had to show evidence of CA125 ≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart, Radiological tumor assessment: every 12(+/- 1) weeks for 3 years after randomization + CA 125: day 1 of each cycle
Time To Progression (TTP): Interval From the Date of Randomization to the Date of Disease Progression, A patient may have been declared to have progressive disease on the basis of radiological measuremt of tumor lesions assessmt or CA125 evaluation (tumor measuremts taking precedence).Radiological progression was defined as per the RECIST guidelines (Therasse et al, JNCI2000) as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions(ref the smallest sum of the longest diam recorded since the treatmt started or since the appearance of at least 1 new lesion).Serum CA125 progression was defined, according to the 2005 GCIG def: pts with:

* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt and normalization of CA125 has to show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* Elevated CA125 pretreatmt which never normalized must show evidence of CA125≥ 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart OR
* CA125 in the normal range pretreatmt had to show evidence of CA125 ≥ 2 times the upper normal limit on 2 occasions at least 1 wk apart, Radiological tumor assessment: every 12 (+/- 1) weeks for 3 years after randomization + CA125: day 1 of each cycle|Overall Survival (OS), Interval between the date from randomization to death from any cause whichever came first., Day 1 of each cycle up to 4 years after randomization
