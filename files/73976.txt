The High-Dose Aldesleukin (IL-2) "Select" Trial for Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
High-dose interleukin 2 (Proleukin, Novartis) (IL-2) is approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer and is a standard treatment of this disease. At the present time, IL-2 is the only therapy for kidney cancer that can produce a remission of disease that lasts after treatment is completed. However, most patients who receive IL-2 do not benefit and all patients experience potentially dangerous side effects.

Recent research has suggested that certain patients may respond better to IL-2 than others. The Cytokine Working Group is currently conducting a clinical trial that aims to identify and confirm this research and narrow the application of IL-2 to those patients most likely to benefit.

Objective Response in ISM Good Risk Group, The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. \[Miller et al. Cancer 1981\] Per WHO, evaluation of tumor measurements of measurable lesions centers on the percent change from baseline in the sum of the perpendicular diameters. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all clinical and laboratory evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) is a \>/= 50% decrease. PR status also requires no simultaneous increase in the size of any metastatic lesion, absence of one or more new metastatic lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. CR and PR status needs confirmation within 4 weeks. Response status was determined by investigator assessment of radiographs., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and during weeks 8 and 12 of each course. Participants received up to 3 courses of 12 weeks duration each. Median (range) days on treatment: 20 (1-262).

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and "good" pathologic predictive features is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.

Secondary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and "poor" pathologic predictive features and to compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with "good" pathologic predictive features.
* To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with response to high-dose IL-2.
* To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most.
