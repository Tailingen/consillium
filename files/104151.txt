Does Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Cause a Delay in the Diagnosis of Gastric Cancer Patients?
The aim of this study is to analyze whether COVID-19 causes a delay in the diagnosis of gastric cancer patients particularly in the TNM staging of the tumor, or not and to compare the number of newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
Stomach Cancer|Corona Virus Infection
PROCEDURE: Gastric cancer surgery
Comparison of the mean monthly numbers of newly diagnosed gastric cancer patients between the groups, numbers of newly diagnosed gastric cancer, from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 -from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019|Comparison of the clinical staging and pathologic TNM staging of the patients, Clinical staging was determined based on the results of a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests including computed tomography (CT), PET CT, endoscopy and the endoscopic ultrasound. Surgical stage refers to the pathologic stage of the surgical specimen determined based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system., from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 -from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019
Comparison of the demographic data, age and gender distributions, mean monthly numbers of newly diagnosed patients, CEA and CEA-19.9 levels, the type of the surgery, the location of the tumor, the frequency of the patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, length of the hospital stay,, from March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 -from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019
The study included the patients diagnosed with gastric cancer during the period between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, in the pandemic group at the Adana City Training and Research Hospital, Department of General Surgery, Divisions of Gastroenterological Surgery and Surgical Oncology. For the baseline group, patients diagnosed with gastric cancer between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, was included in the same department.

Clinical and pathological data of the patients were retrospectively collected from the hospital medical records. The following parameters were compared between the pandemic and baseline periods; age and gender distributions, mean monthly numbers of newly diagnosed patients, CEA and CEA-19.9 levels, the type of the surgery, the location of the tumor, the frequency of the patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, length of the hospital stay, clinical staging and pathologic TNM staging.
