Evaluation for Benign and Malignant Pulmonary Ground-glass Nodules Based on MRI Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Imaging
Computed tomography (CT) is critical for the diagnosis of lung nodules as well as for therapeutic management. Repeated CT examinations will raise the issue of the cumulative radiation dose and subsequent risk of cancer, thus pushing the need for imaging techniques using low or no radiation dose. Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) with ultrashort echo time (UTE) pulse sequences with high signal-to-noise and spatial resolution is a promising alternative for lung nodules imaging.The purpose of the study is to evaluate the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) to discriminate of malignant from benign lesions.
