Biochemical Role of Long Non-coding RNA MALAT 1 and Serum Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha in Bronchial Asthma Patients.
Bronchial asthma affects more than a quarter of a billion people worldwide. It is responsible for over 1000 deaths a day, of which the majority are preventable (Levy, 2015).

Asthma is a common heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of variable respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezes, and cough, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. Airflow limitation may later become persistent (GINA, 2023).

The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of these characteristic symptoms and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests (GINA, 2023).
