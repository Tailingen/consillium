Clinical Trial Comparing Outcomes of Breast Conserving Operations With Classic v High-frequency Electrocoagulation
The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of breast conserving therapy operation depending on the type of surgical tool used: classic electrocoagulation with higher operative temperatures and high frequency electrocoagulation with lower operative temperatures. The investigators would assess the pain levels, length and amount of the lymphatic secretion as well as quality of life following breast conserving surgery.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: classic v high-frequency electrocoagulation
Pain Control, Pain assessment would be performed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at the days 1-5, 10 (+/- 2), 20 (+/- 2), 30 (+/- 2), and 12 weeks (+/- 2 days). SF - MPQ questionnaire would be filled in on admission, 10th (+/- 2) post-operative day and 12 weeks (+/- 2 days)after surgery., From the day before surgery up to 12 weeks (+/-2days) after surgery
Quality of life (QoL), Pre-operative assessment of QoL would be performed by psychologist using questionnaires: CISS, HADS - M, Eysencka. Postoperative assessment of QoL would be performed using QLQ C30 and QLQ BR 23 questionnaires 12 weeks (+/- 2 days)after surgery, From the day before surgery up to 12 weeks (+/-2days) after surgery|Length of lymphatic secretion, Number of days of lymphatic secretion would be assessed., From the day before surgery up to 12 weeks (+/-2days) after surgery|Amount of lymphatic secretion, Amount of lymphatic secretion would be measured until it stops on daily basis., From the day before surgery up to 12 weeks (+/-2days) after surgery
