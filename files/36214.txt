Light Therapy to Increase Energy in Adolescents and Young Adults Newly Diagnosed With Solid Tumors: A Pilot Study
Fatigue is one of the most consistent and distressing symptoms reported by pediatric oncology patients. The investigators' work has demonstrated that in the period from diagnosis through the initial 8 weeks of treatment, adolescents and young adults with solid tumors experience substantial fatigue that is not related to sleep disruption. Fatigue can contribute to many adverse outcomes including poor treatment adherence, reduced social activities, depressive symptoms, behavior problems, and poorer quality of life. Unfortunately, no definitive intervention to reduce fatigue has been developed for pediatric oncology patients. Investigators propose a study to estimate the feasibility and acceptability of bright light therapy as an intervention to decrease fatigue in adolescents and young adults who are newly diagnosed and receiving treatment for solid tumors, including lymphoma.

Rate of consent, Estimate the rates of consent to a BWL intervention, compared to DRL in adolescent/young adult solid tumor and lymphoma patients., Day 0|Rate of adherence, Estimate the rates of adherence to the intervention in adolescent/young adult solid tumor or lymphoma patients for each group., At the end of therapy (Day 60)|Rate of side effects, Estimate rates of side effects in a light therapy intervention trial., At the end of therapy (Day 60)
Rate of fatigue, Estimate the rates of fatigue between the intervention and comparison groups. Fatigue will be measured by self- and parent-report with the 18-item PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (MFS) that includes three subscales: (1) general fatigue (six items), (2) sleep/rest fatigue (six items), and (3) cognitive fatigue (six items)., At the end of therapy (Day 60)
Rate of adherence by participant location, Estimate the effect of participant location (inpatient, hospital-based housing, or home) on adherence., At the end of therapy (Day 60)|Rate of depressive symptoms, Mood symptoms will be assessed with the Children's Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (CDI 2) in participants 8-17 years old and by the BDI-II in participants 18 years of age and older. The CDI 2 is a 27-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms in children ages 7-17., Baseline (Day 0), and approximately Day 14, Day 28 Day 42, and Day 60|Metrics of quality of life and well-being, Quality of life will be assessed by self- and parent-report with the PedsQL™ Acute Version \[34\] that includes 4 subscales: (1) physical functioning (eight items), (2) emotional functioning (five items), (3) social functioning (five items), and (4) school functioning (five items) as well as a total score. The Likert scale and scoring method are identical to the MFS, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life. The PedsQL™ will be completed prior to initiation of the intervention, at three time points during the intervention period (14 +/- 3, 28 +/- 3 days, and 42 +/- 3 days) , and at the end of the 60 day intervention/period (days 61-68)., Baseline (Day 0), and approximately Day 14, Day 28, Day 42, and Day 60
This feasibility and acceptability study will assess the rate of consent to, adherence to, and side effects from a therapy study in a randomized trial comparing bright white light (BWL) to dim red light (DRL). Four questionnaires will be distributed to patients and/or their parents, depending upon the questionnaire, to study the fatigue, quality of life, mood symptoms, and side effects of the BWL/DRL intervention in adolescents and young adults being treated for solid tumors, including lymphoma.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* To estimate the feasibility and acceptability of a BWL intervention compared to a DRL standard comparison group in adolescent/young adult solid tumor and lymphoma patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

* To estimate the effect size of this intervention on measures of fatigue in order to design a larger clinical trial of efficacy of a randomized control trial of BWL versus DRL intervention for fatigue in pediatric oncology patients.

OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the effect of participant location (inpatient, hospital-based housing, or home) on adherence.
* Estimate rates of depressive symptoms.
* Describe quality of life.
