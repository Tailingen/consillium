A Phase II Study of Rulonilimab Combined With Chemotherapy in the First-Line Treatment for Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a single-arm, open-label, and multicenter phase Ⅱ study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rulonilimab combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung Cancer (NSCLC). Two cohorts were designed in this study: cohort 1 (non-squamous NSCLC) and cohort 2 (squamous NSCLC). About 84 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC plan to be enrolled in about 20 study sites of the study.
