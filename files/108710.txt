Microwave Ablation Simultaneously Combined With Lenavatinib for Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation combined lenvatinib simultaneously for recurrent HCC
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Microwave Ablation|Liver Cancer|Lenvatinib|Recurrent Tumor
PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Tumor-free survival rate at 36 months, Progression was defined as progressive disease after microwave ablation by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST or death from any cause, 36 months|Over-all survival (OS) rate at 36 months, OS is the length of time from the date of microwave ablation until death from any cause., 36 months
Adverse events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., 24 months|Complication rate, Complication was defined as the a disease or sythrome caused by the therapy, 36 months
Microwave ablation (MWA) is available as the major curative treatments for early-stage recurrent HCC. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated MWA simultaneously combined Lenvatinib for recurrent HCC. There needs further investigation to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment. Thus, the investigators carried out this randomized, multicenter, prospective trial study to find out it.
