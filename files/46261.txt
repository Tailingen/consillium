Window Trial to Evaluate Molecular Response to PI3K Inhibition With Copanlisib in r/r Adult B-cell ALL
This study will provide an evaluation of biologic markers of leukemia cell response following a single dose of copanlisib prior to any salvage induction therapy in a projected cohort of 10 relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients.
