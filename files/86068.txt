Combination of Durvalumab and BVAC-C in Patients With HPV 16 or 18 Positive Cervical Cancer Failure to First-Line Platinum-based Chemotherapy
This is an exploratory, open label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination of durvalumab with BVAC-C in patients with cervical cancer refractory to or relapse after platinum-based first-line chemotherapy with safety lead-in phase.

The study consists of 2 parts: part A, a safety lead-in phase, and part B, an exploratory safety and efficacy evaluation phase.

Part A will be conducted as a 3+3 dose escalation manner, and part B will be conducted as a non-randomized single arm study.

•Part A: Open-labeled; 3+3 dose-escalation; Multi-center; safety lead-in phase

•Part B: Open-labeled; Non-randomized, Single arm; Multi-center, efficacy evaluation phase
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: BAVC-C+Durvalumab
Part A : Dose-limiting toxicities(DLTs), The primary objective of the part A is to assess the maximum tolerable dose of BVAC-C combined with durvalumab 1500 mg as defined by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be safely used for Part B (single arm phase II)., up to 11 weeks|Part B : Evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy, as measured by 6-month PFS rate, The primary objective of the part B is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy, as measured by 6-month PFS rate, of the combination therapy of durvalumab and BVAC-C in patients with HPV 16 or 18 positive cervical cancer recurrent after or refractory to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy +/-bevacizumab., 6 Months
Best overall response rate(BORR), • To evaluate the response to the combination therapy as measured by best overall response rate (BORR), 12-month and 24-month disease control rate (DCR), 12-month and-24 month progression free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month and 24-month overall survival (OS) rate., 12~24 Months|Disease control rate(DCR), • To evaluate the response to the combination therapy as measured by best overall response rate (BORR), 12-month and 24-month disease control rate (DCR), 12-month and-24 month progression free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month and 24-month overall survival (OS) rate., 12~24 Months|Progression free survival (PFS) rate, • To evaluate the response to the combination therapy as measured by best overall response rate (BORR), 12-month and 24-month disease control rate (DCR), 12-month and-24 month progression free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month and 24-month overall survival (OS) rate., 12~24 Months|Overall survival (OS) rate, • To evaluate the response to the combination therapy as measured by best overall response rate (BORR), 12-month and 24-month disease control rate (DCR), 12-month and-24 month progression free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month and 24-month overall survival (OS) rate., 12~24 Months|Adverse event(AE), • To evaluate the safety of combination therapy of durvalumab and BVAC-C as measured by adverse events (AE), adverse events of special interest (AESI), vital signs, physical examination, safety laboratory tests, including change of lymphocyte subsets from baseline, plasma cytokine level, up to 99 weeks|Adverse events rate of special interest(AESI), • To evaluate the safety of combination therapy of durvalumab and BVAC-C as measured by adverse events (AE), adverse events of special interest (AESI), vital signs, physical examination, safety laboratory tests, including change of lymphocyte subsets from baseline, plasma cytokine level, up to 99 weeks
Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1), PD-L1 expression level, 1-2 day|Tumor mutational burden(TMB), TBM is a biomarker that can predict the response of PD-L1 to treatment., 1-2 day|Rate of Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TIL), Cancers with a DNA repair gene deficiency repair (dMMR) mechanism undergo changes very frequently and accumulate mutations in monomorphic microsatellites (short tandem repeats). And is prone to mismatch errors., 1-2 day|Immune gene expression profile(RNA), We studied immune cell expression profiles for various cancer immune characteristics and confirmed significant differences in OS., 1-2 day|Serum cytokine level(multiplex cytokine assay), Immune cells secrete various cytokines that induce subsequent activation of the immune system. It is worth confirming that BVAC-C can increase blood cytokines., 1-2 day|T cells (ELISPOT), ELISA (The enzyme-linked immunospot) can quantify the cell-mediated immune response with a sensitive technique that can detect cells that produce cytokines at the single cell level. This method of analysis allows for rapid, reproducible, and infrequent direct counting of antigen-specific T cells., 1-2 day|HPV types, Biopsy samples will be continuously evaluated to search for biomarkers other than immune profiles and gene signatures that can predict responsiveness to concomitant administration., 1-2 day
