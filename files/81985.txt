A Novel "Pediatric-Inspired" Regimen With Reduced Myelosuppressive Drugs for Adults (Aged 18-60) With Newly Diagnosed Ph Negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to find out whether the combination of chemotherapy drugs that are routinely used in children with ALL, will be safe and effective in treating adult patients with ALL. The standard treatment for adults with ALL consists of many chemotherapy drugs that are given in different combinations and in several steps. In adult ALL there is no standard which drugs to give and how to combine them. Some leukemias have a chromosome abnormality called Philadelphia chromosome (also called Ph Positive) and some leukemias do not (called Ph Negative). In this study we want to see whether this combination of chemotherapy drugs will be safe and effective in treating adult patients with Ph Negative ALL.

rate of molecular remission, i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status, as assessed by PCR and flow cytometry in the bone marrow after phase I induction., 1 year
complete remission (CR), All three criteria must be met for clinical complete remission:

* Peripheral Blood Counts. The absolute neutrophil count should be ≥1,000/μl (sustained without growth factor support), and platelet count should be ≥100,000/μl (without transfusions), and no circulating blasts. After Induction remission assessment, blood counts are considered recovered at ANC ≥ 1,000 and PLT ≥75,000.
* Bone Marrow Aspirate. Bone marrow cellularity should be approximate normal with evidence of maturation of all cell lineages and should contain \<5% blasts.
* Extramedullary Leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be present. If the patient had CNS involvement by ALL at the time of starting the study, the CNS involvement should be re-examined and interval determined by the treating physicians in order to determine if clinical complete remission, 1 year|overall survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the start of induction therapy to death or last follow-up., 1 year|event-free survival (EFS), EFS survival will be calculated from the start of induction therapy to relapse (molecular or clinical), death, or last follow-up., 1 year|disease free survival (DFS) rates, DFS will be calculated from the time of clinical CR (or better) to relapse (molecular or clinical), death, or last follow-up., 1 year|minimal residual disease (MRD) status, Molecular relapse is defined as the conversion of RT-PCR from MRD negative to MRD positive on two consecutive tests performed on bone marrow at least one week apart, while still meeting criteria for clinical CR., 1 year|safety, Number of participants with adverse events. Frequencies of toxicities based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 will be tabulated., 1 year
