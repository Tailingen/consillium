A Single Arm Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for Patients With HER2 Mutant NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in participants with HER2 mutant metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.
HER2-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan
ICR-assessed ORR (Objective Response Rate), Confirmed ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response or partial response, as assessed by independent central review(ICR) based on RECIST 1.1., At an average of approximately 14 months
Investigator-assessed ORR (Objective Response Rate), Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, as determined by the investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1, An average of approximately 14 months|ICR-assessed and Investigator-assessed DoR (Duration of Response), DoR is time from the initial confirmed response (CR or PR) until documented tumour progression or death from any cause., At an average of approximately 14 months|ICR-assessed and Investigator-assessed DCR (Disease Control Rate), DCR is the percentage of participants who achieved confirmed CR, PR, or SD during study intervention., Approximately 6 weeks|ICR-assessed and Investigator-assessed PFS (Progression-free Survival), PFS is the time from date of enrolment until first objective radiographic tumour progression or death from any cause., An average of approximately 14 months|OS (Overall Survival), OS is the time from date of enrolment until death from any cause., An average of approximately 22 months|ICR-assessed CNS-PFS (Central Nervous System Progression-free Survival), CNS-PFS is the time from date of enrolment until CNS tumour progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by ICR due to any cause in the absence of CNS progression., An average of approximately 14 months|Serum Concentrations of T-DXd, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for T-DXd., An average of approximately 14 months|Serum Concentrations of Total Anti-HER2 Antibody, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for total anti-HER2 antibody., An average of approximately 14 months|Serum Concentrations of DXd, Individual patient data and descriptive statistics will be provided for serum concentration data at each time point for DXd., An average of approximately 14 months
