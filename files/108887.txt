Efficacy and Safety of First-line Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody in Combination With Chemotherapy and Bronchoscopy-assisted Interventional Therapy in Patients With Advanced Central Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. Several PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its overall effective population is only 20%, and even in studies of enriched populations (such as PD-L1 ≥ 50%), its single-drug effective rate is only about 40%. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted lnterventional therapy in the first-line treatment of advanced central non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled, prospective clinical trial to examine the efficacy, safety, and mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, chemotherapy, in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy vs anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of patients with advanced central NSCLC.

Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. Most patients with lung cancers are already in advanced stages when diagnosed, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced lung cancer is less than 5%. Therefore, exploring effective treatments is of great significance for improving the survival and quality of life of patients with lung cancer. Immunotherapy represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors has received widespread attention in the field of lung cancer, and several PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, its overall effective population is only 20%, even in studies of enriched populations (such as PD-L1 ≥ 50%), its single-drug effective rate is only about 40%. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy in the first-line treatment of advanced central non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled, prospective clinical trial to examine the efficacy, safety and mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of patients with advanced central NSCLC.
