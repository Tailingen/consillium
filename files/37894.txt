The overall objective of this study is to develop a novel couple-based mindfulness intervention aimed at reducing distress in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and their partners. The intervention is named "MIND-Together" (Mindfully Navigating Distress Together). MIND-Together will be the first mindfulness-based intervention designed to reduce mCRC couples' distress by targeting their unique psychosocial needs. The intervention is projected to be a 4-session intervention delivered by a trained therapist to individual couples facing mCRC (i.e., a patient and his/her intimate partner) via video-conference (e.g., Zoom).
