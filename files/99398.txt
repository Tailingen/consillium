Study of NIS793 and Other Novel Investigational Combinations With SOC Anti-cancer Therapy for the 2L Treatment of mCRC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of NIS793 and other novel investigational combinations with standard of care (SOC) anti-cancer therapy vs SOC anti-cancer therapy for the second line treatment of mCRC.

This study aims to explore whether different mechanisms of action may reverse resistance and improve responsiveness to the currently considered SOC anti-cancer therapy in the second line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) setting.

This is an open-label, multi-center, phase II, 2-part platform study with Safety run-in and Expansion parts.

The platform design of this study is adaptive to allow flexibility in the introduction of additional treatment arms with new investigational drugs in combination with SOC anti-cancer therapy for the second line treatment of mCRC.

The study will include a control arm that will enroll participants treated with SOC anti-cancer therapy (bevacizumab with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) for the second line treatment of mCRC. The choice of the chemotherapy medications (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) will be determined by the Investigator based on prior exposure to oxaliplatin or irinotecan.

Each investigational arm will include a combination of an investigational drug and the SOC anti-cancer therapy. The first investigational arm of the study will explore the combination of anti-transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) monoclonal antibody, NIS793 with SOC anti-cancer therapy. The second investigational arm of the study will explore the combination of anti-transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) monoclonal antibody, NIS793 with Tislelizumab, which is an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, and SOC anti-cancer therapy. Combination of other investigational drugs with SOC anti-cancer therapy may be added by protocol amendments an additional investigational arms.

In each investigational arm, a Safety run-in part will be conducted before opening the expansion part to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for a combination of any investigational drug with SOC anti-cancer therapy unless the dose has been confirmed externally to this trial.

The decision to open the Expansion part of the study will be based on dose confirmation of investigational drug with available safety, relevant PK and other relevant data from Safety run-in part. Participants in the expansion part will be randomized in 1:2 ratio to the control arm or investigational arm.
