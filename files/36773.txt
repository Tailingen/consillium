Strigolactones and Dysplastic Colonic Lesions or Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the plant hormones strigolactones, on cell cultures of colonic polyps and colorectal cancer.
Colonic Neoplasms|Colonic Polyps
PROCEDURE: biopsy during colonoscopy
percentage of cells with reduced viability after dose-dependent exposure, 24 hours of exposure to strigolactone|percentage of cells in G2/M arrest after dose-dependent exposure, analysis of cell cycle, 24 hours of exposure to strigolactone
Strigolactones have been shown to anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cell cultures of breast and prostate origin, partially by down-regulation of cyclin B1 and induction of cell cycle arrest. In this study the investigators intend to take biopsies from benign colonic polyps and cancer tissue, culture intestinal explants and generate immortalized primary cells as a platform to assess the effect of this plant hormone on cell viability, cell mobility, apoptosis and cytoskeleton modifications.
