A Real-world Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Surufatinib in the Treatment of Biliary Tract Carcinoma
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label,multi-center, observational real-world clinical study to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib in the treatment of patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC).
Biliary Tract Carcinoma
DRUG: Surufatinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the length of time from the administration of the first-dose until disease progression or death from any cause before disease progression., 6 months after the last patient enrolled
Safty, The rate of AE and SAE in patients with BTC receiving surufatinib,AEs/SAEs were evaluated using NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 4 weeks after the last dose|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)., 6 months after the last patient enrolled|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the length of time from the administration of the first-dose until death from any cause.

or lost of follow-up, 6 months after the last patient enrolled|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)., 6 months after the last patient enrolled
QoL, Using quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) to collect the score. Scale range is 30\~126, higher values are considered to be a better outcome., 6 months after the last patient enrolled|Biomarkers, Explore the correlation between curative effect and different biomarkers, such as EGFR mutation, FGFR etc., before the first dose
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label,multi-center, observational real-world clinical study to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib in the treatment of patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 200 subjects are prepared to recruit in the study.
