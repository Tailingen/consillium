A Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Low-Dose Prednisone Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Versus ADT Alone in Newly Diagnosed Participants With High-Risk, Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer (mHNPC)
The purpose of this study is to determine if newly diagnosed (within previous 3 months) participants with metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one part of the body to another ) hormone-naive prostate cancer (mHNPC) who have high-risk prognostic factors will benefit from the addition of abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; lutenizing hormone releasing hormone \[LHRH\] agonists or surgical castration).

Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Radiographic PFS was defined as the time (in months) interval from randomization to the first date of radiographic progression or death. Radiographic progression included progression by bone scan (according to modified Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 \[PCWG2\] criteria), defined as at least 2 new lesions on bone scan and progression of soft tissue lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1 criteria). As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and a minimum absolute increase of 5 millimeter (mm) in the sum as compared to nadir sum of diameter., Up to 44 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 66 months
Time to Initiation of Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of chemotherapy was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer., Up to 66 months|Time to Subsequent Therapy for Prostate Cancer, Time to subsequent therapy was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of initiation of subsequent therapy for prostate cancer., Up to 66 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression was defined as the time (in months) interval from randomization to the first date a participant experienced a greater than or equal to (\>=) 30 percent (%) increase in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) from baseline in the BPI-SF worst pain intensity (Item 3) observed at 2 consecutive evaluations (\>=4) weeks apart. BPI-SF was an 11-item questionnaire, designed to assess severity and impact of pain on daily functions. Total score ranged from 0 to 10 with 0 representing "no pain" and 10 representing" pain as bad as you can imagine., Up to 66 months|Time to Skeletal-Related Event, Time to skeletal-related event was defined as the earliest of the following: clinical or pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or surgery to bone., Up to 66 months|Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression was defined as the time (in months) interval from the date of randomization to the date of PSA progression, according to PCWG2 criteria. PCWG2 defines PSA progression as the date that a 25 percent (%) or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) or more from the nadir is documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later., Up to 66 months
This is a randomized (the treatment group is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives), placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial)-controlled study designed to determine the efficacy of abiraterone acetate plus low-dose prednisone in participants with mHNPC. The study consists of 4 parts: Screening Phase (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1); Double-blind treatment Phase (consists of 4-week dosing cycles wherein abiraterone acetate will be administered as 1,000 milligram \[mg\] plus 5 mg prednisone or only placebo orally); Follow-up Phase (every 4 months up to 60 months or until death, lost to follow up, withdrawal of consent or study termination) Open-label Extension (OLE) Phase. Participants in the Double-blind Treatment Phase will have the opportunity to enroll into the OLE Phase. The OLE Phase will allow participants to receive active drug (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) until Long-term Extension (LTE) Phase for an additional period of up to 3 years. Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity unless, in the Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit from study treatment. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the active treatment group (abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg daily plus ADT) or the control group (ADT plus placebos).Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
