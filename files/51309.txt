A Phase I Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic Characteristics, and Preliminary Efficacy of HLX35 in Combination With HLX10 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a phase I clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, and preliminary efficacy of HLX35 in combination with HLX10 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult

For HLX35, 5 dose levels are set, starting at 0.1 mg/kg, q2w, followed by gradually escalating doses of 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg; for HLX10, a fixed dose of 200 mg is set, q2w, without dose escalation. The "3 + 3" design is used for dose escalation in this study.
