A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of SH-1028 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of SH-1028 with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SH-1028
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Every 2 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year.
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose, an average of 1 year.|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax）, Part A: Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2 (21 days for 1 cycle).|Area Under the Curve [AUC], Part A: Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2 (21 days for 1 cycle).|Progression-free survival (PFS), Every 2 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle) until end of follow-up, an average of 1 year.|Duration of Response(DOR), Every 2 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year.|Disease Control Rates(DCR), Every 2 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle) until end of treatment, an average of 1 year.|Overall survival(OS), Every 2 cycles (21 days for 1 cycle) until end of treatment; Every 12 weeks until end of follow-up, an average of 2 years.
Biomakers (eg. AF value of KRAS，MET mutation or other gene mutations ) of drug-resistance measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS)., optional，use NGS to analyse the gene associated with NSCLC and to determine the reason of SH-1028-resistance., at end of treatment，an average of 1 years.|Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin）, Before administration in Day 1 of cycle 2, 3 and 5 (21 days for 1 cycle).
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SH-1028 in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.The trail is divided into two parts:part A is dose extension phase,and Part B is expand sample size phase to confirm the efficacy of SH-1028.Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of SH-1028 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
