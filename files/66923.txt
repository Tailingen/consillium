Safety and Efficacy of CC-486 in Previously Treated Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-486 in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma having failed one to two previous regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy. Participants will be enrolled according to a Simon two-stage design; if the predefined activity is met (\>4 responses \[complete response; partial response {CR/PR}\] out of the first 17 evaluable participants based on independent radiological assessment), then the study will continue to enroll an additional 34 participants. If 4 or less responses out of 17 are observed, then the study enrollment will be stopped.
Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms
DRUG: CC-486
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete or Partial Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Based on an Independent Radiology Assessment (IRA), Overall response rate was defined as the combined incidence of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met, based on independent radiology assessment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions; Partial response is at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions or disappearance of target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesions from baseline., Tumor response was assessed every (Q) 6 weeks for the first 3 evaluations then Q 9 weeks until disease progression as of the cut-off date of 08 August 2017; the median duration of treatment was 257 days for the 200 mg dose and 114.5 days for 300 mg dose|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on an Independent Radiology Assessment According to RECIST 1.1 Criteria, PFS was defined as the time from the date of start of the study treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) on or prior to the data cut-off date for the statistical analysis, whichever occurred earlier, based on an independent radiology assessment of response using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target or non-target lesions from nadir or appearance of a new lesion., From Day 1 of documented disease progression; up to data cut off date of 08 August 2017; median follow-up time for censored participants was 12.3 months
Kaplan Meier Estimate of Overall Survival, Overall survival was the time from the first dose of study drug to patient death from any cause. Participants who did not die were censored at the last known time the patient was alive date or the clinical data cutoff date, whichever was earlier., From Day 1 of study treatment to the first date of progressive disease or death; up to data cut-off date of 08 August 2017; overall median follow-up time for censored participants was 20.4 months|Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease for ≥ 16 Weeks From the Date of the First Treatment, or CR or PR According to RECIST 1.1 Criteria and Based on an Independent Radiology Assessment, Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a CR, PR, confirmed ≥ 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met, or stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks from the first treatment, based on independent radiology assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria. A complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions; a partial response is at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions or disappearance of target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesions from baseline. Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase of lesions to qualify for progressive disease, Tumor response was assessed every 6 weeks for the first 3 evaluations then every 9 weeks until disease progression. As of the cut-off date of 08 August 2017 the median duration of treatment was 257 days for the 200 mg dose and 114.5 days for 300 mg dose|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as any adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred or worsened on or after the day of the first dose of the investigational product (IP) through 28 days after the last dose of IP. In addition, any SAE with an onset date more than 28 day after the last dose of IP that was assessed by the investigator as related to IP was considered a TEAE. The severity of AEs was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and based on the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life threatening Grade 5 = Death., From date of first dose of study treatment to 28 days after last dose of study treatment; up to final data cut-off date of 08 August 2017; median treatment duration was 257 days for CC-486 200 mg and 114.5 days for CC-486 300 mg|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration Of CC-486 (AUC-t), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Area Under the Plasma Concentration -Time Curve From 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC-inf, AUC0-∞) Of CC-486, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 extrapolated to infinity, calculated as \[AUCt + Ct/ λz\]. Ct is the last quantifiable concentration. No AUC extrapolation was performed with unreliable λz. If AUC %Extrap was ≥25%, AUC inf was not reported., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) Of CC-486, Maximum observed plasma concentration, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (Tmax) Of CC-486, Time to Cmax, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of CC-486, Terminal phase half-life in plasma, calculated as \[(ln 2)/λz\]. t1/2 was only calculated when a reliable estimate for λz could be obtained., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Apparent Total Clearance (CL/F) Of CC-486, Apparent volume of distribution, calculated as \[(CL/F)/λz\]., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) Of CC-486, Apparent volume of distribution, calculated as \[(CL/F)/λz\]., Blood samples for oral azacitidine PK assessment were collected prior to each dose (pre-dose) and over the 8-hour period following each dose (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose or similar schedule).
