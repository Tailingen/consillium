Alternative Splicing and Leukemia Initiating Cells
Aberrant RNA splicing and mutations in spliceosome complex in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are frequent. It have been shown that some splicing variants had a prognostic value in AML.

AML are characterized by their propensity to relapse because of the persistence of leukaemia initiating cells (LICs).

The aim of this study is to determine the splice variants on AML initiator cells and define a splicing pattern.

OTHER: Assessment of splicing variants
Polymerase chain reaction, Transcriptome analysis to determine the splicing variants on acute myeloid leukaemia initiator cells.

The analysis will focus on the gene encoding ABCA3 transporter and genes known to be mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (FLT3, NPM1, c-Kit, N et K-RAS).

The duration of selection of samples is estimated to be one month., 1 month|Ribonucleic acid sequencing, Transcriptome analysis to determine the splicing variants on acute myeloid leukaemia initiator cells.
