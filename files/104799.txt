A Study of IMC-002 in Subjects With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas
This is the first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, PharmDyn, and clinical activity of IMC-002 in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory lymphomas.

Male or female subjects 18 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory lymphomas will be included in the study if they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

The study will consist of 2 parts:

Part 1: Dose Escalation Part 2: Expansion Cohorts
Solid Tumor|Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: IMC-002
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), For 28 days|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), 2 years
Part 1: Dose Escalation

Part 2: Expansion Cohort The study may be amended in the future to include expansion cohorts in selected tumor types to further evaluate extended safety of IMC-002 at recommended Phase 2 dose in that tumor type. Sample size in the Dose Expansion part will be determined when the study is amended to include the expansion cohorts.
