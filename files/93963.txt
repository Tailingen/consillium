Study of TBio-6517 Given Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Solid Tumors
To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TBio-6517 when administered by direct injection into tumor(s) or intravenously and when combined with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors (RIVAL-01).

Incidence of adverse events when TBio-6517 administered by direct injection into tumor(s) alone at each dose level, Percentage of patients with adverse events by grade as determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, 25 months|Incidence of adverse events when TBio-6517 administered by direct injection into tumor(s) when combined with pembrolizumab, Percentage of patients with adverse events by severity as determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, 25 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Maximum feasible dose (MFD) and determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TBio-6517 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab., The highest dose of TBio-6517 that can be administered where fewer than 2 patients have a dose-limiting safety event alone or when combined with pembrolizumab as assessed by NCI CTCAE v.5.0 during the Phase 1 dose escalation, 4 weeks|Percentage of overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 at the RP2D, Percentage of patients treated at the RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab with a partial response or complete response by RECIST 1.1 following central radiologist review, 25 months|Percentage of overall response rate (ORR) by immunotherapy RECIST (iRECIST) at the RP2D, Percentage of patients treated at the RP2D with pembrolizumab with a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) by iRECIST following central radiologist review, 25 months
Number and severity of adverse events at the RP2D, Number of patients with adverse events by severity and frequency as determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, 25 months|Median overall survival (OS), Median overall survival in months in patients, 48 months|Median Duration of Response (DoR), Median duration of response in patients with a CR or PR, 25 months|Proportion of patients with a response (ORR), Percentage of patients in all arms with a CR or PR as assessed by the central radiologist using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, 25 months|Median Disease Control Rate (DCR), Median duration of response in patients with a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), 25 months|Time to tumor progression (TTP), Median time until patient disease progression (PD), 25 months|Median progression free survival, Median duration of progression free survival of patients, 25 months
This is a Phase 1/2a dose escalation study with TBio-6517 administered by direct injection into tumor(s) or by intravenous infusion. The Phase 1 portion has 4 arms; the first arm (Arm A) will determine the RP2D of TBio-6517 alone when directly injected into tumor(s), and the second arm (Arm B) will determine the RP2D of TBio-6517 when combined with pembrolizumab. The third and fourth arms will determine the RP2D of TBio-6517 when given intravenously alone and with pembrolizumab, respectively.

In the Phase 2a portion, the clinical benefit of TBio-6517 combined with pembrolizumab will be further explored in patients with Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC), Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), Cutaneous Melanoma, and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin (cSCC), as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) from central radiology review.
