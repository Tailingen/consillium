A Study of BL-M07D1 in Patients With a Variety of Solid Tumors Including Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-positive/Low-expressing Urinary and Gastrointestinal Tumors
Phase Ib: Explore the safety and tolerability of BL-M07D1 to further define RP2D in a variety of solid tumors, including locally advanced or metastatic urinary and gastrointestinal tumors. Phase II: To explore the efficacy of BL-M07D1 in patients with a variety of solid tumors including locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive/low-expressing urinary and gastrointestinal tumors.
Her2-positive/Low-expression Urinary and Digestive Tract Tumors
DRUG: BL-M07D1
Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ib/II: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any adverse and unexpected change in body structure, function, or chemistry or any exacerbation of an existing condition (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) during treatment. The type, frequency, and severity of TEAE will be assessed during treatment., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of medication to disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: AUC0-t, Blood concentration - Area under time line., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: CL, The serum clearance rate of BL-M07D1 per unit time will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Ctrough, Ctrough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of BL-M07D1 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency and titer of anti-BL-M07D1 antibody (ADA) will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months
