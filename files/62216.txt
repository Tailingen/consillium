HSRT and IMRT Chemoradiotherapy for Newly Diagnosed GBM
This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the combination of 30Gy/5fx HSRT and 20Gy/10fx IMRT adjuvant therapy. The total biological effective dose (BED) of the PTV is 72 Gy in a ratio of alpha/beta ratio of 3, which equals to the conventional 60Gy/30fx treatment. This study can provide evidence for future non-inferiority phase III randomized controlled trials. The abbreviated course of radiotherapy can reduce the treatment time by half, benefit patients, and utilize the health resource.

Overall survival (OS), Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, From the start of treatment to the date of death or the last follow-up, up to approximately 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, From the start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death, up to approximately 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) prior to progression or any further therapy., Bimonthly up to intolerance the toxicity or progressive disease (PD), up to approximately 24 months|Quality of Life score (QoL), European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0, Bimonthly up to intolerance the toxicity or PD, up to approximately 24 months|Cognitive function, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE, score range 0 to 30) to evaluate the cognitive function. Any score of 24 or more (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (â‰¤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment., Bimonthly up to intolerance the toxicity or PD, up to approximately 24 months|Toxicity rate, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 to assess the toxicity. Estimated using an exact binomial distribution together with 95% confidence interval., Bimonthly up to intolerance the toxicity or PD, up to approximately 24 months
