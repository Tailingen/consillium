Study of DCC-3084 in Participants With Advanced Malignancies Driven by the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathway
This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate DCC-3084 alone or in combination with other cancer therapies in participants with advanced cancers. Module A will enroll participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Additional modules exploring other cancers may be added to the master protocol at a later date. Each module will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion).
