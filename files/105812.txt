A Clinical Research of CAR T Cells Targeting CEA Positive Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
The main purpose of this research is to verify the safety of CEA targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells and to determine the proper dosage of CAR T cells infused.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have demonstrated great successes in treating even late stage cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) positive B cell malignancies. But it has few studies in solid tumors. The carcino-embryonic antigen(CEA) is widely expressed in cancers like gastric cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. To confirm if CAR T cells still function in solid tumors, we have developed anti-CEA CAR-modified T cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of CEA target cells. In this study, the CEA CARs, will be evaluated in CEA positive gastric cancer. The primary goal is to confirm its adverse effects including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
