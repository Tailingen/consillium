Chemotherapy Combined Autologous Cytokine-induced Killer Cells in Naive Stage IV EGFR-wild Type Lung Adenocarcinoma
This is a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the efficacy of cytokine-induced killer cells combined chemotherapy in stage Ⅳ naive EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CIK|DRUG: chemotherapy
overall survival time, overall survival time aims at from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 36 months, from the day of randomization to the day of death, up to 36 months
time to progression, time to progression points to from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, up to 24 months, from the day of randomization to the day of first detecting progression, up to 24 months|objective response rate, the partion of overall remission in total proportion, one year
There is still no great improvement in advanced EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma although great progress was made in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It's necessary to explore the treatment mode of this kind of patients. As the progress was made in tumor immunity and immunotherapy, more and more cancer therapists accept the treatment model of chemotherapy combined immunotherapy. And now chemotherapy combined autologous CIK cells is one kind of common treatment model in some countries. Investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this kind of treatment model in patients with stage Ⅳ naive EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma.
