Observational Controlled Clinical Trials, on Adult Patients With T-lymphoblastic Lymphoma Treated With Intensive Chemo/Radiotherapy or Intensive Chemotherapy Followed by Transplant. Evaluation of Clinical, Anatomy -Pathological Parameters
The purpose of the study is to create a prospective database of T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (T-LBL) cases in order to conduct an appropriate statistical study as well as to monitor diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD), to detect specific genetic profile useful to give advices on therapies, to assess if PET has a prognostic validity on T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (T-LBL).

To create a prospective database of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma cases on adult patients in order to conduct an appropriate statistical study., 5 years
To monitor histological and immunophenotypical diagnosis and to make a minimal residual disease (MRD) molecular study in order to verify if minimal residual disease (MRD) prognostic value observed in children is confirmed in adult patients., 5 years|To make a gene expression analysis on T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma patients to detect specific genetic profiles useful to give prognostic and therapy response advices., 5 years|To validated the prognostic systems already identified in T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cases that can be useful to label the high-risk for Lymphoblastic Lymphoma patients., 5 years|To evaluate if PET has a prognostic value in T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma cases., 5 years
Observational prospective Clinical Trial designed to:

* record all patients treated with a latest generation ALL-like therapy (e.g.: Holzer, LSA2-L2 modified, GIMEMA LAL094), an enhanced therapy (hyper-CVAD or Stanford), autologous or allogeneic transplant or reduced intensity conditioning allotransplant after induction/consolidation and also expected cases treated with high dose sequential therapy or intensified minimal residual disease (MRD) oriented therapy;
* enter classic T-LBL patients (bone marrow infiltrate \<25%) treated as long as previous section;
* monitor therapy response/phenotype ratio by the study of phenotype;
* monitor therapy response/residual disease/patients outcome ratio by the study of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement;
* evaluate any gene-profile difference between T-LBL pre-thymic phenotype and T-LBL thymic phenotype so as to correlate it to outcome;
* monitor the stage of the disease at diagnosis, during the therapy and during the follow-up by means of TAC, so to value if PET (in association with TAC) is an additional and/or outcome predicting element compared to TAC.
