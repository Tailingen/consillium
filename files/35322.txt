IBI308 in Subjects With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Malignancies
The study is to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity (overall response rate, ORR) of IBI308 monotherapy in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies.

Patients will be recruited for 2 cohorts:

• Cohort 1: Advanced/metastatic cancers with TMB\>10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb). This enrollment of this cohort has been stopped per sponsor's communication with the sites. For patients who have already enrolled in this cohort, treatment and monitoring will be conducted as stipulated by the protocol. The patients will remain on study until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs first.

Cohort 2: Advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer (N=40)
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Malignancies
DRUG: IBI308
Overall Response Rate (Confirmed), To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity (overall response rate, ORR) of IBI308 monotherapy in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 29 months
Progression-free Survival, To measure progression-free survival rate (PFS) Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non- target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 2 years|Duration of Response, To measure duration of response (DOR), 2 years|Overall Survival, To measure overall survival rate (OS), 2 years|Number of Participants With Detectable Anti- Drug Antibodies., Anti-Drug Antibodies will be tested to evaluate immunogenicity of IBI308, 2 years|Area Under the Curve (AUC [0-504h]), To evaluate the Area Under the Curve \[AUC\] of IBI308., 0-504h|Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], To evaluate the Maximum Plasma Concentration \[Cmax\] of IBI308., Cycle 1 Day 1: predose, 5 minutes, 1, 6, 24, 48, 168, and 336 hr post-end of infusion
