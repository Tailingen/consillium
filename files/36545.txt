A Study of Poziotinib in Previously Treated Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC Harboring HER2 Exon 20 Mutations
The primary purpose of this study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) exon 20 mutations when treated with poziotinib versus docetaxel.
NSCLC
DRUG: Poziotinib|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the start of the study treatment to the date of first documented disease progression by central radiographic evaluation per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time (in months) from the start of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve at least one complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by the central radiographic evaluation as per the RECIST v.1.1 criteria, before disease progression. Per RECIST v.1.1 for solid tumors, CR is defined as disappearance of all tumor lesions (TLs) and disappearance or reduction of all pathological lymph nodes \<10mm (short axis). PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) from Baseline., Up to approximately 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve at least one CR, PR, stable disease (SD), or non-CR/non-progressive disease (PD), by the central radiographic evaluation per the RECIST v.1.1 criteria, before disease progression. Per RECIST v.1.1 for solid tumors, CR is defined as disappearance of all tumor lesions (TLs) and disappearance or reduction of all pathological lymph nodes \<10mm (short axis). PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) from Baseline, and non PD is ≥20% increase in SOD from previous smallest SOD on study, and an absolute increase of ≥5mm). SD is SOD change neither sufficient for PR nor sufficient for PD., Up to approximately 5 years
This is a Phase 3, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety/tolerability of poziotinib versus docetaxel in previously treated participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations.

Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to:

* Arm A: Poziotinib 8 milligrams (mg), twice daily (BID) or
* Arm B: Docetaxel 75 milligrams per meter square (mg/m\^2)

The Screening Period lasts up to 21 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Participants will be treated in 21-day cycles or until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer treatment, or other protocol-specified reasons.
