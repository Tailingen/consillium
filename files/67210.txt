Relapse-Free Survival(RFS), Defined as the time from enrollment in this study to the occurrence of relapse. For patients without relapse, the time is calculated until death from any cause or the time of the last follow-up, From date of index treatment to death, disease progression, or end of study, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.

If the patient is still alive, the last observed time will be used, and the patient's OS will be considered for analysis., From date of index treatment to death, disease progression, or end of study, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.|Cumulative Relapse Rate (CIR), Defined as the proportion of patients who experience disease relapse from the time of enrollment in this study., From date of index treatment to death, disease progression, or end of study, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.|MRD Negative Conversion Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who convert to MRD negative among all evaluable patients for efficacy., From date of index treatment to death, disease progression, or end of study, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.
This study is designed to be a prospective cohort study conducted at the First Hospital of Jilin University. The target populations of this study are patients with Middle- and High-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia in the elderly who received intermediate-dose cytarabine in combination with venetoclax for consolidation therapy from June 1, 2025to December 31, 2026. It is expected to enroll 68 subjects in this study. The subjects' data such as demographics and other baseline characteristics, medications, prognosis, will be collected, and statistical analysis of data will be conducted to compare the effectiveness outcome measures
