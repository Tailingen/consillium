This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III study to explore chemotherapy omission in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative endocrine-sensitive breast cancer with 1-3 positive lymph nodes receiving extended (3 year) adjuvant abemaciclib. In this study, patient eligible will be randomized into either endocrine drug plus 3-year adjuvant abemaciclib without chemotherapy or treatment of physician's choice (TPC).The safety and efficacy of each group will be assessed through invasive disease free survival (iDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AE) as graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.
