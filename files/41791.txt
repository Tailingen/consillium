LOcoregional vs Systemic Therapy in Patients With BCLC Stage B HCC
The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of two standard of care treatments in people who have been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This research study is being done to compare atezolizumab/bevacizumab to locoregional therapy with either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab and bevacizumab|RADIATION: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE
Progression-free survival, Evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to TACE or TARE as measured by progression-free survival after randomization. PFS is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause or radiologic tumor progression, according to investigator assessment per mRECIST (modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors )., Baseline until date of first observed disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months
Overall Response Rate, To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to locoregional therapy with TACE or TARE as measured by ORR.

ORR to be assessed using investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Baseline until date of first observed disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months|Time to treatment Failure, To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to locoregional therapy with TACE or Time to treatment failure, defined as time to death or inability to provide allocated treatment (atezolizumab/bevacizumab for Arm A or TACE/TARE for Arm B). Failure of strategy can be based on loss of clinical benefit, unacceptability toxicity, liver function deterioration, or no longer applicable as determined by local tumor board., Baseline until date of first observed disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to locoregional therapy with TACE or TARE as measured by OS.

Overall survival after randomization, defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, Baseline until date of death, assessed up to 24 months|Time to Deterioration of Liver Function, Time to deterioration of liver function, defined as time from randomization to first clinically meaningful deterioration in liver function, as measured by Child Pugh and ALBI. Meaningful increases in Child Pugh will be defined as increase in Child Pugh score to 8 and meaningful increased changes in ALBI will be defined as an increase in ALBI grade (from grade 1 to 2 or grade 2 to 3)., Randomization until first clinically meaningful deterioration in liver function, assessed up to 24 months|Time to deterioration of quality of life, To evaluate health related quality of life scores of patients treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to locoregional therapy with TACE or TARE.

Time to deterioration of quality of life, defined as time for randomization to first clinically meaningful deterioration of quality of life measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-HCC18., Randomization to first clinically meaningful deterioration of quality of life, assessed up to 24 months
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared to locoregional therapy (TACE or TARE) in patients with intermediate-stage HCC. The primary outcome is progression-free survival, which will be compared between two arms using stratified log-rank tests, adjusting the effect of stratification variables between two study arms. Cox regression analysis will be done to see if there are significant differences in PFS, controlling for the effects of confounding variables between the two study arms.
