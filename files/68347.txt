Novel Peptide Vaccination for Patients With Advanced Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of novel vaccination for advanced bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer

DEP domain containing 1(DEPDC1) and M phase phosphoprotein 1(MPHOSPH1) have been identified using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous studies. We have determined the HLA-A\*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from DEPDC1, DEPDC1-9-294, and MPHOSPH1, MPHOSPH1-9-278. These epitopes showed strong IFN-g production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and HLA-A\*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the safety and efficacy of novel vaccination for the advanced bladder cancer patients who already showed resistance to standard chemotherapies or radiotherapy.
