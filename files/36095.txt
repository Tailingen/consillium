Sintilimab in Combination With S-1/Oxaliplatin With Nab-paclitaxel Intraperitoneal Infusion for Untreated Advanced Gastric Cancer With Malignant Ascites
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab in Combination With S-1/oxaliplatin With nab-paclitaxel intraperitoneal infusion as First-line Treatment for advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GC/GEJ) adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites
Gastric Cancer|Peritoneal Metastases|Ascites, Malignant
DRUG: Sintilimab in Combination With S-1/oxaliplatin With nab-paclitaxel intraperitoneal infusion|OTHER: Blood samples, tumor biopsy specimens, ascites, and feces samples will be collected
Ascites objective response rate (ORR), The ascites objective response rate (ORR) was calculated as a summed ratio of patients with disappeared and decreased ascites to the total number of patients., 1 year
Overall Survival (OS), OS is calculated from diagnosis to death or last follow-up time, 1 year|Progress free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease, 1 year|12 months os rate, The definition of 12-months OS rate is the percentage of patients who had NOT has an event before or at 12 months, 1 year|Obiective response rate of Solid tumor lesion (if exists), Number of participants with partial response or complete response treating by anloitnib according to RESIST criteria v1.1, 1 year|Safety assessment, Number and percentage of participants with Adverse Events (any Grade and Grade 3/4), 1 year|Changes of ascite cell subsets in patients, Changes in ascites cell subsets in patients before and after treatment. Differences in the proportion of subpopulations and gene expression levels of ascites cells between responders and non-responders by single-cell sequencing., 1 year
Peritoneal metastasis(PM) is common in advanced gastric cancer and associated with a poor prognosis. The efficacy of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in gastric cancer with PM is still not clear, and there is a lack of biomarkers for efficacy prediction. It is a single arm, open-label, phase II cinical trial conducted in China and plans to recruit 35 patients who were primarily diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GC/GEJ) adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites who have not received previous systemic treatment. Patients plan to receive sintilimab in combination with S-1/oxaliplatin with nab-paclitaxel intraperitoneal infusion as first-line treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with S-1/oxaliplatin with nab-paclitaxel intraperitoneal infusion for untreated advanced GC/GEJ adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites. To explore the potential biomarkers, tumor tissue paraffin section, peripheral blood, ascites, and feces before and after treatment will be collected and investigated by multiomics sequencing.
