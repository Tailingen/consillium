Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine Plus Paclitaxel in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
This is a prospective, multi-center, open-labeled, randomized phase III clinical trial comparing overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity obtained with gemcitabine cisplatin combination (GP) versus gemcitabine paclitaxel combination (GT).

The previous phase II study showed that gemcitabine and cisplatin combination (GP) is an effective regimen in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The potential therapeutic effects of GP in advanced TNBC deserve further evaluation yet. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive either GP or GT regimen to verify the hypothesis.
