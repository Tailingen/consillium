Dynamic Position Change in Colonic Adenoma Detection
There was an only single operator study reporting dynamic position change during colonoscopy withdrawal significantly improved polyp and adenoma detection. So we designed a prospective, randomized multicenter study to verify the effect of dynamic position change in colonic adenoma detection. We think position change improve luminal distension and has the potential to improve adenoma detection rate.
