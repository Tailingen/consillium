Subjects will receive FF-10101-01 orally once a day repeated every 28 days =1 cycle Frequent blood draws will be collected to measure pharmacodynamic parameters and pharmacodynamic activity.

Disease assessments, including bone marrow aspirates, will be performed at the beginning of cycles 1-3, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects who demonstrate objective response or stable disease will be allowed to continue therapy with FF-10101-01 until , observation of unacceptable adverse events, or until the subject is no longer deriving benefit based on the opinion of the investigator.
