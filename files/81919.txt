Clinical Trial of Thoracoscopic Lobecotmy Under Spontaneous Ventilating Anesthesia
With the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) techniques and technology for anesthesia control, non-intubated anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation has been widely applied in VATS. A prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical study was applied in this study to assess the feasibility and safety of thoracoscopic lobectomy under spontaneous ventilation versus intubated single lung mechanical ventilation.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: spontaneous ventilation|PROCEDURE: intubated anesthesia with single-lung mechanical ventilation
numbers of participants with unstable vital signs, hypoxemia or hypercapnia intraoperatively, the numbers of participants with unstable vital signs or hypoxemia/hypercapnia will be reported. The vital signs will be monitored through the whole surgical operation(including heart rating in beat per minute, temperature in degree Celsius, respiratory in breaths per minute and blood pressure in oxygen in millimetres of mercury ), and blood gas analysis((including partial pressure of oxygen in millimetres of mercury, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in millimetres of mercury, and so on) will be tested every 30 mins during the operation., during the surgical operation, an average of 1 hour
numbers of participants with postoperative complications, The numbers of participants with postoperative complications will be reported. The postoperative complications include postoperative respiratory complications(e.g., air leaks, lung infections, atelectasis, and bronchospasm and respiratory failure), postoperative cardiovascular complications(e.g., arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure) , intubated related complications(e.g., hoarseness, sore throat, and irritating cough), and other undefined complications, from operation to discharging, an average of 1 week|numbers of participants with anesthesia conversion intraoperatively in spontaneous ventilation group, The numbers of participants undergoing conversion from nonintubated spontaneous ventilation anaesthesia to intubated anaesthesia in nonintubated group will be reported because of hypoxemia, carbohemia, bleeding or other undefined reasons., during the surgical operation, an average of 1 hour
the postoperative hospitalization time of every participant, the postoperative time point of participants meeting the discharging criteria: body T°\<37.5℃, degree of blood oxygen saturation on room air\>95%, no complications requiring in-hospital treatment, full lung re-expansion after chest tube removal, and white blood cell count\<10×109/L, through the postoperative hospitalization time, an average of 1 week
Intubated anesthesia with single lung mechanical ventilation (SLV) is considered the standard of care in VATS. However, this type of anesthesia has been associated with several adverse effects, which can trigger complications and increase the overall surgical risk. In order to avoid intubated-anesthesia related adverse effects, spontaneous ventilation strategies have been proposed in recent years.Encouraged by the satisfactory results with a preliminary experience of spontaneous ventilated VATS, the multicentre randomized controlled clinical controled study is established to comparatively analyze the outcome of patients undergoing either nonintubated intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation (SV) or SLV VATS lobectomy, especially in safety during operation, lymph nodes resection, complication rate, muscle recovery after surgery, the difference the postoperative hospitalization time.
