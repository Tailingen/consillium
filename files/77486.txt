Assessment of Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy
The purpose of this study is to collect clinical data, blood samples, and self reported symptoms from patients that experience unusually severe neuropathy after treatment with paclitaxel. This data will be used to develop predictive markers for neuropathy. Blood samples will be used to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and eventually artificial nerve cells to be used to study neuropathy in the lab.
