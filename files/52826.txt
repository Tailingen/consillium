Infusion of Specially Treated Umbilical Cord Stem Cells After Chemoradiation Treatment for Blood Cancers
This study hopes to show that specially treated umbilical cord cells, called stem cells, can be safely given to a person after they receive chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy for their illness. During chemoradiation therapy or chemotherapy, a person loses all of the cells that are needed to make the different types of cells in their blood, including their immune system cells. These cells must be replaced in order for the blood and immune systems to work properly. Some people receive bone marrow transplants or other types of stem cell transplants to get the cells they need. CB001 is being developed as an option for people who need bone marrow transplants or other types of transplants to replace those cells. It is also being developed for people who do not have the option of other types of transplants.
