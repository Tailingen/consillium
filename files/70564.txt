PD-1 Blockade Combined With De-intensified Chemoradiotherapy Sparing Concurrent Cisplatin in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a phase 3, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, with the purpose to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade (toripalimab) combined with the de-intensified chemoradiotherapy sparing concurrent cisplatin (i.e., toripalimab incorporated into induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy) in high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Failure-free survival (FFS), Failure-free survival is measured from day of diagnosis until treatment failure, death from any cause, or last follow-up visit, whichever occurred first, 3-year|Incidence rate of all-grade vomiting, Incidence rate of all-grade vomiting during treatment assessed by clinicians according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from day of diagnosis until death due to any cause or the latest known date alive, 3-year|Locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), Locoregional failure-free survival is measured from day of diagnosis until local or regional recurrence, 3-year|Distant failure-free survival (DFFS), Distant failure-free survival is measured from day of diagnosis until distant metastasis, 3-year|Incidence rate of investigator-reported adverse events (AEs), Analysis of investigator-reported adverse events (AEs) are based on treatment-related AEs (trAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), and all-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs. AEs are evaluated by investigators according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, 3-year|Incidence rate of patient-reported adverse events (AEs), Analysis of patient-reported adverse events (AEs) are based on treatment-related AEs (trAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), and all-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs. AEs are evaluated by patients themselves, 3-year|Quality of life (QoL): questionnaire, Changes in QoL of participants from initial treatment to 6 months after the completion of 6 cycles adjuvant PD-1 blocking antibody. QoL is evaluated with the use of (1) the head-and-neck-specific module (H\&N35) of the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 module (QLQ-C30), which is established by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and (2) the general and head-and-neck-specific module of the evaluation tool developed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT). Scores for the module range of H\&N35 QLQ-C30 from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning or well-being or higher symptom burden (scales measuring symptom burden were reverse-scored to facilitate presentation), week 1, 20, 40, 64|Tumor response, Evaluation of tumor response (CR, PR, SD, PD, NA) performed after induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and adjuvant PD-1 immunotherapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Correlation between pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level and FFS, Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level of tumor cell is evaluated centrally by means of immunohistochemical testing. This is a single assessment with only one unit of measure, since the correlation is aimed to be roughly categorized into positive and negative., 3-year|Correlation between pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level and OS, Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level of tumor cell is evaluated centrally by means of immunohistochemical testing.

This phase 3, multi-center, randomized controlled trial plans to enroll 532 patients with newly-diagnosed, pathologically-proven, untreated locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) at high-risk of distant metastasis (T4N1 and T1-4N2-3, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer \[AJCC\]/Union for International Cancer Control \[UICC\] 8th edition clinical staging system). Patients will receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy (IC; gemcitabine-cisplatin regimen) followed by 1) experimental arm (de-intensification group): intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) alone or 2) control arm (standard group): 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin plus IMRT (CCRT). For both of the two arms, toripalimab will be adopted on day 1 of the first cycle IC and continue every 3 weeks for 6 cycles till the end of IMRT, with the first and last 3 cycles of toripalimab administrated along with IC and CCRT/IMRT, respectively. After three weeks of the completion of IMRT, adjuvant toripalimab will be used every 3 weeks for 11 cycles, and therefore the entire treatment process is expected to last for one year.
