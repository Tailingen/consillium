This scale addresses symptoms and functional limitations that are important to lymphoma patients. Only the LYM subscale was administered in this study. The LYM items are scored on a 0 ("Not at all") to 4 ("Very much") response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on a 0-60 scale. Lower scores indicate better health outcomes.

This is a study to determine the efficacy and safety of JCAR017 in adult participants with aggressive B-cell NHL. The study will enroll participants in Europe and Japan with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS; de novo or transformed follicular lymphoma \[tFL\]), high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology (HGBL), follicular lymphoma Grade 3B (FL3B), and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Participants with secondary central nervous system (CNS) involvement are allowed.

Once enrolled, participants will undergo leukapheresis to enable JCAR017 cell product generation. Upon successful JCAR017 cell product generation, participants will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by infusion of JCAR017. JCAR017 will be administered by intravenous infusion. Participants will be followed for approximately 2 years after their JCAR017 infusion for safety, disease status, survival and health-related quality of life.

Delayed adverse events following exposure to gene modified T cells will be assessed and long-term persistence of these modified T cells will continue to be monitored under a separate long-term follow-up protocol for up to 15 years after JCAR017 infusion as per competent authority guidelines.
