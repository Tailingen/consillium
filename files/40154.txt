S1+ Paclitaxel (IV&IP) + Bevacizumab (IP) Versus S1+Oxaliplatin as First-line Treatment in Gastric Cancer With Malignant Ascites
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of S1 plus paclitaxel (intravenous injection \& intraperitoneal injection) plus bevacizumab (intraperitoneal injection) vs. S1 plus oxaliplatin intravenous injection as first-line treatment in gastric or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites.

This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial, to compare the efficacy of S1 plus paclitaxel (intravenous injection \& intraperitoneal injection) plus bevacizumab (intraperitoneal injection) versus S1 plus oxaliplatin intravenous injection as first-line treatment in gastric or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma with malignant ascites. A total of 66 patients who are diagnosed with gastric or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma will be allocated to receive either S1 orally administration plus paclitaxel intravenous injection \& intraperitoneal injection plus bevacizumab intraperitoneal injection, or to receive S1 orally administration plus oxaliplatin intravenous injection. The primary end point is ascites response rate at 6 weeks. The secondary end points include the median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response rate (ORR), puncture free survival, volume of drainage, the quality of life (QoL) and safety.
