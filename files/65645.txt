Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-486 in Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral azacitidne (CC-486) twice daily (BID) in subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes who failed to achieve an objective response post injectable hypomethylating agent (iHMA) treatment

Reason for removing the combination arm: Due to difficulties with dose-finding, the durvalumab plus CC-486 combination arm was closed to enrollment.

Extension:

An Extension Phase (EP) has been added to allow subjects who are currently receiving oral azacitidine BID and who are demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator, to continue receiving oral azacitidine until the subject meets the criteria for study discontinuation.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Oral Azacitidine|DRUG: Durvalumab
Overall Response Rate Based on the Modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 Response Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), The overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective response including: hematologic improvement (HI), partial remission (PR), complete remission (CR), or marrow complete remission (mCR). Hematologic response was defined as: • CR: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines; peripheral blood (PB) shows: hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, neutrophils ≥1.0x10\^9/L, platelets ≥100x10\^9/dL, blasts (0%) • PR: same as CR bone marrow (BM) shows blasts decreased by ≥ 50% over pre-treatment but still \> 5%; cellularity and morphology not relevant • mCR: BM: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pre-treatment PB, PB: if HI responses, noted in addition to mCR • HI: HI erythroid response (HI-E); HI neutrophil response (HI-N) ; HI platelet response (HI-P), Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms
Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, and was calculated using date of first dose and date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored subjects., From first dose till death due to any cause (Up to 91 months)|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Time to Onset of First and Best Response, Time to onset of first response was defined as the time between the date of first investigational product (IP) dose and the earliest date any response (CR, PR, mCR, or HI) was first observed. Participants who did not achieve any defined response during the treatment period were censored at the date of treatment discontinuation, disease progression, or death, whichever occurred first. Best response is the best recorded response or treatment outcome from the start of the study treatment until the end of the study treatment taking into account the requirements for confirmation of response., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Duration of First Response, Duration of hematologic response and/or improvement was defined as the time from the date response or improvement was first observed to the date of documented relapse or disease progression as defined by the modified IWG 2006 criteria. Particpants who maintained hematologic response and/or improvement through the end of the treatment period were censored as the date of treatment discontinuation or death, whichever occurred first., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Duration of Best Response, Duration of hematologic response and/or improvement was defined as the time from the date response or improvement was first observed to the date of documented relapse or disease progression as defined by the modified IWG 2006 criteria. Particpants who maintained hematologic response and/or improvement through the end of the treatment period were censored as the date of treatment discontinuation or death, whichever occurred first., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose to the first documented progressive disease (PD), relapse, or death due to any cause during or after the treatment period, whichever occurred first, according to IWG 2006 response criteria for MDS. Participants who were still alive and progression-free were censored at the date of their last response assessment. Progressive disease is defined as follows: - an increase in BM blasts relative to nadir: •If nadir less than 5% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in blasts to \> 5% blasts •If nadir 5% - 10% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in blasts to \> 10% blasts •If nadir 10% - 20% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in blasts to \> 20% blasts •If nadir 20% - 30% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in blasts to \> 30% blasts And any of the following: •At least 50% decrement from maximum remission/response levels in granulocytes or platelets •Reduction in Hgb concentration by ≥ 2 g/dL •Transfusion dependence, From first dose to the first documented progressive disease (PD), relapse, or death due to any cause (Up to 91 months)|Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease at Baseline Who Achieved Stable Disease, A participant was considered as having a stable disease if the disease neither responded nor progressed during or after study treatment., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Onset to Achieve Stable Disease, A participant was considered as having a stable disease if the disease neither responded nor progressed during or after study treatment., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Duration of Stable Disease, The duration of stable disease was defined as the time between any two observations of objective disease progression (modified IWG criteria), starting from the first day of dosing with IP. Participants who maintained stable disease through the end of the treatment period were censored at the date of study termination., Response was assessed every 2 cycles following treatment during the first 6 cycles, then every 3 cycles thereafter; median duration of treatment = 5.26 and 3.81 months for SD/PD for oral AZA arms respectively, and 1.84 months for AZA and Durva SD/PD arms|Percentage of Participants Who Progressed to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), For all participants who received at least one dose of study drug, continuous monitoring for progression to AML occurred in the post treatment follow up period., From first dose and until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further data collection (Up to 91 months)|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Time to Progression to AML, Time to AML progression was defined as the time from the date of first dose of IP until the date the participant had documented progression to AML., From first dose and until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further data collection (Up to 91 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs were defined as AEs occurring or worsening on or after the date of the first dose of oral aza or durva and within 28 days after last dose of oral aza or 90 days after last dose of durva A serious adverse event (SAE) is any: • Death; • Life-threatening event; • Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity; • Congenital anomaly or birth defect; • Any other important medical event The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.0) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death., From first dose until 28 days after the last dose of CC-486 (90 days after the last dose of durvalumab) or the last follow up visit, whichever date is later (Up to 91 months)|Serum Plasma Concentration of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Area Under Curve (AUC) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Terminal Half-life ( ½) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Clearance (CL/F) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22|Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of Azacitidine and Durvalumab, Data was not collected, Day 1, 8, 15 and 22
