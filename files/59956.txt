Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine in Patients With Metastatic Tumors
Patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors receive oral vinorelbine at one of three different doses (30 or 40 or 50 mg). Vinorelbine will be administered orally at a metronomic schedule three times a week: on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

The purpose of this study is to define the biologically optimal dose of vinorelbine when administered at a metronomic dosing schema. \[Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the close, regular administration of minimally toxic doses of cytotoxic drugs, with minimal or no drug-free breaks, over prolonged periods\]. Patients with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors are randomly assigned one of three different doses of oral vinorelbine (30 or 40 or 50 mg). Treatment is administered three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or to a maximum of 24 months.
