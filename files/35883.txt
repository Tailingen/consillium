Safety and Feasibility of Reversible Induction Strategy
This study would explore the safety and feasibility of a reversible induction strategy for uncertain difficult airway. This reversible induction strategy would include high flow nasal canular oxygenation support, short-term effect anesthetic including Propofol and Remifentanil for sedation and analgesia and Sugammadex would be used for reverse the muscle relaxant.
