Derazantinib in Subjects With FGFR2 Gene Fusion-, Mutation- or Amplification- Positive Inoperable or Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This Phase II, open-label, single-arm study evaluated the anti-cancer activity of derazantinib in subjects with inoperable or advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) who received at least one prior regimen of systemic therapy. Patients received an oral once-daily total dose of 300 mg derazantinib capsules.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma|Combined Hepatocellular and Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: derazantinib
Substudy 1: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR) by blinded independent central review using the internationally recognized criteria for the radiological assessment in tumor response of solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, From first dose and up to 54 months|Substudy 2: Progression Free Survival at 3 Months (PFS 3), PFS3 was defined as the proportion of patients who have progression-free survival at 3 months from the first date of receiving study drug as assessed by survival status and blinded independent central review as per RECIST 1.1., From first dose and up to 3 months
PFS, PFS was calculated from the first date of receiving study drug until radiographic disease progression by blinded independent central review or death., From first dose and up to 54 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was calculated from the first date of receiving study drug until death, From first dose and up to 54 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR was calculated from the first date of documented tumor response to disease progression by blinded independent central review per RECIST version 1.1 DoR was derived only for patients who have the best overall response of CR or PR, From first dose and up to 54 months|Substudy 2: Objective Response Rate, ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR) by blinded independent central review using the internationally recognized criteria for the radiological assessment in tumor response of solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, From first dose and up to 54 months|Number of Patients With Grade 3-5 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Number of patients experiencing TEAE of Grade 3 to 5 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), TEAEs were defined as all events occurring after drug treatment began and up to 30 days after last study drug administration
This was a multi-center, open-label, single arm study which evaluated the anti-cancer activity of derazantinib in adult patients with inoperable or advanced iCCA in the following study population:

Patients with inoperable or advanced iCCA and with fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions (Substudy 1) or FGFR2 mutations/amplifications (Substudy 2), treated with at least one prior regimen of systemic therapy.

Derazantinib was supplied as 100 mg capsules. A dose of 300 mg once-daily (three capsules of 100 mg each) of derazantinib was administered orally to patients, 1 hour before, or 2 hours after, a meal.
