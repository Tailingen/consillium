Anthracycline-free Taxane Based Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2/Neu Negative Early Breast Cancer
The planned trial compares an anthracycline-free taxane based regimen versus a modern third generation (anthracycline/taxane-based) regimen in HER2/neu non-over expressing tumors. The aim is to define a further anthracycline-free standard and to spare anthracycline toxicity to a patient, who will only have a modest benefit from this compound. Prior to randomization for chemotherapy for all patients with HR positive disease OncotypeDX® will be performed to identify patients who should not receive chemotherapy.

Secondary objectives of this trial will be to compare overall survival and toxicity between the two chemotherapy arms, to evaluate survival in the observation arm and to perform translational research regarding prognostic and predictive factors.
