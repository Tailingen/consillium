Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine Trial in Young Adolescent Women With GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' (GSK Bio) HPV-16/18 Vaccine
This protocol posting deals with objectives \& outcome measures of the extension phase up to Month 48. The objective of the extension study is to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity of the HPV 16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (for all subjects in the HPV Vaccine Group) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The objectives \& outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00196924).

The long-term follow-up study will be blinded until the primary study is unblinded and will be open for all visits subsequent to unblinding of primary study HPV-013 (NCT00196924). During the open phase, only subjects who received the HPV-16/18 VLP/AS04 vaccine during the primary study will continue their participation in the follow-up study until Month 48. Subjects in the Control group (Havrix®) will attend one further visit as their last study visit.

The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
