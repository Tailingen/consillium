Coherence Imaging of the Cervical Epithelium With Scanning a/LCI
The purpose of this study is to develop a low coherence interferometry (LCI) endoscopic probe that can examine the cervix for evidence of cervical dysplasia. The device will make optical measurements of the cervix to determine:

1. the difference between two different types of cervical cells: ectocervical cells and endocervical cells. Cervical dysplasia is most likely to occur at the junction between these two types of cells.
2. features of individual cervical cells that indicate whether the cell is normal or abnormal (cervical dysplasia).
Cervical Dysplasia
DEVICE: scanning a/LCI
Sensitivity of Scanning a/LCI Probe to Detect Cervical Dysplasia as Measured by Percentage of Correctly Identified Positive Biopsies, Sensitivity of the scanning a/LCI probe's ability to detect cervical dysplasia determined by calculating the percentage of correctly identified positive optical biopsies measured by the scanning a/LCI probe when compared to the gold standard, histopathology.

There are two dichotomies of classification used in this study: one that focuses on the morphological differences between cells (histology-based classification), and one that focuses on the urgency of corresponding treatment (response-based classification). In the histology-based classification, a result of benign alone is a negative result and a result of LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) or HSIL (high-grade squamous epithelial lesion) is a positive result. In the response-based classification, both benign and LSIL are treated as negative results and HSIL is treated as a positive result., baseline|Specificity of Scanning a/LCI Probe to Detect Cervical Dysplasia as Measured by Percentage of Correctly Identified Negative Optical Biopsies, Specificity of the scanning a/LCI probe's ability to detect cervical dysplasia determined by calculating the percentage of correctly identified negative optical biopsies measured by the scanning a/LCI probe when compared to the gold standard, histopathology.
