Temsirolimus Plus Neratinib for Patients With Metastatic HER2-Amplified or Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, multi-national, adaptive design, dose-escalation Phase 1/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus with daily neratinib, and to determine the safety and efficacy of this combination when given to patients with advanced breast carcinoma, specifically trastuzumab-refractory HER2-amplified disease or triple-negative disease.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Temsirolimus|DRUG: Neratinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Phase II), ORR is defined as proportion of subjects who achieved confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.

A complete or partial response must be confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response are initially met., From enrollment date to first documented response, or last tumor assessment, assessed up to two years
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved objective response (CR or PR) or SD for at least 24 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

Clinical Benefit (CB) = CR + PR + SD \>= 24 weeks., From enrollment date to first documented response, or last tumor assessment, assessed up to two years|Duration of Response (DOR), Measured from the time at which measurement criteria were first met for CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first), until the date of first recurrence, Progressive Disease (PD), or death was objectively documented, taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since enrollment, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Progressive Disease (PD), At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From first response to first PD or death, assessed up to two years.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as time from date of enrollment until the first disease recurrence or progression or death due to any cause; censored at the last assessable evaluation or at the initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. Disease assessment is based on investigator tumor assessments. If no post-baseline tumor assessment then censored at enrollment date., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression, or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to two years.|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause; censored at the date last known alive., From enrollment to date of death from any cause, or end of long term follow-up, assessed up to three years.
Phase I Design A standard, 3+3, dose escalation schedule to determine the MTD of temsirolimus in combination with neratinib with no intrapatient dose escalation and a starting dose of temsirolimus 8 mg administered intravenously (IV) weekly (dose level 1) and three patients enrolled in each cohort.

Phase II Design The phase II portion of this trial is comprised of three cohorts. Two of the cohorts utilized a Simon two-stage design to determine the sample size to assess the efficacy of temsirolimus when administered in combination with neratinib: HER2-amplified and triple negative breast cancer. The third cohort was a single stage design with HER2-amplified patients and dose escalation.
