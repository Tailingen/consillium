Ph2 Gem/Nov/Rituxan Rel/Ref MantleCell
To determine the efficacy (response rate) produced by the combination of Gemzar, Novantrone, and Rituxan in relapsed or refractory MCL
Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: mitoxantrone|DRUG: rituximab
Objective Response Rate (CR + PR), Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 2 years
Duration of Response, The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented.

CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 33 months.|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 1 Year, OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date., 1 year.|Progression-free Survival Rate at 1 Year., PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date., 1 year.
