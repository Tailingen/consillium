Early Phase Clinical Trial About Therapeutic Biological Product Mix for Treating HPV
Conducting an early phase clinical trial to assess HPV Antigen Presentation Therapeutic Biological Product Mix activity that suggests the potential for clinical benefit of HPV patients.

1. Treat Infection of Multiple HPV Virus Strains via Trained Immunity.
2. Activate human HPV Antigen Presentation Reaction.
3. The human antigen presenting cells (APCs) can treat the HPV virus protein antigens into small peptide fragments, and then clear HPV virus in vivo.
