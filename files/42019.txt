* Concurrent (within 1 day) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Concurrent (within 30 days) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (up to 34 months)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Thyroid Tests, Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities in specific thyroid tests based on US conventional units to determine the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab and Daratumumab. The number of subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities from on-treatment evaluations will be summarized:

* TSH value \> ULN and
* with baseline TSH value \<= ULN
* with at least one FT3/FT4 test value \< LLN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with all FT3/FT4 test values \>= LLN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with FT3/FT4 missing within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test.
* TSH \< LLN and
* with baseline TSH value \>= LLN
* with at least one FT3/FT4 test value \> ULN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with all FT3/FT4 test values \<= ULN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with FT3/FT4 missing within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (up to 34 months)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Results of Worst CTC Grade, Number of participants with laboratory test results of worst (CTC v4.0) grades 0-4 to determine the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab and Daratumumab, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (up to 34 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of treated participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on investigator assessments (using RECIST v1.1 criteria), Up to 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time between the date of first documented response (Complete response or partial response) to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined by Investigator (per RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 36 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response, as determined by Investigator, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST v1.1 criteria or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first., Up to 36 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of treatment start day and the date of first documented tumor progression, based on Investigator assessments (per RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 36 months|Nivolumab Serum Concentrations, Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed using serum concentration data for Nivolumab, From day 1 to follow-up 2 (up to 36 months)|Daratumumab Serum Concentrations, Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessed using serum concentration data for Daratumumab, From day 1 to follow-up 2 (up to 36 months)|Percentage of Participants Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) by Positivity, Percentage of participants Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) to assess immunogenicity by ADA positive status and ADA negative status, relative to baseline. ADA positive is a participant with at least one ADA-positive sample relative to baseline (ADA negative at baseline or ADA titer to be at least 4-fold or greater (\>=) than baseline positive titer) at any time after initiation of treatment. ADA Negative is a participant with no ADA-positive sample after initiation of treatment, Up to 36 months
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of Nivolumab and Daratumumab is safe and effective when treating Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung or Triple Negative Breast Cancers, that have advanced or have spread.
