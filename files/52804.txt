Role of Gut Microbiome and Fecal Transplant on Medication-Induced GI Complications in Patients With Cancer
This trial studies the role of the gut microbiome and effectiveness of a fecal transplant on medication-induced gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients with melanoma or genitourinary cancer. The gut microbiome (the bacteria and microorganisms that live in the digestive system) may affect whether or not someone develops colitis (inflammation of the intestines) during cancer treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitor drugs. Studying samples of stool, blood, and tissue from patients with melanoma or genitourinary cancer may help doctors learn more about the effects of treatment on cells, and help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment. Treatment with fecal transplantation may help to improve diarrhea and colitis symptoms.

Difference in stool microbiome pattern, The primary endpoint is alpha diversity of bacteria species (measured using inverse Simpson index). It is a measure of diversity which takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. As species richness and evenness increase, so diversity increases., Up to 1 year|Incidence of adverse events (AE) of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) (Project 3), Adverse events will be recorded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 as well as FMT-specific events. All events will be recorded with grade and attribution to FMT. Adverse events that are related to fecal microbiota transplantation will be summarized using frequency and percentage by AE grade, type and attributions., Up to 1 year
Immune profile factors associated with onset of ICPI-related colitis in blood and colon tissue, Immunohistochemistry study for inflammatory markers will be performed on colon biopsies to measure the change in pattern after treatment. Blood and stool samples will be compared before and after immunosuppressive treatment longitudinally and also horizontally between quick response patients and slow/refractory patient., Up to 1 year|Genetic factors associated with onset of ICPI-related colitis in blood and colon tissue, Genomic bacterial DNA will be extracted from fecal samples, with the addition of a bead-beating lysis step. Genomic 16S ribosomal-RNA V4 variable region will be amplified and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform to obtain the microbiome structure and composition., Up to 1 year|Endoscopic and histologic features of ICPI-related colitis before and after medical treatment, We will assess the resolution of the following endoscopic presentations of ICPI-related colitis including large, deep ulcerations, erosions, diffuse or patchy erythema, inflammatory exudate, loss of vascular pattern, aphthae, and edema after medical treatment.

We will assess the resolution of the following histological features of acute colitis and lymphocytic colitis including neutrophilic infiltration, cryptitis, crypt abscess, eosinophilia, intraepithelial apoptosis, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration after medical treatment., Baseline up to 1 year|Changes of ICPI-related symptoms, We will use MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Colitis module to capture ICPI-related symptoms, which include 22 physical, psychological, and cognitive symptoms and colitis related symptoms. The ratings are on 0-10 numeric scales, ranging from "not present" to "as bad as you can imagine., Up to 1 year|Changes of quality of life (QoL), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Colitis module includes 6 symptom interference items which could capture the impact of therapy on patient's physical and affective functioning. The ratings are on 0-10 numeric scales, ranging from "did not interfere " to "interfered completely "., Up to 1 year|Cytokine features that are associated with good response to FMT, We will compare the levels of many cytokines/chemokines by Luminex assays including IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-Î±, etc. between patients with good response and poor response to FMT., Up to 1 year|Genetic factors associated with onset of ICPI-related colitis in blood and colon tissue, Genomic bacterial DNA will be extracted from fecal samples, with the addition of a bead-beating lysis step.
