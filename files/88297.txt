Marker Assisted Selective ThErapy in Rare Cancers: Knowledge Database Establishing registrY Asia
This is a registry study that aims to collect patients' data with advanced-stage rare cancer in Asia-Pacific region. Data includes clinical information, details of treatment, prognosis, pathological diagnosis and genetic biomarkers by next-generation sequencing.

The relationship between cancer types and prognosis, the effect of treatments, and the cancer type-specific incidence of genomic alterations will be investigated to discover more specific and effective treatment.
