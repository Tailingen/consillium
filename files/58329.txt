Study of MGTA-117 in Patients With Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplasia-Excess Blasts (MDS-EB)
This research study is designed to selectively deplete CD117-positive cells from participants with AML and MDS-EB.

This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and potential anti-leukemia activity and to establish the minimum safe and biologically-effective dose of a single dose of MGTA-117 in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD117+ AML participants and participants with MDS-EB. The study consists of escalating single-dose cohorts using a standard 3+3 design.
