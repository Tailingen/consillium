Effects of Different Physical Therapy Programs on Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients With Lung Cancer
This study applies external diaphragm pacemaker and positive expiratory pressure therapy to patients who received thoracic surgeries, in order to explore the effects of different physical therapy programs on pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with lung cancer. As well as we hope that these physical training programs can effectively improve the lung function of patients, reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, hospitalization days, hospitalization expenses, etc.
Rehabilitation
BEHAVIORAL: ACBT training|DEVICE: acpella®PEP|DEVICE: EDP-type II external diaphragm pacemaker
The change from baseline Forced Expiratory Volume In One Second at one month after surgery, Evaluate the change of Forced Expiratory Volume In One Second before the surgery and one month after surgery by conducting Pulmonary Function Test on resectable NSCLC patients, baseline (before the surgery), and one month after surgery
The change from baseline Borg Score at one month after surgery., Borg Score is a rating of perceived exertion which is a reliable indicator to monitor and guide exercise intensity.It allows individuals to subjectively rate their level of exertion during exercise testing.We would record patients' Borg Score after 6 minutes walking test, baseline (before the surgery), and one month after surgery|Complications incidence, Record the complications of patients after surgery., One month after surgery
This study applies external diaphragm pacemaker and positive expiratory pressure therapy to patients who received thoracic surgeries, ninety patients may be enrolled in this study.

Some metrics are used to evaluate the pulmonary rehabilitation status in postoperative patients which include pulmonary function test, 6-Min Walking Test，Borg index, complications incidence, chest tube draining time, and diaphragm muscle mobility.
