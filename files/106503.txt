Safety Study of LBH589 When Given in Combination With Bortezomib in Adult Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This study comprises of a dose-escalation and dose expansion phase and will determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral Panobinostat on a continuous schedule in adult in combination with bortezomib. Safety, tolerability, PK and PD profile of the combined treatments will be assessed as secondary objectives. Dose expansion phase will explore in a non continuous Panobinostat schedule with bortezomib and dexamethasone, safety and tolerability and PK profile of Panobinostat and Bortezomib with and without Dexamethasone
