PROCLAIM-CX-2029: A Trial to Find Safe and Active Doses of an Investigational Drug CX-2029 for Patients With Solid Tumors or DLBCL
The purpose of this first-in-human study of CX-2029 is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of CX-2029 in adult subjects with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable solid tumors or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The antitumor activity of CX-2029 will be evaluated in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), DLBCL, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (squamous cell histology only), or esophageal (esophageal adenocarcinoma \[EAC\], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma \[ESCC\], or gastroesophageal \[GE\] junction) cancer.

The number of subjects experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity at various dose levels when given CX-2029 as a monotherapy, 21 days (dose-limiting toxicity period)
The percentage of subjects experiencing anti-cancer activity (ORR) at various dose levels when given CX-2029 as a monotherapy, 2 years
This is an open-label, Phase 1-2, first-in-human study for CX-2029 in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable solid tumors or Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) without approved life-prolonging treatment options for their malignancy.

The study is divided into 3 parts (arms), as follows:

* Part A: Dose escalation and determination of the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
* Part B: Characterization of CX-2029 in the Tumor microenvironment (TME) in subjects with select tumor types using previously cleared dose levels from Part A
* Part C: Expansions in select tumor types at the MTD/RP2D as established in Part A
