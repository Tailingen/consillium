Clinical Trial of Green Tea Catechins in Men on Active Surveillance
This randomized double-blinded Phase II clinical trial will evaluate the bioavailability, safety, effectiveness and validate the mechanism by which a standardized formulation of whole Green Tea Catechin, (Sunphenon® 90D) containing 405 mgs vs. Placebo, administered for 24 months in a cohort of men with low to intermediate grade prostate managed on active surveillance
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Sunphenon|DRUG: Placebo
Rate of Progression to Prostate Cancer (PCa), Number of participants with clinical progression defined as a composite outcome on repeat prostate biopsy \>33% of biopsy cores positive for cancer or \>50% of any biopsy tissue core positive for cancer or adverse reclassification of Gleason sum \>3+3 or \>3+4 respectively at end of study biopsy, 24 months
Occurrence of Adverse Events per Study Arm, Safety of Green Tea Catechins (GTC) at daily dose (vs. Placebo) as indicated by incidence of adverse events and toxicities, monitored using Common Toxicity Criteria version 5.0, complete blood count (CBC), and complete metabolic panel (CMP) from baseline, month 6, month 12 and month 24 at end of trial, Liver toxicities (LFTs) from baseline, month 3, 6 and every 3 months until end of intervention, Base line to 24 months|Adherence of Green Tea Catechins vs.Placebo, Adherence based on pill counts and agent logs, Baseline to 24 months|Acceptability of Green Tea Catechins vs.Placebo, Acceptability based on pill counts and agent logs, Baseline to 24 months|Change in (prostate-specific antigen) PSA and PSA kinetics, PSA or PSA density and PSA doubling time at month 12 and at 24 months) from serum at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and month 24, Baseline to 24 months|Change in gene expression panel, Asses change in gene expression panel (Decipher) and a set of 13 biomarker genes known to be overexpressed in PCa from baseline to end of study (EOS) using biopsy tissue, Baseline to 24 months|Proportion of men with no cancer, Assess the proportion of men with no cancer in the post-intervention biopsy, Baseline to 24 months
