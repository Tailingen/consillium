Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Effects of Ethnicity and Food on Pharmacokinetics of YH25448
Clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of ethnicity and food on the pharmacokinetics (how a drug is absorbed, metabolized, distributed and excreted; plasma drug concentration will be measured in this clinical trial) of YH25448, which Yuhan Corporation plans to develop as a therapeutic agent for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

This clinical trial will be conducted in healthy Korean and Caucasian volunteers at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) Clinical Trial Center.

It is expected to take approximately 39 days from the first dosing of Investigational Product until the final follow-up visit. It will be hospitalized twice for 9 nights and 10 days with 21 days of interval, and one visit will be needed for safety evaluation between 14-17 days from the last dosing of the Investigational Product.
