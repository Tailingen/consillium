Comparison of Interleukin-11 and rhTPO for Recurrent Colorectal Cancer Patients With Thrombocytopenia
This randomized controlled clinical phase II study was designed to compare the effect of rhTPO with rhIL-11 in improving thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer who underwent radiotherapy and with thrombocytopenia.

Most patients with recurrent CRC have undergone a six-month postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil. Although the main dose-limiting side effect of oxaliplatin is neurotoxicity, with the widespread use of this drug, there are more and more reports that oxaliplatin is discontinued because of thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding, rate of blood transfusion needs and length of stay. On the other hand, patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy may also experience significant bone marrow suppression because flat bones such as the tibia may be exposed to high doses radiation. Low platelet counts is an urgent problem to be solved in order to give adequate quantitative radiotherapy. This randomized controlled clinical phase II study was designed to compare the effect of rhTPO with rhIL-11 in improving thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer who underwent radiotherapy and with thrombocytopenia, thus providing more evidence in clinical practice.
