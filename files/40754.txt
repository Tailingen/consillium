Comprehensive Digital Archive of Cancer Imaging-Radiation Oncology( CHAVI-RO )
In this pilot project Investigators propose to create annotated image data bank of patients suffering from cancer. The system will provide India's first comprehensive platform to upload annotated images with associated medical and demographic information of a patient. It will support flexible query from the users with appropriate choice from a set of attributes and design of various query filters using a GUI. Over the proposed period of 18 months, images and records related to radiation oncology including pretreatment images of at least 500 patients would be annotated and archived in the data bank. The imaging modalities to be covered are X-RAY mammograms, SPECT, CT, CBCT, MR, PET-CT, Ultrasound, digital histopathology, etc. In this phase, this study will include data sets of five types of cancers namely, breast, head and neck, brain, cervix and lung cancer.

Investigator propose to demonstrate the application of this data set in cancer research. Investigator will work on serial PET-CT based radiomics of breast and cervix cancer patients to extract appropriate features and correlate them with clinico-pathological variants.
