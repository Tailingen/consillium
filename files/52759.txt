Cancer Patients Decision Making and Family Communication About Secondary Findings From Tumor Genomic Profiling
The objective of this protocol is to characterize cancer patients' responses to learning their secondary findings arising from tumor genomic profiling, and the process and outcomes of their decisions to communicate these results to their families.
Tumor Genomic Profiling
BEHAVIORAL: survey|BEHAVIORAL: semi-structured interview
The investigators will assess patients' emotional responses to receiving their secondary findings, Through quantitative (i.e., survey) assessments, the investigators will assess patients' emotional (both positive and negative) responses to receiving their secondary findings, and their perceptions regarding the utility of this information and communicating it to family., 1 year
For Phase 1 of this study, the investigators will conduct a prospective, observational study with cancer patients undergoing tumor genomic profiling (n = 300) and their family members (anticipated n â‰ˆ 150). Data collection will occur through an embedded mixed methods design, in which both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., semi-structured interview) data are collected at the same timepoint in order to obtain a more complete understanding of specific processes and outcomes.

They will be recruited from those who already enrolled in protocol #12-245, and who agree to receive their secondary findings through Consent Part C of this existing protocol.

For Phase 2 of this study, participants (n=500) who have received pathogenic secondary findings through protocol #12-245 will be recruited.

For Phase 3, efforts will be expanded from the adult populations explored in the preceding phases to the experiences of patients affected by pediatric cancers and their families. Cross-sectional mixed methods data from AYA survivors of pediatric cancers (n=50) and adult caregivers of survivors of pediatric cancer (n=50) will be collected.
