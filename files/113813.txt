Rare Tumours in Children and Adolescents (STEP)
The aim of the STEP registry is to collect and evaluate experience and data on the diagnosis and treatment of rare childhood tumors in order to use the knowledge gained to improve the treatment prospects for our patients. The rarity of a disease should not be a disadvantage for the young patients.

The objective of the STEP registry is to optimise the diagnosis and treatment of patients with rare tumour diseases in childhood and adolescence. Therefore, a continuous prospective collection of clinical data on rare paediatric tumours is conducted to improve the understanding of these tumours. Beyond analysis of clinical data, further scientific research on the biological and molecular genetic characteristics of these tumours is performed. These data and a close collaboration with international partners, especially the European EXPeRT group, enable the improvement of treatment recommendations for these tumours along with establishment a global interdisciplinary network of rare tumour specialists.
