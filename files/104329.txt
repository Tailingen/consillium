Surgery for Ovarian Cancer After PARPi Therapy in Precision
This multicenter, biomarker-driven, patient-centric study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of secondary cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer (PSROC) after previous PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy.

There have been fewer effective treatments for patients with disease progression occurring during or after PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy. The immune phenotype of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer may correlate with their response to immunotherapy. This multicenter, biomarker-driven, patient-centric study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of secondary cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer (PSROC) after previous PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy. PD-L1 expression and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cell count (CD8+ TILs count) were evaluated as biomarkers using archived or fresh tumor tissue samples in patients with BRCA1/2 wild type.

This study would be proceeded in two phases. The phase 1b single-arm study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Sintilimab in the treatment of BRCA wild type, PD-L1-positive, CD8+ TILs-positive, patients with PSROC after previous PARPi maintenance therapy. The patent-centric phase II study with three arms aimed to evaluate the efficacy of secondary cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with Sintilimab in these patients. In arm 1 and 2, patients received secondary cytoreduction followed by platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with Sintilimab. In arm 3, patients received physician's therapy of choice.
