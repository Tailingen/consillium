A Pilot Trial of AC (Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide) Chemotherapy With G-CSF (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor) Followed by Infusional Taxol (Paclitaxel) as Adjuvant Treatment for High Risk Stage II and Stage III Breast Cancer Patients
This is a pilot feasibility trial of AC (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy with G-CSF (filgrastim) followed by infusional Taxol (paclitaxel) as adjuvant treatment for patients with high risk stage II and stage III breast cancer. Cycles will be 14 days in duration. After 3 fourteen day cycles of AC with filgrastim, patients will be treated with 3 fourteen day cycles of 96 hour infusional paclitaxel. The goal of this study will be to assess the toxicity and feasibility of administering dose-intensive AC chemotherapy followed by infusional paclitaxel in 14 day cycles.
