Phase Ib of Abiraterone Acetate Plus BEZ235 or BKM120 in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Patients
This is an open label study of abiraterone acetate in combination with BEZ235 and abiraterone acetate in combination with BKM120 in CRPC patients with abiraterone acetate failure.
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BEZ235|DRUG: BKM120|DRUG: BEZ235|DRUG: BKM120
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose escalation part: Determine MTD and /or RDE of the combinations abiraterone acetate + BEZ235 and abiraterone acetate + BKM120 by assessing the incidence of DLTs in cycle 1, from days 1-35 in BEZ235/abiraterone acetate arm and from days 1-28 in BKM120/abiraterone acetate arm|Prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 30%, Dose expansion part: Assess anti-tumor activity of the combinations (abiraterone acetate + BEZ235 and abiraterone acetate + BKM120) in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with abiraterone acetate failure as on treatment PSA progression according to prostate cancer working group criteria 2 (PCWG2) by assessing PSA decline ≥ 30% at Week 12 or later., At week 12 or later after treatment discontinuation
Number of patients with at least one adverse event, Treatment start until 30 days after the last dose|radiological Progression Free Survival as per RECIST 1.1 and PCWG2, Every 12 weeks until disease progression|radiological Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1, Every 12 weeks until disease progression|Overall Survival, From treatment start until 75% of deaths from any cause have occurred|Number and percentage of patients with laboratory abnormalities, Treatment start until 30 days after the last dose|Changes in ECG (electrocardiogram), Treatment start until 30 days after the last dose|Changes in vital signs, Treatment start until 30 days after the last dose|Changes in mood scales, Treatment start until 30 days after the last dose
A dose-escalation part will first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recomended dose for expansion (RDE) of abiraterone acetate in combination with BEZ235 and abiraterone acetate in combination with BKM120 in CRPC patients with abiraterone acetate failure.

Subsequently, the MTD and/or RDE of each combination will be investigated in two expansion treatment groups of CRPC patients who have failed abiraterone acetate therapy.
