This is a Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of ABL503, and to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ABL503 in Subjects with Any Progressive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL503 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary antitumor activity, and the PD effect of ABL503 in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors who are relapsed or refractory following the last line of treatment and have no available standard of care option. This study includes 3 parts: a dose-escalation part, a dose-expansion part and tumor-expansion part
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ABL503
Number of Subjects with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of subjects with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), From Day 1 until disease progression or Day 28, whichever came first|Number of subjects with AE, IrAEs, IRRs, SAEs and abnormalities in Lab, Number of subjects with Adverse Event, Immune-related Adverse Event, Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs), serious AEs, and abnormalities in lab parameters, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, unacceptable AEs, or subject's consent withdrawal, or investigator's decision to discontinue treatment, which came first, assessed up to approx. 12 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subject with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, unacceptable AEs, or subject's consent withdrawal, or investigator's decision to discontinue treatment, which came first, assessed up to approx. 12 months|Pharmacokinetic (PK) of ABL503, Serum concentrations of ABL503 will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of ABL503, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, unacceptable AEs, or subject's consent withdrawal, or investigator's decision to discontinue treatment, which came first, assessed up to approx. 12 months|Immunogenicity of ABL503, Incidence of anti-ABL503 antibody will be analyzed to evaluate the Immunogenicity of ABL503, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, unacceptable AEs, or subject's consent withdrawal, or investigator's decision to discontinue treatment, which came first, assessed up to approx. 12 months
