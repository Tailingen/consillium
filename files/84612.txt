A Multicenter Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of 177Lu-DOTA-TATE Based on Kidney-Dosimetry in Patients With Disseminated Neuroendocrine Tumors
By improved kidney dosimetry including biological effective dose and taking into account potential risk factors (especially for kidney toxicity), it might be possible to give an optimal and personalized treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-TATE to the patient with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
Neuroendocrine Tumors|Liver Metastases
DRUG: 177Lu-DOTA-TATE
Objective tumor response after a cumulative kidney biologically effective dose (BED) of 27 +/- 2 Gy, 3 months after completed step 1
Objective tumor response after receiving a cumulative BED to the kidneys of 40 +/- 2 Gy as per RECIST v 1.1, 3 months after completing step 2 treatment
By improved kidney dosimetry including biological effective dose and taking into account potential risk factors (especially for kidney toxicity), it might be possible to give an optimal and personalized treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-TATE to the patient with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor.
