A Parallel Arm Phase 1b/2a Study of DKN-01 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Docetaxel for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer With Elevated DKK1
This is a non-randomized multi-center Phase 1b/2a dose escalation and dose expansion study testing DKN-01 as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients need to be biomarker positive (Dickkopf-1 \[DKK1\]) either in plasma or biopsy. Other biopsies for correlative studies are encouraged but not mandatory. Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of one pre-treatment blood sample and one post-treatment blood sample will be mandatory on Day 1 of every cycle.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: DKN-01|DRUG: Docetaxel
Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities Observed by End of Treatment Cycle 1, Measured among Phase I dose-escalation cohorts (arms 1A.1, 1A.2, 2A.1, and 2A.2) only., Up to End of Cycle 1 (Up to Day 21 for Cohort 1A, Up to Day 28 for Cohort 2A)|Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (iCR) or Partial Response (iPR) Per iRECIST by End of Long-Term Follow-Up Period, iRECIST will be used by the Investigator to assess tumor response and progression. An iCR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions as assessed by iRECIST; an iPR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, as assessed by iRECIST., Up to Year 2 Post-Baseline
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to documentation of radiographic progression in soft tissue as assessed by Investigator using iRECIST, in bone as assessed by Investigator using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), or death, whichever occurs first., Up to Year 2 Post-Baseline|Number of Participants With a Decline in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) of at Least 50% Relative to Baseline, Up to Year 2 Post-Baseline|Maximal Percent Change in PSA Measured After Treatment Initiation, Up to Year 2 Post-Baseline
