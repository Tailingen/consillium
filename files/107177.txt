A Study of Standard Treatment +/- Enoxaparin in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The endpoint is to investigate if the addition of low molecular heparin - enoxaparin, will result in a significant increase of overall survival in patients with small cell lung cancer, receiving standard chemotherapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: cisplatinum or carboplatin and e.g.etoposide.|DRUG: cisplatinum or carboplatin and e.g.etoposide+enoxaparin
Significant increase of overall survival, At follow up 1 year after treatment
Toxicity, During treatment
