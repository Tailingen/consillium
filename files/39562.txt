the Safety and Effectiveness of Protein Supplements on Cancer Patients With Nutritional Risk and Malnutrition
Nutritional risk and malnutrition is common in cancer patients, which is one of the significant factors affecting the overall survival, toxicity during anticancer treatment, and quality of life among patients with cancer. Previous studies have shown that the increased protein intake can stimulate muscle synthesis, and improve muscle mass, strength, function, overall survival, and quality of life. The current study is going to investigate the effectiveness and safety of protein supplements on patients with cancer, in order to provide a reference for further nutrition treatment.
Cancer|Malnutrition
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: protein supplement|BEHAVIORAL: nutrition counseling
blood toxicity, blood toxicity based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 6 month|nutritional risk, nutritional risk based on nutrition risk screening-2002 (NRS-2002), 6 months|malnutrition, malnutrition assessment based on Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), 6 months
phase angle (PA), phase angle (PA) assessed by multi-Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (m-BIA), 6 month|weight, weight change during the study, 6 month|dose limitation, dose limitation, 6 months
An anticipated total of 100 participants will randomly assigned to receive either a 20-gram protein supplement per day or nutrition counseling to increase the protein intake. there will be a total of 3 study visits, and dietary assessment and blood sample collection will occur at every study visit. Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol analysis (PP) will be used in statistical analysis.
