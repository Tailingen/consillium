Outcomes of Patients Who Had an Incomplete Colonoscopy After a Positive Fecal Immunological Test
In France, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death. Its organized screening (Organized ColoRectal Cancer Screening: DOCCR), now carried out by immunological test for occult blood in the stool, has proven its effectiveness. When the immunological test is positive, the Haute Autorité de Santé recommends a total colonoscopy. In 5 to 10% of cases, this colonoscopy is incomplete. The renewal of the endoscopic procedure or the performance of additional second-line examinations are then recommended. At present, however, the respective place of second-line examinations to be performed in this situation is not the subject of specific and validated recommendations.
