Tislelizumab Combined With Recombinant Human Endostatin Combined With Chemotherapy for Unresectable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical study designed to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of patients receiving Tislelizumab in combination with recombinant human endostatin injection plus chemotherapy for stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. To evaluate the surgical conversion rate of tirellizumab combined with recombinant human endostatin injection and chemotherapy induction therapy in patients with initially unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Unresectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: neoadjuvant therapy:Tislelizumab With Recombinant human endostatin combined with Chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: surgery|DRUG: Adjuvant therapy:Tislelizumab and Recombinant Human Endostatin Injection (Endostar)|OTHER: Standard Treatment
Surgical resection rate, Proportion of patients who underwent surgical resection after induction therapy, From enrollment to the end of surgery
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response or a partial response, measured by RECIST 1.1., prior to surgery|Event-Free Survival(EFS), The time from the start of randomization (or the start of treatment in a one-arm trial) to the first occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression without surgical treatment, local or distant recurrence, death from any cause, etc., Up to 2years|Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate, no residual tumor cells in the surgically resected tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment., 1 month after surgery|Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate, Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate: defined as â‰¤ 10% of residual tumor cells in the surgically resected tumor specimen and sampled regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment., 1 month after surgery|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS): defined as the time from the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death (from any cause), 3 years|1 years event free survival (EFS), 1 years EFS rate is defined as the percentage of participants having no radiographic disease progression, local progression precluding surgery, inability to resect the tumor, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause within 1years after randomization., 1 years|1 years Progression-Free Survival (PFS), 1 years Progression-Free Survival (PFS): defined as the time from the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first within 1 years after randomization., 1 years after randomization|1 years overall survival rate (OS), 1 years OS rate is defined as the percentage of participants having no death of any cause within 1 years after operation.The Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to estimate median OS and its 95%CI and the survival curve., 1 years after randomization|R0 Resection Rate, R0 Resection Rate: The pathological results will showed that the incision margin was negative and no residual cancer cells were found under the microscope., 1 month after surgery|Safety and Tolerability, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 3 years
