Safety Study of CC-292 and Lenalidomide in Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This is a dose finding study using a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to determine a Not Tolerated Dose (NTD), Optimal Biological Effect Dose (OBE) and / or Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). These data will be used to establish a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for the combination of CC-292 and lenalidomide in subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).
Leukemia Lymphocytic Chronic B-Cell
DRUG: CC-292|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Adverse Events, Number of participants with adverse events, Up to 5 years
Percentage of Participants Who Have Received Some Form of Response, Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved some form of response including: a Complete Response (CR), a CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery, a Nodular Partial Response (PR), a Nodal PR or a PR with lymphoctyosis) based on the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and lymphoma guidelines (IWCLL)., Up to 2 years|PK-Cmax, Maximum observed plasma concentration, Up to 15 days|PK-Tmax, Time to maximum observed plasma concentration, Up to 15 days|PK-λz, Terminal phase rate constant, determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the log-linear plasma concentration-time curve. Visual assessment will be used to identify the terminal linear phase of the concentration, Up to 15 days|PK-t1/2, Estimate of the terminal elimination half-life in plasma, Up to 15 days|PK-AUC (0-t), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time t, where t is the last measurable time point, Up to 15 days|PK-AUC0-∞, Area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity., Up to 15 days
This dose finding study uses a 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion design to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. The starting dose is CC-292 375 mg twice daily and Lenalidomide 10 mg once daily. After review of the data for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the second dose level will be enrolled. Doses for this second cohort are CC-292 500 mg twice daily and lenalidomide 10 mg once daily. Additional doses of lenalidomide in combination with CC-292 may be evaluated to accurately determine the maximum tolerated dose. Once the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimal biologic effect has been ascertained, an expansion cohort of 24 subjects may be enrolled.
