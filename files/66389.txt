A Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of ENV-501 in Patients With HER3-Expressing Solid Tumors
This study is a Phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ENV-501 in patients with advanced-stage, relapsed and/or refractory human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-expressing solid tumors. The study consists of 2 phases: a dose escalation phase (Phase 1) and a dose expansion phase (Phase 2).

The primary objectives of Phase 1 are to characterize the overall safety and tolerability profile of increasing doses of ENV-501 in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ENV-501. During Phase 1, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of ENV-501. The results of the dose escalation will determine the RP2D and dosing schedule of ENV-501 to be administered in the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the preliminary clinical efficacy of ENV-501 in dose expansion cohorts.

BIOLOGICAL: ENV-501
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response is defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by investigator assessment, measured by revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., through study completion, an average of 6 months
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) by investigator assessment, measured by revised RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Objective Response Rate (ORR), through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): maximum blood concentration (Cmax) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): time of maximum blood concentration (Tmax) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): absorption to time t (AUC0-t) after a single dose, AUC represents "area under the concentration-time curve" and measures the amount of drug that is present in the blood from the time of administration to a given time 't', At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): absorption to end of the dosing period (AUC0-tau) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): total absorption (AUC0-infinity) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): drug half-life (t1/2) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): minimum blood concentration (Cmin) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): rate of clearance (CL) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) after a single dose, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Cmax at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Tmax at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): AUC0-t at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation):AUC0-tau at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): t1/2 at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Cmin at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): accumulation ratio at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Disease Control Rate (DCR), through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Duration of Response (DoR), A DoR event is defined as disease progression or death due to any cause in the subset of patients who achieved CR or PR on the study. DoR will be calculated from the date of first radiographic evidence of objective response by RECIST v1.1 to the date of progression, date of death, or date of last follow-up, whichever is the earliest., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Progression-free Survival (PFS), A PFS event is defined as disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be calculated from the date of treatment start to the date of progression, date of death, or date of last follow-up, whichever is the earliest., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Cmax at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months|Phase 2 (Dose Expansion): Cmin at steady state, through study completion, an average of 6 months
