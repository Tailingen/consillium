Preemptive and Precise Intervention for CKD-SHPT
Through multi-center randomized controlled trial studies on preemptive surgical intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) - secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), to precisely evaluate the safety and effectiveness during perioperative period, and the long-term outcomes by 1-year follow-up. The follow-ups include the evaluation of the overall quality of life, calcium and phosphorus metabolism, hyperparathyroidism level, vitamin D metabolism, bone mineral density, soft tissue and vascular calcification.
Hyperparathyroidism; Secondary, Renal
PROCEDURE: Preemptive Surgical Intervention and Precise Efficacy Evaluation of CKD-SHPT
Safety of preemptive surgical intervention, The rate of post operative complications(including bleeding, infection, adjacent tissue injury) of early precise parathyroidectomy surgery in patients with CKD-SHPT, according to the electronic medical records of the hospital., October 2020 to September 2022|Efficacy of preemptive surgical intervention, The rate of relapse of hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy, according to the immunoreactive parathyroid hormone concentration., October 2020 to September 2022
short-term and long-term mortality, The all-cause mortality rate and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality rate during hospitalization, by Day 60, Day 180 and 1 year during follow-up., October 2020 to September 2022|short-term and long-term bone metabolism, The level of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, 25(OH)-vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and biomarker series of bone metabolism during hospitalization, by Day 60, Day 180 and 1 year., October 2020 to September 2022|Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF36) Scale, Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF36) scale on quality of life during hospitalization, by Day 60, Day 180 and 1 year during follow-ups. The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is 100, and higher scores mean a better outcome., October 2020 to September 2022|cardiovascular function, The left ventricular ejection fraction (%, obtained by echocardiography) during hospitalization, by Day 180 and 1 year during medical visits., October 2020 to September 2022|inpatient days, Length of hospitalization, according the electronic medical records., October 2020 to September 2022|hospitalization costs, Cost of hospitalization, according the electronic medical records., October 2020 to September 2022|adverse events associated with metabolic bone disease, e.g. fall down, bone fracture during follow-ups, through medical visits and telephone follow-ups., October 2020 to September 2022
