Electroacupuncture for Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment
The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture compared to sham acupuncture in preventing CRCI among breast cancer patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment
DEVICE: Electroacupuncture|DEVICE: Sham acupuncture
The incidence of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) at the end of chemotherapy, All participants will undergo neuropsychological assessments at baseline and after chemotherapy. CRCI is defined as two or more test scores at or below -1.5 standard deviations (SDs), or a single test score at or below -2.0 SDs from baseline to the end of chemotherapy., After chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle). Each chemotherapy cycle typically lasts for 4 weeks.
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog), FACT-Cog will be used to assess cognitive function and its impact on cancer patients., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), MoCA will be used to identify the presence of cognitive impairment., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), FACT-G will be used to measure the impact of cancer and its treatment on patients' overall well-being., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), GAD-7 will be used to assess the frequency and severity of symptoms such as excessive worry, restlessness and difficulty in relaxing., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), PHQ-9 will be used to assess the frequency and severity of several symptoms commonly associated with depression., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), ISI will be used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms and their impact on an individual's daily functioning, During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).|Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), PRO-CTCAE is a tool used to document self-reported adverse events and their severity on a 5-point scale. In our trial, we plan to evaluate 12 symptoms selected from the original PRO-CTCAE scale, specifically decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia, fatigue, headache, and dizziness., During chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle).
Treatment safety, Incidence of adverse events., Adverse events will be observed and recorded throughout the trial. The study duration will depend on the chemotherapy cycle of each participant, which may range from 4 months to 8 months.
Participants will be randomized to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment. Both treatments will be administered twice a week, starting one week before chemotherapy and continuing throughout the chemotherapy period. The study outcomes will be evaluated at three time points: baseline (before acupuncture and chemotherapy), during chemotherapy (one day before the third chemotherapy cycle), after chemotherapy (21 days after the last chemotherapy cycle). Each cycle typically lasts for 4 weeks.
