Radiotherapy Treatments for the Treatment of Thoracic District Tumors
Evaluation of clinical and dosimetric aspects, tolerance, and effectiveness of thoracic radiotherapy treatments in patients undergoing radiotherapy for primary or secondary neoplasms localized in the thoracic anatomical region.
Thoracic Neoplasms
Overall survival, Number of patients death, 5 years|Disease free survival, Number of oncological event (local recurrence, distant metastasis, other primary tumor), 5 years
Approximately 60% of patients with neoplasms receive radiotherapy as part of their oncological treatment.

Various primary tumors as well as metastases of various origins can be localized in the thoracic anatomical region.

Patients with such neoplastic localizations will therefore receive radiotherapy treatment possibly associated with other systemic or surgical treatments.

Treatment choice is usually established following multidisciplinary discussions, based on disease characteristics and stage, concurrent pathologies and pharmacological treatments, patient preferences, and functional aspects.

The collection of data related to radiotherapy plays a crucial role in understanding various clinical aspects of the treatment itself. The availability of data from an increasing number of patients will allow the identification of clinical situations or technical parameters of radiotherapy correlated with treatment tolerance and effectiveness, aiming to identify the best treatment for these oncological pathologies. This project aims to collect data related to radiotherapy treatments for primary or secondary neoplasms of the thoracic region for scientific dissemination with the goal of establishing the basis for evaluating achieved results over time, and deriving from these elements useful for guiding the most effective treatment strategies and appropriate operational protocols.
