A Study of the Pan-KRAS Inhibitor LY4066434 in Participants With KRAS Mutant Solid Tumors
The main purpose of the study is to assess whether the study drug, LY4066434, is safe and tolerable when administered to participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with certain KRAS mutations. LY4066434 will be given alone or in combination with other treatments. The study will have 2 parts: monotherapy dose escalation and dose optimization. The study is expected to last up to approximately 5 years.
