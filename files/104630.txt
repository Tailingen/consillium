Rociletinib Genomic Landscape in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Though patients whose tumors harbor EGFR T790M mutation appear to benefit from rociletinib, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to primary and acquired resistance to rociletinib. The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of rociletinib of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations (including exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation), with or without EGFR T790M mutation. In these patients, pre-treatment and post-progression biopsy specimens will be subjected to genomic analysis to fully understand the clonal evolution and the molecular mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance.

DRUG: Rociletinib|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood draw
Somatic genetic changes in the tumor associated with disease progression, -The investigators plan to conduct exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor before therapy with rociletinib and at the time of relapse. In addition, exome sequencing of peripheral blood DNA will be done (for germ line)., Until the time of disease progression (estimated median of 3 months)
Overall response rate (ORR), * ORR: Percentage of patients experiencing complete response or partial response
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Until the time of disease progression (estimated median of 3 months)|Overall survival (OS), Until death (estimated median of 8 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Until the time of progression (estimated median of 3 months)|Duration of treatment, Until the time of removal from study (estimated median of 3 months)
