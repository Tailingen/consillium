Fruquintinib Plus FOLFIRI in RAS-mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RAS mutations are found in nearly half of colorectal cancer patients. However, except for G12C mutation, no driven gene targeted drug can be used. the commonly first-line used treatment regimen is bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy. Angiogenesis is an important therapeutic target in colorectal carcinoma. Fruquintinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of VEGFR1/2/3, has approved for the third-line treatment of refractory colorectal cancer.

DRUG: intensive treatment|DRUG: Maintenance treatment
Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response, using RECIST v 1.1, assessed up to 1 year
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, assessed up to 1 year
Overall survival (OS), time from randomization to death from any cause., assessed up to 2 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), the proportion of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease, using RECIST v 1.1, assessed up to 1 year
This is a prospective ,single-center, open labeled, single-arm phase II study exploring the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with FOLFIRI as second-line treatment of RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients with disease progression during or after first-line therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.
