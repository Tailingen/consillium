Fractionated Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Treating Measurable Residual Disease in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase II trial studies the how well fractionated gemtuzumab ozogamicin works in treating measurable residual disease in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called gemtuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called ozogamicin. Gemtuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD33 receptors, and delivers a chemotherapy known as calicheamicin to kill them.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment
Clinical response rate, Measured by clearance of measurable residual disease (MRD) with bone marrow evaluation after one or two cycles of therapy and compare responses (rate of eradication of MRD) based on CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism rs12459419 genotype., Up to 70 days
Rate of sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS), Measured by grade III/IV non-hematologic toxicities using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4., Up to 6 months|Rate of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), Measured by those receiving HCT, Up to 6 Months
OUTLINE:

Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 7. Treatment continues for 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Responders and non-responders, without significant adverse events during the first course, may receive a second course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin within 60 days after course 1.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
