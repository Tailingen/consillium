A Study to Assess the Benefit of Treatment Beyond Progression With Enzalutamide in Men Who Are Starting Treatment With Docetaxel After Worsening of Their Prostate Cancer When Taking Enzalutamide Alone
The purpose of the study was to understand if there was benefit in continued treatment with a medicine called enzalutamide, when starting treatment with docetaxel and prednisolone (a standard chemotherapy for prostate cancer), after the prostate cancer had gotten worse when treated with enzalutamide alone.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS: time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to earliest progression event. Progression is defined as radiographic progression, unequivocal clinical progression, or death on study. Radiographic progression is defined for bone disease by appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions on whole-body radionuclide bone scan per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria (i.e., unconfirmed progressive disease) that needs to be confirmed in the next assessment (i.e., progressive disease in the next assessment) or for soft tissue disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Unequivocal clinical progression is defined as new onset cancer pain requiring chronic administration of opiate analgesia or deterioration from prostate cancer of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score to ≥ 3, or initiation of subsequent lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy or surgical intervention due to complications of tumor progression., From date of randomization to the earliest of either documented disease progression (median duration: 35 weeks)
Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to the date of the first PSA value in Period 2 demonstrating progression (Period 2). The PSA progression date is defined as the date that a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir recorded in Period 2 is documented, which must be confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained at least 3 weeks later., From date of randomization to the first PSA value (median duration: 35 weeks)|Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response, PSA response, defined as a decrease in percentage change from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) of 50% or more. PSA response was derived at Week 13 and at any time after randomization in Period 2. PSA response at any time is defined as a decrease in percentage change from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) at any time after randomization of 50% or more. Percentage of participants with PSA response was reported., Randomization, Week 13, any time after randomization in Period 2 (median of 35 weeks)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the best overall radiographic response after randomization (Period 2 Week 1) as per Investigator assessments of response for soft tissue disease per RECIST 1.1, in participants who had a measurable tumor. ORR was reported as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm from baseline measurement. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of diameters., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to Pain Progression, The time to an increase of \>=30% from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) in average BPI-SF item scores (items 3, 4, 5, 6) at two consecutive evaluations \>=3 weeks apart without decrease in analgesic score according to the World health Organization (WHO). Only participants with an average pain intensity item score \>=4 were considered. The BPI-SF was an instrument to document pain-related functional impairment and contains 7 questions which included pain intensity \[(items 3, 4, 5 and 6): worst pain, least pain, average pain and current pain, with scales from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine)\] and pain interference \](items 9A to 9G): general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life, with scales from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)\]. The BPI-SF total score for pain intensity was calculated as the mean of the 4 scores for the 4 items of pain intensity., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to Opiate Use for Cancer-related Pain, Time to opiate use for cancer-related pain, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to initiation of chronic administration of opiate analgesia \[parenteral opiate use for ≥7 days or use of WHO Analgesic Ladder Level 3 oral opiates for ≥3 weeks\]., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Time to First Skeletal-related Event (SRE), Time to first SRE, defined as the time from randomization (Period 2 Week 1) to radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain., From date of randomization up to median duration of 35 weeks|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-P quality of life questionnaire is a multi-dimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument specifically designed for use with prostate cancer participants. It consists of 27 core items which assess participant function in four domains rated on 0 to 4 Likert-type scale: physical well-being (PWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), social/family well-being (SWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), emotional well-being (EWB) (6 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-24), and functional well-being (FWB) (7 items; 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-28), which is further supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms (Prostate Cancer Subscale \[PCS\] 12 items rated on Likert-type scale 0 \[worst\] to 4 \[better\], score range 0-48). The total domain scores and PCS subscale score are then combined to a global quality of life score ranging between 0 to 156; higher scores representing better quality of life., Period 2: Baseline, weeks 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, 169, 181|Change From Baseline in EuroQOL 5-dimension 5-level Questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable)., Period 2: Baseline, weeks 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97, 109, 121, 133, 145, 157, 169, 181
The study was conducted in consecutive periods of open label treatment with enzalutamide followed by randomized double-blind treatment with continued enzalutamide or placebo, in combination with docetaxel and prednisolone.

Open Label (Period 1)

Participants received open label treatment (OL) with enzalutamide. At week 13, all participants were assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and imaging. Participants with no confirmed PSA response or evidence of radiographic progression were ineligible for participation in Period 2 and typically had safety follow up; however, Period 1 treatment continued for some participants as long as the investigator considered it to be of clinical benefit (stopping on initiation of any new antineoplastic therapy). Participants with confirmed PSA response continued Period 1 until disease progression.

Enrollment to Period 2 ceased after approximately 274 participants had been enrolled or 182 primary endpoint events had been reached, whichever occurred first. Participants who were not randomized into period 2 at this time continued to receive open label treatment in an extension period.

Randomization (Double Blind \[DB\]) (Period 2)

Participants with confirmed disease progression on enzalutamide alone who continued to meet all eligibility criteria proceeded to randomization. Treatment allocation was in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by disease progression in Period 1 to the following treatments:

* Enzalutamide with docetaxel and prednisolone
* Placebo with docetaxel and prednisolone

Any ongoing participants in Period 2 at the point of unblinding in the enzalutamide+docetaxel arm that were still receiving and benefitting from enzalutamide treatment, had the option to continue treatment via an extension period.
