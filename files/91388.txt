Ph 1 Trial of ADI-PEG 20 Plus Cisplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Certain cancers require the amino acid arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is an enzyme from microbes that degrades arginine. ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol, and has been used to treat patients that have cancers that require arginine. In this study, ADI will be combined with the well known chemotherapy cisplatin, and the safety and potential efficacy of this combination will be explored in patients with cancers that require arginine.
