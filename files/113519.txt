Anti-HER2 CAR-T Cell Injection in Patients With HER2-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Anti-HER2 CAR-T cell injection in patients with HER2-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.
HER2-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-HER2 CAR-T cells
Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) & Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) following infusion of CAR-T cell injection, at each dose level tested in dose escalation phase., 4 weeks after the CAR-T cells infusion|Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events., 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of the disease progression or death from any cause., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of death due to any cause., 2 years
All eligible participants will receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and ABRAXANE followed by Anti-HER2 CAR-T cell injection.The dose escalation phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Anti-HER2 CAR-T cell injection. Additional patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase to further characterize the safety profile and evaluate the efficacy of Anti-HER2 CAR-T cell injection, and establish recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
