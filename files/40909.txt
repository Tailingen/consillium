A Study of MRG002 in the Treatment of HER2-positive Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelium Cancer
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG002 as single agent in patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelium cancer.
Locally Advanced Urothelial Cancer|Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: MRG002
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months
ORR by Investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with CR and PR as assessed by Investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented objective response to the first onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the first onset of CR or PR in tumor evaluation., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion, up to 12 months|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of MRG002: concentration-time curve, Concentration-time curve will be depicted based on pharmacokinetics concentration set (PKCS)., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), The incidence of ADA analysis will be summarized for all patients who received at least one cycle study treatment., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
The study consists of two stages. In Phase IIa, approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG002. Based on the initial safety and efficacy data obtained from the Phase IIa, the study design of second stage Phase IIb single-arm study either will be continued or the trail will be terminated. If the Phase IIa data support the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional 33 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG002.
