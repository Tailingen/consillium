Crizotinib in Pretreated Metastatic Non-small-cell Lung Cancer With MET Amplification or ROS1 Translocation (METROS)
Phase II, two arms, parallel, non comparative study with crizotinib in patients with ROS 1 translocation or MET amplification or MET exon 14 mutation
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Crizotinib
Response rate to crizotinib in patients with ROS1 translocation or MET amplification or MET exon 14 mutation, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Overall Survival (OS), From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Toxicity analysis: Incidence of Grade 3-4 Grade Toxicity graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4.0, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Correlation with additional tumor biomarkers in tumor tissue or blood, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Response according to different levels of ROS1 translocation or MET amplification (ratio >2.2 and <5 versus ratio â‰¥ 5) or MET exon 14 mutation, From date of the first enrolment until the date of last documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months
This is a phase II, prospective, two arms, parallel, non comparative study with crizotinib in pretreated NSCLC patients with ROS1 translocation or MET amplification or MET exon 14 mutation (figure 1). Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, pretreated with at least one previous chemotherapy line and with at least one measurable tumor lesion will be considered eligible for the trial. All potentially eligible patients will be evaluated for MET and ROS1 by FISH to detect MET amplification or ROS1 translocation. MET mutation will be assessed using direct sequencing or high sensitive methods. After evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and after signature of informed consent form, all MET amplified or MET exon 14 mutation or ROS1 translocated eligible patients will receive crizotinib 250 mg BID p.o until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
