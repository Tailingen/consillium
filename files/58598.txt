Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Hematological Malignancies After Allo-HSCT
This study investigates the infusion safety and potential curative properties of ex-vivo expanded γδ T cells obtained from the same donor for patients who have hematological malignancies and have accepted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded γδ T cell in patients with hematological malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. γδ T cell will be separated from peripheral blood of the same donors. After expansion in vitro, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.
