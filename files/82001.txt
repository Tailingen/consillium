Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan in Chinese Patients With Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer Who Received at Least Two Prior Treatments
The goal of this study is to learn more about the effectiveness of the study drug, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, in Chinese participants with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who received at least 2 systemic chemotherapy regimens.
Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy
Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1) By Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 3 years
Duration of Response (DOR) by IRC, DOR is defined as the time between the date until the earlier date of disease progression or death., Up to 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) of at least 6 months., Up to 3 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time since the first dose of trial treatment until the earlier date of disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time since the first dose of trial treatment until death due to any cause., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, First dose date up to 3 years plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) According to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, First dose date up to 3 years plus 30 days|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy and Free SN-38, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug., Up to 3 years|Percentage of Participants Who Developed Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) Against Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy, Up to 3 years
This is a Phase IIb, single arm, multicenter study of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC patients who are refractory or relapsing after at least 2 prior standard chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and these regimens will qualify regardless of triple-negative status at the time they were given. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1) by Independent Review Committee (IRC) in all treated patients.

Participants will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and progression will be assessed using RECIST v 1.1 and assessment by Investigator at the trial center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis of response will also be performed by IRC, but this will not be used to make treatment decisions. All participants will visit the Investigator at regular intervals for assessment of safety parameters and adverse events.
