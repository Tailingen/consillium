A Study of Safety, Tolerability, and Pk of rhMBL in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Pts With Fever and Neutropenia
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the dose of EZN-2232 that can be given to MBL deficient pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of the study drug will also be studied.

Determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous rhMBL administered at dosages of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg to MBL deficient pediatric hematology/oncology patients during episodes of fever and neutropenia., 1 month
Determine the PK profile of intravenous rhMBL as a single dose escalation cohort design in MBL deficient pediatric oncology patients during episodes of fever and neutropenia., 1 month
MBL deficient patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive a single dose of either 0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg of intravenous rhMBL. A total of 24 patients will be treated in each of the rhMBL arms, (12 in the 0.5 mg/kg and 12 in the 1.0 mg/kg. All patients are to receive anti-infectious prophylactic supportive therapy as per institutional standards
