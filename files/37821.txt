A Study for the Treatment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer With HRS-1167 Tablets Combined With Abiraterone Acetate Tablets and Prednisone
The purpose of this study was to observe and evaluate the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of HRS-1167 combined with abiraterone acetate tablets (II) and prednisone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, determine the RP2D, and evaluate the effectiveness.
