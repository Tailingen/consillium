Clinical Study on the Second-line and Above Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor With Anlotinib Combined With Pd-1 Antibody
The main objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with pd-1 antibody second-line and above in the treatment of advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: pd-1 antibody
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 2 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., up to 1 year|Overall survival(OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 2 year
To observe the beneficial population and adverse reactions of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with pd-1 in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor, and to explore the safe and effective drug treatment dose in the combined program, so that more patients with advanced tumor with poor prognosis can benefit from the combined program
