Phase III, Open-label Study of First-line Osimertinib With or Without Datopotamab Deruxtecan for EGFRm Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of osimertinib (tablet) in combination with Datopotamab Deruxtecan (i.v. infusion) compared with osimertinib (tablet) monotherapy as a first-line therapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm (Ex19del and/or L858R) NSCLC.

Study details include:

1. The study duration will be event-driven, with an estimated duration of approximately 9 years.
2. Participants may receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other specific discontinuation criteria are met.
3. The visit frequency will be every 3 weeks during the treatment period.

Note: Participants on osimertinib treatment (osimertinib only arm or who have discontinued Datopotamab Deruxtecan while are still receiving osimertinib) are required to attend visits to perform assessments every 6 weeks from Cycle 7 until Cycle 17 and then visits every 12 weeks until disease progression, IP discontinuation or primary PFS DCO. Participants who are receiving osimertinib + Datopotamab Deruxtecan are still required to attend visit to perform assessment every 3 weeks (q3w) per SoA.
