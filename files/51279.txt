Research on the Combined-Modality Treatment Model of Bladder Preservation in Muscular Invasive Bladder Cancer
This research aims to explore the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in muscular invasive bladder cancer of T2-4aN0M0, and the survival effect of combined-modality treatment model，then to clarify the probability of bladder preservation, corresponding cancer specific survival, and the quality of life.
