Combination Study of BMS-754807 and Erbitux® in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The study is expected to identify a safe dose of BMS-754807 to be given in combination with a standard dose of cetuximab and the recommended dose or dose range for Phase II studies. The study is also intended to collect first data on the effects of the combination of BMS-754807 with cetuximab on tumors of patients with colorectal cancer or squamous cell cancer of the head and neck for whom cetuximab-containing therapies have not been effective

DRUG: BMS-754807|DRUG: cetuximab (Erbitux®)
Maximum tolerated dose of BMS-754807 administered orally (daily schedule) in combination with cetuximab administered standard doses IV (weekly basis) will be determined by observation of dose limiting toxicities during the first 33 days of administration, During and at the end of the first 33 days after the first dose of BMS-754807 is given
To assess anti-tumor activity as measured by objective responses, every 8 weeks|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the BMS-754807/cetuximab combination regimen, Ongoing|To assess the effects of the BMS-754807/cetuximab combination regimen on glucose homeostasis, Ongoing|Dose Expansion only: To identify biomarkers that are predictive of a response to BMS-754807/cetuximab combination therapy in advanced or metastatic CRC and SCCHN subjects with cetuximab resistance, tumor biopsies before treatment and on day 33 +/- 3 of treatment
