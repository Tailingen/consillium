Safe Anastomosis Feasibility Study
A clinical trial to assess the efficacy, mechanism of action and safety of the Colovac+ Colorectal Anastomosis Protection Device in providing temporary protection of the anastomosis in subjects undergoing lower anterior resection for colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer|Anastomosis
DEVICE: Colovac
To measure the incidence of serious adverse events related to using the device, The primary endpoint will be a measurement of SAEs probably related or causaly related to the use of the investigational device, to the index surgery in this clinical trial., 3 months
To measure the number of participants with evidence of absence of feces between the sheath and the colonic wall before device retrieval, Rate of patients with evidence of absence of feces between the sheath and the colonic wall before device retrieval at 10 days:, 10 days|To measure the rate of ostomy avoidance, To measure the number of participants where ostomy was avoided, 3 months|To evaluate the occurrence of clinical anastomotic leakage, 3 months|To measure on a scale of 1 to 5 rated by the surgeon the ease of device introduction, positioning and endoscopic retrieval, * Ease of device introduction and positioning will be rated by the surgeon on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being very easy and 5 being impossible)
* Ease of endoscopic retrieval of the device will be rated by the endoscopist on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being very easy and 5 being impossible), 10 days|To evaluate the clinically significant migration rate, 10 days|To evaluate the integrity above the anchoring site during the device retrieval using endoscopy., Mucosal appearance above the anchoring site will be evaluated endoscopically during device retrieval and classified as Normal/Inflamed, Bleeding, Ulcerated, Perforated., 10 days|To evaluate the integrity of the anchoring site during the device retrieval using endoscopy., Mucosal appearance at the anchoring site will be evaluated endoscopically during device retrieval and classified as Normal/Inflamed, Bleeding, Ulcerated, Perforated., 10 days|To evaluate the integrity of the anastomosis before the device retrieval using fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy with injection of contrast between the colonic wall and the sheath will be performed prior to retrieval of the Colovac+ Device in order to check for anastomotic integrity before device retrieval.

Outcome is measured with presence/absence of any contrast liquid leak through the anastomosis prior to device retrieval., 10 days|To evaluate the integrity of the anastomosis after the device retrieval using fluoroscopy, Fluoroscopy with injection of contrast per rectum will be performed immediately after retrieval of the Colovac+ Device in order to check for anastomotic integrity following device retrieval.

Outcome is measured with presence/absence of any contrast liquid leak through the anastomosis after device retrieval., 10 days|To measure the average procedure time, 1 day|To measure the patient tolerability of the device using a patient questionnaire, Responses to a patient questionnaire on device acceptance, on the device handling and comfort, and on preference compared to an ostomy - utilizing the NIH's (National Institute of Health) PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) health measurement questionnaires to assess parameters like pain, bowel incontinence, constipation, diarrhea, or anxiety and social isolation, on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being absence of difficulty and 10 being severe problems)., 10 days
A primary diverting stoma is widely used by surgeons in order to bypass the low rectal anastomosis and reduce morbidity associated with anastomotic leaks. Typically, a stoma is created for all high-risk patients which means that many patients are exposed to potentially serious complications associated with the stoma itself without any clinical benefit.

Colovac+ is a local, temporary, minimally invasive bypass device that provides protection of the anastomosis and safely postpones stoma creation for 10 days after surgery. By postponing stoma creation for 10 days, Colovac is designed to avoid stoma creation in all patients except those patients whose anastomoses have not healed by 10 days after surgery, allowing the others to return to normal activity more quickly and safely.
