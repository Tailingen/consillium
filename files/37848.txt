Treatment by a Bispecific CD3xCD20 Antibody for Relapse/Refractory Lymphomas After CAR T-cells Therapy
This study is a multicenter phase II trial including 2 cohorts of patients in Refractory/Relapse disease at least 1 month after CAR T-cells therapy:

* cohort 1: DLBCL patients
* cohort 2: PMBL, mantle cell lymphoma, transformed indolent NHL (t-iNHL) or iNHL CAR T-cells Refractory/Relapse status will be determined by PET-CT central review allowing inclusion in this trial.

Patients enrolled will then receive a pre-phase of obinutuzumab followed by experimental treatment:11 cycle of glofitamab.

The primary objective of the study is to assess the anti-lymphoma activity of glofitamab, a bispecific CD3xCD20 monoclonal antibody in patients with relapse/refractory DLBCL (cohort 1) disease after anti-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy
