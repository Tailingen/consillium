Phase 1/2a Study of JAB-21822 Plus JAB-3312 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS p.G12C Mutation
This is a multicenter, open-label phase 1/2a study consisting of two parts: dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. The objective of the dose escalation phase is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of JAB-21822 in combination with JAB-3312 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation and to determine the RP2D for the combination therapy. In the dose expansion phase, preliminary efficacy and safety of the combination therapy at the RP2D will be further explored in patients with specific cancer harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation.

recommended phase-2 dose (RP2D)., RP2D should be selected based on a comprehensive assessment of maximum tolerated dose(MTD), toxicity, pharmacokinetic(PK) profile, and efficacy data., Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event (AE) or clinically significant abnormal laboratory value occurring in Cycle 1 (DLT assessment period), which is unrelated to progressive disease, concurrent disease, or concomitant medication but related to JAB-21822 and/or JAB-3312, and meets the criteria for DLT., Approximately 2 years
Number of participants with AEs, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of AEs and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imagings and ophthalmological assessments, Approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response or partial response, Approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Period of time from the start of treatment to tumor progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) based on RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years
