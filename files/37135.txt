Short-term Presurgical Study to Assess Molecular Predictors of Lapatinib's Effects in Primary Breast Cancer
To provide an in vivo measure of the activity of lapatinib. To assess the antiproliferative effects of lapatinib in breast cancer, ie how much lapatinib slows down the growth of cancer cells by measuring K167 (a marker of proliferation) in breast tumours before and after a short treatment with lapatinib.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Lapatinib-Placebo
Changes in Ki67 after short term treatment with lapatinib., Paired core samples taken at baseline and time of main surgery analysed for Ki67, TUNEL, HER2, EGFR, ER, PgR, pAkt,pERK \& stathmin, 11-14 days after treatment
Assess how changes in Ki67 and apoptosis relate to molecular markers at baseline and after 2 weeks. These markers aer HER2, EGFR, p-HER2, p-EGFR, p-ERK1/2, pAKT, ER, PR, IGR-1R, cyclin D1, PTEN and TGF alpha. Further markers may be considered., 10-14 days after treatment
Randomised multi centre double blind pre-surgical study in women with a histological diagnosis of breast cancer by core biopsy.
