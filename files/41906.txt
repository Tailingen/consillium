Neoadjuvant Dual Checkpoint Inhibition and Cryoablation in Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Solid Tumors
The is a phase II, single arm, open-label, multi-site trial studying the combination of cryoablation therapy and dual checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) given at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

Disease response measured with consistent imaging utilizing the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, Patients will undergo consistent imaging prior to every odd cycle of therapy and utilize the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1., 12 months|Incidence and severity of study treatment-related adverse events measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5, Toxicities will be defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5., 12 months
Disease response in rare tumors (non-statistical cohort) measured with consistent imaging utilizing the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1), Patients in the non-statistical cohort will under consistent imaging prior to every odd cycle measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1., 12 months|Biomarkers of response to checkpoint inhibition (number/activity of immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, C-reactive protein) will be measured in peripheral blood by flow cytometry at baseline and throughout study, Peripheral blood will be collected from patients at baseline, following neoadjuvant immunotherapy/prior to cryoablation, and prior to each cycle of immunotherapy., 12 months|Health outcomes as assessed by the PROMISÂ® Pediatric Scale v1.0 Global Health 7+2 scores at baseline, prior to start of each cycle, and last trial visit, Each question will be rated from the following: Excellent (5) to Poor (1), Never (5) to Always (1), or Never (1) to Almost Always (5), 12 months|Health outcomes as assessed by the Parent Proxy Scale v1.0 Global Health 7+2 at baseline, prior to start of each cycle, and last trial visit, Each question will be rated from the following: Excellent (5) to Poor (1), Never (5) to Always (1), or Never (1) to Almost Always (5), 12 months
Patients less than 40 years old with relapsed/refractory solid tumors and at least two sites of measurable disease will receive the current pediatric RP2D of nivolumab and ipilimumab for one cycle and undergo cryoablation therapy of one tumor site. Patients will continue to receive cycles of checkpoint inhibition as long as there is no disease progression of unacceptable toxicity (maximum of 13 cycles \[12 months\]).
