Matched Unrelated Donor Stem Cell Transplantation (MUD-SCT) After Dose-reduced Conditioning for Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Relapse After Autologous SCT
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a reduced intensity conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors is a feasible and effective treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who failed a previous autologous stem cell transplantation.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: allogeneic HSCT
Engraftment, chimerism, toxicity, non-relapse mortality, Follow-up until day +1095
Evaluation of response/GvHD/ infectious complications/ disease-free survival, Prognostic impact of cytogenetic, Evaluation of incidence and prognostic impact of molecular remission in patients with clinically complete remission., Follow-up until day +1095
