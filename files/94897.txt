Nivolumab/Ipilimumab-Primed Immunotransplant for DLBCL
This multi-center study open-label trial will enroll a single cohort of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients whom are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) due to 1) insensitivity to salvage chemotherapy, or 2) inability to tolerate high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy. All patients will receive dual checkpoint blocking antibody (DCBA) therapy with established doses currently being used in phase III trials of ipilimumab (1mg/kg) and nivolumab (3mg/kg) given at three week intervals, two times before, and two times following "immunotransplant" in which T cells (in whole PBMCs) are cryopreserved and re-infused (adoptive T cell transfer or ATCT) following lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen, currently being employed in adoptive T cell therapies.
Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs recorded and graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. for Phase 1B part of study, 3 months|Completion Remission (CR) Rate, The proportion of patients who have achieved complete remission as per Lugano criteria which is complete metabolic response even with a persistent mass., 3 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier where PFS is defined as the time from Adoptive T cell transfer (ATCT) until the first recurrence or progression of disease as per Lugano criteria (3), or date of death if the subject dies from any cause before progression is documented., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS from the time of ATCT (D0) until recorded date of death., 2 years|IgVH level, Rate and time to achieving molecular remission as determined by serum analysis for persistent IgVH by PCR, 2 years|Delayed CR, Delayed CR defined as the proportion of patients who achieved CR reported as a percentage of the total number of subjects enrolled for both FA and PP populations., 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as CR+PR+SD (complete remission + partial remission + stable disease, 2 years
First 6 patients will be part of Phase Ib. Phase Ib and Phase II: Will occur sequentially. Phase II will proceed only if toxicity is acceptable as determined in Phase Ib.
