The primary objectives of the study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of ridaforolimus when administered once weekly for 4 weeks (4 week cycle). The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ridaforolimus, to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of ridaforolimus, and to obtain preliminary information on the antineoplastic activity of ridaforolimus.

Protocol Outline: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive ridaforolimus over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once weekly for 8 weeks (two 4-week cycles). If tolerated, a total of at least 2 cycles will be administered (8-week treatment period). Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
