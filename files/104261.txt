Pilot Study: Combined Molecular Breast Imaging/Ultrasound System for Diagnostic Evaluation of MBI-detected Lesions
A combined molecular breast imaging / ultrasound system will enable coregistration of a functional abnormality seen on Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) with the corresponding anatomical abnormality seen on ultrasound.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Molecular Breast Imaging
To evaluate the potential benefits of co-registered MBI and ultrasonic information relative to independent acquisition of each modality., Presence / absence of correlation between lesion seen on ultrasound and lesion seen on MBI., 1 year
A combined molecular breast imaging / ultrasound system will enable coregistration of a functional abnormality seen on Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) with the corresponding anatomical abnormality seen on ultrasound.
