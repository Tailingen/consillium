Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Versus Triweekly Chemotherapy
The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is the standard first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer as recommended by the NCCN Guidelines for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, and is conventionally given via intravenous route every three weeks. The addition of target therapy (bevacizumab) has shown to improve progression free survival but not overall survival. Several trials have also demonstrated a clinically significant survival advantage associated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared to intravenous chemotherapy, and the best outcomes are consistently seen for patients who have no residual disease. This study aims to compare triweekly chemotherapy with bevacizumab versus intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer.

Progression free survival, the time interval from the date of surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy to clinically defined recurrence, disease progression, or the last follow-up
Overall survival, the time interval from the date of surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up
