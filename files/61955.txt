Capecitabine and Radiotherapy in the Adjuvant Treatment of Resistant Breast Cancer
This is a single-arm, prospective, non-randomized, feasibility study evaluating concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy in participants with Resistant Breast Cancer.
Resistant Breast Cancer|Non-metastatic Invasive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Percentage of patients who complete concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy, Up to 6 months
Assess tolerability, Patient reported health-related quality of life outcomes via RAND 36-Item Health Survey HRQOL outcomes via RAND 36-Item Health Survey, Up to 6 months|Characterize radiation dermatitis secondary to concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy, Through patient-reported RISR scores, Up to 7 months|Frequency of grade 3-4 adverse events, Events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology, Up to 7 months|Completion of study study assessments, Median number of study assessments completed, Up to 7 months|Completion of exploratory assessments, Median number of exploratory assessment completed, Up to 7 months
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate the feasibility of a novel concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy regimen by characterizing the percentage of patients who complete concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy as a preliminary study before a larger trial.

Secondary Objectives

* To report the tolerability of concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy with patient-reported HRQOL outcomes via RAND 36-Item Health Survey.
* To characterize radiation dermatitis secondary to concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy through patient-reported RISR scores and to compare concurrent RISR scores to published reports of patients undergoing breast cancer radiotherapy only.
* To provide a preliminary description of the toxicity profile of concurrent capecitabine radiotherapy and report the frequency of grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity during combined therapy.
* To report the feasibility of completion of all study assessments, and completion of all study and exploratory assessments.

Outline:

This trial will investigate chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 BID every other week during radiotherapy.
