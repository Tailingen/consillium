Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease (cGvHD) Prophylaxis With or Without ATG Prior to Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) From HLA-identical Siblings in Patients With Acute Leukemia
This multicenter, prospective phase III-study is to compare the administration of ATG FRESENIUS to the NON-administration of ATG FRESENIUS in a myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling in patients with acute Leukemia. This clinical trial is to show that the administration of ATG FRESENIUS reduces the risk of chronic Graft-versus-Host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical siblings.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: ATG FRESENIUS (Anti-Lymphocyte-Globulin)|DRUG: ATG FRESENIUS (Anti-Lymphocyte-Globulin)
comparison of cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD (limited or extensive) after allogeneic SCT from HLA-identical siblings with or without anti-T-lymphocyte-globulin at 2 years after transplantation, 2 years after transplantation
comparison of: acute GvHD/quality of life/treatment-related mortality/toxicity/ overall survival/progression-free survival/engraftment/chronic-GvHD-free survival, 2 years after transplantation|incidence of infection/ AEs and ADRs, 2 years after transplantation
