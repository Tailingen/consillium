A Clinical Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of HLX04 and Bevacizumab Combined XELOX or mFOLFOX6 in the First-line Treatment of mCRC
This trial is conducted in patients with the recurrent lesion(s) post-surgery or the untreated mCRC. After stratification with respect to ECOG PS score, chemo regimen, primary tumor location and KRAS and BRAF genotype (complete wild-type/primal type), eligible patients are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive HLX04 (Arm A) or Bevacizumab (Arm B) in combination with one of the protocol-defined chemotherapies, modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or XELOX for mCRC until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or achieving an operable contingency, whichever occurs first.
