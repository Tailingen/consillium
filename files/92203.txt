Effects of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonism on Hyperandrogenemia in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
A prospective, interventional, open-label, single-arm, proof-of-concept study: 18 women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) will be treated with 100 mg of Anakinra/Kineret® for 4 weeks. 1 week after last injection patients will have a follow-up and a dexamethasone visit after a dexamethasone suppression test. Goal of this study is to investigate the effect of the Interleukin 1( IL-1) receptor antagonist Anakinra/Kineret® on laboratory and clinical features in women with PCOS.
