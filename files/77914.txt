A Study of an Infectivity Enhanced Suicide Gene Expressing Adenovirus for Ovarian Cancer in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian and Other Selected Gynecologic Cancers
In spite of surgical and chemotherapeutic advances, long term survival for advanced and recurrent gynecologic cancers remains dismal and no curative treatment for recurrent disease exists. Novel treatment strategies are needed. This is a study to determine the maximally tolerated dose of and toxicities associated with intraperitoneal delivery of an infectivity enhanced adenovirus that expresses a suicide gene and an gene that allows imaging of gene transfer. This vector will be given in combination with intravenous ganciclovir in patients with recurrent ovarian and other gynecological cancers.
