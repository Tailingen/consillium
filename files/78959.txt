MR Characterisation/Localisation of Breast Cancer
Objective: To determine the accuracy of multi-functional magnetic resonance (MR) in detecting, localising and characterising satellite lesions in relation to an index breast tumour in order to improve definition of clinical target volume after local excision.

Hypothesis: Pre-operative multi-functional MR has high sensitivity and specificity for localising unsuspected multifocal and multicentric lesions in women diagnosed with early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
Sensitivity of MR techniques in detecting histopathologically-identified multifocal and multicentric lesions, Sensitivity of the MR technique in detecting histopathologically-identified multifocal/centric pre-invasive/invasive disease will be calculated (with 95% confidence intervals)from positive or negative correlates., 4 years
Closeness of agreement between MR techniques and histopathology in localising satellite lesions relative to the index tumour., Distance \& distribution of lesions from reference tumour will be plotted and correlated with distances and signal characteristics seen on multifunctional MR.

Pre-op MRI volume will be plotted against histopathological dimensions and examined for agreement between the two methods.

Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to test for systematic differences between MRI and pathology measurements., 4 years
