Study of Rogaratinib (BAY1163877) vs Chemotherapy in Patients With FGFR (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor)-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) compared to chemotherapy in patients with FGFR-positive locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have received prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of rogaratinib over chemotherapy in terms of objective response rate (before: overall survivial) of urothelial carcinoma patients with FGFR positive tumors.

At randomization, patients will have locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and have received at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. Only patients with FGFR1 or 3 positive tumors can be randomized into the study. Archival tumor tissue is adequate for testing of FGFR1 and 3 mRNA expressions, which will be determined centrally using an RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) test. Approximately 42 % of UC patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC are identified as FGFR-positive by the RNA-ISH cut-off applied.

DRUG: Rogaratinib (BAY1163877)|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Central Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). participants for whom overall best response is not CR or PR, as well as participants without any post-baseline tumor assessment will be considered non-responders., From start of treatment up to end of active follow-up, approximately 29 months
Disease-control Rate (DCR) - Central Assessment, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants whose overall best response was not a progressive disease (i.e., CR, PR, stable disease \[SD\] or Non CR/Non PD)., From start of treatment till end of active follow-up, approximately 29 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Central Assessment, Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to date of first observed disease progression (radiological or clinical assessment or both) or death due to any cause (if death occurred before progression was documented)., From start of treatment till end of active follow-up, approximately 29 months|Duration of Response (DOR) - Central Assessment, DOR (for patients with PR and CR only) was defined as the time from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was noted earlier, to disease progression (including symptomatic deterioration) or death, whichever was earlier, From start of treatment till end of active follow-up, approximately 29 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent event was defined as any event arising or worsening after the start of study drug administration until 30 days after the last administration of study treatment, From start of treatment up to 30 days after the last administration of study treatment, approximately 29 months
