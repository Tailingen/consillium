Study of Velcade and Temsirolimus for Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The investigators want to find out if the drugs Velcade and temsirolimus given together are effective in treating cancer. Velcade and temsirolimus are each FDA approved individually for certain types of cancer (Velcade for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, and temsirolimus for renal cell carcinoma) but are not currently approved in combination for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The investigators are trying to find out if giving these 2 drugs together will improve the period of time that the patient's cancer is stopped or slowed from growing and causing symptoms.
Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Temsirolimus
Overall Response Rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Velcade in combination with temsirolimus provides benefit to subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) to therapy. ORR is the sum of patients with a Complete Response and Partial Response to therapy. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete REsponse (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 60 months|Progression Free Survival, The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Velcade in combination with temsirolimus provides benefit to subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS)., Up to 60 months
Safety of This Regimen, Safety of the regimen will be measured by frequency and severity of adverse events., Up to 36 months|Complete Response Rate, The complete response rate (CR) to therapy as defined by International Lymphoma Response Criteria., Up to 60 months|Tolerability of the Regimen, Tolerability of the regimen is measured by the number of subjects able to complete the therapy as planned., Up to 36 months|Duration of Response, Duration of Response is how long a response to therapy is held before a subject has progressive disease., Up to 60 months|Overall Survival, Length of time from enrollment until death., Up to 60 months
