All participants enrolled will be treated with systemic chemotherapy post-surgical resection of the tumor. Participants will be assigned to treatment strata based first on tumor molecular group and subgroup assignment \[SHH (including SHH-1, SHH-2, SHH-3, SHH-4 and SHH-NOS), G3, G4, (including NWNS NOS, or indeterminate cases\] and then by clinical risk stratification (age and metastatic state).

Infants and young children on Stratum S-2 and infants on Stratum S-1 will be treated with chemotherapy-only strategies.

* Stratum S-2:

Patients on S-2 will receive 8 courses of chemotherapy consisting of:

* 4 Course A (A1A2A3A4)
* 2 Course B (B1B2)
* 2 Course C (C1C2) Courses repeats every 28 days/4 weeks.
* Stratum S-1:

Patients on S-1 will receive the same systemic chemotherapy regimen as S-2, with the addition of intraventricular (IVT)- MTX, administered via Ommaya reservoir, with each systemic MTX infusion. Each S-1 patient is scheduled to receive 12 doses of IVT-MTX. Each patient on S-1 will also receive 8 courses of combination chemotherapy. (4 Course A with IVT, 2 Course B with IVT and 2 Course C). Courses repeats every 28 days/4 weeks.

* Stratum N:

Stratum N participants will be treated with post-surgery chemotherapy until 36-months-of age followed by radiation CSI with Boost. There is no defined maximum number of systemic chemotherapy courses in stratum N. The length of chemotherapy (number of courses) will depend on the patient's age at enrollment. The chemotherapy plan for stratum N is divided into 5 sub-cohorts:

* Age ≥34 months and \< 36 months: 4 cycles - 2 cycles (A1A2) prior to radiation and 2 cycles (E1, E2) post-radiation
* Age: ≥32 to \<34 months-old: 4 cycles (A1A2A3A4)
* Age: ≥30 to \<32 months-old: 6 cycles (A1A2A3A4B1B2)
* Age: ≥28 to \<30-months-old: 8 cycles (A1A2A3A4B1B2C1C2)
* Age: \< 28 months-old: 8 cycles + multiple cycles of Course D until 36 months old (A1A2A3A4 B1B2 C1C2D1D2D3D4...)

Courses A, B, C and E repeats every 28 days/4 weeks and Course D repeats every 42 days.

Prior to radiation therapy, around when stratum N patients achieve 36 months of age, they will be re-stratified onto substratum N-1, N-2 or N-3 based on their response to chemotherapy.

Patients who receive less than or equal to 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy prior to CSI regardless of their substratum assignment (N-1, N-2 or N-3) will have their radiation therapy augmented by IV carboplatin. Carboplatin will be given to each of these patients 1-4 hours before each radiation fraction is delivered.

Patients enrolled in stratum N who have received only 2 courses of pre-radiation chemotherapy will receive 2 additional courses of adjuvant chemotherapy after completing CSI . The adjuvant chemotherapy consists of Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Vincristine. The patients receiving 4 or more courses of chemotherapy prior to radiation will not receive additional adjuvant chemotherapy after completing CSI.

Patients will be followed for 84 months following enrollment.
