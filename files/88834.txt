[18F]HX4 PET/CT Imaging for Detection of Hypoxia
The aim of this study is to investigate the radiotracer \[18F\]HX4 for non-invasive detection of hypoxia in patients with head and neck, or lung cancer. Each participant will undergo a diagnostic \[18F\]HX4 PET/CT scan before beginning radiotherapy treatment. Patient follow up data will be collected from routine appointments, and analysed with the hypoxia scan results to assess whether \[18F\]HX4 PET/CT scanning can predict patient outcome from radiotherapy treatment.
