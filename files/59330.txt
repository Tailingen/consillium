LYMPHA Procedure for the Prevention of Lymphedema After Axillary Lymphadenectomy
Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and debilitating condition that occurs with disruption or obstruction of the lymphatic system, which commonly occurs a result of breast cancer therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a low risk lymphatic reconstruction procedure at the time of axillary lymph node dissection will reduce the risk of developing lymphedema. Additionally, to determine if this procedure improves objective outcomes of lymphedema and patient quality of life

PROCEDURE: axillary lymphadenectomy with immediate lymphatic reconstruction (LYMPHA)|PROCEDURE: Axillary lymphadenetomy alone
Lymphatic flow pattern of whole limb, In the early lymphedema stages this exam allows to detect percutaneously the lymphatic vessels of the whole limb, up to about 1 cm in depth from the skin surface, by an infrared camera visualization system after intra-dermal injection of ICG in the hand. The change in the lymphatic pattern and reduction in the ICG velocity will be tested to find a correlation with other used diagnostic parameters like volume change and bioimpedance spectroscopy., 2 yr|Limb Volume, Limb volume as measured by serial assessment, 2 yr|Skin thickness measurements, Skin thickness is changed by lymphedema, 2 yr|Bioiimpedance spectroscopy, Impedance of the skin changes with lymphedema, 2 yr|Quality of life, Questionnaire to determine patient reported quality of life. Measured by limb-lymphedema-specific quality of life (LYMQOL) tool. The LYMQOL is divided into four domains: Function, Appearance, Symptoms, and Mood, as well as yielding an overall quality-of-life score, 2 yr
