The Combination of Immunotherapy and Neoadjuvant Short-course Radiotherapy in Early Rectal Cancer
The study evaluates the combination of immunotherapy of PD-1 antibody and neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy in early low rectal cancer. A total of 34 patients will receive 5\*5Gy short-course radiotherapy, followed by 4 cycles of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) chemotherapy and PD-1 antibody, finally receive the local excision(TEM) or total mesorectal excision (TME). The rate of complete response (cCR+pCR), Organ retention rate, long-term prognosis, and adverse effects will be analyzed.

complete response (CR) rate, Rate of complete response (CR), including the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) after surgery and the rate of cCR with W\&W strategy., The status of cCR will be evaluated after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The pCR rate will be evaluated after surgery. The cCR patients who adopted W&W strategy will be included into the CR rate caluculation.
Organ preservation rate, Rate of patients who underwent organ preservation via WW or TEM after neoadjuvant therapy, from date of receiving neoadjuvant therapy, assessed up to 2 years|Grade 3-4 adverse effects rate, Rate of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy related adverse events, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|3 year disease free survival rate, Rate of 3 year disease free survival, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.|3 year local recurrence free survival rate, Rate of 3 year local recurrence free survival, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented pelvic failure, assessed up to 36 months.|3 year overall survival rate, Rate of 3 year overall survival, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.|10 year Quality of Life, Quality of life will be evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CR29, LARS score and Wexner score., From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 10 years
