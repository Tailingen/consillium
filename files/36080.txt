p53 Gene in Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The study objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of p53 combined with chemotherapy (cisplatin and paclitaxel) in treatment of recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer.
Ovarian Epithelial Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: p53 gene|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
response rate, Objective response rate using RECIST version 1.1 guidance, from starting study treatment to 6 months|progress-free survival, measure the time to progression/death, or to the last tumor assessment, from starting treatment to 2 years after
overall survival, measure the time to death, or time last known alive, from starting study treatment to 2 years after|Karnofsky Performance Status score（KPS）, from starting study treatment to 2 years after|safety as measured by adverse events, vital signs, clinical lab tests, ECG and physical examination, from starting study treatment to 30 days after the last study treatment
The study objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of p53 combined with chemotherapy (cisplatin and paclitaxel) in treatment of recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer.

study design: open-labeled, active controlled, randomized, phase 2 treatments: experiment group will consist of intraperitoneal p53 (2 x 10\^12 viral particles) plus cisplatin 150 mg/m\^2, and Paclitaxel 175 mg/m\^2 IV over 3 h on day 1; every 21 d for 6 cycles.

study end points: response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and Karnofsky score（KPS).
