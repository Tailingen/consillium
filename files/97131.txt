Bortezomib and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors or Melanoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving temozolomide together with bortezomib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: To determine the best dose of bortezomib and temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced refractory solid tumors or melanoma.

Optimal Doses of Temozolomide and Bortezomib (Phase I), The optimal biologic dose (OBD) defined as the dose that achieves the greatest degree of inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells when co-administered with Temozolomide, up to 42 days|Number of Patients With Clinical Anti-tumor Activity Phase II), Per RECIST criteria v. 1.0: measurable lesions: complete response (CR) disappearance of target lesions, partial response (PR) \> 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) \> 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions, stable disease (SD) neither sufficient decrease nor increase of the sum of smallest sum of the LD of target lesions. Patients with CR + PR + SD, every 9 weeks to a maximum of 54 weeks
Patients With Inhibition in NF-kB Activation (Phase I), Patient with a minimum of 50% reduction from baseline on day 8 or day 29 in NF-kB, measured by picograms/milliliter in peripheral mononuclear blood cells, at baseline, on day 8 and on day 29|Patients With Clinical Anti-tumor Activity (Phase I), Per RECIST criteria v. 1.0: measurable lesions: complete response (CR) disappearance of target lesions, partial response (PR) \> 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) \> 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions, stable disease (SD) neither sufficient decrease nor increase of the sum of smallest sum of the LD of target lesions, every 9 weeks up to a maximum of 54 weeks|Patients With Inhibition of NF-kB (Phase II), Patient with a minimum of 50% reduction from baseline on day 8 or day 29 in NF-kB, measured by picograms/milliliter in peripheral mononuclear blood cells, at baseline, on day 8 and on day 29
