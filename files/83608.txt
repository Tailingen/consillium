Phase 2 Study of JX-594 in Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis of Ovarian Cancer Origin
This is a single-arm open-label Phase 2 study in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of ovarian origin that are not eligible for curative treatments. Patients will receive 5 weekly IV infusions of JX-594 until radiographically determined progressive disease. Patients will be allotted in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a laparoscopy and tumor biopsy 10 days after dose 1 or 10 days after Dose 5. Patients will be monitored on study until evidence of progression or death or for 12 months post treatment.
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: JX-594
Radiographic response of ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis to JX-594 treatment, Determine radiographic response rate (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors \[modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1\])to JX-595, 6 weeks
Assessment of Adverse Events related to JX-594 administered by repetitive IV infusion, Collection of incidence(s) of treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated and stratified by severity and relationship to JX-594 administration, Weekly|Response rate using modified immune criteria, Determine response rate using modified immune criteria in ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis, 6 weeks|Delivery of JX-594 in solid tumours, Determine the delivery of JX-594 to solid tumors after repetitive IV infusion in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, Weekly|JX-594 Secondary Replication in blood over time, Determine the pharmacokinetics of JX-594 by examining secondary replication of viral genomes in blood over time., Weekly|Immune response to JX-594, Determine the immune response to JX-594 by change in peripheral white blood cell counts over time, 6 weeks|Response of tumour markers to JX-594, Determine serum tumor marker response rate, Weekly|Time to progressive disease, Determine time to progression of disease after JX-594 administration, 6 weeks
This is a single-arm open-label Phase 2 study in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of ovarian origin that are not eligible for curative treatments. Patients will receive 5 weekly IV infusions of JX-594 and will continue to receive IV infusion of JX-594 every 3 weeks until radiographically determined progressive disease. Using a 2 stage trial design, if 2 or more of the first 15 patients show a clinical response as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.10 criteria (or if 3 of the 15 have stable disease as defined by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or clinically), the arm will be expanded to a total of 25 patients (Stage 2).

In Stage 1, patients will be allotted in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a laparoscopy and tumor biopsy 10 days after dose 1 or 10 days after Dose 5. A decision as to whether laparoscopy will be performed in Stage 2 will be reached at the conclusion of Stage 1.

Patients will be monitored on study until evidence of progression or death or for 12 months post treatment
