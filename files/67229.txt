Descriptive Analysis of Real-world Data Collected with ME&MGopen
The ME\&MGopen smartphone application is an investigational software for research purposes only, developed by Ad Scientiam. It features digital tests to assess the respiratory capacity ("My Breathing" Test), dysarthria ("My Voice" Test), ptosis ("My eyelids" test), as well as upper and lower limb muscle function ("My arms" Test and "My legs" Test). The mobile app also includes e-questionnaires related to activities of daily living, pain, insomnia, quality of life and depression. The objectives of the study are to collect data on patients' symptoms with the application in a real life setting, to assess adherence to the use of the tool, user experience and satisfaction with the application, and safety of use.

To evaluate the reliability of the digital tests performed at home in real-life, The intraclass correlation coefficient mean k raters (ICCk; k=month) will be used to assess the monthly reliability at home of digital tests from the beginning to the end of participation :

At-home MET At-home MBT At-home MVT At-home MAT At-home MLT, Baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3, Month 4, month 5, month 6, month 7, month 8, month 9, month 10, month 11, month 12|To assess adherence to the mobile application, Descriptive analysis of the mobile application's adherence data (number of completed questionnaires, carried tests, number of sessions performed etc.), through study completion, 30 months|To assess the satisfaction and user experience with the smartphone application, Descriptive analysis (counts/percentages) of the answers to the user experience and satisfaction questionnaires related to the use of the ME\&MGopen smartphone application, through study completion, 30 months|To assess user behavior, Description of user behavior (counts/percentages), through study completion, 30 months|To assess safety of use of the smartphone application, Descriptive analysis of adverse events (AEs) related and unrelated to the use of the application. Adverse event data will be reported in a table and expressed as number and percentage, differentiating mild, moderate and severe AEs., through study completion, 30 months|To evaluate the effect of different frequencies of assessments of the digitals tests on the onset of learning effect, p-value, through study completion, 30 months|To analyze correlations between digital tests, e-questionnaires, socio demographic data, treatments, Matrix correlation to estimate Pearson's correlation coefficient for each pair of relevant variables., through study completion, 30 months|To evaluate the ability of the Health Belief Model to predict user behavior towards the smartphone application, coefficient of correlation between dimensions of the Health Belief Model and device use, through study completion, 30 months|To identify if socio-demographic data, treatment status, severity, satisfaction and user experience could influence the results to the digital tests and questionnaires, p-value from multiple regression, through study completion, 30 months|To identify if socio-demographic data, treatment status, severity, satisfaction and user experience could influence the reliability of the digital tests, p-value from multiple regression, through study completion, 30 months|To identify if depression , activities of daily living and satisfaction could influence the adherence to the smartphone application, p-value from multiple regression, through study completion, 30 months|To identify if socio-demographic data or treatment status could influence satisfaction with the smartphone application, p-value from multiple regression, through study completion, 30 months|To explore the existing association between the ME&MG tests scores obtained at home and the results labeled by a trained evaluator, coefficient of correlation, through study completion, 30 months

The objectives of the study are to collect data on patients' symptoms with the application in a real life setting, to assess adherence to the use of the tool, user experience and satisfaction with the application, and safety of use.

Analyses will also be performed to identify factors that may influence these parameters and provide levers for understanding and improvement. The existence of a possible learning effect on active testing will also be explored as a data point of interest.

The results will allow researchers to extend their knowledge of gMG from real-life data and of the use of digital tools in a gMG patient population
