Phase II Study of Fractionated 90Y Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (Zevalin) Radioimmunotherapy as an Initial Therapy of Follicular Lymphoma
90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan (zevalin) has demonstrated consistently high response rates in patients who have received previous treatment for lymphoma. More than two-thirds of the patients who achieve CR go on to experience durable remissions lasting for years. Despite these highly promising clinical results with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in relapsed follicular lymphoma there is very little data using RIT in previously untreated follicular lymphoma. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two fractions of Zevalin in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma in a Phase II study.
