An Efficacy and Safety Study of ARGX-113 in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Who Have Generalized Muscle Weakness
A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, quality of life and impact on normal daily activities of ARGX-113 in patients with gMG.
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
BIOLOGICAL: ARGX-113|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Percentage of MG-ADL Responders During Cycle 1 (C1); Analyzed in the AChR-Ab Seropositive Population, The MG-ADL is an 8-item patient-reported scale to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. The scale comprises 2 items on daily life activities and 6 items on symptoms. The MG-ADL total score range is 0-24, with higher scores indicative of greater disease severity. A patient was considered an MG-ADL responder during C1 if there was a reduction of ≥2 points on the MG-ADL total score (compared to baseline of C1 \[C1B\]) for ≥4 consecutive weeks with the first reduction occurring no later than 1 week after the last infusion of IMP in C1., Baseline up to Day 63 (end of TC1)
Percentage of Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Responders During C1; Analyzed in the AChR-Ab Seropositive Population, The QMG scale quantifies disease severity based on impairments of body functions and structures as defined by the International Classification of Disability and Health. The QMG scale consists of 13 items that measure endurance or fatigability, and accounts for fluctuations in disease state. The QMG total score range is 0-39, with higher scores indicative of greater disease severity. A patient was considered a QMG responder during C1 if there was a reduction of ≥3-points on the QMG total score (compared to C1B) for ≥4 consecutive weeks with the first reduction occurring no later than 1 week after the last infusion of IMP in C1., Baseline up to Day 63 (end of TC1)|Percentage of MG-ADL Responders During C1; Analyzed in the Overall Population, The percentage of MG-ADL responders during C1 in the overall population is reported for this secondary end point; percentage of MG-ADL responders during C1 in the AChR-Ab seropositive population is reported previously as a primary end point., Baseline up to Day 63 (end of TC1)|Percentage of Time That Patients Had a Clinically Meaningful Improvement (CMI) in MG-ADL Total Score up to and Including Day 126; Analyzed in the AChR-Ab Seropositive Population, An MG-ADL CMI was defined as a reduction of ≥2 points on the total MG-ADL score compared to study entry baseline (SEB)., Baseline up to Day 126|Time From Week 4 to Qualify for Retreatment; Analyzed in the AChR-Ab Seropositive Population, Time to qualify for retreatment was defined as time from the Week 4 assessment until the first visit with a \<2-point reduction compared to SEB in the MG-ADL total score and MG-ADL total score ≥5 points with \>50% of the total score attributable to nonocular symptoms., Week 4 up to Day 182 (end of study [EoS])|Percentage of Early MG-ADL Responders During C1; Analyzed in the AChR-Ab Seropositive Population, A patient was considered an early MG-ADL responder during C1 if there was a reduction of ≥2 points on the MG-ADL total score (compared to C1B) for ≥4 consecutive weeks with the first reduction occurring no later than Week 2 (ie, after 1 or maximum 2 infusions of IMP in C1)., Baseline up to Day 63 (end of TC1)
