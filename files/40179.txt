A Phase I/II Study of XELOXIRI and Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The phase I/II study was designed to evaluate if the regimen of Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine (XELOXIRI) and Bevacizumab is a superior first-line option for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) in terms of safety and efficacy.

dose-limited toxicity (DLT), dose limited toxicities are evaluated in the phase I study according to CTCAE v5.0 and reviewed through the phase I study completion, up to 1 year|maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is determined according to the DLT in the phase I study, up to 1 year|recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D is determined according to DLT and MTD in the phase 1 study, up to 1 year|objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response or partial response, up to 2 years
Adverse events (AEs), Adverse events assessments are computed and categorized according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute, version 5.0, though study completion, an average of 2 years|progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest evidence of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1), or death from any cause, though study completion, an average of 2 years|overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomized to death from any cause or to last contact, up to 5 years|disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response, partial response or having stable disease, up to 2 years|duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the length from the first response occured to disease progression, though study completion, an average of 2 years|time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the length from randomization to the first response occured., up to 2 years|the surgical resection rate of patients with liver-only metastases, the percentage of patients with liver-only metastases undergoing surgical resections during the trial therapy, up to 2 years
Recent studies have shown that the triplet-drug regimen FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan/oxaliplatin/fluorouracil) can further improves survival benefit for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) compared to standard two-drug regimens in first-line therapy, especially when combined with bevacizumab. However, the increased toxicities of FOLFOXIRI limited its usage. Capecitabine demonstrates a superior efficacy and safety than fluorouracil, so we designed this trial to evaluate if the XELOXIRI plus bevacizumab can be a better alternative to FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab. The phase I study is to determine the safety and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of XELOXIRI plus Bevacizumab. In the phase II study, we aim to determine the efficacy of the regimen as first-line therapy for mCRC and explore potential molecular biomarkers (genomes, circulating tumor cell) for toxicity forecasting or efficacy monitoring.
