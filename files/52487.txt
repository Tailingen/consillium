Alpha Radiation Emitters Device for the Treatment of Cutaneous, Mucosal or Superficial Soft Tissue Neoplasia (DaRT)
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for superficial cutaneous, mucosal or soft tissue neoplasia
Skin Cancer|Mucosal Neoplasm of Oral Cavity|Soft Tissue Neoplasm
DEVICE: Radiation: Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters Therapy (DaRT)
Tumor response to DaRT, Assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1), 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion|Adverse Events, The incidence, frequency, severity and causality of acute adverse events related to the DaRT treatment according to Common Terminology and Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 24 Months
Reduction in tumor volume, based on imaging, 9-11 weeks post DaRT insertion|DaRT seeds placement, Assessment by localization of the DaRT seeds in the tumor using CT imaging on the day of DaRT insertion, Day of insertion procedure|Change in quality of life, Assessment of patient reported health-related Quality of Life outcome after DaRT, using QoL questionnaire Skindex-16 questionnaire score, Day 15, Day 30, Day 70, Day 180 post DaRT insertion|Change in quality of life, Assessment of patient reported health-related Quality of Life outcome after DaRT, using QoL questionnaire Skin Cancer Index (SCI) questionnaire score, Day 30, Day 70, Day 180 post DaRT insertion|Adverse Events, All Adverse Events (AE) related and unrelated to the study treatment, Up to 24 Months|Progression Free Survival, Time elapsed from response to disease progression, 24 months post DaRT insertion
This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients.

Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using DaRT seeds.

Reduction in tumor size 70 days after DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by the incidence, severity and frequency of all Adverse Events (AE).
