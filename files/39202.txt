A Study of PD5K3 in Healthy Adult Volunteers
The main aim of this clinical trial is to assess the safety of PD5K3 in patients aged 18 to 65 years. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is PD5K3 safe in adult? Researchers will compare PD5K3 to an active comparator pegaspargase to see if PD5K3 is safe and active in human.

Participants will

* Receive a single dose injection of PD5K3, pegaspargase or placebo according to weight,
* Visit the clinic for assessment.
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: PD5K3|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Pegaspargase
Treatment-related Adverse Events, To evaluate the adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity as graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy after administration., up to 49 days
The Area Under the Curve from dosing to the time of the last measured concentration (AUC0-t), Pharmacokinetic parameter, up to 49 days|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic parameter, up to 49 days|The half-life (t1/2), Pharmacokinetic parameter, up to 49 days|Compare the plasma asparaginase activity between the PD5K3 and pegaspargase groups, Plasma asparaginase activities are determined by a validated enzymatic spectrophotometric assay, and the results are reported in IU/mL. In the assay, asparaginase hydrolyzes asparagine to generate aspartic acid, which can be detected colorimetrically using a coupled enzymatic reaction., up to 49 days|Compare the plasma asparagine concentration between the PD5K3 and pegaspargase groups, Plasma asparagine concentration as a pharmacodynamic parameter, up to 49 days
This study is a first-in-human study, which is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation, clinical study, aiming to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of PD5K3 in healthy adult volunteers, compared with pegaspargase at the same dose.
