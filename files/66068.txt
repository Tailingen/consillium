Comparative Study of Mitomycin and Lobaplatin in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients With Radical Surgery Combined With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
This study is a prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial conducted by Wuhan Union Hospital and aim to compare the therapeutic effects of Mitomycin and Lobaplatin in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer patients with radical surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
Colorectal Cancer|Chemotherapy Effect|Surgery|Metastasis|Survival
DRUG: Mitomycin|DRUG: Lobaplatin
peritoneal metastasis, peritoneal metastasis-free survival (pRFS), 3-year|overall survival, overall survival (OS), 3-year
Number of participants with immunosuppression events as assessed by blood immunological indicators, Before and After Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, collect 5mL blood samples of patients for detecting immunological indicators such as CD3, CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte population; Interferon-γ; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; interleukin-2, 4, 8, 10, etc, up to 4 weeks|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, postoperative adverse events (referring to CTCAE 5.0 \[including blood routine, liver and kidney function, patient reaction to HIPEC, adverse events\]) was analyzed, up to 4 weeks|The positive rate of cancer cells of participants by exfoliative cytology examination, According to the positive rate of cancer cells measured in exfoliative cytology before and after HIPEC, the difference between the groups is analyzed., 1 week
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is traditionally used to treat peritoneal cancer combined with cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Further, there have been more than 20 years for CRS + HIPEC applying in treatment of patients with colorectal cancer peritoneal metastasis. While, to date, the kinds, doses, combinations of HIPEC drugs are not clearly been evaluate a criterion for local advanced colorectal cancer patients. Thus, This study aim to compare the efficacy of Mitomycin and Lobaplatin in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer patients with radical surgery combined with HIPEC. We plan to recruit 201 patients and divide into 3 groups, 2 drug groups and 1 control group, radomly. all patients with advanced co cancer receive radical surgery + HIPEC + mFOLFOX6/XELOX chemotherapy regimen. the mainly experimental variable is HIPEC drugs and three groups employ Mitomycin, Lobaplatin and none respectively. the endpoints of study include peritoneal metastasis, overall survival, immune status and perioperative safety assessment.
