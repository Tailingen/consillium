Evaluation of Lucanthone to Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy of lucanthone administered as an adjunct to patients receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) as primary treatment for brain metastases secondary to non-small cell lung cancer.
Brain Metastases|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Lucanthone|OTHER: Placebo
Determine the efficacy of lucanthone when given during WBRT, Progression free survival at 6 months and one year, overall response rate at months 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 months and overall survival at 13 months will be evaluated. MRI brain scans will be performed baseline and months 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. Objective assessments of overall response will be based on tumor assessments from MRI scans interpreted using the Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria., 2 weeks to 13 months
Evaluate the safety and toxicity of lucanthone when used in combination with standard doses of WBRT in the primary treatment of brain metastases secondary to non-small cell lung cancer, Safety will be monitored throughout the study by physical exams, review of adverse events, and laboratory studies., 2 weeks to 13 months
Eligible patients for this trial will be randomized to lucanthone or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. The treatment will consist of WBRT given in a dose of 30 Gy in ten fractions. Lucanthone/placebo will be given as an adjunct to the WBRT on days that WBRT is administered. Tumor assessments will be done with a brain MRI. Radiological assessments on the tumor will be made periodically throughout the study and will be discontinued at the time of tumor progression. Safety will be evaluated for one year during the study period and survival data will be collected thereafter.
