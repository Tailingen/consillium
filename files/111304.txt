A Study of Valemetostat in Combination With Atezolizumab in People With Lung Cancer
This study will test whether valemetostat in combination with atezolizumab is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects in people with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The researchers will test different doses of valemetostat to find the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects in participants. After the dose is found, researchers will test it in a new group of participants to learn more about the safety of the study treatment and see if it is an effective treatment for extensive-stage SCLC.
