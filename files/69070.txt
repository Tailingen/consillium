Expanded Access to Trilaciclib for Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this expanded access protocol is to provide access to trilaciclib for chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients receiving chemotherapy as a treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Patients will receive trilaciclib intravenously as a 30-minute infusion prior to chemotherapy dosing and on each day that chemotherapy is administered.

Supplementary to providing access to trilaciclib, this expanded access program will also capture Real World Data to help inform subsequent trilaciclib development.

Requests for access to trilaciclib will be managed by Bionical Emas. G1 Therapeutics will review eligibility of, as well as complete a medical review of, each patient access request.
