Proteomic Signature in Breast Cancer: Correlation With Tumor Response to Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy
The scope of the trial is to identify proteomic signatures correlated with tumor response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood sampling|PROCEDURE: BIOPSY|PROCEDURE: SURGERY
Proteomic analysis by SELDI-TOF on the tumor biopsy and blood samples Histological response according To Chevallier and Sataloff, 6 months
Correlation with node invasion, 6 months|Correlation with basal, luminal phenotypes, HER2 status or hormonal status, 6 months|Correlation with the response measured by ultrasound after chemotherapy, After 3 and 5 months
The scope of the trial is to identify proteomic signatures correlated with tumor response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
