Screening for Lung Cancer in the HIV Patient
That computed tomography (CT) screening of HIV-seropositive heavy smokers will detect early stage lung cancer at significantly higher rates than what is currently being observed.

DEVICE: CT Scan with Spirometry
Stage distribution of HIV-seropositive patients, To determine differences in stage distribution of HIV-seropositive patients at lung cancer diagnosis between those who are screened by spiral CT and historic controls., Day 1
To create a specimen bank of serum, sputum, and tissue, To create a specimen bank of serum, sputum, and tissue from the cohort of heavy smokers with HIV at high risk for lung cancer identified in Specific Aim 1., 5 years
Epigenetic analysis of sera and sputa, To use epigenetic analysis of sera and sputa collected in Specific Aim 2 from patients screened in Specific Aim 1 as a complementary approach to low dose helical CT in order to discriminate radiologically indeterminate nodules as either molecularly positive or negative., 4 weeks
The study design is that of a prospective cohort study in which 200 smoking participants will be recruited from an existing HIV-seropositive cohort of 800 patients (the Human Oral Papillomavirus Etiology (HOPE) Study). Participants will be enrolled from the Johns Hopkins HIV (Moore) Clinic and the resources of the Johns Hopkins Adult Outpatient General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) and pilot project funding from the Lung Cancer SPORE will be utilized to fund the costs of the CT scans. An interdisciplinary team with expertise in HIV-associated malignancy, CT screening, lung cancer surgery, HIV infection, epidemiology and biostatistics has been assembled to test the hypothesis by accomplishing the following Specific Aims:
