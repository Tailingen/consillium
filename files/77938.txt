Safety, Preliminary Effectiveness of BNT327, an Investigational Therapy for Patients With Small-cell Lung Cancer in Combination With Chemotherapy
This is a Phase II, multi-site, open-label, parallel group study in participants with untreated extended-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) (Cohort 1) or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which has progressed on first- or second-line treatment (Cohort 2 and Cohort 3). This study will assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BNT327.

In Cohort 1 of this study, two dose levels of BNT327 will be studied in combination with etoposide and carboplatin to identify an optimized dose for future clinical investigation.

Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will explore the combination of two dose levels of BNT327 with paclitaxel, or topotecan in the second- or third-line setting.

Patients will be treated until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, patient withdrawal, study termination or up to 2 years (whichever occurs first).

Participants will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2/Cohort 3 based on their disease type (i.e., untreated ES-SCLC for Cohort 1 and SCLC which has progressed on first- or second-line treatment for Cohort 2 and Cohort 3). Assignment to either Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 will be the investigator's choice.

Participants will be randomized to each arm within each cohort:

* Participants enrolled to Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm 1 or Arm 2.
* Participants enrolled to Cohort 2 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm 1 or Arm 2.
