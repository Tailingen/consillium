Pharmacological Ascorbate for Lung Cancer
This clinical trial evaluates adding high-dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to standard of care treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. All subjects will receive high-dose ascorbate in addition to the standard treatment.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Ascorbic Acid
Tumor Response, From cycle 1, day 1, to documented disease progression in CT imaging as described by RECIST criteria, every 2 months for up to 5 years post treatment
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time (in months) it takes for disease to progress as defined by RECIST criteria. Timeframe will be from cycle 1, day 1 to date of progression., every 2 months for up to 5 years post treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Time, measured in months, from cycle 1 day 1 until date of death from any cause, every 2 months for up to 5 years post treatment
Standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves a combined therapy of paclitaxel and carboplatin. These drugs are administered once every 21 days. This study adds high dose ascorbic acid (75g per infusion) twice per week for up to 4 cycles of therapy.

Participants will:

* receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate two times a week during each 3 week chemotherapy.
* have blood samples drawn to measure blood ascorbate levels once every 21 days
* have blood samples drawn to measure iron and ferritin levels before treatment, then on cycles 1 and 3.

The active therapy portion of this study lasts for 4 months. After that is completed, participants will go back to standard therapy for their cancer. Participants will continue to have life-long follow-up for this study.
