Clinical Trial of Patidegib Gel 2%, 4%, and Vehicle Applied Once or Twice Daily to Decrease the GLI1 Biomarker in Sporadic Nodular Basal Cell Carcinomas
This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in comparison with that of vehicle in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma. One investigational center (metasite) in the United States will participate in this study. Approximately 36 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or vehicle gel.
Basal Cell Carcinomas
DRUG: Patidegib|DRUG: Vehicle gel
Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Including Both Serious and Non-Serious) Causally Related to Study Drug, All serious adverse events (SAEs) and all other non-serious adverse events (AEs) regardless of causality are located in the Reported AE Module. The number of AEs (including both serious and non-serious) considered related to study drug by the Investigator are presented below. Treatment-emergent AEs are those with an onset after use of study drug., Baseline through Week 12|Molecular Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in the Hedgehog (HH) Signaling Pathway Target Gene Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog 1 (GLI1) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Levels at Week 12, GLI1 change is a biomarker of the HH signaling pathway. A change in GLI1 mRNA levels reflect a change in the HH pathway. Surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) were defined as clinically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 5 to 20 millimeters (mm) in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. A single baseline BCC designated as a treatment-targeted tumor at Baseline was biopsied first at Baseline and again following 12 weeks of treatment. This was used to assess percent change in GLI1 mRNA levels as follows: (Baseline - Week 12) / Baseline \* 100, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Any missing values were not imputed; all available data is summarized., Baseline, Week 12
Clinical Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size of Treatment-targeted SEBs at Week 12, SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percent change in greatest diameters of treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) from Baseline to Week 12 was calculated as follows: (sum \[Baseline\] - sum \[Week 12\] / sum \[Baseline\] \* 100), where sum = the greatest diameters of treatment-targeted SEBs and positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Missing values were imputed using Last-Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)., Baseline, Week 12|Clinical Efficacy: Percentage of SEBs Showing Complete or Partial Response at Week 12 as Determined by Blinded Photographic Review, SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of tumors showing a complete or partial response at Week 12 was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs showing complete or partial response at Week 12) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) \* 100. Missing values were not imputed.Complete Response is determined when there is no longer any visible evidence of a lesion consistent with BCC at the site, and Partial Response is determined when although a BCC still remains at this site, it has demonstrated a visible decrease in size compared with baseline., Baseline, Week 12
Percentage of Treatment-targeted SEBs Achieving Clear or Almost Clear on the Investigator Static Global Tumor Assessment (ISGTA) Scale, The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear or almost clear at Week x (Week x = 2, 6, 8, 10, or 12) based on the ISGTA scale was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 or 1 at Week x) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) \* 100. Missing data were imputed using LOCF. The percentage of responders achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on the ISGTA scale are presented by Week., Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12|Percent Change in Treatment-targeted SEBs Tumor Size From Baseline as Determined by Blinded Photographic Review, SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percent change in greatest diameters of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs from Baseline to Week 12 was calculated as follows: (sum \[Baseline\] - sum \[Week 12\] / sum \[Baseline\]) \* 100), where sum = the greatest diameters of treatment-targeted SEBs., Baseline, Week 12
This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in comparison with that of vehicle. Approximately 36 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts. As soon as one cohort has been completely enrolled, the next cohort will be enrolled. Each subject will treat no more than two previously untreated biopsy confirmed treatment-targeted nodular BCCs. If the subject has additional non-treatment targeted BCCs they can be treated surgically prior to or during the trial. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or vehicle gel. The sequential cohorts will be:

* Cohort 1: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, once daily
* Cohort 2: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, once daily
* Cohort 3: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, twice daily
* Cohort 4: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, twice daily

The study drug will be applied topically to the treatment-targeted BCCs and a rim of adjacent skin for 12 weeks. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination (PE) will be performed at Baseline and Week 12. The treatment-targeted BCCs will be identified by the Investigator at the Baseline visit and will be circled in ink at Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12 and photographed, and measured at all study visits (Baseline, Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12). Blood samples for complete blood count and serum chemistry and urine for urinalysis will be collected from subjects at Screening, Week 6, and Week 12. Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for BCCs (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.
