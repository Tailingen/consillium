Study on All-Trans Retinoic Acid, Induction and Consolidation Therapy, and Pegfilgrastim After Consolidation Therapy in Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This trial is a study on all-trans retinoic acid in combination with induction and consolidation therapy as well as pegfilgrastim after consolidation therapy in younger patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Idarubicin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: All-trans retinoic acid|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
Complete remission (CR)-rate after induction therapy, after the second induction cycle|Relapse-free survival, one year after consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine considering different temporal sequences (1-3-5 versus 1-2-3) of the consolidation therapy, One year after consolidation therapy|Event-free survival, two years
Kind, incidence, severity, temporal sequence and correlation of side effects of the study-drugs, during therapy|Cumulative incidence of relapse, two years|Cumulative incidence of death, two years|Overall survival, two years|Hematological recovery as well as incidence and duration of infections during neutropenia after each consolidation cycle, during consolidation therapy|Timely sequence of the pegfilgrastim-concentration in correlation to the absolute neutrophil counts after each consolidation cycle, during consolidation therapy|Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity after consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine considering the different consolidation schemes (day 1-3-5 versus day 1-2-3), during consolidation therapy|Days in hospital after each consolidation cycle, after consolidation therapy
