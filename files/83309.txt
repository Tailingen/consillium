Clinical Research on the Effect of Aspirin on the Disease Free Survival Rate of Esophageal Carcinoma
Esophageal cancers are the seventh most common cancer in the world and one of the most common causes of cancer deaths. In some parts of China, the incidence of SCC is among the highest in the world. Despite surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, the prognosis for SCC patients was disappointing. There is therefore an urgent need for new prevention and treatment strategies.

Epidemiological investigations have found that about 25% of human tumors are associated with chronic inflammation caused by a variety of causes, and chronic inflammation activates nuclear transcription factors (nuclear Factor,NF), induces gene and epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, tumor suppressor gene point mutations, and post-translational modification, and participates in the process of tumorigenesis. It has been noted that the long-term regularity of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs aspirin can reduce the incidence and mortality of a variety of tumors, including esophageal cancer.

Aspirin is the earliest, most extensive and common antipyretic analgesics and anti-rheumatism drugs used to play an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the synthesis of PGs. COX-2 is a key enzyme in the synthesis of PGs, so it is speculated that the anti-tumor effect of aspirin inhibits the PGs of COX and its inhibition.
