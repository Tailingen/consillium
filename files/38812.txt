Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of GX-I7 in Patients With Glioblastoma
Patients will be enrolled in two stages:

* Dose-escalation stage: Approximately 12-24 patients will be enrolled.

Detailed Description:

â€¢ Dose-escalation stage : designed as classical 3+3 to determine MTD(Maximum tolerable dose), RP2D(Recommended Phase 2 Dose) and DLT(Dose-limiting toxicity)s to evaluate approximately four dose levels of GX-I7

* pre-determined dose(Level I)\~ pre-determined dose(Level IV)
