Stage IB Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
RFS, recurrence-free survival, 5 years
OS, overall survival, 5 years
A total of 971 NSCLC patients with pathological stage IB resected by surgery (R0) from January 2016 to December 2020 at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University were reviewed. The primary endpoint is RFS (recurrence-free survival) and OS (overall survival) is the secondary endpoint. The baseline characteristics of the patients were obtained statistically, and factors affecting the prognosis of patients with stage IB NSCLC were analyzed using survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. The characteristics of the patients include pathological type, STAS, GGO, gene mutation, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.
