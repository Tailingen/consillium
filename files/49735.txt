Scale Down for Endometrial Cancer
This proposal will pilot a weight management program for patients with endometrial cancer, the cancer most associated with obesity. If successful, this pilot could be expanded to include obese women with other gynecologic cancers (ovarian and cervical) and could be expanded and adapted for use not only upon completion of treatment, but during chemotherapy or radiation. Furthermore, other obstetricians and gynecologists could use this strategy for obese women as a practical cancer prevention strategy for obesity-associated cancers.
