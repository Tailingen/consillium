LCI-PED-NOS-EXER-001: Exercise in Pediatric Oncology Patients
The purpose of this study is to see if there are physical and emotional benefits to participating in a structured exercise regimen for those who are ages 2-25, are newly diagnosed with a blood or solid tumor cancer, and are currently undergoing or will begin cancer treatment.

Potential benefit of increasing/maintaining physical functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment, Investigate if 20 minutes of exercise, five days per week, will have benefit relative to the control arm by increasing and/or maintaining physical functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment as measured by 6-Minute Walk test, 18 month period|Potential benefit of increasing/maintaining physical functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment, Investigate if 20 minutes of exercise, five days per week, will have benefit relative to the control arm by increasing and/or maintaining physical functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment as measured by BOT-2 Brief (in subjects â‰¥ 4 years of age) or PDMS-2 (in subjects \< 4 years of age)., 18 month period
Adverse Event Rate, Occurrence of Adverse Events of Special Interest (thromboembolic event, skin ulceration, significant nausea/vomiting, and constipation) will be measured as binary variables., up to 18 months|Quality of Life measured by the PedsQL Cancer Module, Investigate if a structured exercise regimen relative to the control arm will result in Increasing and /or maintaining quality of life as measured by the PedsQL Cancer Module. Peds QL scores will be calculated as a composite quantitative analogue variable ranging from zero (best score) to 100 (worst score)., up to 18 months|Subject adherence to exercise regimen, Subject adherence to exercise regimen will be determined by patient-reported tracker listing activity performed and duration of time of activity. Data collected will be normalized quantitatively based on intended activity., up to 18 months|Adverse Events Related to Exercise Program, To summarize adverse event rates deemed to be related to the protocol directed exercise program. Adverse events of special interest (Grade 2 or greater Bone fracture, Fall, and Muscle aches/Myalgia) will be captured for each subject and time point randomized to the intervention arm., up to 18 months
This is a randomized, controlled trial to investigate if a structured exercise regimen will have benefit relative to the control arm by increasing and /or maintaining physical functioning in pediatric subjects undergoing chemotherapy and childhood cancer treatment as measured by 6-Minute Walk test and BOT-2 Brief or PDMS-2.
