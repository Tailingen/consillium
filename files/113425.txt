Optimizing ctDNA-based MRD Assessment in DLBCL, MCL, and FL Patients Undergoing CAR Therapy
In this study, invesigators propose to analyze 150 DLBCL patients, 50 MCL patients, and 100 FL patients to determine the clinical utility of ctDNA- as well as circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based MRD assessment in CAR therapy patients. The project detailed in this protocol will utilize the clonoSEQ platform as specific quantification of residual DLBCL/FL/MCL and correlate its results with radiologic assessment of disease and clinical outcomes. Invesitgators predict there will be a strong correlation between ctDNA and PET/CT and dynamic changes in ctDNA will precede radiologic evidence of disease recurrence in patients following CAR therapy.

DEVICE: ClonoSEQ
Primary Outcome: Predicting Progression Free Survival, Ability of ctDNA MRD assessment to predict progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months following CAR infusion in DLBCL, FL and MCL patients., 0-18 months
Secondary Objective: Correlation of minimal residual disease and tumor burden, -Determine the correlation between quantified MRD and metabolic tumor volume (MTV), 0-18 months|Secondary Objective continued: Looking at clinical information of minimal residual disease, -Determine the clinical utility of MRD assessments in an exploratory analysis, 0-18 months|Secondary Objective continued: Additional correlations, -Determine the correlation between ctDNA-based and CTC-based MRD assessments in DLBCL/FL/MCL, 0-18 months
