Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Toripalimab
R0 surgical resection rate, No residual ratio under the microscope after surgical resection, Approximately 1 years
ORR, To measure the patients's overall response rate, Approximately 2 years|Major Pathological Response (MPR) rate, defined as noadjuvant therapy-induced tumor regression in pathologically residual tumor cells \<10%, Approximately 2 years|Complete Response (pCR) rate, Defined as non-adjuvant therapy-induced tumor regression in absence of pathologically residual tumor cells, Approximately 2 years|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Defined as the time from the first dose treatment to the occurrence of any event, including disease progression, discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or death., Approximately 2 years|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Defined as the time from surgery to the occurrence of any event, including disease progression, discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or death., Approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the first dose treatment to death., Approximately 2 years
The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of Toripalimab Combined with Double Platinum Based Chemotherapy for Initially Unresectable Non-driver Gene Mutation Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Other multiple Omics data will be analyzed to predict the MPR for treatment outcomes.
