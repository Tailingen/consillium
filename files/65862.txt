Multi-omics Study of Early-stage Lung Cancer with Distinct Phenotypes
The goal of this observational study is to investigate the multi-omics characterization early-stage lung cancer exhibiting distinct phenotypes including lung cancer associated with cystic airspaces, multiple primary lung cancers, and so on. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What are the differences in pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer with different phenotypes explored by multi-omics?
* Whether differential genes lead to potential prognostic models and therapeutic targets? Participants will be followed up after surgery to answer prognosis: whether they have recurred, and the time to recurrence.
