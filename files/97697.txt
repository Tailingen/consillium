Study of Onvansertib in Combination With FOLFIRI and Bevacizumab Versus FOLFIRI and Bevacizumab for Second Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in Participants With a Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus Gene (KRAS) or Neuroblastoma-RAS (NRAS) Mutation
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of 2 different doses of onvansertib in combination with a chemotherapy regimen of irinotecan, fluorouracil \[5-FU\], and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) and bevacizumab for treatment of confirmed metastatic and/or unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC) in participants with a kirsten rat sarcoma virus gene (KRAS) or neuroblastoma-RAS (NRAS) mutation who have progressed on an oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidinebased regimen in the first-line setting.
