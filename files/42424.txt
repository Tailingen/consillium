Evaluation of the Zetiq Histological and Cytological Staining Technique for the Detection Cervical Cancer
Zetiq has introduced a histochemical stain that claims to tinctorially identify cancer and neoplastic cells. Because of the potential importance of such a capability, the investigators undertook to investigate Zetiq's CellDetect速 staining technology as applied to cultured cell lines as well as an initial sample of clinical cases. This goal was pursued by investigating four types of comparisons: 1) cancer cell lines before and after differentiation; 2) cervical squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) biopsies to non-neoplastic squamous epithelium; 3) SCCs to neoplastic, nonmalignant squamous epithelium; and 4) neoplastic squamous cells to non-neoplastic squamous cells in cytological preparations. The clinical material was also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (biopsies) or Pap (cytologies) for diagnostic purposes. The investigators found that all CellDetect速-stained cells exhibited one of the two tinctorial outcomes. Cell lines with malignant phenotype uniformly had red/purple cytoplasm, whereas the differentiated phenotype changed the color to blue/green.
