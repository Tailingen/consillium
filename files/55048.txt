A Study of RC48-ADC for the Treatment of HER2-expressing Gynecological Malignancies
This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intravenous injection of RC48-ADC in the treatment of HER2 expression (HER2 positive and HER2 low expression) gynecological malignancies.
Gynecological Malignancy
DRUG: RC48-ADC
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by the Independent Review Committee, Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 2 years
Objective Response Rate（ORR）as assessed by investigator, Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 2 years|Duration of Response（DOR）, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, 2 years|Disease control rate（DCR）, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD), 2 years|Progression Free Survival（PFS）, PFS is defined as the time from the first administration of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, 2 years|Overall survival （OS）, OS is defined as the time from the first administration of study treatment to death from any cause., 2 years
This study is an open, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase II basket clinical study that included HER2 expression (HER2 positive and HER2 low expression) gynecological malignant tumor subjects. The four cohorts include cervical cancer, ovarian epithelial cancer、 fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer, endometrial cancer and other gynecological malignancies (vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, primary sarcoma of the gynecological reproductive system, etc.). Each cohort enrolled 30 subjects. Among them, IHC+, IHC2+, IHC3+ subjects were enrolled at least 5 subjects, and the remaining 15 subjects were not restricted by HER2 expression. HER2 expression includes HER2 positive and HER2 low expression. HER2 positive is defined by the immunohistochemical IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization technique FISH+ or IHC 3+ judged by the central laboratory. HER2 low expression is defined as IHC 2+/FISH- or IHC+ as determined by the central laboratory. The Molecular Pathology Department of the Department of Pathology, Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences will serve as the research center laboratory to confirm the HER2 status (including IHC and FISH tests).
