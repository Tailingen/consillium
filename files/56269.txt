Targeted and Staged Cyber Knife Combined With Interventional Therapy in the Treatment of MHCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that is progressing rapidly. Hepatic arterial embolization chemotherapy (TACE) is a common method for the treatment of unresectable of hepatocellular carcinoma.But for patients with \> 10cm hepatocellular carcinoma, the intervention effect was not satisfied.The cyberknife is a kind of stereotactic radiotherapy which can track the movement of tumor and monitor the position deviation of tumor in real time.This stuy is aimed to observe the efficiency and safety of the combination of TACE and cyberknife in the treatment of massive hepatocellular carcinoma.
