Glioma Supra Marginal Incision Trial
G-SUMIT is a pilot, phase II,randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of performing a large-scale trial in patients undergoing surgery for first-time diagnosis of high grade glioma (HGG) in a surgically favorable anatomical location to answer the following:

Does extending the margin of resection 1 cm beyond visible enhanced volume on MRI result in (a) an increase in overall survival? (b) result in a similar rate of "clinically-significant" neurological worsening during 30 days post surgery and quality of life at 6 and 12 months?
High Grade Glioma
PROCEDURE: Supramarginal resection|PROCEDURE: Conventional (i.e. GTR) resection
Enrollment, The number of patients enrolled and successfully allocated to the intervention versus the control treatment, Collected at time of randomization, through end of enrollment period (2 years)
Feasibility using eligibility, Measures feasibility. Among all screened patients, the proportion of patients who meet the eligibility criteria, Screening/Enrollment|Feasibility using proportion of consent, Measures feasibility. Among all screened patients, the proportion of patients consenting to participate, Screening/Enrollment|Feasibility using number of completed visits, Measures feasibility. Among all screened patients, the proportion of patients completing all scheduled follow-up assessments, Through study completion, on average 2 years|Feasibility using Gross Total Resection, Measures feasibility. The proportion of radiographically-confirmed gross total resection of contrast-enhancing tumor based on the first MRI after surgery., 2 days (+/- 1 day) post surgery|Efficacy using overall survival, Measures efficacy. The date of death will be obtained from hospital records, outpatient follow up clinic notes, or provincial cancer registries., 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks), 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) and 12 (+/- 1) months post surgery|Efficacy using progression-free survival, Measures efficacy. Assessment of progression-free survival based on the Modified Criteria for Radiographic Response Assessment in Glioblastoma (mRANO) criteria. The date of death will be obtained from hospital records, outpatient follow up clinic notes, or provincial cancer registries. Progression-free survival will be measured based on mRANO criteria during regular 3-month interval clinical and MRI follow up, 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks), 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) and 12 (+/- 1) months post surgery|Safety using neurological function, The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) will be used to assess neurological function. The NIHSS is a validated neurologically-specific outcome tool originally developed for rapid grading of stroke symptoms adopted in surgical clinical trials as well., 2 (+/- 1) days and 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks), days post surgery|Safety using global disability, The modified rankin scale (mRS ) is a measure of global disability that has been widely used to assess outcome after stroke.

The scale consists of six grades from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (severe disability); 6 indicates death., 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) and 12 (+/- 1) months post surgery|Safety using quality of life, The overall quality of life will be assessed either in-person or over the phone using the EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D is a generic instrument used to measure quality of life, designed for self-completion by respondents either face-to-face or over telephone interview, also available in proxy version through care giver., 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) and 12 (+/- 4 weeks) post surgery, 24 (+/- 4 weeks) post surgery|Safety using 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) all cause-mortality, Will collect mortality data., 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) post surgery|Radiological, Volumetric measurement of contrast enhancement on MRI, 2 (+/- 1) days, 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) and 12 (+/- 1) months
This pilot, multi-centre, pragmatic randomized controlled trial is planned to simulate all aspects of a larger definitive trial comparing conventional versus supramarginal tumor resection at the time of the first surgical resection of HGG in appropriately selected patients. This pilot will help determine the ability to meet pre-specified criteria in identification, recruitment, and patient allocation, allow for refinement of eligibility criteria for optimal recruitment, confirm safety of procedure and ability to retain participants for the duration of the trial. Preliminary efficacy data will inform sample size calculations and estimation of resources required for the envisioned larger definitive trial.
