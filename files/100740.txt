Personalized Nutrition Counseling and Nutritional Status of Esophageal Cancer and HNSCC Patients Undergoing CCRT
The purpose of the study is to improve the nutritional status of esophageal cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy by the personalized nutrition counseling.Dietitians consult with participants which invited to be the experimental group and follow up weekly through communication software (Line) or telephone remote methods. Dietitians provide the dietary advice base on the guidance of the cancer diet principles, and give on assessment and diet adjustments. At the same time, Under the same condition of nutritional supplements in both the experimental group and the control group, the investigators explore the changes in the quality of life and nutritional status of the subjects by evaluating with the nutrition Index (PG-SGA) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire Taiwan version) questionnaire evaluation and recode the basic physical data, including body weight, grip strength, body muscle fat composition. Therefore, investigators conducted this study to appoint dietitian to arrange personalized nutrition consultation for esophageal cancer patients to improve the nutritional status of these patients.

Approximately 60-85% of esophageal cancer patients present with malnutrition at diagnosis (1). Malnutrition, defined as body weight loss of more than 10% over the previous 6 months is associated with treatment response and survival (2). Around 38% of esophageal cancer patients are managed with curative intent in the form of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by esophagectomy (3). Individuals are at increased risk of malnutrition arising from disease related symptoms and neoadjuvant treatment. Nutritional status serves as an important risk factor for major complications after operation (4) Therefore, assessment of nutritional status should be undertaken for all esophageal cancer patients, especially for those who are planned to receive esophagectomy (5). The nutritional assessment includes hand grip for muscle mass (6), body composition for lean body mass and sarcopenia (7), body mass index- body weight loss grade (BMI-BWL grade) for generalized nutrition status (8). These tools are needed to be integrated and individualized to esophageal cancer patients to improve outcome. Therefore, investigators conducted this trial to appoint dietitian to arrange personalized nutrition consultation for esophageal cancer patients to improve the nutritional status of these patients.
