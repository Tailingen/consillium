To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT for T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer，the following questions should be answered. Can SRT be an alternative standard treatment modality for inoperable patients? Can SRT can be a comparable standard treatment modality with lobectomy for operable patients? 12 Gy is the daily dose at the isocenter，and 48 Gy in total by 4 fractions will be irradiated by stereotactic irradiation over 4 to 8 days.
