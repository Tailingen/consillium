Clinical Trial Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Dendritic Cell-Based Immunotherapy for Glioblastoma
This Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial with sequential randomization is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an experimental vaccine composed of hybrid dendritic cells (DCs) for the treatment of glioblastoma. Conducted at the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) and the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo (ICB/USP), the study is led by Professor José Alexandre Marzagão Barbuto. A multidisciplinary team of researchers specializing in neurosurgery, pathology, hematology, and other fields will contribute to a comprehensive approach.

The trial aims to determine whether the hybrid DC vaccine can increase overall survival in adult patients with glioblastoma who have completed standard treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating progression-free survival, quality of life, immune response, and the safety of the intervention. The study will enroll 186 patients, who will be randomized into three groups: (1) a control group receiving placebo, (2) a group receiving the DC vaccine, and (3) a group receiving the DC vaccine combined with pembrolizumab.

Overall Survival, The primary expected outcome is overall survival, evaluated over a 2-year period., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 2 years
Disease Progression and Survival Metrics, Progression-free survival in months, assessed through RANO criteria (complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressing disease); Survival rates at 6 and 12 months after the initiation of vaccination; Functional status evolution, evaluated through the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS, ranging from 0, dead to 100, asymptomatic), WHO-ECOG scale (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ranging from 0, fully active, to 5, dead), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, ranging from 0, all questions responded wrongly to 30, best performance);, From enrollment to the end of treatment, limited to 2 years|Quality of life and general health assessment, Quality of life and general health evaluation:
