First-in-Human Study of ICT01 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
Part 1 will be a dose escalation study of IV ICT01 (a monoclonal antibody targeting BTN3A) as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid or hematologic tumors, followed by a cohort examining the combination of ICT01 plus pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Part 2 will be a cohort expansion into 2 solid tumor indications and one hematologic malignancy for ICT01 monotherapy, and 3 solid tumor indications for the combination of ICT01 plus pembrolizumab.
