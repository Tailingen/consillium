The Effect of GM-CSF to Preventing Oral Mucositis for Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Receiving Radiotherapy
To evaluate the efficacy of GM-CSF to preventing oral mucositis for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma receiving radiotherapy.
GM-CSF
DRUG: GM-CSF
The incidence of severe oral mucositis(grade 3+), To evaluate the incidence of severe oral mucositis between the two arms., During radiotherapy, up to 1.5 months.
Acute toxicities, The incidence rates of acute toxicities during treatment, evaluted by CTCAE Version5.0., One month.|The last time of ≥3 grade oral mucositis, The time from first observed ≥3 grade oral mucositis to first observed oral mucositis decrease to less than grade 3, 1 months after radiotherapy|Daily questionaire of oral mucositis (OMDQ), Patients are required to finish daily questionaire of oral mucositis by visual signs, 1 months after radiotherapy|Quality of life(QOL), QOL is calculated by QLQ-C30., 1 months after radiotherapy
Patients of GM-CSF group receive GM-CSF washmouth four times a day during radiotherapy. Control arm receive conventioanl care during radiotherapy. Visual signs of radiation or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage were independently assessed during the course of RT by a radiation oncologist or other trained study personnel. The incidence of severe oral mucositis, the severe oral mucositis last time, quality of life between the two arms would be calculated.
