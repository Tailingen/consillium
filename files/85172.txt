Comparison of Clinical Outcomes Among Patients Treated With Tisagenlecleucel
This is a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study using the Flatiron Health Research Database (FHRD) and data from the single-arm phase II JULIET clinical trial (NCT02445248).
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
OTHER: Tisagenlecleucel
Overall survival (OS): ITT population, To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as compared to the current SOC as measured by overall survival (OS) among patients with r/r DLBCL and treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy., throughout the study, approximately 5 years|Overall survival (OS): FAS population, To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as compared to the current SOC as measured by overall survival (OS) among patients with r/r DLBCL and treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy., throughout the study, approximately 5 years
Overall response rate (ORR): ITT population, To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as compared to the current SOC as measured by overall response rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), among patients with r/r DLBCL and treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy., throughout the study, approximately 5 years|Overall response rate (ORR): FAS population, To evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel therapy as compared to the current SOC as measured by overall response rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), among patients with r/r DLBCL and treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy., throughout the study, approximately 5 years
JULIET is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II study of tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with r/r DLBCL who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

Patients enrolled in JULIET will be referred to as the trial cohort in this study. Outcomes observed in the trial cohort will be compared against a cohort of patients receiving standard of care, defined as the real-world cohort in this study. The real-world cohort will be derived from the FHRD by applying relevant JULIET trial inclusion and exclusion criteria that are feasible to apply in the FHRD.
