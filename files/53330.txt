Neoadjuvant Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreatic Head and/or Body
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of focused radiation (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy, SBRT) on patients with pancreatic cancer that will be removed surgically.
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Number of Participants With Acute (Within 3 Months of Treatment) Grade 3 or Greater Gastrointestinal Toxicity, AEs were reviewed for gastrointestinal toxicity. Toxicities of note include grade 3 or greater gastritis, enteritis, fistula, or ulcer and any other grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity., 3 months
Number of Participants With Late (Greater Than 3 Months After Treatment) Grade 2 Gastritis, Enteritis, Fistula, and Ulcer or Any Other Grade 3 or Greater Gastrointestinal Toxicity, AEs were assessed for gastrointestinal toxicity. Toxicities of note include grade 2 or greater gastritis, enteritis, fistula, or ulcer and any other grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity., 1 year|Local Progression Free Survival, Local tumor progression will be defined as \>=20% increased size on CT scan compared to a CT. scan from prior to treatment. Distant progression will be defined as any new tumor found outside of the pancreas or periampullary region on CT scan. Local and/or distant progression will be evaluated by both PET/CT (if available) and CT scan as deemed by treating physician., 1 year|Metastasis Free Survival, 1 year|Overall Survival, 1 year
