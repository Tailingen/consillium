The Gut Microbiome and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in Solid Tumors
The microbiome has the potential to serve as a robust biomarker of clinical response to immunotherapy. Additionally, microbial manipulation, through diet, exercise, prebiotics, probiotics, or microbially-derived metabolites, may prove to be beneficial in promoting anti-tumor immune responses. However, large prospective studies in humans with longitudinal sample collection and standardized methods are needed to understand how microbiota and their byproducts affect cancer therapies, particularly among patients undergoing identical therapy but experiencing different outcomes. The proposed observational study builds upon these hypotheses by proposing a large cohort design to further assess the associations between the gut microbiota (composition and function), host immune system, and ICI treatment efficacy across multiple cancer types.

Change in microbiome composition from baseline to after Cycle 2 of checkpoint therapy (6-8 weeks) by analyzing longitudinally-collected stool specimens of 800 patients with primary NSCLC, MM, RCC, and TNBC, Microbiome evaluation with whole metagenome shotgun sequencing to assess changes in the relative abundance of microbial taxa (measured as percentage abundance per microbial species and changes in percentage abundance between baseline and cycle 2 timepoints) in patients who are receiving checkpoint blockade immunotherapy as the standard of care, prior to initiation of checkpoint therapy (i.e. "Baseline") and at the end of Cycle 2 of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (at approximately 6-8 weeks) ]
