Study of Carbon Dioxide Exchange Patterns During Robotic Prostatectomies
The AirSeal® System will allow for lower carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption rates than the standard Endopath System.

DEVICE: AirSeal System|DEVICE: Standard Endopath
Intraoperative Pneumoperitoneal Pressure (mmHg), Pneumoperitoneal pressure is the pressure exerted by air or gas in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. As the amount of air/gas increases, the pressure (mmHg) increases. The highest pressure that occurred during the procedure was compared between groups., Through end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes
Intraoperative Arterial Blood Gas Carbon Dioxide (mmHg)., The amount of dissolved carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in arterial blood (mmHg) during the operative procedure, Baseline, 60 minutes, and at end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|End-tidal Carbon Dioxide Pressure (mmHg), End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the end of exhalation. Normal value is 35-45 mmHg., Baseline, 60 minutes, and at end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|Carbon Dioxide Elimination (mmHg), Carbon dioxide elimination was calculated using end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (EtCO2), tidal volume, respiratory rate, barometric pressure (pB = 760mm Hg), partial pressure of water vapor (PH2O = 13 mm Hg), and patient weight (kg), Baseline, 60 minutes, and at end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|Intraoperative Arterial Blood Gas Oxygen (mmHg)., The amount of dissolved oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood (mmHg)., Baseline, 60 minutes, and end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|Number of Ventilator Interventions, The number of times the anesthesiologist had to adjust ventilator settings, Through end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|Procedure Time (Minutes), The duration of the procedure, Through end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes|Smoke Evacuation Quality, Smoke evacuation quality throughout the procedure was assessed by the surgeon as below average, average, or above average, Through end of procedure, an average of 156 minutes
The primary observation to be made is the level of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, specifically when the patient is insufflated and deflated during the surgery. As a result of the consistent pressure that the AirSeal® system maintains, carbon dioxide will be absorbed in lower levels when compared to the standard of care systems in which fluctuations in intra-peritoneum pressure are seen.
