Breast Cancer Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Combined Neoadjuvant Treatment
The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined neoadjuvant treatment for patients with triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1316 at a dose 20mg/kg q3w|DRUG: SHR6390 at a dose of 150mg orally, daily|RADIATION: SBRT
Pathological complete response (pCR) for TNBC group, pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on resected breast specimen and the sampled regional lymph nodes as shown by hematoxylin-eosin staining after completion of the neoadjuvant treatment., Up to11 months|Residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-I index for HER2-/HR+BC group, Residual cancer burden (RCB) is estimated from routine pathologic sections of the primary breast tumor site and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. 5 variables are included in a calculation formula to evaluate the total index(0-III), the higher scores mean a worse outcome, Up to11 months
