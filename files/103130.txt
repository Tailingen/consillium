Molecular, Pathologic Intra Tumoral Heterogeneity in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare pleural cancer, which could be primary or secondary to an asbestos exposure. To enhance our knowledge of this rare disease, an exploration of genetic and tumor mechanism is mandatory. One of the principal difficulty is to harvest sufficient tumour pieces to perform multi-omics analysis. The goal of the SCITH-MESO study is to harvest larges pieces of tumour during a routine surgical procedure of MPM diagnosis by mean of pleural biopsies during VATS surgery. Operating samples will increase a tissue bank collection (CRB).

For patients with MPM, blood samples are collected and a piece of biopsy will be used for the constitution of a specific bio collection in the CRB (centre de ressources biologiques)., For patients with MPM, blood samples are collected and a piece of biopsy will be used for the constitution of a specific bio collection in the CRB (centre de ressources biologiques)., day 1 (day of chirurgie)
