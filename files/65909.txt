Ph I Study of Alvocidib and Cytarabine/Daunorubicin (7+3) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
The purpose of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and tolerability including the maximum dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days 1-3 followed by cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated AML

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Alvocidib, Determine the safety and tolerability including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days 1-3 followed by Ara-c/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated AML, During the first cycle|Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of Alvocidib, Determine the safety and tolerability including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days 1-3 followed by Ara-c/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated AML, During the first cycle
Antileukemic Activity of Alvocidib Plus 7+3 - Response to Treatment Based on 2017 ELN Response Criteria, CR: Measurable residual disease is positive or unknown; BM blasts (bls) \<5%; no circulating bls and bls w/ Auer rods; no extramedullary disease; ANC \>1.0 x 109/L; platelets \>100 x 109/L. CRMRD-: CR w/ negativity genetic marker. CRi: CR except residual neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. MLFS: BM bls \<5%; no bls with Auer rods; no extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required. PR: all hematologic CR criteria; decrease (dec) BM bls % to 5-25%; dec pretreatment BM bls % by \>50%. SD: no CRMRD-/CR/CRi/PR/MLFS; PD criteria not met. PD: increase (inc) BM bls % and/or inc absolute bls in blood: 50% inc BM bls over baseline (\>15% point inc required in cases w/ \<30% bls at baseline or persistent BM bls % of \>70% over at least 3 months; without at least 100% improvement in ANC to absolute level \[\>0.5 x 109/L and/or platelet count to \>50 x 109/L non-transfused); or \>50% inc in peripheral bls to \>25 x 109/L (in the absence of differentiation syndrome); or new extramedullary disease., Best response during duration of study|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Alvocidib in Combination With 7+3, The dose at which \< 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1 with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 to 6 patients experiencing a DLT during Cycle 1, During Cycle 1 beginning at 1st dose of study drug through Day 50 + or - 3 days
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Using Standardized Techniques, Percentage of participants with a CRMRD- response at the end of Cycle 1, During duration of study
Primary Objective:

• To determine the safety and tolerability including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of alvocidib when administered over a range of doses on Days 1-3 followed by cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) on Days 5-11 in adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated AML

Secondary Objectives:

* To observe patients for any evidence of antileukemic activity of alvocidib plus 7+3 using the 2017 ELN response criteria
* To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with alvocidib in combination with 7+3

Exploratory Objective:

• To assess levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) using standardized techniques (ie, multiparametric flow cytometry \[MPFC\] and next generation sequencing \[NGS\] and evaluate other potential biomarkers including, but not limited to, MCL-1 dependency.
