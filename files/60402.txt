Expansion Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HM95573 in BRAF, KRAS or NRAS Mutant Solid Cancers
This study evaluates the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of single agent HM95573 administered in patients with solid tumors harboring mutations in either BRAF, KRAS or NRAS gene.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HM95573
Objective response rate (Proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of a predefined amount), At screening and every 8 weeks from time of first dosing until date of progression, start of other anticancer therapy or death whichever came first, assessed up to study completion (around 36 months).
Safety and tolerability by assessing adverse events (AEs) based on CTCAE ver.4.03, All AEs occurring up to 28 days after the last administration of study drug until the start of other anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes first, will be record.|Best overall response rate, At screening and every 8 weeks from time of first dosing until date of progression, start of other anticancer therapy or death whichever came first, assessed up to study completion (around 36 months).|Disease control rate, At screening and every 8 weeks from time of first dosing until date of progression, start of other anticancer therapy or death whichever came first, assessed up to study completion (around 36 months).|Progression-free survival, At screening and every 8 weeks from time of first dosing until date of progression, start of other anticancer therapy or death whichever came first, assessed up to study completion (around 36 months).|Changes in molecular biomarkers, Screening and 15 days after first dosing
