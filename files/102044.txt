A Study on the Efficacy of GD2-CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Neuroblastoma
Neuroblastoma (NB) is a malignant tumor of the sympathetic nervous system.Chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are the main treatments for neuroblastoma, and the prognosis of patients with high-risk recurrence and refractory treatment is very poor. There is a large unmet medical need in patients with relapsed refractory neuroblastoma, and further research into new therapeutic approaches is needed for these patients.GD2 is a dissialic ganglioside expressed by neuroectodermal tumors. The proportion of GD2 expression in neuroblastoma is up to 100%, so GD2 is a specific target for neuroblastoma immunotherapy and an ideal target for CAR-T treatment of neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: GD2-CAR-T cell
Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V4.03, 24 months|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR includes CR, PR,MR.SD,PD.Complete response (CR)#All components CR.Partial response (PR)#PR in at least one component and all other components CR,minimal disease (bone marrow), PR or not involved at baseline.Minor response (MR)#PR or CR in at least one component but at least one other component with SD; no component with PD.Stable disease (SD)#SD in one component with no better than SD or not involved at baseline in any other component, no component with PD.Progressive disease (PD)#Any component with PD., 24 months
Duration of overall response (DOR), Duration of overall response will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to progression, death or last follow-up., 24 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to progression, death or last follow-up., 24 months|Overall survival(OS), OS will be assessed from the CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up., 24 months
The duration of CAR T-cells in vivo, The time of CAR-T cells' persistence in blood and the copies of CAR-T cells, 24 months|CAR-T related cytokine expression, CAR-T related cytokine expression., 24 months
The subjects received the target dose of GD2-CAR-T from 1×106 to 1×108 /kg. Each subject will start with a low dose of 1×106/kg and if there are no significant side effects will be increased to the next dose until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. A variety of adverse events (including neurological events, hematological events, infections, and secondary tumors) will be collected from the time of infusion of CAR T cells to 24 months after infusion. To understand the complete response rate (CR) and partial response rate (PR) at 3 months; Recurrence rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after 1 to 5 years of GD2-CAR-T reinfusion; The amount and duration of GD2-CAR-T in vivo.
