A Trial of 15 Fraction vs 25 Fraction Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Radiotherapy After Mastectomy in Patients Requiring Regional Nodal Irradiation
This is a randomized controlled trial to determine the safety of 15 fraction vs 25 fraction pencil beam scanning proton radiotherapy after mastectomy in patients requiring regional nodal irradiation. Proton therapy is recognized as a standard option for the delivery of radiotherapy for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionation
Complication Rate, Will be defined as the percentage of women randomized who develop one or more of the following events: grade 3 or higher late adverse events; unplanned surgical intervention (not including planned serial fat grafting) in patients who undergo mastectomy with reconstruction., 24 months
Incidence of Acute Adverse Events, Data will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies by treatment arm. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration., Up to 90 days post radiation therapy (RT)|Incidence of Late Adverse Events, Data will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies by treatment arm. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration., 90 days post-RT and up to 5 years post-RT|Reconstruction Failure, Will assess loss of the tissue expander or implant with the inability to replace it resulting in no final reconstruction or conversion to autologous reconstruction or revised with the addition of autologous reconstruction., 90 days post-RT and up to 5 years post-RT|Quality of Life - Breast Cancer Outcomes, measured by cosmesis evaluation and the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), up to 5 years post-RT|Cosmesis, measured by reviewing digital photographs and the 4 point (excellent, good, fair, poor) adaptation of the Harvard Cosmesis Scale, baseline, 2 years, and 5 years|Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence (IBTR) Incidence, Will be defined as local recurrence from trial registration as a first event at 5 years. The IBTR cumulative incidence will be estimated using a competing risks method by treatment arm. The competing risks will be regional/distant breast cancer recurrence and death., at 5 years post RT|Distant Recurrence Incidence, Will assess metastatic cancer that has either been biopsy confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer at 5 years., at 5 years post RT|Regional Recurrence Incidence, Defined as invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and skin of the ipsilateral breast at 5 years., at 5 years post RT|Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from study registration until the occurrence, if any, of one of the following events: invasive IBTR, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant breast cancer recurrence, death due to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, and second primary non-breast invasive disease., at 5 years post RT|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause., at 5 years post RT
