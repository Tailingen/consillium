A Study to Assess the Feasibility and Safety of Intratumoral Diffusing Alpha Emitters for the Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma
Recurrent Glioblastoma|Recurrent Gliomas
DEVICE: Device :DaRT seeds
Feasibility - DaRT seed placement, Feasibility will be determined according to the rate of successful placement of Alpha DaRT sources into brain tumors., From day 0 until 12 months|Safety - Adverse events, Safety will be determined according to incidence of acute grade 3 or greater unanticipated Adverse Events (AE) according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From day 0 until 12 months
Toxicity profile, according to CTCAE v5.0, within 4 weeks of completion of postoperative radiotherapy|Radiographic local tumor control, per RANO criteria, from 1 month following surgery and onwards|Rate of pseudo-progression at first post-implant scan, RANO criteria, 1 month following surgery|Overall survival, up to 12 months post implant
This is a Prospective Open label Single arm Multi-center interventional study. The study is designed to evaluate the Feasibility and Safety of DaRT seeds for the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma.

A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled.

Eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (as assessed during the screening period) will be invited to the site for the procedure of DaRT seeds insertion and will return for a follow up visit every 2 months (+/- 7 days ) up to 12 months (4 ,6 , 8, 10 and 12 ). Survival F.U (after visit 11) will be done via phone calls every 2-3 months until (1) the start of new anti-cancer treatment, (2) disease progression or (3) death, whichever occurs first.
