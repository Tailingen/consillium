Comparison of Melphalan-Prednisone (MP) to MP Plus Thalidomide in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Very Elderly Patients (> 75 Years) With Multiple Myeloma
In multiple myeloma, combination chemotherapy with melphalan plus prednisone has been usedsince the 1960s and is regarded as the standard of care in very elderly patients. We assess whether the addition of thalidomide at 100 mg/day to this combination would improve survival.
