FSRT Combined With TMZ for Large BMs: a PSM Study
A propensity- matched study was conducted to investigate the feasibility and safety of adding temozolomide to hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for large brain metastases.
Brain Metastases|Radiotherapy|Chemotherapy
RADIATION: fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy
Local tumor control rate (LTCR), the control rate of treated lesions, 3 months after radiation
Intracranial progression- free survival (IPFS), the interval from the beginning of radiation to any intracranial progression, up to 1 year|Local recurrence- free survival (LRFS), the time from the beginning of radiation to local faliure., up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), the time from the beginning of radiation to follow-up or death, up to 3 years|Progression- free survival (PFS), the interval from the beginning of HFSRT to any progression of tumor., up to 1 year|Brain metastasis-specific survival (BMSS), the internal from the beginning of radiation to death that caused by brain metastases., up to 1 year
A previous single arm phase II trial of our institution has shown that HFSRT combined with concurrent TMZ was safe and efficient for patients with BMs of ≥ 6cc in volume. The 1-year local control and overall survival rate was better than the results of a retrospective study using HFSRT alone in treating BMs of ≥ 3cm in diameter. Thus, we hypothesized that adding TMZ to HFSRT should translate to substantive benefits in clinical outcomes compared to HFSRT alone. Propensity score matching method was adopted to decrease potential bias in this retrospective study.
