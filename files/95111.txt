The TOTOM Trial: Tai Chi to Optimize Transplant Outcomes for Multiple Myeloma
The current proposal aims to test the feasibility of immune function analysis for Tai Chi Easy (TCE) intervention in multiple myeloma (MM) patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with concurrent exploration of health related quality of life (HRQOL).

The current proposal aims to test the feasibility of immune function analysis for TCE intervention in MM patients undergoing ASCT with concurrent exploration of HRQOL. The data obtained from this trial will provide supporting data for a future randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of TCE on immune function (incidence of ASCT related infectious complications, natural killer cell phenotype and activity, and myeloma remission rate (clonal plasma cell % at day 100, minimal residual disease (MRD)), with the evaluation of efficacy on improving HRQOL during ASCT. Successful completion of this CROC project will provide necessary data to support future grant applications, in particular the feasibility of immunoassay evaluation of MM patients undergoing ASCT.
