Lenvatinib Combined Anti-PD1 Antibody for the Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
For the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the targeted therapy and immunotherapy are recommended. This study focused on the management of Lenvatinib combined anti-PD1 antibody for the HCC. This study will create a database that will provide clinical parameters and outcomes of patients undergoing Lenvatinib and anti-PD1 antibody as part of their standard of care in hopes of answering key clinical questions.

Progression-Free-Survival(PFS), Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST or death from any cause, 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of randomization until death from any cause., 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the proportion of all randomized subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR., 6 months|Disease control rate(DCR), The proportion of patients who had a best response rating of complete responseï¼Œ partial response, or stable disease., 24 months|Adverse events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., 24 months
Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody, was effective and tolerable in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus. We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib combined anti-PD1 antibody in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who can not receive redical therapy.
