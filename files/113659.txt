This study is a randomized controlled trial of young adult cancer survivors with clinically significant symptoms of insomnia to evaluate the cognitive-behavioral based Sleep Treatment Education Program for Young Adult Cancer Survivors (STEP-YA).

All participants will take part in a single STEP-YA session, during which they will complete baseline measures prior to randomization and then receive the STEP-YA intervention. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive the STEP-YA intervention either, 1) alone (non-coaching condition), or 2) with the addition of 2 remote coaching sessions (coaching condition). Participants will also complete follow-up measures 4 and 8 weeks post-baseline.

It expected that about 74 people will take part in this study
