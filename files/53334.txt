Cabazitaxel and BKM120 in Patients With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Previously Treated With Docetaxel
Although there have been advances in the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), all patients eventually develop resistance to available therapy. Docetaxel is the accepted first-line agent followed by cabazitaxel in the post-docetaxel phase. In this study the investigators propose to evaluate BKM120, a PI3K inhibitor, with cabazitaxel in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Advanced Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BKM 120|DRUG: Cabazitaxel
Number of Subjects with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Determine the optimal dose and safety of BKM120 given with cabazitaxel to patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer., up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), time to disease progression, every 6 weeks, up to 24 months
Overall Response Rate, Percentage of complete responders (CR) or partial responders (PR) among patients evaluable for response, every 6 weeks, up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Time from first treatment until death from any cause using Kaplan-Meier methods., up to 36 months
This study will be conducted in two parts. In a lead-in cohort, the feasibility and safety of administering BKM120 with a standard dose of cabazitaxel will be assessed. If safety is confirmed, a subsequent Phase II portion will assess the activity of the combination in patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel. The treatment will consist of 3-week (21-day) cycles.

The ultimate purpose of this study will be to determine progression-free survival, response rate, disease control rate and overall survival of patients treated with the combination regimen and compare outcomes to historical results with single-agent cabazitaxel.
