Feasibility of online MR guided Radiotherapy, Treatment of a patient is considered feasible when 85% of treatments were completed as planned in this patient, During every single patients treatment (i.e. between one to seven weeks after the first application of radiotherapy)
Time analysis, Time required for online MR guided radiotherapy, During every single patients treatment (i.e. between one to seven weeks after the first application of radiotherapy)
Novel hybrid devices combine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a linear accelerator in a single device. The superior soft tissue contrast compared with cone-beam computed tomography based treatment and the possibility for daily plan adaptation promise a higher precision of treatment, better target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing. In a first step the present study will test the feasibility of imaging and treatment on the 1.5 T MR-Linac.
