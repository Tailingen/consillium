Retrospective Study in a NSCLC M+ p
This is a national, multicentre, non-interventional, retrospective study to be carried out in the oncology settings of approximately 15-20 Spanish hospitals.

At each participant hospital, all patients recently diagnosed with advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC (both newly or with recurrent disease , without previous treatment for metastatic disease) from April 2010 to December 2011 will be included as study population. Information about the follow-up of the patients during a minimum of 12 months after diagnosis will be collected.
