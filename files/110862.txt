Trial of Prehabilitation in Vulnerable Patients Undergoing Cystectomy for Bladder Cancer
The development of clinically relevant and scalable exercise interventions in older cystectomy patients may have an impact upon:

* Patients: Exercise interventions may improve patient outcomes, including quality of life and avoidance of skilled nursing facilities.
* Clinicians: Proving the safety and feasibility of targeted interventions in older surgical patients may facilitate the development of clinically relevant preoperative interventions suitable for wider study and implementation.
* Payers: Improved surgical outcomes among high risk surgical patients will be associated with significant cost savings.
* Researchers: Targeted and well controlled studies focusing on improving surgical outcomes through exercise may provide insight into relationships between patient factors, surgical stressors and outcomes. Ultimately, such work may lead to novel clinical approaches to optimize patients for surgery.

The investigators will study the effects of preoperative exercise training on cystectomy patients, specifically targeting increasing functional capacity and muscular strength. Prior to conducting a more extensive, multi-center, randomized-controlled trial, the feasibility, safety, and initial efficacy of preoperative exercise in cystectomy patients must be determined. To address this issue, the investigators will complete a trial of rehabilitation in cystectomy patients at the University of Michigan.
Bladder Cancer
OTHER: Baseline Strength Test|OTHER: Exercise
Assess whether a pre-operative exercise training program (Prehabilitation) for elderly patients undergoing cystectomy for bladder cancer will lower their post-operative 90-day hospital readmission rate., The study will compare the readmission rate of 70 recruited prehabilitation patients to the historic readmission rates from our institution and the published literature. Readmission will be defined as an admission to any acute care hospital after initial discharge from the immediate post-operative stay within 90 days of surgery. Visits to emergency rooms or urgent, unscheduled outpatient evaluations will be tracked, but will not count as a readmission. We will also track instances in which patients experience multiple re-admissions within 90 days of surgery, but for the purposes of this study, multiple re-admissions for an individual patient will only count as a single readmission event., 3 Years
Determine the efficacy of prehabilitation on improving functional capacity and strength from baseline levels., A submaximal exercise test and 6 minute walk test will be used to assess the maximal rate of oxygen utilization and functional capacity at baseline and at the conclusion of the intervention period. Muscular strength will be evaluated using volume loading., 3 Years|Composite of measures assessing the effects of prehabilitation on peri-operative cystectomy complications, resource utilization, patient reported outcomes, and functional status., Early (within 30 days of surgery) and late (between 31 and 90 days of surgery) complications, length of hospital stay, resource utilization (emergency room visits, need for sub-acute rehabilitation or nursing home stays, and the costs associated with this additional care) and post-operative outcomes, such as functional capacity and quality of life, will be evaluated and compared to historic data available in the published literature., 3 years|Evaluate safety for a prehabilitation program in elderly cystectomy patients., The endpoint for safety is the prevalence of adverse events during study-related assessments and exercise training sessions., 3 Years|Rates of attrition for a prehabilitation program in elderly cystectomy patients., Study attrition will be the rate at which patients drop out of the study., 3 Years|Rates of adherence for a prehabilitation program in elderly cystectomy patients., Study adherence will be the percentage of prescribed exercise sessions each participant completes during the treatment period., 3 Years|Rates of accrual for a prehabilitation program in elderly cystectomy patients., Track the study recruitment rate and, once patients have been screened by the study team and approached to participate, note the reasons that patients who choose not to participate give for their refusal (personal preference, medical comorbidities/deconditioning, perceived program intensity, time commitment for the study protocol, travel distance or lack of consistent means of travel)., 3 Years
