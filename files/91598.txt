Proof of Concept of TBio-4101, Lymphodepleting Chemo, IL-2 for Relapsed/Refractory Melanoma
The purpose of this first in human study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of administering TBio-4101 (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes \[TIL\]) after receiving a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen and before receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2) in participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

BIOLOGICAL: TBio-4101|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Percentage of Participants that Successfully Receive TBio-4101, Percentage of participants who undergo tumor resection that successfully receive TBio-4101, Day 7
Objective Response Rate (OOR), ORR will be calculated using irRECIST and RECIST v1.1, 2 years after receiving TIL Transfer|6 Month Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death, at 6 Months|12 Month Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death, at 12 Months|6 Month Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study enrollment until disease progression or death., at 6 Months|12 Month Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study enrollment until disease progression or death., at 12 Months|Durable Response Rate (DRR), DRR is defined as a continuous response, beginning within 12 months of treatment and lasting \> 6 months, Up to 6 Months after 12 months of Treatment
