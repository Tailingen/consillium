Comparison of SEEOX and SOX Regimens in Stage ⅢB/ⅢC Gastric Cancer Patients
Chemotherapy is an important therapeutic method for patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, there is currently no established standard chemotherapeutic regimen in the preoperative or neoadjuvant treatment setting. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity between SEEOX and SOX regimens. The investigators estimate that combined intravenous and intra-arterial intensified SEEOX preoperative chemotherapy may be a safe and promising regimen for locally advanced or initially unresectable gastric cancer patients.

DRUG: oxaliplatin|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: pharmorubicin|DRUG: S-1
3 year progression free survival, time period calculated from randomization to the first disease progression, recurrence or death from any cause, up to 7 years
Objective response rate, the proportion of patients with complete and partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (version 1.1), up to 4 years|R0 resection rate, the proportion of complete tumor resection with no microscopic or macroscopic residual diseases in all operations, up to 4 years|3 year overall survival, time period calculated from randomization to death from any cause, up to 7 years|Adverse events of preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative chemotherapy associated complications, up to 4 years
Sensitivity analysis of primary outcome adjusted for stratification factors, up to 7 years
Gastric cancer patients who will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy would be included in this study. They would receive combined intravenous and intra-arterial intensified SEEOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy or SOX regimen at random. The efficacy and toxicity of these two regimens would be compared.
