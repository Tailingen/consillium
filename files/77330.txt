Preoperative IMRT With Concurrent Apatinib for Localised Extremity or Trunk Sarcoma
To investigate the safety and efficacy of preoperative IMRT and concurrent Apatinib for primary truncal or extremity soft tissue sarcoma; To investigate the Quality of life and extremity function post-combination treatment; To study the mechanism of radio-sensitizing effects of Apatinib for primary truncal or extremity soft tissue sarcoma; To assess the relationship between the MRI imaging, pathological findings and local control.
Sarcoma,Soft Tissue|Extremity|Trunk|Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy|Targetd Therapy|Major Wound Complications
DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate
Rate of Major wound complications within 4 months post-surgery, 4-months post-surgery
Acute and late toxicities, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, acute toxicities were evaluated during and 3 months after IMRT, late toxicities were evaluted after 6 months|Patient-reported Quality of Life assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Evaluate the quality of life by patient-reported EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire at different time points, From date of enrollment to 2 years after surgery, specifically at pre-IMRT, end of IMRT, 1 months post-IMRT, and every 3 to 6 months during follow-up up to 2 years post-surgery|Extremity function scores, Evaluate the extremity function by MSTS (Musculoskeletal Tumor Rating Scale) and TESS (Toronto Extremity Salvage Score) forms at different time points, From date of enrollment to 2 years after surgery, specifically at pre-IMRT, end of IMRT, 1 months post-IMRT, and every 3 to 6 months during follow-up up to 2 years post-surgery|Pathological remission rate, Evaluate the tumor remission rate microscopically 2 weeks after operation, 2 weeks after operation|Local control, 2-year|Overall survival, 2-year
