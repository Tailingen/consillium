progression-free survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, Approximately 36 months
objective response rate, Complete response (CR)+Partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, 18months|overall survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, Approximately 36 months|adverse event (AE), adverse event according to NCI-CTCAE (5.0), Approximately 36 months
This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. A total of 73 patients with pathologically confirmed locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma would be enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, with 48 patients in the combination group and 25 patients in the control group. The combination group was treated with Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy combined with Endostar. The control group was treated with Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. The short term efficacy and side effects of these treatments would be evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year progression-free survival and overall survival would be analyzed. This data of this study might provide an alternative option for the treatment of Locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with higher efficacy and low toxicity.
