Anatomical Radiofrequency Ablation for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to investigate therapeutic outcomes of anatomical radiofrequency ablation for peripherally located small hepatocellular carcinoma using combined energy delivery mode and triple cooled-wet electrodes.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation
Technical success, Technical success addresses whether the index tumor was treated according to a predefined protocol and entirely covered by the ablation zone., Immediately after radiofrequency ablation|Local tumor progression rate, Local tumor progression, defined as the appearance of tumor foci at the margin of the ablation zone after the attainment of treatment success., 12 months after radiofrequency ablation
Complication after radiofrequency ablation, Post-radiofrequency ablation complications were defined as problems noted within 1 month after RFA as well as additional complications identified on follow-up imaging and judged to be likely caused by radiofrequency ablation., Immediately, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after radiofrequency ablation|Recurrence-free survival, Recurrence-free survival was defined as the interval between radiofrequency ablation and the date of any type of recurrence or the last follow-up date if there was no recurrence., 12 months after radiofrequency ablation
The aim of this study is to investigate therapeutic outcomes of anatomical radiofrequency ablation for peripherally located small hepatocellular carcinoma using combined energy delivery mode and triple cooled-wet electrodes.
