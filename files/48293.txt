Interest of a Weekly Consultation by a Medical Electro Radiology Manipulator (MERM) in Addition to the Follow-up by the Radiotherapist to Improve the Collection of Radio-induced Toxicities in Patients Undergoing Proton Therapy
To our knowledge, the investigators have not found any scientific article dealing with cooperation between radiation oncologists and medical radiation technologists in the context of monitoring patients undergoing radiotherapy. Cooperation protocols between health professionals are in progress but concern mainly technical procedures (ultrasound, laserthermal sessions).

This study aims to evaluate whether MERMs, after training by physicians, can monitor clinical signs (for usual well-described toxicities) during treatment via a dedicated consultation.

This approach participates in the development of new professions and cooperation protocols between health professionals. This mission of accompaniment on a dedicated time would make it possible to develop the caring role of the medical electroradiology manipulator.
