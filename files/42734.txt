Combined TACE, TKI/Anti-VEGF and ICIs as Conversion Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to the efficacy, prognosis, adverse effects, and factors for predicting therapeutic effects and clinical prognosis of combined therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Anti-VEGF antibodies or pan-target anti-angiogenic drugs, and anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibody for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma which initially unsuitable for the radical therapy, including resection, transplantation, or ablation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody|DRUG: Bevacizumab Biosimilar IBI305 plus sintilimab|DRUG: Bevacizumab plus Atezolizumab|DRUG: apatinib plus camrelizumab|DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Donafenib|DRUG: Regorafenib
Number of Patients Amendable to Curative Surgical Interventions, Number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions defined as number of patients receiving curative surgical resection, transplantation, or ablation after successful down-sizing of tumor(s) by intervention., from the date of first treatment to the date of last treatment, an average of 3 years
Response Rate measured by mRECIST criteria, Complete response (CR): Disappearance of any intra-tumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions; Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions.

Response rate is the rate of CR plus PR., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST v1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP): measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), Time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP): measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). Participants alive and without disease progression or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last radiographic assessment., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), measured from date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause. Participants alive or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last visit., from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Incidence of Study-Related Adverse Events, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the United States National Cancer Institute The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE 5.0)., from the date of first treatment to 90 days after last treatment, around 3 years and 90 days|Pathological response, Pathological response is assessed as the percentage of surface with non-viable cancer cells (represented by necrosis or fibrosis, the ultimate stage of necrosis) in relation to the total tumor area and will be equal to: 100% - viable cancer cells (%). If there are multiple tumors, the mean percentage will be used. Pathological complete response (pCR) is defined by the absence of viable tumor cells in any nodule., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years.|Disease control rate, Percentage of patients that had a CR, PR, or SD â‰¥ 6 months per mRECIST1.1., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years.|Duration of response, Defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause., from the date of first documented evidence of CR or PR to first documented sign of PD or death from any cause according to mRECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) after treatment, The life quality of every subject is assessed every 3 months during follow up according to the 45-item FACT-Hep questionnaire, which assesses generic HRQL concerns and disease-specific issues., 3 year
The multicenter, non-random, open and ambispective real-world cohort study is conducted at 4 research centers, including 3 centers (Hankou, Sino-French New District, and Optical Valley) of Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China) and one in the second affiliated hospital of Fujian Medical University (Quanzhou, China). It is estimated that 300 patients with advanced HCC will be enrolled in these 4 research centers. And it is planned to complete the enrollment within 1 year and it is expected that all enrolled subjects will reach the observation end point in 3 years. Radiological assessments are performed every two cycles over the course of treatment, then every 3 months within the first two years following the completion of treatment and every 6 months thereafter, until PD were recorded. All subjects are followed until death or lost to follow up.
