Phase 1 Study Evaluating VT1021 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an an open-label Phase I trial of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients must have recurrent or advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors) for which standard therapy offers no curative potential.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: VT1021

This is an open-label Phase I study of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will include a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. Upon determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened. The Dose Expansion Phase will include cohorts in ovarian, pancreatic, triple negative breast cancer, glioblastoma and CD36-high patients in order to confirm the tolerability of VT1021 against specific tumor types.
