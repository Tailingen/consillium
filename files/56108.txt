Evaluation of [18F]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT for PD-L1 Detection in Malignant Tumors
This phase I/II clinical trial evaluates the safety, efficacy, and prognostic potential of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging in assessing PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors, including glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and esophageal cancer. The primary aim is to establish the correlation between \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 uptake and PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues, while secondary objectives include evaluating its role in predicting clinical outcomes such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). By providing a non-invasive, quantitative, and reproducible method for assessing PD-L1, this study aims to refine patient stratification and improve the precision of immunotherapy decision-making.

Assessment of [18F]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging for PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors, This outcome measure will assess the safety and efficacy of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT in detecting PD-L1 expression in malignant tumors (glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and esophageal cancer). This will include evaluating the correlation between \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 uptake and PD-L1 expression as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)., Pre-treatment imaging, within 1-7 days before treatment initiation.
[18F]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging as a prognostic biomarker in malignant tumors, This outcome will evaluate the prognostic value of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging in predicting clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), based on tumor PD-L1 expression., Up to 1 year of follow-up for clinical outcomes (PFS, OS).
Correlation of circulating PD-L1 and exosomal PD-L1 with [18F]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging, This exploratory outcome measure will investigate the correlation between circulating PD-L1 levels, exosomal PD-L1, and \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging for assessing PD-L1 expression in tumors., Pre-treatment, and at follow-up visits (up to 1 year).
This phase I/II clinical trial is designed to explore the utility of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT in evaluating PD-L1 expression and its prognostic implications in patients with malignant tumors (glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and esophageal cancer). The study involves at least 20 patients (5 per tumor type) who will undergo a pre-treatment PET/CT scan following an intravenous injection of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2. The primary endpoints include the safety of the imaging protocol and the correlation between \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 uptake (SUV values) and PD-L1 expression determined through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Secondary endpoints explore the dynamic changes in SUV values in patients undergoing multiple scans and their relationship with clinical outcomes.

Scientific and Technical Rationale:

\[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 is a novel radiotracer with high specificity for PD-L1, enabling non-invasive imaging of its expression in vivo. This imaging approach complements traditional immunohistochemical methods by offering whole-body assessment, eliminating the need for repeated biopsies, and providing insights into the tumor microenvironment. This study seeks to validate its application in clinical oncology, bridging molecular imaging with biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies.

Study Methods:

Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 (adjusted for body weight), followed by a whole-body PET/CT scan after one hour. Images will be analyzed independently by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists. Tumor biopsies will be collected to measure PD-L1 expression via IHC, and blood samples will be assessed for circulating and exosomal PD-L1 biomarkers. For patients undergoing multiple scans, changes in radiotracer uptake will be tracked to monitor treatment response.

Data Analysis:

SUV values will be correlated with PD-L1 expression levels, clinical factors (e.g., tumor stage, histology), and patient outcomes (PFS, OS). Statistical analyses, performed using SPSS 29.0, will include primary correlations and secondary evaluations of imaging-based dynamic changes and their relationship with therapeutic efficacy.

Significance:

This trial will provide critical data on the feasibility of \[18F\]AlF-NOTA-PCP2 PET/CT imaging in clinical oncology. Its potential to stratify patients based on PD-L1 expression and predict therapy response could transform personalized cancer care, optimizing immunotherapy outcomes and minimizing unnecessary treatments.

Timeline:

Patient enrollment is expected to last 12 months, with an additional 3 months of follow-up for data collection and analysis.
