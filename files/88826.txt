Nutrition and Cancer Outcomes in Shaanxi Chemoradiotherapy
The study investigates the impact of nutritional status on the clinical outcomes of cancer patients in Shaanxi Province undergoing chemoradiotherapy. It focuses on understanding how diet and nutrition affect the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments.

Study Purpose and Objectives:

The Nutritional Status and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Common Malignancies (NCOM) study aims to assess how nutritional status influences treatment-related complications, functional performance, psychosocial well-being, and long-term survival in cancer patients. By capturing longitudinal data, the study seeks to identify modifiable risk factors and develop predictive models to support personalized nutritional interventions in oncology.

Study Design and Scope:

The study is being conducted at 11 tertiary hospitals across Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, and will recruit a total of 1,538 patients diagnosed with common malignancies. Participants are enrolled within 48 hours of hospital admission and followed at structured intervals over a five-year period: at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months, and then annually. Baseline and follow-up evaluations include demographic data, cancer-specific clinical characteristics, nutritional risk (mPG-SGA, NRS-2002), dietary intake (SDSAT), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), psychosocial health (HADS), physical activity, sleep quality (PSQI), and laboratory biomarkers.

Data Collection and Management:

Standardized procedures are used for anthropometric measurements, clinical assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. Nutritional support in and out of hospital, inflammatory biomarkers, liver and kidney function, and hematological indicators are systematically recorded. All data are managed via REDCap with built-in validation, routine audits, and centralized oversight.

Quality Assurance and Training:

Research personnel at each site undergo rigorous training to ensure consistency in data collection and patient evaluation. Supervisors oversee data quality, coordinate follow-up, and address missing data or protocol deviations.

Ethical Oversight:

The study adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center (Approval No. 2022-1373). Written informed consent is obtained from all participants. All personal data are deidentified and securely stored.

Expected Outcomes and Significance:

By establishing the temporal relationships between nutritional status and clinical outcomes, the NCOM study will provide high-quality evidence to support individualized nutrition-focused care. Results are expected to improve early identification of patients at risk, optimize nutritional interventions, reduce treatment-related toxicity, and enhance long-term cancer prognosis.
