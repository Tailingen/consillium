Ketogenic Diet Treatment Adjunctive to Radiation and Chemotherapy in Glioblastoma Multiforme: a Pilot Study
The goal of the present study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of 4:1 ketogenic diet administered adjunctively to standard radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with GBM in a prospective, randomized open label study.

survival time, We hope to achieve a substantial difference in both survival time and time to recurrence between the KD and non-KD treatment groups. Survival time of 3 years from treatment initiation and tumor progression-free time of 2.5 years from treatment initiation would be extraordinary compared to historical data., 6 months|time to radiological (MRI) tumor progression, MRI outcome will be assessed by the radiographic assessment in neuro-oncology criteria based on contrast-enhanced cranial MRI scans evaluating measureable disease, measured as the sum of products of perpendicular diameters (bi-dimensional measurements) of all measurable enhancing lesions and non-measurable disease., 6 months|The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events during treatment, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events changes in laboratory evaluations, changes in physical examination findings will be compared between the KD and control treatment groups, 6 months
Tolerability of ketogenic diet: Rate of early discontinuation of subjects from the diet because of intolerability, defined as unwillingness by the subject to continue with the diet because of possible diet related side effects, Rate of early discontinuation of subjects from the diet because of intolerability, defined as unwillingness by the subject to continue with the diet because of possible diet related side effects will be evaluated using descriptive statistics, 6 months
Primary aims of the study will be to 1) To evaluate efficacy of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. 2) To evaluate the safety of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. Secondary aim will be to evaluate tolerability of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme.

Participants will be seen at one, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after KG diet initiation, and then monthly until month 6 after diet initiation, then every 2 months until 2 years after treatment initiation or death, then every 3 months until 3 years after treatment initiation or death. KD treatment will last for 6 months or until exit criteria are met, whichever comes first. Exit criteria are the primary outcome measures, the first of either (a) MRI tumor progression or (b) death. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance, hunger scale scores, fasting serum glucose and BOH levels and occurrence of adverse events.

Patients with documented tumor progression will receive standard care for progressive GBM as directed by their treating oncologist, independent of the study.
