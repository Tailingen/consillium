Randomized Study to Compare CyberKnife to Surgical Resection In Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer remains the most frequent cause of cancer death in both men and women in the world. Surgical resection using lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling has been a standard of care for operable early stage NSCLC. Several studies have reported high local control and survival using SBRT in stage I NSCLC patients. SBRT is now an accepted treatment for medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC and patients with operable stage I lung cancer are entered on clinical protocols. The purpose of this study is to conduct a phase III randomized study to compare CyberKnife SBRT with surgery, the current standard of care for stage I operable NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: CyberKnife Stereotactic Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Overall Survival, The study power was calculated for sample size of 420 patients, enrolled over 7 years. The actual enrollment was 36 patients over 4 years. The study was therefore terminated due to lack of enrollment. The sample size does not allow to analysis of the primary outcome.

While the study data is not mature enough to evaluate the endpoints of the study, we will attempt to describe the results gleaned from the existing patient population., 3 years
Objectives:

Primary Goal: To compare overall survival at 3 years.

Secondary goals:

1. To compare disease specific survival at 3 years.
2. To compare 3 year progression free survival at the treated primary tumor site
3. To compare grade 3 and above acute and/or chronic toxicities.
4. To evaluate predictive value of pre and post treatment PET scan in clinical outcome.
