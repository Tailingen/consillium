Comparison of Laparoscopic Pylorus Preserving Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy
The aim of this study is to show better postoperative quality of life including lower incidence of dumping syndrome and comparable survival after laparoscopic pylorus preserving gastrectomy (LPPG), compared to laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) in patients with middle-third early gastric cancer

Participating Surgeons

Prior to this clinical trial, only the surgeons who are considered to have the standardization by review committee participated.

Patients Registration

It is required to ensure that the patients meet the inclusion criteria for this clinical trial, are free from any items of exclusion criteria, are explained about the participation in the clinical trial along with the informed consent forms.

After rechecking the patients with the registration check list by accessing the web-based randomized program provided from Seoul National University Hospital Medical Research Collaborating Center.

Each group 128 patients, total 256 subjects will be enrolled.

Randomization

The registration randomization should be done with 1:1 ratio for each researcher.

Baseline number (BN) should be provided to the subjects in the order of acquisition of informed consent form. Based on the subjects who are selected as the appropriate subjects in the end, the allocation number (AN) shall be provided in the order of randomized allocation table.

Procedure

Operations are performed according to the allocated group.
