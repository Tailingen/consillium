Tandem Auto-Allo Transplant for Lymphoma
Relapse remains a principle cause of treatment failure for patients with aggressive lymphoma after autologous transplantation. Non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation allows patients to receive an infusion of donor cells in an attempt to induce a graft versus lymphoma effect. This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the combination of autologous stem cell transplantation followed by non-myeloablative transplantation for patients with poor-risk aggressive lymphoma.

This is a phase II clinical trial investigating the feasibility, and efficacy of sequential autologous stem cell transplant followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant for patients with poor risk lymphoma. Patients will be enrolled onto the trial when eligible and undergo standard high-dose chemotherapy with the combination with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide followed by autologous stem cell transplant. After recovery of counts and clinical status, patients will then proceed to non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant using a fully matched related or unrelated donor.
