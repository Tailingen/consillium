Identification of Prognostic Factors and Role of Radiotherapy in Patients With Ewing Sarcoma
assess whether there is a correlation between some factors (age, sex, tumor volume, tumor site, chemotherapy-induced necrosis, radiation and biomarkers) and overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with Ewing sarcoma.

Identification of reliable prognostic factors could help to identify high-risk patients, which may require a different treatment and follow up.
