Economic Analysis of Early vs Delayed Therapy in Newly Diagnosed Asymptomatic High-Risk Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma:
Utilization data will be collected from all patients entered on the trial at Canadian centres from the time of registration until death, removal from study, or completion of 10 years of follow-up.

Protocol-specified health care utilization will be collected within trial case report forms, and will include study visits, radiographic assessments, laboratory investigations, and treatment administration.

Resource utilization data collection will be supplemented by a self-administered resource utilization form (Stanford SMRC) to document non-protocol specified utilization. This will include hospitalizations (including days in hospital), emergency room visits, and non-protocol specified ambulatory visits.

To determine incremental cost-utility ratio of an early novel therapy approach compared to a deferred approach in Canadian patients with high-risk CLL (enrolled in the randomized component of the SWOG S1925/CLC3 study)., Direct medical costs will be estimated from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. The denominator of the ratio will be expressed in quality-adjusted life years gained., 10 years
