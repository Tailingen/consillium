A Study to Learn More About How Well Treatment With BAY2927088 Tablets Works and How Safe it is in Participants Who Have a Solid Tumor With Mutations of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have solid tumors with HER2-activating mutations. Before a treatment can be approved for people to take, researchers do clinical trials to better understand its safety and how it works.

In this trial, the researchers want to learn how well BAY2927088 works in people with different types of solid tumors with HER2 mutations. These include tumors in the colon or rectum, the uterus and the cervix (lower part of the uterus), the bladder, and the biliary tract (includes gall bladder and bile ducts) as well as other types of solid tumors with the exception of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Solid tumors may have specific changes or mutations to a gene called human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2). This leads to the formation of an abnormal form of HER2 protein in the cancer cells, resulting in increased cell growth. The study treatment, BAY2927088, is expected to block the abnormal HER2 protein which may stop the spread of cancer.

The trial will include about 111 participants who are at least 18 years old. All the participants will take 20 mg of BAY2927088 as tablets by mouth.

The participants will take treatments in 3-week periods called cycles. These 3-week cycles will be repeated throughout the trial. The participants can take BAY2927088 until their cancer gets worse, until they have medical problems, or until they leave the trial.

During the trial, the doctors will take imaging scans of different parts of the body to study the spread of cancer and will check heart health using echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrocardiogram (ECG). The doctors will also take blood and urine samples and do physical examinations to check the participants' health. They will ask questions about how the participants are feeling and if they have any medical problems.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have decreased in size to have a short axis of \<10 mm. PR is defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.

RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1; BICR = blinded independent central review (BICR), From start of study intervention until the first documented progression, or death from any cause, or end of study (up to approximately 3 years), whichever comes first
Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from date of first documented complete or partial response (if confirmed) until the earliest date of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.
