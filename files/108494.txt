A Study to Test Radium-223 With Docetaxel in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects of using radium-223 along with docetaxel chemotherapy treatment versus using docetaxel alone. Earlier studies helped show that the combination is safe, but the combination has not been proven to work better than either drug alone. The goal of this study is to find out if combining docetaxel and radium-223 is better than giving either drug by itself.
