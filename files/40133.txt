Study of Brentuximab Vedotin And Bevacizumab In Refractory CD-30 Positive Germ Cell Tumors
This is a multi-center phase II study of brentuximab vedotin in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of refractory CD-30+ germ cell tumors (GCT) after disease progression on imaging and/or tumor marker progression documented by serially rising alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) measured on at least 2 consecutive visits and determined by treating physician to be clinically significant. Patients unable to receive 2nd line of platinum-based chemotherapy due to toxicity or refusal would also be eligible.
Germ Cell Tumor
DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Disease Response Rate as Defined by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Integrated With Tumor Marker Response., Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.

In addition to CT scan to assess for disease evaluation, whole body bone scans will be done for patients with known or suspected bone metastases to assess for bone lesions., 1 year
Number of Participants Experiencing Progression Free Survival, Incidence of Progression-free survival - Number of patients who were alive and did not have disease progression, 2 years|Number of Participants Who Were Alive at 2 Years - Overall Survival, Number of participants who were alive at 2 years (Overall survival), 2 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AE) and Severe Adverse Events (SAE), Safety/ toxicity of brentuximab vedotin, measured by incidence of AEs/SAEs, 2 Years
