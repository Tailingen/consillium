A Phase I/II Study of ASTX660 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-cell Lymphoma
Phase 1 (dose-escalation part): Investigate the tolerability and safety of ASTX660 in patients with r/r PTCL and r/r CTCL and determine the recommended dose (RD) for the Phase 2.

Phase 1 (ATLL expansion part): Evaluate the safety of ASTX660 at RD in patients with r/r ATLL.

Phase 2 : Evaluate the efficacy of ASTX660 at RD in patients with r/r PTCL.
