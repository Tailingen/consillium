Study of Niacin in Glioblastoma
This is a single institution Phase I-II study to evaluate the tolerability and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I) and efficacy (Phase II) of adding Niacin CRT™ to standard first line treatment (concurrent Radiation Therapy (RT) and Temozolomide (TMZ) following by monthly TMZ - AKA Stupp protocol) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type.
Glioblastoma IDH (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase) Wildtype
DRUG: Niacin CRT
Determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose, To evaluate and determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Niacin CRT added to concurrent radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB)., Up to 24 weeks after registration onto the study|Evaluating if Niacin CRT Improves Glioblastoma Survival Rates, To evaluate if adding Niacin CRT to current standard first line treatment of GB improves progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months., 6 months after determining the maximum tolerated dose which can last up to 24 weeks after registration onto the study
Effect of Niacin CRT in Peripheral Monocytes, To evaluate the effect of Niacin CRT in peripheral monocytes by comparing control monocytoid cells to those that have been treated with Niacin., From date of registration until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Response Rate Associated with Niacin, To determine the response rate associated with the investigational regimen., From date of registration until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Overall Survival Rate Associated with Niacin, To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the investigational regimen., From date of registration until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Quality of Life While on Study using EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaires, To determine Quality of Life (QOL) that will be evaluated throughout the study using EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires., From date of registration until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Quality of Life While on Study using EORTC BN-20 Questionnaires, To determine Quality of Life (QOL) that will be evaluated throughout the study using EORTC BN-20 questionnaires., From date of registration until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.
During the Phase I stage Niacin CRT™ dose will be escalated every 4 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD dose will be prescribed to patients during the Phase II stage.

During the Phase I study a sample of blood at baseline, at each level dose of Niacin CRT™, and every two months during the maintenance phase while on Niacin CRTTM will be sent to a lab to evaluate the peripheral activity of Niacin CRT™ in innate immune system cells. These samples will be taken at the time of routine standard of care lab work.

Based on prior clinical trials evaluating niacin extended release formulation for the management of dyslipidaemias there is vast experience on dose escalation of niacin. One of the main side effects is flushing that is ameliorated by escalating doses in intervals no shorter than 4 weeks and usually decreases with time.

Following this schema, there is no increase in dose coinciding with TMZ while administered in a 5/28 days schedule (given daily for 5 days of each 28-day cycle). This will not only improve tolerance but also will allow us to differentiate potential adverse events from chemotherapy from the ones from Niacin CRT™.
