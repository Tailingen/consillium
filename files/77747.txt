The purpose of the study is to evaluate an exercise program for individuals with hepatobiliary cancer planning for surgery.
Hepatobiliary Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Liver Metastases
BEHAVIORAL: Resistance Training|BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic Training
Percentage of Participants that Enroll and Consent - Enrollment Feasibility, Enrollment will be considered feasible if ≥60% of eligible and approached patients actually consent and enroll, Up to 12 Months|Percentage of Participants that Complete Study Assessments - Retention Feasibility, Retention will be considered feasible if ≥70% of participants complete study measures, Up to 3 Months|Adherence - Feasibility, Adherence will be based on participants attending ≥ 70% of tele-RT sessions on average and performing ≥ 70% of prescribed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, Up to 3 Months|Participant Self-Reported Musculoskeletal Injuries - Safety, The numerator of the safety variable will be the number of musculoskeletal injuries or adverse health events reported as "likely related" or "definitely related" the exercise programming and that caused at least some limitation of daily activity lasting more than 3 days. The denominator for the safety variable will be the number of exercise training sessions attended by the participant., Up to 3 Months|Exercise Training Safety, Number of participants that reported any exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries or other adverse health events (e.g.,extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, heat-related illness, cardiovascular events, changes in medication) incurred over the course of the intervention., Up to 3 Months|Participant Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability - Acceptability, Participants evaluation of feasibility and acceptability will be assessed with a questionnaire, adapted to fit the intervention. The questionnaire includes both Likert Scale and open-ended questions. An item-by-item basis and as average item score, with scores ≥4 ("agree" to "strongly agree") indicating acceptability. Open-ended responses will be analyzed qualitatively to inform intervention improvement., Up to 3 Months|Objective Physical Functioning and Fitness, Physical functioning and fitness will be assessed using the 30-second chair stand test,30-second arm curl test, and treadmill 6-minute walk test., At Baseline and Up to 3 Months|Participant Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI), Participants SMI will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans, At Baseline and Up to 3 Months|Participants Health-Related Quality of Life, Participants health-related quality of life will be measured using the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Survey, At Baseline and Up to 3 Months|Patient Activation, Participants patient activation will be measured using the Patient Activation Measure Short Form that is a valid and reliable 13-item scale for measuring patient's self-reported knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management., At Baseline and Up to 3 Months|Social Support, Participants social support will be measured using two scales, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (a valid 12-item measure assessing perceived adequacy of general social support from friends, family, and significant others) and the Social Influence Scale for Exercise (positive influences) (a valid 15-item measure assessing perceived adequacy of exerciserelated social support from friends, family, and experts), At Baseline and Up to 3 Months|Participant Self Reported Exercise, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, At Baseline and Up to 3 Months
