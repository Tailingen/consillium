Study of Ibrutinib in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Primary Central Nervous Lymphoma or Intraocular Lymphoma
The study is an open label, prospective, multicenter, phase II study which aims to define ibrutinib efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory primary central nervous lymphoma (PCNSL) or intraocular lymphoma (IOL) as measured by the disease control (DC) rate (complete response (CR) + uncertain complete response (Ru) + partial response (PR) stabilized disease (SD)) after 2 cycles of treatment according to International study group for PCNSL (IPCG) criteria.
