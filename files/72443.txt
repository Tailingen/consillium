Perioperative Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, Docetaxel and S-1 (LOTS) For Locally Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
The aim of the trial is to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of perioperative chemotherapy with leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel and S-1 (LOTS) in patients with locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who receive a curative surgery.

Pathological response, the tumor pathological response after pre-operative chemotherapy with LOTS plus curative surgery. The pathological response is defined by tumor evaluation of complete, partial or no response according to tumor regression grading (TRG), after pre-operative chemotherapy and curative surgery (Week 11 to 13)|Curative resection rate, the rate of margin-free (R0) resection in the absence of macro- or microscopic residual tumors remaining at the primary tumor bed, after pre-operative chemotherapy and curative surgery (Week 11 to 13)
Recurrence-free survival, the time interval from the initiation of trial treatment to disease recurrence, progression or death at any causes, From date of the initiation of trial treatment until the date of disease recurrence, progression or death at any causes, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Overall survival, the time interval from the initiation of trial treatment to death at any causes, From date of the initiation of trial treatment until the date of death at any causes, assessed up to 48 months|Disease control rate, the rate of patients remaining in disease control (complete, partial response and stable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines version 1.1) lasting at least three months, From date of the initiation of trial treatment until the date of recurrence/death events, withdrawal from the trial at any causes, termination/completion of the trial, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Protocol completion rate, the rate of patients completing the pre-specified protocol treatment, From date of the initiation of trial treatment until the date of recurrence/death events, withdrawal from the trial at any causes, termination/completion of the trial, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Treatment-emergent adverse event rate, the rate of protocol treatment-emergent adverse events, as graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, From date of the initiation of trial treatment until the date of recurrence/death events, withdrawal from the trial at any causes, termination/completion of the trial, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months
The study is an open-label, single-arm, single-country and multi-center phase II investigator-initiated trial. Patients with locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who enroll the trial will receive perioperative chemotherapy with LOTS (14 days as a cycle) 4 cycles every 2 weeks, followed by operation and another 4 cycles every 2 weeks post-operatively. The primary outcome is pathological response or curative resection rate. The secondary outcome includes recurrence-free survival, overall survival, disease control rate, protocol completion rate and adverse events.
