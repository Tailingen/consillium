Intervention to Improve Self-Care of Symptoms in Breast Cancer Survivors on Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy
Hormone responsive breast cancer is common and costly. Long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) improves breast cancer outcomes greatly, but, unfortunately, is commonly associated with physical and emotional concerns. I propose to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a behavioral intervention to facilitate problem identification, provide education, coaching for breast cancer survivors with symptoms while on AET. Therefore, the intervention intends to empower women to engage in better self-care and seek out resources they need, which, in turn, will lead to better symptom management.
