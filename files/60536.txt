Consolidation Therapy With Brentuximab Vedotin After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
The aim of the trial is to improve disease control after an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) for relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (rrHL, cHL) with consolidation therapy by Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) for up to one year.

The primary objective of the trial is to show efficacy of the experimental consolidative treatment strategy. Secondary objectives are to further evaluate efficacy, show safety and feasibility and perform correlative studies.
