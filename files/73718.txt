A Low AGE (Advanced Glycation End-product) Dietary Intervention for Breast Cancer Survivors
The scientific premise for this study is the known impact of overweight/obesity on breast cancer risk and outcomes, the association between advanced glycation end-products (AGE) and high fat, highly processed foods common in Western diets, and the preclinical evidence suggesting a link between AGE and breast cancer independent of weight. The association between dietary and serum AGE in breast cancer survivors and prognosis has not been previously evaluated. However, preclinical studies suggest that AGE may represent a novel, lifestyle-linked, modifiable, prognostic biomarker, which could be targeted through lifestyle (diet and exercise) and/or pharmaceutical interventions to improve breast cancer prognosis. The proposed study will pave the way for a large scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a low AGE diet on weight (BMI), known (IL-6 and CRP) and novel (AGE and RAGE) prognostic biomarkers, and ultimately on breast cancer prognosis.

Feasibility as measured by adherence rate, * Feasibility is a defined adherence rate of at least 80% of participants enrolled
* Diet adherence will be categorized by the study dietitian at the end of the study and before the results of AGEs in serum or any analysis of outcomes to avoid bias. Following each phone session with the participants, the dietitian will elicit answers to the following question: since the last call did the participant use any cooking methods they were advised to avoid for certain food items? (yes/no).
* The information will be used to calculate an adherence score. Adherence score is % phone calls of patient's report for full maintaining instructions to reduce AGEs.
* Very high adherence= ≥80%; good adherence= 60-80%; partial adherence= 40-60%; lack of adherence but intention to adhere more in the future= ≤40%; lack of adherence and no intention to adhere more= ≤40%, At study completion for all enrolled participants (estimated to be 15 months)|Feasibility as measured by dropout rate, -Feasibility is defined as a dropout rate of less than 20% of participants enrolled, At study completion for all enrolled participants (estimated to be 15 months)
Change in dietary AGE, -Dietary AGE is estimated based on analysis of the 3 day food record patients will complete at baseline and study completion. A specific dietary AGE value will be assigned to each item on the 3 day food recall by consultant and dietary AGE expert Jaime Uribarri, MD. This value is based on his published dietary AGE database which accounts for type of food, portion size and cooking methods., At baseline and study completion (24 weeks)|Change in serum AGE, * Blood specimens for serum AGE analysis will be shipped from the University of San Diego Biorepository to the Medical University of South Carolina to be analyzed in the lab of study team member and expert AGE analyst, Dr. David Turner.
* AGE (measured by the AGE metabolite carboxymethyllysine (ug/ml)) will be assessed in serum using commercially available 96-well format ELISA's and ROS detection kits (Cell Biolabs). Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML) is an AGE metabolite extensively studied in animal models of disease and with regard to food content., Baseline, week 12, and week 24|Correlation between serum AGE levels and BMI, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and BMI will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between serum AGE levels and serum CRP, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and serum CRP will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between serum AGE levels and IL6, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and IL6 will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between serum AGE levels and glucose, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and glucose will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between serum AGE levels and leptin, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and leptin will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between serum AGE levels and adiponectin, -The relationship between serum AGE levels and adiponectin will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and BMI, -The relationship between dietary AGE and BMI will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and serum CRP, -The relationship between dietary AGE and serum CRP will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and IL6, -The relationship between dietary AGE and IL6 will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and insulin, -The relationship between dietary AGE and insulin will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and glucose, -The relationship between dietary AGE and glucose will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and leptin, -The relationship between dietary AGE and leptin will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks|Correlation between dietary AGE and adiponectin, -The relationship between dietary AGE and adiponectin will be assessed using rank based correlation., Baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks
