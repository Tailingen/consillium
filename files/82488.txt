Dose-painting Radiation for LA-NSCLC
The study evaluated the effectiveness, safety and immune effects of dose-painting radiation in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage II
RADIATION: Dose-Painting Radiation
FPS, progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from enrollment to the first recording of disease progression as determined by RECISTv1.1, or to death due to any cause (whichever occurs first). PFS will be analyzed in the ITT analysis set., up to 3 years
ORR, Objective response rate, according to RECISTv1.1, the proportion of patients with CR or PR was determined. If the patient has not undergone a post-baseline assessment, it is considered unremission, up to 3 years|OS, OS(Overall survival) refers to the time from enrollment to the first recorded death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., up to 3 years|HRQoL, HRQoL uses EORTCQLQ-C30 to assess the overall health of patients. The post-baseline score of the treatment group was studied, and the score changes from the baseline were summarized descriptively., up to 3 years
Prognostic Biomarkers, The expression of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood, including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD8+CD28+ T cells, CD8+CD28- T cells, Treg cells, NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells;, up to 8 weeks|Prognostic Biomarkers, The changing trend of various cytokines in radiotherapy, including IL-6, IL-1b, IL-9, TNF-a, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-21, etc., up to 8 weeks
The study evaluated the effectiveness, safety and immune effects of dose-painting radiation in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary points contains ORR, OS, HRQoL, and safety.
