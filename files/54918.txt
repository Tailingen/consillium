Extended Use of Sodium Bicarbonate in Patients With Cancer
This pilot phase I trial studies the safety of long-term use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with cancer. Sodium bicarbonate may neutralize tumor acidity and as a result may inhibit the spread of the tumor to other parts of the body (metastases) and improve survival.
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: Sodium Bicarbonate
Adherence measured by the time to evidence of adherence failure, 120 days
Assessment of Metabolic Alkalosis by measurement of blood pH from basic metabolic panels, 120 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is feasible and well tolerated as measured by the proportion of subjects with first evidence of adherence failure.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is safe for long term consumption (90 days) as measured by blood pressure, resting pulse rate, and basic metabolic panels to assess metabolic alkalosis.

OUTLINE:

PHASE I (RUN-IN/ADJUSTMENT): Patients receive sodium bicarbonate orally (PO) dissolved in water thrice daily (TID) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. The dose may be adjusted as necessary.

PHASE II (LONG TERM): Patients continue to receive sodium bicarbonate PO TID or BID for a total of 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
