Molecular Imaging of EpCAM Receptors Using [123I]I-DARPIN-Ec1
The study should evaluate the biological distribution of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 in patients with lung and ovarian cancer

The primary objective are:

1. To assess the distribution of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 in normal tissues and tumors at different time intervals.
2. To evaluate dosimetry of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1.
3. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 after a single injection in a diagnostic dosage.

The secondary objective are:

1. To compare the obtained \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 SPECT imaging results with the data of CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies in lung and ovarian cancer patients.

The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging lung and ovarian cancer using \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1.

Phase I of the study:

Biodistribution of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 in patients with lung and ovarian cancer .

The main objectives of the study:

1. To evaluate the distribution of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 in normal tissues and tumors in patients with lung and ovarian cancer at different time intervals.
2. To evaluate dosimetry of \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single intravenous administration.
3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 after a single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

Additional research tasks:

1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the visualization of lung and ovarian cancer by SPECT using \[123I\]I-DARPIN-Ec1 with data obtained by CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) research of postoperative material.

Methodology:

Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of the labeled tracer.
