Prospective Pilot Trial to Assess a Multimodal Molecular Targeted Therapy in Children, Adolescent and Young Adults With Relapsed or Refractory High-grade Pineoblastoma
Children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or treatment refractory pineoblastoma (rPB) represent a group of patients with dismal prognosis for whom a recommended standard salvage therapy is currently not available.
Pineoblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Rapamycin
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), According to:

* Imaging criteria to

  * MRI, CT or
  * CSF evaluations or
* date of death of any cause, Time interval from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 52 weeks
Overall survival (OS), According to: questionnaire, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks|Response to the investigational treatment after 4 and 8 courses of I/T and 1-year-follow-up in the RIST treatment arm, According to:

• Imaging criteria to

* MRI, CT or
* CSF evaluations, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks|Duration until adequate response to this treatment regimen, According to:

• Imaging criteria to

* MRI, CT or
* CSF evaluations, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks|Assessment of quality of life (Lansky and Karnofsky Scores), According to:

Lansky and Karnofsky Scores, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks|Toxicity of this combination of drugs in children, adolescents and young adults with rNB - Assessment according to the latest version of the CTC criteria, Assessment according to the latest version of the CTC criteria. In particular due to the expected AE Profile:

Myelosuppressive measures (RBC, PLT units) Infectious complications Gastrointestinal problems, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks|Safety and tolerability of the investigational treatment - Assessment according to the latest version of the CTC criteria, Assessment according to the latest version of the CTC criteria. In particular due to the expected AE Profile:

Myelosuppressive measures (RBC, PLT units) Infectious complications Gastrointestinal problems, From the first course of the investigational treatment up to the end of the trial assessed to 52 weeks
The multimodal metronomic approach combining molecular targeted drugs (rapamycin and dasatinib) with conventional chemotherapy (irinotecan and temozolomide) will be investigated in a randomized fashion as new treatment strategy for patients with rPB. The intention is to assess the therapeutic benefit of molecular targeted drugs for the treatment of rPB.

The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide showed activity in the treatment of several solid organ tumors, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. In one study relapsed neuroblastoma (rNB) patients received a median of 5 courses of 5 days irinotecan and temozolomide every 3 to 4 weeks with a cumulative dose of 35% lower than in the RIST design. 33% had disease regression with 8% CR or PR. A phase II study in rNB also using irinotecan and temozolomide with a substantially lower intensity showed a response rate of 15%.

The combination of a mTOR inhibitor with a multi-kinase inhibitor demonstrated in preclinical studies a synergistic effect on cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and sensitization for radio- and chemotherapy. It is assumed that this combination of molecular targeted drugs with a tolerable conventional chemotherapy consisting of irinotecan and temozolomide can substantially improve the outcome of this patient population. A group of 20 rNB patients treated with the RIST therapy approach in a compassionate use setting showed an overall survival of 55% at a median of 80 weeks with a tolerable adverse event profile.
