Personalized Active Immunotherapy (Vaccine Therapy) and Sargramostim Given After Standard of Care Treatment With Rituximab and Chemotherapy for Initial Treatment With Lymphoma
The treatment being investigated is a patient- and tumor-specific therapy known as a personalized active immunotherapy. Personalized active immunotherapy is an attempt to use a person's own immune system to combat disease. Sargramostim (a.k.a. GM-CSF) is given together with the personalized active immunotherapy because it may increase the immune system's response and, therefore, aid in the effect of the personalized active immunotherapy.

This approach has previously been studied in patients with follicular Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other B-cell malignancies. Encouraging efficacy results and a favorable safety profile have been seen to date in these studies.
