Gefitinib With or Without Chemotherapy in Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multi-center phase III randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of Gefitinib alone and Gefitinib combination with Pemetrexed/platinum on patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutation type by intracranial PFS(iPFS),also PFS ,DCR and OS.The side effect is evaluated as well.
