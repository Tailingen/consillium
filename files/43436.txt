Study of Neoadjuvant Olaparib Monotherapy and Olaparib and Durvalumab Combination in HER2 Negative BRCAm Breast Cancer
This study to learn more about olaparib and olaparib plus durvalumab combination therapy and also to better understand the studied disease, breast cancer, and associated health problems.

Olaparib is a type of drug called a PARP (poly \[adenosine diphosphate-ribose\] polymerase) inhibitor. PARP inhibitors can destroy cancer cells that are not good at repairing DNA damage. Olaparib is also approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in other countries for treating women with BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer.

Durvalumab is a type of anticancer drug called immunotherapy that targets cancer cells by blocking the signal that prevents the immune system from seeing the cancer cell. Your immune system can then attack and kill the cancer cells. Durvalumab is approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after receiving chemoradiation therapy and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.

Some parts of this study are experimental, which means that durvalumab and the combination of olaparib and durvalumab are still in the development stage for the treatment of breast cancer, and they are not approved for treatment of breast cancer, except for use in research studies like this.

The investigation of olaparib as monotherapy or olaparib in combination with durvalumab in patients with early stage BRCAm, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative or ER-low, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy supports the ongoing effort to identify novel agents and new drug combinations that can improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival (EFS). In patients at a lower risk (T1b-c/N0) of disease recurrence and a higher chance for cure, monotherapy olaparib may provide adequate neoadjuvant treatment. In contrast, monotherapy olaparib may be inadequate neoadjuvant treatment for those patients at a higher risk (T2/N0 or T1/N1) of recurrence, and the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to the neoadjuvant regimen may improve long-term outcomes as was seen in KEYNOTE-522 and GeparNuevo. However, the risk of irreversible immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) of the endocrine system due to ICI use supports the use of ICIs only in the cohort of patients at higher risk for disease recurrence. For both the lower and higher risk groups, the study treatments have the potential for the development of de-escalation strategies in this disease setting where traditional chemotherapy regimens may be avoided altogether.

While assessment of the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and durvalumab is ongoing, there are sufficient safety data available to develop a safety and tolerability profile for the combination.
