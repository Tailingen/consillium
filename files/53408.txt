Study of the Efficacy of SBRT on Unresectable Peripheral Primary Tumor
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic lung radiation therapy after concomitant radiochemotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with peripheral primary tumor.

Evaluate in terms of local control rate at 6 months the addition of stereotactic radiotherapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of mediastinal non-resectable stage III NSCLC having a peripheral primary tumor.

The number of patients required in this multicenter prospective study is 70.

This is a prospective, multicenter, non comparative and non randomized study.
Non-small-cell Lung Carcinoma
RADIATION: SBRT
Local control rate, According to RECIST v1.1, 6 months after the end of SBRT
Overall survival, From date of inclusion until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months after the end of SBRT|Progression-free survival, From date of inclusion until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months after the end of SBRT|Safety (adverse events, assessed using the NCI-CTCAE v4 grading scale), Incidence of adverse events, assessed using the NCI-CTCAE v4 grading scale, Up to 2 years after the end of SBRT
Stereotactic radiotherapy or SBRT (Body Stereotactic Radiation Therapy) allows to irradiate with high dose limited lesions size with a local control surrounding of 80-98% and with a low level of toxicity.

We propose to realize a classic concomitant RT-CT for mediastinal irradiation and combine this treatment with stereotactic RT for peripheral primary tumor.

The estimated inclusion period is approximately 3 years.

Follow-up duration for each patient is 2 years. The duration of the research is 5 years.
