Effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) on Blood Count Recovery After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSPC) Transplant for Multiple Myeloma
Patients with Multiple Myeloma who are considered for high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation at the bone marrow transplant clinic at the Wilmot Cancer Institute (WCI) will be be approached to participate in this trial. Eligible patients who choose to participate will be randomized so that half receive one hyperbaric oxygen therapy session prior to hematopoetic stem cell infusion and half will not. All subjects will have their blood counts monitored closely and time to count recovery will be compared between the two groups.
Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy|OTHER: No Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
Time From Transplant to Neutrophil Count Recovery, Time from transplant to neutrophil recovery was measured as the first day of absolute neutrophil count \>=0.5 thou/ul after nadir., 100 days
Time From Transplant to Absolute Lymphocyte Recovery, 100 days|Number of Days of Granulocyte Colony-stimulating Factor, 100 days|Number of Units of Packed Red Blood Cells Received, 100 days|Length of Hospital Stay, 100 days|Percentage of Participants With Progressive Free Survival, A progressive response is defined as follows:

Increase of \> 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following:

Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 0.5 g/dL)6 Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \> 200 mg/24 h) Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels; the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase must be \> 10 mg/dL Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; the absolute percentage must be \> 10%7 Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder

Anyone who did not have a progressive response was considered as progression free survival., 1 year
