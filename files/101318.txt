Alpha/Beta T Cell and CD19+ B Cell Depletion in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Malignant Diseases
This study will assess the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of ⍺/β CD3+ T-cell and CD19+ B-cell depletion in allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and lymphoma. Subjects will receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant that has been depleted of ⍺/β CD3+ T-cells and CD19+ B-cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® system.

Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) incidence, Compare the incidence of grade II to IV aGVHD following allogeneic stem cell trasplantation utilizing α/β CD3+ T-cell and CD19+ B-cell depletion compared to historical controls by day +100, 100 days
Event-free survival, Evaluate the event-free survival, which is defined as being alive and without evidence of disease relapse, 2 years|Overall survival, Evaluate the overall survival, 2 years|Probability of hematopoietic engraftment, Determine the probability of hematopoietic engraftment, as measured by the presence of donor chimerism \>95% by day 100, 100 days|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia incidence, Determine the incidence of CMV viremia. Viremia is defined as \>1000copies/mL present on at least 2 weekly tests or requiring therapy., 1 year|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia incidence, Determine the incidence of EBV viremia. Viremia is defined as \>1000copies/mL present on at least 2 weekly tests or requiring therapy., 1 year|Adenovirus viremia incidence, Determine the incidence of adenovirus viremia. Viremia is defined as \>1000copies/mL present on at least 2 weekly tests or requiring therapy., 1 year|Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) incidence, Determine the incidence of PTLD, 1 year
