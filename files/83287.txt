IGF-MTX Conjugate in the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of utilizing the insulin-like growth factor-1-methotrexate conjugate, 765IGF-MTX for the treatment of advanced, previously treated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and oligoblastic acute myelogenous leukemia (oligoblastic AML or O-AML), including determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

This pilot study will evaluate use of IGF-Methotrexate conjugate (765IGF-MTX) in patients with advanced, previously treated MDS, CMML and O-AML. 765IGF-MTX at a dose of 0.20 to 2.5 Âµequivalents per kg is administered as an IV infusion over 1.5 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression, as assessed after 2 cycles, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will be confirmed by bone marrow studies performed at the end of cycles 2, 4, and 6 (each +/- 3 days).

Pharmacokinetics will be performed before and for up to 24 hours after drug administration on days 1 (for 24 hrs) and 15 (for 24 hrs) of cycle 1. Pharmacodynamic samples will be assessed pre-dosing on day 1 of cycle 1, pre-dosing on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and pre-dosing on day 15 of cycles 4 and 6.
