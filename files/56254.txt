A Phase I Study of RGT-419B in Patients With HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer or Other Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy of RGT-419B as monotherapy in Chinese patients with HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer and other advanced solid tumors.
