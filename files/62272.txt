Alteplase Through an Indwelling Pleural Catheter for the Management of Symptomatic Septated Malignant Pleural Effusion
This study investigates whether alteplase can help to improve pleural fluid drainage and dyspnea (breathlessness) in patients with non-draining malignant pleural effusion. Alteplase helps dissolve blood clots and is used to treat heart attacks, strokes, and clots in the lungs. Alteplase may help to control symptoms of breathlessness.

BIOLOGICAL: Alteplase|DRUG: Placebo Administration
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, through study completion; an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate dyspnea using the visual analog scale (VAS) scale at one week in patients with symptomatic septated malignant neoplasm of the pleural effusion (MPE) and a non-draining/inadequately draining indwelling pleural catheter (IPC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate dyspnea using the visual analog scale (VAS) scale at 48 hours (+/-12 hours) after treatment with intrapleural alteplase, in patients with septated MPE and a nondraining/inadequately draining IPC. In addition, complications, quality adjusted survival (calculated using the SF-6D to determine utilities and then integrating utilities over time to arrive at quality-adjusted survival), change in dyspnea (using the Borg score and VAS scale) at 1 week (+/- 1 day), 2 weeks (+/- 2 days) and every 4 weeks (+/- 2 days) after the intervention until IPC removal or death.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive alteplase instilled into the IPC which is capped for 1-2 hours before the catheter is drained.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo instilled into the IPC which is capped for 1-2 hours before the catheter is drained. Beginning 1 week later, patients may receive alteplase as in arm I.
