First-in- Human Imaging of Multiple Myeloma Using 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab, a CD38-targeting Monoclonal Antibody
The purpose of this study is to test 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab, a new imaging agent, to demonstrate its safety and ability to take pictures of the myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: 89Zr-daratumumab|DEVICE: PET/CT scans|OTHER: Blood draws
Average Absorbed Radiation Dose Estimates for Normal Tissues for Phase I Participants, Standardized uptake value (SUV) in various organs will be estimated from VOI analysis of clinical images and converted to activity-time curves. The areas under the activity-time curves will be derived by integration, converted to residence times, and used as input to the OLINDA/EXM dosimetry program to obtain absorbed dose estimates for normal tissues for all Phase I participants, regardless of study dose. Each participant underwent four PET/CT scans over the next 8 days, as well as blood chemistry and whole-body counts, to determine safety, tracer biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry. Because 89Zr has a half-life of 78 hours, only a single administration of tracer was needed to obtain all four PET/CT scans for all Phase I participants. Results were combined because all received the same dose of tracer., up to 19 months
