A Phase I Study of Nilontinib and Cetuximab in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase II dose of nilotinib when used in combination with cetuximab in the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic Kras wildtype colorectal cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

ABL1 has been suggested to play a key role in the resistance mechanism to anti EGFR therapy in cancer. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the safety and possible effect of targeting both EGFR using cetuximab along with ABL1 using nilotinib. Correlative studies assess the changes in tumor proteome in response to therapy and magnitude of ADCC as a marker of antibody activity.
