Benmelstobart Combined With Radiochemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment Iin ESCC
This study will explore the efficacy and safety of benmelstobart combined with radiochemotherapy compared to radiochemotherapy alone as neoadjuvant treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. It will also compare the effectiveness and safety of low-dose radiotherapy versus standard-dose radiotherapy in neoadjuvant regimens that include benmelstobart with concurrent radiochemotherapy. This research may provide more treatment options for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Benmelstobart+ Paclitaxel + Carboplatin+ Radiotherapy|DRUG: Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiotherapy
Pathological complete response (pCR), The ratio of patients with no residual cancer cells found in the pathological examination after treatment., 4 months
Major pathologic response (MPR), The percentage of subjects with a residual surviving tumor less than or equal to 10% after surgery., 4 months|Overall response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients achieved a best overall tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 4 months|Diseases control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients achieved CR+PR+ stable disease (SD)., 4 months|R0 resection rate, The proportion of subjects who could undergo R0 resection., 4 months|Disease free survival (DFS), 1y-DFS, The time from surgery to the onset of tumor recurrence or death from any cause., 15 months|Overall survival (OS), 1y-OS, The time from randomization to the time of death from any cause., 15 months|Surgical-related Indicators, Surgical Time: Defined as the duration from the start to the end of the surgery for the participant.

Intraoperative Blood Loss: Defined as the amount of blood lost by the participant during the surgery.

Postoperative Length of Stay: Defined as the duration from the end of surgery until the participant is discharged.

Perioperative Complication Rate: Defined as the percentage of participants who experience complications during the perioperative period among all participants., 1 months|Neoadjuvant Treatment Completion Rate, The percentage of participants who complete neoadjuvant treatment among all participants., 1 months|Adverse events, The severity of adverse events will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE 5.0 standard., 15 months
Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the benmelstobart plus radiochemotherapy group or the radiochemotherapy group. Surgery will be performed 6-8 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant treatment, with the primary endpoint being the rate of pathological complete response (pCR).
