A Study of 19-28z/IL-18 in People With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
Participants will have a sample of their white blood cells, called T cells, collected using a procedure called leukapheresis. The collected T cells will be sent to a laboratory to be changed (modified) to become 19-28z/IL-18, the CAR T-cell therapy that participants will receive during the study. Making the participants' study therapy will take about 2-4 weeks.
