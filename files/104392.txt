Identifying Mechanisms of Resistance to mTOR Inhibitors in Cancer
mTOR kinase is part of the mTORC1 complex that promotes cap-dependent protein translation, and part of the mTORC2 complex that activates AKT. Everolimus (Afinitor) is an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR that suppresses mTORC1 activity. Everolimus is FDA-approved for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer (in combination with exemestane), renal cell carcinoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), and neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET), and is currently being tested in ongoing clinical studies in other indications. While everolimus-based therapies elicit anti-cancer effects, most cancers ultimately progress and exhibit everolimus resistance. This study will evaluate genetic mechanisms of resistance to everolimus.
