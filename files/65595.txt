Orelabrutinib,Rituximab and Methotrexate in Newly-diagnosed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma(PCNSL)
This is a prospective single arm,multi-center,phase 2 study,and this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib,Rituximab combined with high-dose Methotrexate(RMO) as first line regimens in the treatments of newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma(PCNSL).Objective response and complete response are the primary endpoint.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib,Rituximab and Methotrexate
primary endpoint, Objective response rate(ORR) is the primary endpoint, Enrollment is expected to last for two year, followed up for five years
secondary endpoints, Complete rate(CR)、progression free survival(PFS)、overall survival(OS) are the secondary endpoints, Enrollment is expected to last for two year, followed up for five years
This is a single-arm,multicenter,phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib,Rituximab combined with high-dose Methotrexate(RMO) as first line regimens in the treatments of newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma.The response will be evaluated every 2 cycles.Patients who achieved complete remission(CR) or partial remission(PR) will receive further treatment,and there are 6 cycles of RMO regimen for the induction.The patients with stable disease(SD) or progressed disease(PD) will withdraw from the trial and receive salvage regimens.After total 6 induction cycles,the investigators evaluate the efficiency again.After 6 cycles,the patients who receive CR or PR,can tolerate Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation(AHSCT) will be candidates of high-dose chemotherapy and stem rescue.The patients who achieve CR or PR,cannot tolerate AHSCT will go to whole brain radiotherapy or Orelabrutinib maintenance.The patients with SD or PD will receive salvage regimen.
