Surgical Complications Related to Primary or Interval Debulking in Ovarian Neoplasm
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III C) and highly disseminated tumor will be randomized into two arms: primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy vs. neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). The primary end point is the evaluation and comparison of the surgical complications of primary surgery and IDS and the evaluation of the progression free survival (PFS)
Stage IIIC Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + Interval Debulking Surgery|PROCEDURE: Primary Debulking Surgery + Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Evaluation and comparison of early surgical complications of primary surgery and Interval debulking surgery., Early surgical complications:

* Blood transfusion
* Re-laparotomy
* suture dehiscence of laparotomy.
* Venous thrombosis
* Haemorrhage
* Death in the post-operative period
* Digestive fistula
* Urinary fistula
* Lymphocyst
* Fever
* Infection
* Pleural effusion
* Pulmonary embolism
* Pneumothorax
* Pneumonia, thirty days|Evaluation and comparison of late surgical complications of primary surgery and Interval debulking surgery, Late surgical complication:

* Death for every reason.
* Suture dehiscence of laparotomy with opening of the abdominal muscles
* Fever due to lymphocystis infection, six months|Evaluation of the progression free survival (PFS), Time from randomization until recurrence of tumor or death from any cause., Thirty-six months
Overall Survival, Time from randomization until death from any cause., Thirty-six months|Evaluation of Quality of life, Quality of life will be assess using the EORTC quality of life questionnaire core-36 (QLQC-30) and the ovarian cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-Ov28). These will be complete at study entry, at the 4th cycle or before IDS (in arm A and arm B, respectively), at the 6th cycle, and 6 months after the last cycle of chemotherapy., 12 months
