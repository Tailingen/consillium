Safety and Efficacy of Fruquintinib+FOLFIRI in RAS-mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Molecular subtypes make difference on clinicopathologic features and response to chemotherapy and targeted agents as well as prognosis. RAS mutation status, which accounting for approximately 35% to 40% of colorectal cancer patients, is an important factor considered in the standard of care for colorectal cancer. For RAS-mutated patients, no targeted driver gene drugs have been approved, and their treatment is based on the anti-VEGF/VEGFR pathway, and corresponding targeted drugs such as bevacizumab, aflibercept, and ramucirumab have also been successfully marketed for the treatment of CRC.

For RAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, the commonly used first-line treatment regimen is bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy, which is shown in previous studiesthat the PFS of 1st-line is about 10 months; the standard regimen of second-line treatment is FOLFIRI Â± bevacizumab, which is shown in previous study that the 2nd-line PFS is about 5 months with ORR 4%. There are a lot of unmet medical needs to improve the clinical efficacy in secondline-treatment of RAS-mutant patients.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Combination: Fruquintinib + FOLFIRI
Objective Response Rate, Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, From treatment initiation to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year|RP2D, RECIST v1.1, from first dose up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 1 year
Overall Survival, every two months follow up after EOT observation period at 30 days after the last medication, from treatment initiation until death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 year|Progress-Free Survival, every two months follow up after EOT observation period at 30 days after the last medication, from treatment initiation until death due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year|Duration of Response, every two months follow up after EOT observation period at 30 days after the last medication, from treatment initiation until death due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year|Safety and tolerance evaluated by incidence of AE, Incidence and severity of AE, from first dose to 30 days post the last dose|Safety and tolerance evaluated by incidence of SAE, Incidence and severity of SAE, from first dose to 30 days post the last dose
This is a prospective, single-armed, single-center phase Ib/II study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Fruquintinib combined with FOLFIRI in RAS-mutant patients who failed first-line standard therapy.
