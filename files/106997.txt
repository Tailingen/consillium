System for High-Intensity Evaluation During Radiotherapy
This quality improvement project will evaluate the implementation of a previously described intervention (twice per week on-treatment clinical evaluations) in a feasible fashion using a previously described machine learning algorithm identifying patients identified at high risk for an emergency visit or hospitalization during radiation therapy.
