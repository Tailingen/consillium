A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3602 Capsule
This is a study to evaluate the tolerance, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), phase II recommended dose (RP2D), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single and multiple oral doses of TQB3474 in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
