Solid Tumors in RASopathies
RASopathies are a group of syndromes, caused by variants of genes involved in the regulation of the Ras/MAP/ERK pathway. This intracellular transduction pathway profoundly affects embryogenic development, organogenesis, synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth.

RASopathies are characterized by multi-organ involvement, growth delay, premature aging and haemato-oncological manifestations.

Based on evidences provided by literature, cancer screening protocols are applied in some individuals affected by RASopathies, even though detailed information about prevalence and molecular pathogenesis of such tumors is still not clearly elucidate.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Molecular characterization of solid tumor in RASopathies
Prevalence of solid tumors in RASopathies, To detect prevalence of solid tumors in monocentric cohort of RASopathies, 5 years
Molecular characterization of solid tumors in RASopathies, NGS analysis on tumor tissue samples, 5 years
To define the prevalence of solid (non-haematological) neoplasms in a monocentric cohort of patients affected by RASopathies To perform Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis on tissue samples to preliminarily characterize the molecular pathogenesis of solid tumors in these patients' categories.
