Dose Escalation Study of RAD001 in Combination w/Chemotherapy & Radiation in Patients With NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to understand the effects (good and/or bad) of the addition of RAD001 to standard radiation and chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: RAD001 (in addition to standard radiation and chemotherapy)
To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of RAD001 when administered in combination with chemotherapy and radiation., 9/2011
To evaluate the preliminary clinical benefit rate after administration of RAD001 in combination with chemotherapy and radiation., 3/2012
In oncology, clinical experience with RAD001 has been based on a number of phase I and II studies with single agent RAD001 as well as phase Ib and II studies of RAD001 in combination with other chemotherapeutic and molecular targeted agents, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and erlotinib among others. More recently, a phase III trial of single agent RAD001 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had failed therapy with VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors was completed. Clinical experience for indications other than oncology comes from single dose studies in healthy volunteers, and studies in solid organ transplant patients, where RAD001 was administered with other immunosuppressive agents.
