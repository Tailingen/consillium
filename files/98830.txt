A Non-interventional Prospective Study of Early HER2-negative High-risk Breast Cancer and BRCA1/2 Mutations Prevalence in RussiA
(Neo)adjuvant treatment approaches and outcomes
Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in high-risk early HER2-negative breast cancer, The prevalence of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in high-risk early HER2-negative breast cancer will be presented as a number of missing and non-missing records, median, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval for median, 3 years
To describe treatment approaches of high-risk early HER2-negative breast cancer in routine practice in the general population, in the BRCAm and non-BRCAm population, Demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment approaches will be summarized using descriptive statistics., 3 years|To determine invasive disease-free survival for high-risk early HER2-negative breast cancer in the general population, in the BRCAm and non-BRCAm population, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median (95% CI) IDFS and OS for the total sample and all subgroups. Cumulative survival curves will be created using Kaplan-Meier analysis, 3 years|To determine 3-year OS for high-risk early HER2-negative breast cancer in the general population, in the BRCAm and non-BRCAm population, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median (95% CI) IDFS and OS for the total sample and all subgroups. Cumulative survival curves will be created using Kaplan-Meier analysis, 3 years|To determine the prevalence of HRR mutations in HER2-negative breast cancer, Testing the archived tumour specimen and blood for BRCA1/2m and HRRm status, 3 years|To determine invasive disease-free survival in the HRRm population (including BRCA1/2), Testing the archived tumour specimen and blood for BRCA1/2m and HRRm status, 3 years|To evaluate concordance between P53 expression and BRCAm, Testing the archived tumour specimen and blood, 3 years|To assess the quality of life in patients with various types of adjuvant systemic therapy, completed WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire will be assessed, 3 years
