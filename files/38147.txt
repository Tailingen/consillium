Metabolic Insights: the Impact of F-18 FDG PET/CT in Adult Lymphoma
1. To assess staging accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT in lymphoma
2. Determine the role of F-18 FDG PET/CT in monitoring treatment response and detecting relapse or residual disease in lymphoma
3. To evaluate FDG uptake correlation with histopathological subtypes and immunophenotypes as a prognostic factor.

DEVICE: 18 FDG
primary, Treatment Response Using Deauville Score for FDG Uptake Evaluation:

Evaluate FDG uptake using the 5-point scale:

1. No uptake above background
2. Uptake ≤ mediastinum
3. Uptake \> mediastinum but ≤ liver
4. Moderately increased compared to liver
5. Markedly increased compared to liver X: New uptake, unlikely related to lymphoma, 3 years
secondary, Detect early relapse or residual disease using F-18 FDG PET/CT using SUVmax, maximum standardized uptake value(g/mL ), 3 years
The incidence of lymphoma in Egypt has been increasing in recent years, with a noticeable rise in both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. This increase is due to better healthcare, awareness, and diagnostic advancements. Risk factors include infections, lifestyle, genetics, and immune system issues.

Lymphoma is now the fourth most prevalent cancer among Egyptian adults, accounting for approximately 8.4% of all new cancer cases annually. As the burden of lymphoma grows, it becomes essential to develop effective strategies for its diagnosis and management.

Flurodeoxyglucose F-18 (F-18 FDG) is a radiolabeled glucose analog that accumulates in metabolically active cells, such as lymphoma cells, making F-18 FDG positron emission tomography / computed tomography scan (PET/CT) highly sensitive for detecting malignant lesions. It plays a key role in staging lymphoma by assessing the extent of disease spread.

Additionally, F-18 FDG PET/CT is essential for assessing treatment response, detecting relapses early, and evaluating the prognosis of patients, offering prognostic value by evaluating residual disease and predicting recurrence. Its ability to monitor disease progression and detect recurrent lymphoma provides critical insights that guide therapeutic decisions and long-term outcomes.
