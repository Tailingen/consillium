Efficacy and Safety of Selumetinib in Adults With NF1 Who Have Symptomatic, Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas
A global study to demonstrate the effectiveness of selumetinib in participants with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas.
Neurofibromatosis 1|Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN)
DRUG: Selumetinib|OTHER: Placebo
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Arm A versus Arm B, ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response as determined by ICR per REiNS criteria, Approximately 3 years
Change in chronic target PN pain intensity from baseline for Arm A versus Arm B as assessed using a PRO questionnaire, Difference in mean change from baseline in chronic target PN pain intensity score between Arm A and Arm B, obtained using an NRS-11 scale to assess pain intensity of a target plexiform neurofibroma, Approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DoR) for Arm A, DoR will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response (which is subsequently confirmed) until progression by ICR per REiNS criteria or death due to any cause, Approximately 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) for Arm A, PFS will be defined as the time from first selumetinib dose until date of disease progression by ICR per REiNS criteria or death due to any cause, Approximately 3 years|Time to progression (TTP) for Arm A, TTP is defined as the time from the date of first selumetinib dose until date of disease progression by ICR per REiNS criteria, Approximately 3 years|Time to Response (TTR) for Arm A, TTR is defined as the time from date of first selumetinib dose until the date of objective response by ICR per REiNS criteria, Approximately 3 years|Target PN volume for Arm A vs Arm B, Difference in best percentage change from baseline in target PN volume by ICR per REiNS criteria, Approximately 3 years|Physical functioning assessed using PROMIS physical function items, Difference in change from baseline between Arm A and Arm B, Approximately 3 years|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) outcomes assessed using PlexiQoL, Difference in change from baseline between Arm A and Arm B, Approximately 3 years
Safety and tolerability of selumetinib as assessed by number and grade of adverse events, Adverse events are defined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, Approximately 3 years|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib for exposure-response analyses, Selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib plasma concentrations assessment, Approximately 3 years
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 arm multicentre, global Phase III study to assess the efficacy and safety of selumetinib compared with placebo in adult participants with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN.
