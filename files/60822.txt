Single Versus Multiple Deployment of Metallic Stents for Inoperable Malignant Hilar Biliary Obstruction
In Bismuth II-IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients with a predicted survival of longer than 3 months, metallic stent performance is superior to plastic stenting for palliation with respect to outcomes and cost-effectiveness. However, the optimal stent type and the extent of drainage are issues that remain to be definitively decided. The optimal endoscopic management strategy is contentious. The investigators conduct the present study to prospectively in multi-centers compare unilateral (single) with bilateral (multiple) deployment in inoperable malignant biliary obstructions to clarify the clinical outcomes of these two deployment methods using metallic stents.

DEVICE: Metallic stent deployment in hilar obstruction
Reintervention rate when stents occluded, When the stents occluded after successful single or multiple stent deployment, the outcome measure is assessed., 2 years
Technical success of single or multiple stents, When the bilirubin level decrease more than 50% within one week or 75% within one month., 1 month

The investigators conduct the present study to prospectively in multi-centers compare unilateral (single) with bilateral (multiple) deployment in inoperable malignant biliary obstructions to clarify the clinical outcomes of these two deployment methods using metallic stents.

First as an unilateral or bilateral stent will be deployed according to criteria.

In bilateral group, stent-in-stent or side-by-side deployment will be included.
