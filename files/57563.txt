"Serratus Anterior Plane Block" Versus "Serratus Posterior Superior Plane Intercostal Plane Block" for Patients Undergoing Breast Surgery
The Serrato Posterosuperior Block (SPSIP) is a recently discovered technique that provides analgesia to the hemithorax, shoulders, neck and back. At an anatomical level, it has been seen that this technique allows the diffusion of local anesthetic starting from C7 proceeding dorsally up to T10 by sectioning the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid and erector spinae muscles. The serratus anterior block (SAPB) is a technique that allows local anesthetic to be injected between the serratus anterior muscle and the intercostal muscles (deep plane) or between the latissimus dorsi muscle and the serratus anterior muscle (superficial plane), also providing analgesia at of the chest wall. This study aims to compare the analgesic efficacy of SPSIPB and SAPB in patients undergoing radical mastectomy for breast cancer
Pain, Postoperative|Breast Cancer|Anesthesia|Mastectomy
PROCEDURE: Serratus Posterior Superior Plane Intercostal Plane block|PROCEDURE: Serratus Anterior Plane block
Pain at 0 hours after surgery, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether there is a difference between SAP block and SPSIP block at 0 hours after surgery at rest measure with visual analogic scale (0-10), 0 hours after surgery
Pain at 6 hours after surgery, Evaluate whether there is a difference between SAP block and SPSIP block at 6 hours after surgery at rest measure with visual analogic scale (0-10), 6 hours after surgery|Pain at 12 hours after surgery, Evaluate whether there is a difference between SAP block and SPSIP block at 12 hours after surgery at rest measure with visual analogic scale (0-10), 12 hours after surgery|Pain at 24hours after surgery, Evaluate whether there is a difference between SAP block and SPSIP block at 24 hours after surgery at rest measure with visual analogic scale (0-10), 24 hours after surgery|Intraoperative Opioid consumption, Intraoperative opioids consumption (remifentanyl measured as mcg/kg), During the surgery(From patient intubation to patient extubation)|Postoperative Opioid consumption, Postoperative use of rescue analgesics (measured as yes or no), From extubation to 24 hours post-enrollment|Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting, Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting defined as patient reporting nausea and vomiting or requiring drugs for nausea or vomiting, From extubation to 24 hours post-enrollment
