Serum Biomarker Levels Improvement in Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome: Impact of Metformin Compared to Healthy Controls
The goal of this interventional study is to assess the effect of drug metformin in improving the fertility hormones and reducing the inflammatory hormones in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. We wish to answer the question whether metformin is necessary to improve PCOS symptoms versus simple lifestyle modification.

Participants once diagnosed with PCOS will be given metformin to be sued for 8 weeks. They will be asked to provide blood samples on day 0 and after 8 weeks of metformin use. The blood sample will be used to measure the hormonal and inflammatory profile. In addition, they will be required to compete a questionnaire regarding symptoms such as decrease in facial hair growth, improvement in menstrual cycle etc.
