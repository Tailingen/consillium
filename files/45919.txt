Cardiac Outcomes With Near-Complete Estrogen Deprivation
The purpose of this research study is to understand what effect near complete estrogen deprivation (NCED) therapy has on the heart in breast cancer patients. Investigators want to understand if NCED changes how the heart works.

Change in Myocardial Blood Flow - 24 months, Change in myocardial blood flow will be measured by adenosine CMR imaging. Comparisons will be made using longitudinal mixed models to examine within- and between- group effects on outcomes measured. These mixed models will include fixed effects for group (NCED/TNBC), baseline assessment of the outcome of interest (i.e. MPR) to adjust for potential risk-factor profile differences between groups and the time point at which the measurements are made relative to the baseline assessment., At baseline and at 24 months
Change in Myocardial Blood Flow - 12 months, Change in myocardial blood flow will be measured by adenosine CMR imaging. Comparisons will be made using longitudinal mixed models to examine within- and between- group effects on outcomes measured. These mixed models will include fixed effects for group (NCED/TNBC), baseline assessment of the outcome of interest (i.e. MPR) to adjust for potential risk-factor profile differences between groups and the time point at which the measurements are made relative to the baseline assessment, At baseline and at 12 months|Change in Stiffness - Thoracic Pulse Wave Velocity, Stiffness will be assessed by thoracic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and distensibility using CMR imaging. Comparisons will be made using longitudinal mixed models to examine within- and between- group effects on outcomes measured. These mixed models will include fixed effects for group (NCED/TNBC), baseline assessment of the outcome of interest (i.e. MPR) to adjust for potential risk-factor profile differences between groups and the time point at which the measurements are made relative to the baseline assessment, At 12 months and at 24 months|Change in Myocardial Perfusion Reserves, Myocardial perfusion reserve will be measured with adenosine CMR imaging. Myocardial perfusion reserve is calculated as the percent change in myocardial blood flow between stress and rest perfusion imaging. Comparisons will be made using longitudinal mixed models to examine within- and between- group effects on outcomes measured. These mixed models will include fixed effects for group (NCED/TNBC), baseline assessment of the outcome of interest (i.e. MPR) to adjust for potential risk-factor profile differences between groups and the time point at which the measurements are made relative to the baseline assessment, At 12 months and at 24 months|Number of Women at High Risk for Developing Deficits in Myocardial Blood Flow, The predictive models developed to identify premenopausal women treated with an aromatase inhibitor for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer at highest risk for developing deficits in myocardial blood flow will incorporate variables related to demographics, medical history, and additional clinical variables., At 24 months|Overall Survival, Disease outcomes will be monitored, including invasive-breast cancer free survival, at the annual visits throughout the study. With any change in anti-cancer therapy the specific reason for the change will be requested., Up to 5 years|Difference in Stress CMR Myocardial Blood Flow, Total coronary plaque burden from coronary computed tomography angiography will be measured to assess the difference in heart function, including cardiac volumes and mass and blood flow in both groups., At baseline and at 24 months
Primary Objective: To determine the 24-month difference in stress myocardial blood flow during adenosine stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in premenopausal women treated with near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without near complete estrogen deprivation for hormone receptor-negative breast cancer.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the 12-month difference in stress myocardial blood flow during adenosine stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in premenopausal women treated with near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without near complete estrogen deprivation for hormone receptor-negative breast cancer.
* To determine the 12-month and 24-month difference in aortic stiffness (thoracic pulse wave velocity and distensibility) with CMR in premenopausal women treated with an near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without near complete estrogen deprivation for hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer.
* To determine the association of stress CMR myocardial blood flow with total coronary plaque burden from coronary computed tomography angiography (at baseline and 24 month difference) and difference in variability in these measures in premenopausal women treated with near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without near complete estrogen deprivation for hormone receptor- negative breast cancer.
* To determine the 12-month and 24-month difference in myocardial perfusion reserve in premenopausal women treated with near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and in premenopausal women treated without near complete estrogen deprivation for hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer.
* To develop predictive models to identify women at highest risk for developing deficits in myocardial blood flow in premenopausal women treated with near complete estrogen deprivation for high-risk hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
* To monitor disease outcomes, in particular invasive-breast cancer free survival and to assess if any changes in anti-neoplastic therapy occur on the basis cardiovascular diagnoses generally or specifically due to CROWN study results.
