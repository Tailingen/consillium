Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs including all Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades (for both increasing and decreasing severity) and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; results of physical examinations, regular measurement of vital sign measurements, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), as detailed in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. The relationship of AEs to treatment was based on investigator judgment. Details of AEs and SAEs are provided in the reported adverse event section., Date of first dose of study treatment till 30 days after the last dose, assessed up to 1 year|Objective Tumor Response, A response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) was assigned by the investigator as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node had to be reduced in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. PD was defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment start or the appearance of one or more new lesions. CR or PR was confirmed no less than 4 weeks after first observation of the response. For SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. SD is defined as lasting at least 5 weeks., Baseline to first date of documented CR, PR, SD, or PD, assessed up to 1 year
The study comprised of two phases, the Study Phase and Extension Phase. Participants received 14C-lenvatinib on Day 1 of the Study Phase. Thereafter participants were given daily oral doses of 24 mg of lenvatinib over a 28 day cycle. During the Study Phase, participants received an initial single dose of 14C-lenvatinib oral patient dosing solution containing 24 mg of lenvatinib as anhydrous free base and radioactivity of 100 mCi (3.7 MBq) on Day 1, followed by collection of blood, urine and feces samples for pharmacokinetic analysis between Day 1 and Day 8, with a discharge visit on Day 8. Participants then entered the Extension Phase of the study to continue to receive once daily oral administration of non-radiolabeled lenvatinib at a dose of 24 mg. Each 28-day dosing period will be considered one treatment cycle.
