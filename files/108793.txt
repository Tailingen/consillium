Imaging Markers of Subclinical Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer
This research study is evaluating the use of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) as a method of detecting early signs of damage to the heart that can be associated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer.

OTHER: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR)|OTHER: Echocardiogram (ECHO)
Cardiotoxicity, Cardiotoxicity as measured by changes in left ventricular ejection fraction within one-year of completion of treatment, 1 year after completion of treatment
One of the side effects observed in breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-based treatment is heart complications in which the heart muscle is weakened and no longer able to pump sufficient amounts of blood throughout the body. This complication can lead to the following symptoms: shortness of breath on exertion, swollen ankles and feet, lack of energy and a reduced capacity to carry out day-to-day activities.

This research study is focused on identifying the early signs of such heart complications using CMR, which may allow preventative treatment options to be made available in future.
