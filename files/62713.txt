A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Nitric Oxide Injection Into Unresectable Solid Primary or Metastatic Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study comprised of a screening period, a single treatment session, an evaluation period of 21Â±3 days, and safety and survival follow-up period of up to 12 weeks post-treatment.

DRUG: Nitric Oxide 25,000 ppm|DRUG: Nitric Oxide 50,000 ppm|DRUG: Nitric Oxide 100,000 ppm|DRUG: Nitric Oxide selected dose
Incidence of AEs, SAEs and DLTs (safety) parameters., The incidence and characteristics of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and changes in assessed safety parameters. Toxicity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, up to12 weeks from injection
Anti-tumor activity of a single intratumoral gNO injection at all administered doses, The anti-tumor activity of a single intratumoral gNO injection will be measured per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and secondarily immune-related RECIST (iRECIST)., up to Day 21 from injection
Assessment of predictive biomarkers for anti-tumor activity of a single intratumoral gNO injection, Measurement of blood immune biomarkers levels, up to Day 21 from injection
The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to initiate clinical development of gNO in patients with unresectable cutaneous or subcutaneous primary or metastatic solid tumors that are not amenable or have failed standard treatment, for which no therapy of proven efficacy exists, or which has progressed despite standard therapy. This study of gNO treatment will consist of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part to establish a safe and tolerable dose of gNO in patients with primary or metastatic unresectable cutaneous or subcutaneous solid tumors (Part A), and a dose expansion phase (Part B) which may be initiated at the Sponsor's discretion after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or optimal biological dose (OBD) (or recommended Phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]) has been determined in the dose-escalation phase (Part A). This study will be the basis for future studies.
