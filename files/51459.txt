Circulating Tumor DNA in Surgical Lung Cancer Patients
Conduct a prospective study to detect the change of ctDNA of surgical lung cancer patients.
Lung Neoplasms
Effect of surgery on ctDNA of lung cancer patients, Changes of blood ctDNA of lung cancer patients before and after surgery., before surgery and 7days after surgery
Studies have shown the feasibility of detecting mutation status by blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in lung cancer patients.

The investigators plan to test the blood ctDNA in surveillance of surgical lung cancer patients. And evaluate the correlation between ctDNA level with tumor relapse or metastasis.
