Rituximab and Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The investigator(s) hypothesize that Rituximab together with combination chemotherapy, followed by Rituximab maintenance therapy, will provide better disease control with improved response rates and overall survival in patients with previously untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).
Mantle-Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: G-CSF|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Mesna|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Vincristine
Rate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Rate of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in study participants. PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to the earliest one of the following events: relapse (in patients who achieve complete response), disease progression (in patients with partial response or stable disease), or death. PFS will be evaluated by treating physician from staging Computed Tomography (CT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans., Up to 8 years
Rate of Overall Survival (OS), Rate of Overall Survival (OS) in study participants. OS is defined as the length of time from the start of treatment until death from any cause. OS will be evaluated by treating physician from staging CT or PET scans, Up to 8 years|Rate of Response to Protocol Therapy, Rate of response to protocol therapy in study participants. Response is defined as complete response (CR), complete response/unconfirmed (CRu) or partial response (PR) to protocol therapy according to criteria assignable to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Response assessment will be done by CT and Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, if clinically indicated., Up to 8 years|Rate of Treatment-Related Toxicity in Study Participants, Rate of adverse events, serious adverse events and other toxicities related to protocol therapy in study participants, as evaluated by treating physician., Up to 8 years
