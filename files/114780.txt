Biomarker Analysis of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Undergoing Bipolar Androgen Therapy
This is an open label phase II, single-arm, biomarker multi-institutional pilot study. Men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and at least one prior second generation AR-targeted therapy (either abiraterone or enzalutamide) will be enrolled in this study. All patients will receive treatment with testosterone cypionate 400 mg, intramuscular, every 28 days for a maximum of 3 cycles or limiting toxicity, if it occurs before the end of the scheduled therapy. After 3 cycles of BAT (12 weeks), patients may continue receiving this therapy off study at the discretion of the treating physician, if clinical/radiographic benefit.

During the study period, patients will have plasma collected for cell-free tumor DNA analysis and CTC ARV7 status and also will perform 68Gallium-PSMA PET at baseline and then every 6 weeks.
