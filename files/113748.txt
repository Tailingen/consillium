Durvalumab (MEDI4736) With or Without SBRT in Clinical Stage I, II and IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the effectiveness of the drug durvalumab (MEDI4736) with or without stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as treatment for stage I (tumors \> 2cm), II, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to surgery and one year following surgery.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Durvalumab|OTHER: Durvalumab plus SBRT
Number of Subjects With Major Pathological Response (MPR), MPR is defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor in the resected specimen., Durvalumab start date to surgical resection, up to 10 weeks
Kaplan-Meier Disease-Free Survival Proportion at 2 Years, Disease recurrence or death from any cause assessed using history, physical examination and CT scanning, histologically or cytologically confirmed whenever possible., From date of Durvalumab start date until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed every 6 months for 2 years.|Objective Clinical Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by PET/CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD), \>=20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Treatment day 1 up to weeks 6-7
Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v. 4.0, Adverse events ≥G3 in both arms with and without possible or probable attribution to study drug and graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0, Up to 72 weeks
This is a randomized open label phase II trial of preoperative anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab with or without concurrent non-ablative radiation followed by surgical resection and postoperative monthly maintenance durvalumab for twelve months, following standard of care postoperative therapy.
