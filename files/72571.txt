Number of patients with dose-limiting toxicity, A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells, which is irreversible, or life threatening or CTCAE Grade 3-5. Assessed at all visits., 28 days up to 2 years|Frequency of ARTEMIS T cell treatment-related adverse events, Include but not limited to: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and other gastrointestinal symptoms; Fatigue, hypotension, respiratory distress; Tumor lysis syndrome; Cytokine release syndrome; Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver and kidney dysfunction. Assessed at all visits., Time Frame: 28 days up to 2 years

The molecular target for ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A02 complexed with a HLA-A02-restricted peptide of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on 60-80 percent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ARTEMIS™2 is a second generation ARTEMIS™ receptor engineered with a human antibody domain against the anti-HLA-A02/AFP complex. This clinical study evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells in patients with HCC who have no available curative therapeutic options and a poor overall prognosis.

Patients with lesion(s) localized in liver will be enrolled in the intra-hepatic artery (IA) arm or Intratumoral Injections arm, with the ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells administered via intrahepatic artery catheter. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis will be enrolled in the intravenous (IV) arm, with the ET1402L1-ARTEMIS™2 T-cells administered through intravenous infusion.
