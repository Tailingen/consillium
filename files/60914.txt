Phase I/II Trial of Pembrolizumab and Androgen-receptor Pathway Inhibitor With or Without 225Ac-J591 for Progressive Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a phase I/II study investigating the combination of 225Ac-J591 (a drug that can deliver radiation to prostate cancer cells) with pembrolizumab (immunotherapy, a drug that increases the immune system's ability to destroy cancer cells). This study will assess whether 225Ac-J591 + pembrolizumab + androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) is more effective against prostate cancer than pembrolizumab + ARPI alone.

Proportion of patients with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) following treatment with pembrolizumab and 225Ac-J591, Primary outcome for phase I; DLTs will be measured by utilizing the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. There will be 12 weeks of safety follow-up following visit 1., From visit 1 through 12 weeks on study|Determination of optimal dose of 225Ac-J591 for phase II, Primary outcome for phase I; following 12 weeks of safety follow-up, the study team will make a determination of the 225Ac-J591 dose for phase II (either 65 or 90 KBq/kg)., From visit 1 through 12 weeks on study|Change in composite response rate of pembrolizumab and ARPI with or without 225Ac-J591, The primary outcome for phase II will be response, a composite of: PSA decline greater than 50% of baseline, measurable disease response by imaging criteria, conversion of circulating tumor cell count to favorable or undetectable., Will be collected at the time of visit 1 and up to 100 months
Change in overall survival following treatment, Overall survival will be captured through in-clinic or telephone contact with subjects, Survival will be collected from Day 1 and up to 100 months|Change in biochemical progression-free survival, PSA progression will be defined as a rise of \> 25% above either the pretreatment level or the nadir PSA level (whichever is lowest). PSA must increase by \> 2 ng/ml to be considered progression., Will be collected at the time of visit 1 and up to 100 months|Change in radiographic progression-free survival, Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors RECIST (Version 1.1) criteria with prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3) modifications will be used., Patients will undergo imaging at screening and then every 12 weeks, for up to 100 months|Change in proportion with 1-year progression-free survival, By imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria with prostate cancer working group 3 modifications) or biochemical (PSA) criteria, Will be collected at the time of visit 1 through 1 year on study|Change in proportion with >30% PSA decline, Baseline (pre-treatment) PSA levels will be compared to PSA nadir on study, Will be collected at the time of visit 1 and up to 100 months|Change in proportion with >50% PSA decline, Baseline (pre-treatment) PSA levels will be compared to PSA nadir on study, Will be collected at the time of visit 1 and up to 100 months|Change in proportion with >90% PSA decline, Baseline (pre-treatment) PSA levels will be compared to PSA nadir on study, Will be collected at the time of visit 1 and up to 100 months
This clinical trial is for men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The primary objectives of the study are to determine the optimal dose of 225Ac-J591 when combined with pembrolizumab (phase I) and then to assess whether the combination of 225Ac-J591, pembrolizumab, and androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) is more effective against prostate cancer than pembrolizumab and ARPI alone. 225Ac-J591 is a radionuclide conjugate involving Actinium-225 linked to J591, an antibody that recognizes prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the surface of cancer cells; 225Ac-J591 is able to deliver powerful radiation to cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is a drug that strengthens the body's immune response to cancer cells. In the phase I portion of the study, two cohorts of up to 6 patients each will receive combined therapy: ARPI (standard dosing schedule), pembrolizumab (400 mg every 6 weeks), 225Ac-J591 (single dose, either 65 or 90 KBq/kg). Following a minimum of 12 weeks of safety follow-up, the study team will determine which 225Ac-J591 dose is better. In the phase II portion, patients will be randomized to pembrolizumab + ARPI with or without 225Ac-J591. The primary endpoint for phase II will be response - a composite of PSA, circulating tumor cell (CTC) count, and imaging changes. Patients who achieve at least one of the criteria will be considered responders. Imaging (CT scan, bone scan) will occur every 12 weeks. Additionally, participants will undergo 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan prior to therapy and at 12 weeks. Patients are able to receive pembrolizumab every 6 weeks for maximum 18 cycles (approximately 2 years).
