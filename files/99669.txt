A Study to Compare Quality of Life and Compliance in Patients Receiving High-dose Interferon Versus Pegylated Interferon in Patients With Surgically Resected Melanoma
To evaluate the compliance with and perceptions of treatment, as well as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in surgically resected melanoma patients undergoing HDI or PEG IFN therapy.
Melanoma
Evaluate Compliance With Standard High Dose Interferon (HDI) Versus Sylatron, To evaluate compliance with administration of standard HDI versus PEG IFN for patients with surgically resected melanoma in need of adjuvant therapy, 1 year
Compare Quality of Life (Qol)for Patients on HDI Versus PEG IFN, To compare QOL for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN using chemotherapy convenience and satisfaction questionnaire (CCSQ).

The CCSQ measures the construct "chemotherapy convenience and satisfaction" and includes 10 questions \[scores from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much"), maximum possible summative score = 40\]. Higher scores signify a better outcome. Minimum possible summative score = 0., baseline -week 1, week 3, week 13, week 25, week 50|Assess the Frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 Toxicities, To assess the frequency of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN, baseline-week 1, week 3, week 13, week 25, week 50|Percentage of Participants Reason For Choice of Treatment With HDI Versus PEG IFN, To examine reasons for patients' choice of treatment HDI versus PEG IFN, for those cases in which patients are presented with a choice of either treatment option (percentage answering "very important", "somewhat important", or "not important" for "frequency", "toxicity", "effectiveness", "convenience", and "length")., baseline-week 1, week 3, week 13, week 25, week 50|Treatment-Related Side Effects Impacting Health-Related Quality of Life (FACT-BRM), To compare QOL for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - biologic response modifier, questionnaire (FACT-BRM).

The FACT-BRM measures the construct "Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy" and includes 40 questions \[scores from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much"), maximum possible summative score = 160\]. Due to the nature of their items, the Social/Family Well-Being and Functional Well-Being subscale scores were reverse coded. For the summative score, higher scores signify a worse outcome. Minimum possible summative score = 0., Baseline-week 1, Week 3, week 13 week 25, week 50
The primary objective of this study is:

â€¢ To evaluate compliance with the administration of standard HDI versus PEG IFN for patients with melanoma in need of adjuvant therapy

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* To compare the convenience and satisfaction with chemotherapy for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN using a chemotherapy convenience and satisfaction questionnaire (CCSQ) and to evaluate the treatment-related side effects that may impact the patient's HRQOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy of Biologic Response Modifier (FACT BRM)
* To assess the frequency of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for patients on standard HDI versus PEG IFN
* To examine reasons for patients' choice of treatment with HDI versus PEG IFN, for those cases in which patients are presented with a choice of either treatment option
* To assess Health Resource Utilization on both arms of the study
