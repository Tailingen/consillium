Bevacizumab After Chemoradiotherapy For Locally Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma
This prospective phase II study is to determine the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma
Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab|RADIATION: chest radiation|DRUG: concurrent chemotherapy
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival in patients, 3-year|rate of grade≥2 radiation pneumonia(NCI-CTC4.0), radiation-induced pulmonary injury is classified into 1-5 grades according to NCI-CTC4.0. The incidence of symptomatic radiation-induced pulmonary injury: the ratio of grade 2 and above radiation-induced pulmonary injury cases in 1 year after radio therapy to all cases can be evaluated ., 1 year from the end of chemoradiotherapy
overall survival, overall survival, 3-year|response rate, 3-year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation esophagitis, 3-year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation pneumonitis, 3-year
This prospective phase II study is to determine the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma.

All patients received 4 cycles of weekly docetaxel (25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin (25mg/㎡)(DP), each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy, with one-month break.Bevacizumab maintenance therapy starts 1-2 months later after the chemotherapy.The recommended dose for intravenous infusion is 15mg/kg body weight, and the drug is given every 3 weeks for up to 1 year. Toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0.
