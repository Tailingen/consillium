Translation, Cross-cultural Adaptation and Validation of the MGQOL-15-F
The purpose of this study is to translate and culturally adapt the MGQOL-15 (health-related quality of life scale for myasthenia gravis) for use with French-speaking patients in France and to evaluate its psychometric properties to ensure reliability and validity.

Global quality of life evaluated via the WHOQOL-BREF scale, 1 day|Clinical evaluation : Myasthenic Muscle Score, 1 day|Disease severity assessed via the Myasthenic Muscle Score, 1 day|Impact of symptoms on daily activities and daily life using the MG-ADL score, 1day
It is a translation and validation of a quality of life scale.

Step 1: Translation and cultural adaptation (Forward and back translation, committee review, pre-testing with 10 patients for content and face validity).

Step 2 : Psychometric testing : Test-retest with a 2 day interval, correlation with clinical scores - the Myasthenic Muscle Score and the (MG-ADL) score and with a global quality of life score (WHOQOL-BREF).
