Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Younger Adults
This study is a multicenter trial of treatment for young ALL patients. All ALL patients will receive the same steroid pre-phase in order to evaluate sensitivity or resistance. Then, patients will be included into 3 specific trials according to biological features (immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and molecular biology).

Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) 2005:

* T ALL or B ALL non Ph (N=810 patients planned).
* GRAALL 2005 R: B ALL non Ph CD20+ (N=220 patients planned).
* GRAAPH 2005: ALL Ph+ (N=270 patients planned)
Leukemia, Lymphocytic
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate
Event free survival for all patients, January 2014|GRAAPH: Percentage of patients with minimum residual disease (MRD) < 10-4 after induction and/or consolidation (= salvage), January 2014
CR in 1 or 2 courses, January 2014|Death in induction, January 2014|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, January 2014|Death in first CR, January 2014|Relapse, January 2014|Relapse free survival, January 2014|Overall Survival, January 2014
GRAALL 2005: T ALL or B ALL non Ph

Randomization between standard versus intensified cyclophosphamide administration during a 4-drug, 4 week chemotherapy and late intensification.

(N=810 patients planned)

GRAALL 2005 R: B ALL non Ph CD20+

Randomization between standard versus intensified cyclophosphamide administration during a 4-drug, 4 week chemotherapy and late intensification.

Randomization between Mabthera (rituximab) or no Mabthera during all induction and consolidation courses.(N=220 patients planned)

Allogenic transplantation will be performed depending on unfavourable risk factors.

GRAAPH 2005: ALL Ph

Randomization between an imatinib-based induction and a chemotherapy + imatinib induction. (N=270 patients planned)

Allogenic transplantation will be systematically performed in the presence of related or unrelated donors.

Autologous transplantation could be performed in the absence of a donor in case of Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) â‰¤ 10-4.

Consolidation therapy will be performed in the absence of a donor in case of MRD \> 10-4.
