Interleukin-2 Gene or Methotrexate in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into head and neck cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill the tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether the interleukin-2 gene is more effective than methotrexate for advanced head and neck cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of the interleukin-2 gene with that of methotrexate in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: gene therapy|BIOLOGICAL: interleukin-2 gene|DRUG: methotrexate
OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of interleukin-2 gene versus methotrexate in patients with recurrent or refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the safety and tolerability of interleukin-2 gene in these patients. III. Compare the quality of life of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 gene intratumorally on days 1 and 4 of week 1, and then once weekly for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive methotrexate IV once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 5, 13, 17 and 25. Patients are followed every 2-3 weeks for up to 18 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study.
