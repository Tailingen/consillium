Radical Radiotherapy by External Beam Radiation Versus Radical Radiotherapy With Temporary Iridium Implant Plus External Beam Radiation in Carcinoma of the Prostate
The specific objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy of the combination of a temporary iridium implant plus external beam irradiation versus standard external beam irradiation alone in patients with Stage B2 and C prostatic carcinoma. Benefit will be assessed in terms of local recurrence, survival, and toxicity.
