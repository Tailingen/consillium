A Clinical Study of TQB2450 Injection Combined With Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules Versus K Drug in the Treatment of First-line Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2450 injection combined with Anlotinib Hydrochloride capsules versus K drug as a first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.A total of 375 subjects will be enrolled.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: TQB2450 injection|DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules|DRUG: Pembrolizumab injection|DRUG: Placebo
Disease progression-free survival(PFS) evaluated by Independent Review Committee (IRC), The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Baseline to up to two years
Overall survival (OS), The preriod from the first use of the drug to death from all causes. For subjects who are still alive at the last follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last follow-up. For subjects who are lost follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last confirmed survival time before being lost to follow-up., Baseline to up to two years|Disease PFS evaluated by investigators, The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Baseline to up to two years|Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by investigators, According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and iRECIST, the proportion of subjects whose tumors are evaluated as complete response(CR) and partial response(PR) by subcenter imaging evaluation. It is recorded from the first use of the drug to disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer treatment., Baseline to up to two years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period, including CR, PR and stable disease（SD）, Baseline to up to two years|Duration of response (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) ., Baseline to up to two years|DOR rate (≥ 6 months) (the proportion of subjects with DOR ≥ 6 months), The proportion of subjects reaching 6 months from firstly- recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) ., Baseline to up to two years|OS rate of 12 months, The proportion of subjects who survive for 12 months after the first dose, Baseline to up to two years|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)，as well as abnormal laboratory examination indicators., The proportion of AEs and SAEs recorded afte signing the informed consent form(ICF)., Baseline to up to two years
