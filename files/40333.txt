Efficacy and Safety of Super-hyperfractionation Pulse Radiotherapy Combined With ICIs for Advanced NSCLC
Investigators intend to combine low-dose hypersensitivity with high-dose immunopotentiation effect, and use super-hyperfractionation pulse radiotherapy, which is expected to achieve the effect of in situ vaccine that can enhance tumor killing, protect normal tissues, reduce immune cell damage and enhance tumor immunogenicity at the same time, and play a stronger immunopotentiation effect in combined immunotherapy. Thereby inducing a stronger abscopal effect of radiotherapy.

objective response rate, The proportion of patients with tumor volume reduced by 30% and maintained for more than 4 weeks. Sum of the proportions of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), 12 weeks
iORR, The objective response rate away from the radiation field, 24 weeks
