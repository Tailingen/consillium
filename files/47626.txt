Overall Response rate（ORR）, the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per local investigator´s assessment and according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, 1month
Progression free survival（PFS）, Survival witouth observed progression at 2 years, 1 years|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, DCR (CR+PR+SD) by RECIST v1.1, 1 years|Duration of Response (DOR）, DOR was defined as the time from the first documented a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) to progressive disease (PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm., 1 years|Overal survival （OS）, survival at 5 years, 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], AEs according to CTCAE v 5.0., 1 year
