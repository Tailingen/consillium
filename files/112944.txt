A Study of mTOR Inhibitor Everolimus (RAD001) in Association With Cisplatin and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer
The cervix cancer is the second malignant neoplasia more common between women. The combined treatment involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was defined as the standard. This study will evaluate the safety, toxicity and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in association with cisplatin and pelvic radiotherapy, in patients with squamous cells carcinoma of uterine cervix, in stages IIB and IIIB.
