A Novel Erythropoiesis Stimulating Protein (NESP; Darbopoetin Alfa) for the Treatment of Anemia in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Multi-cycle Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy
The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of darbopoetin alfa to placebo in the treatment of anemia in adults with lung cancer receiving multicycle platinum-containing chemotherapy, by assessing the percentage of participants who received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions during weeks 5-12 inclusive.
Anemia
DRUG: Darbepoetin alfa|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Participants with a Red Blood Cell Transfusion During Weeks 5 to 12, Weeks 5 to 12
Time to First Red Blood Cell Transfusion During Weeks 5 to 12, The number of days from the first day of study week 5 (day 29) to the first administration of a RBC transfusion during the Treatment Phase that occurs on or after day 29., Week 5 to week 12|Percentage of Participants with a Hemoglobin Response by Week 12, Hemoglobin Response was defined as an increase in hemoglobin of ≥ 2.0 g/dL over baseline hemoglobin in the absence of any RBC transfusions during the preceding 28 days., 12 weeks|Time to Hemoglobin Response, The number of days from the first administration of study drug to the first occurrence of a hemoglobin response., 12 weeks|Percentage of Participants who Achieved a Sustained Hemoglobin Response by Week 12, Sustained hemoglobin response was defined as in increase in hemoglobin of ≥ 2.0 g/dL over baseline hemoglobin sustained for at least 28 days or until the end of the Treatment Phase. This increase must have occurred in the absence of RBC transfusions during the period of sustained response and the preceding 28 days., 12 weeks|Time to Sustained Hemoglobin Response, The number of days from the first administration of study drug to the first occurrence of a sustained hemoglobin response., 12 weeks|Percentage of Participants who Achieved a Hemoglobin Correction by Week 12, Hemoglobin correction was defined as a hemoglobin value of ≥ 12.0 g/dL that occurred in the absence of RBC transfusions during the preceding 28 days., 12 weeks|Percentage of Participants who Achieved a Sustained Hemoglobin Correction by Week 12, Sustained hemoglobin correction was defined as a hemoglobin value of ≥ 12.0 g/dL that was sustained for at least 28 days or until the end of the Treatment Phase. This must have occurred in the absence of RBC transfusions during the period of sustained correction and the preceding 28 days., 12 weeks|Time to Hemoglobin Correction, The number of days from the first administration of study drug to the first occurrence of a hemoglobin correction., 12 weeks|Time to Sustained Hemoglobin Correction, The number of days from the first administration of study drug to the first occurrence of a sustained hemoglobin correction., 12 weeks|Change from Baseline in Hemoglobin at Week 12, Baseline and week 12|Percentage of Participants who Received a Red Blood Cell Transfusion During Weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12, Weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12|Number of Standard Units of RBCs Transfused During Weeks 5 to 12, Weeks 5 to 12|Number of Days with RBC Transfusions During Weeks 5 to 12, Weeks 5 to 12|Change from Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia Subscales at Week 12, The FACT-anemia is a 47-item questionnaire to assess specific quality of life concerns related to anemia and fatigue in cancer patients., Baseline and week 12|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, 16 weeks
