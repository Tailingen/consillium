Determinants of Mercaptopurine Toxicity in Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Maintenance Therapy
The present study was conducted to assess the population pharmacokinetics of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and genetic polymorphisms
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Mercaptopurine
Red blood cells (RBC) concentration of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), To detect of RBC 6-MP metabolite concentrations and evaluate the association of metabolite concentrations and side effects, at second day after oral administration|Genetic polymorphisms in Chinese patients with ALL, To detect the frequencies of genetic polymorphisms of Chinese patients receiving 6-MP for treatment of ALL, at second day after oral administration
The investigators' purpose was to identify genetic factors and metabolite concentrations associated with both hematological toxicity in patients with ALL maintained on 6-MP in Chinese.
