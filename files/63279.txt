Unilateral Neck Radiotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer
Patients with head and neck cancer typically undergo a surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes that could contain disease on both sides of the neck. After surgery, radiotherapy is given (with or without chemotherapy) to the area that underwent surgery and both sides of the neck, even if disease was only found on one side. Giving radiotherapy to both sides of the neck commonly results in high rates of side effects, which in turn affects patient quality of life.

There is growing evidence from some other studies that support the safety of omitting radiotherapy after surgery in the side of the neck with no disease. With this study, the investigators are hoping to justify its routine use and, if successful, the standard of care could be to receive radiation on only one side of the neck instead of both sides. This could alleviate the extent of some side effects and improve patient quality of life.

Participants will be randomized into one of the following groups to receive radiotherapy as follows:

Arm 1 (Non-experimental intervention): standard intervention: Radiotherapy to both sides of the neck. Treatment will begin a maximum of 8 weeks from the surgery date.

Arm 2 (Experimental intervention): Radiotherapy to one side of the neck. Treatment will begin a maximum of 8 weeks from the surgery date.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
RADIATION: Radiotherapy to ipsilateral neck lymphatics and tumor bed (radiotherapy to one side of the neck)|RADIATION: Radiotherapy to the bilateral neck lymphatics and tumor bed (radiotherapy to both sides of the neck)
Locoregional control, Locoregional failure is defined as disease recurrence (by imaging, clinical exam, or biopsy) in the neck or at the primary site., At 24 months
Overall survival and disease-specific survival, Percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive five years after their diagnosis or the start of treatment., 5 years after diagnosis or the start of treatment.|University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire - Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (UW-QOL - RTOG) modification, The University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) modification, is a health related quality of life tool for use in head and neck cancer patients receiving RT.

The UW-QOL RTOG modification consists of 15 items with response options ranging from 10 to 50, in multiples of 10. That is, the lowest symptom burden is rated as 10, whereas the highest symptom burden is rated as 50. The individual item scores are totaled and then averaged to obtain the final score. This scoring results in a lower score indicating greater HR-QOL; and conversely, higher scores indicating lower HRQOL., At 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post radiotherapy|Xerostomia, Overall score, At 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post radiotherapy|Acute toxicity, Toxicity scoring will be carried out to include salivary gland, mucositis, skin, and fatigue grading according the CTCAE version 4.0 scoring criteria., Weekly throughout RT treatment (approximately 6 weeks)
