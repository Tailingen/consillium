Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADRs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal or nutritional product (including pediatric formulas) without regard to possibility of a causal relationship with product treatment or usage. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An ADR was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Inlyta in a participant who received Inlyta. SADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Relatedness to Inlyta was assessed by the physician., From first dose of Inlyta or time of the participant's informed consent through the end of the observation period of the study, which included at least 28 calendar days post last dose of drug under study (observation period for the study was of 9 years)|Number of Participants With Unexpected AEs, Unexpected SAEs, Unexpected ADRs and Unexpected SADRs, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal or nutritional product (including pediatric formulas) without regard to possibility of a causal relationship with product treatment or usage. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An ADR was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Inlyta in a participant who received Inlyta. SADR was any SAE that is attributed to Inlyta. Relatedness to Inlyta was assessed by the physician. An unexpected AE was an AE with a difference in nature, severity, specificity, or outcome, compared to the product licensure/safety notification of the drug. Unexpected ADRs were unexpected AEs that were, in the investigator's opinion, of causal relationship to the study treatment., From first dose of Inlyta or time of the participant's informed consent through the end of the observation period of the study, which included at least 28 calendar days post last dose of drug under study (observation period for the study was of 9 years)|Duration of Adverse Events, From first dose of Inlyta or time of the participant's informed consent through the end of the observation period of the study, which included at least 28 calendar days post last dose of drug under study (observation period for the study was of 9 years)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events by Their Severity, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal or nutritional product (including pediatric formulas) without regard to possibility of a causal relationship with product treatment or usage.
