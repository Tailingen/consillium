Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) Versus CRT Alone in Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) (MK-3475-992/KEYNOTE-992)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). MIBC is a type of cancer that has not spread from the muscles in the bladder to other parts of the body.

MIBC is treated by having surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy). Not all people choose to have surgery and want to keep their bladder using other treatments.

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT)- is a type of non-surgical treatment for MIBC which combines Chemotherapy (a treatment with medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them growing) and Radiation therapy (a treatment that uses beams of intense energy \[like X-rays\] to shrink or get rid of tumors).

Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer.

A placebo looks like the study medicine but has no study medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers better understand if the study medicine works.

The goal of this study is to learn: 1. If a study medicine pembrolizumab given with Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can help people live longer without their cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to placebo given with CRT. 2.About the safety and how well people tolerate CRT alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.

Participant responses to the questions "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). A higher score indicates a better overall outcome. The change from baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30) combined score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change from Baseline in Physical Functioning (Items 1-5) Combined Score on the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to 5 questions about their physical functioning are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates a better quality of life. The change from baseline in Physical Functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 1-5) combined score will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change from Baseline in Urinary, Bowel, and Sexual Domains of the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI), The BCI is a validated, condition-specific health questionnaire assessing quality of life among participants with bladder cancer. The BCI contains 36 items which assess 3 domains (urinary, bowel, and sexual) with function and bother subdomains. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores corresponding to better functioning and health-related quality of life. The change from baseline in the combined scores of the urinary, bowel, and sexual domains of the BCI will be presented., Baseline and up to approximately 24 months|Change from Baseline in the Visual Analog Score (VAS) of the European Quality of Life (EuroQoL)-5 Dimensions, 5-level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 10 cm vertical, visual analogue scale. It is rated by the respondent on a scale 0 to 100, with 0 being "the worst health you can imagine" and 100 being "the best health you can imagine".
