Treatment of Larotaxel/Docetaxel, +/- Trastuzumab, After Anthracycline-cyclophosphamide in Breast Cancer Patients
The primary objective of this study is to assess the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate by treatment arm (according to Chevallier criteria).

The secondary objectives are:

* to assess in each treatment arm the clinical Response Rate (RR), the rate of breast conservation, the Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the Overall Survival (OS), the safety and tolerability profile, the pathological Complete Response rate (pCR) according to NSABP and Sataloff criteria,
* to rank docetaxel and larotaxel alone in Her2 -ve patients, or combined with trastuzumab in Her2 +ve patients, according to the pCR rate.
