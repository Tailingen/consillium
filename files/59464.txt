HERTHENA-Lung02: A Study of Patritumab Deruxtecan Versus Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Metastatic or Locally Advanced EGFRm NSCLC After Failure of EGFR TKI Therapy
Disease progression is typical for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Standard platinum-based chemotherapy offers limited efficacy and an unfavorable safety profile.There is an urgent need for more effective and tolerable therapies for patients with EGFRm NSCLC who have exhausted available targeted therapies. Clinical evidence suggest that patritumab deruxtecan constitutes a promising investigational therapy for patients with EGFRm NSCLC.

Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd, U3-1402) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising an anti-HER3 mAb linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is in clinical development for patients with NSCLC, metastatic breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.

The primary objective of the current study is to compare the efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan versus platinum-based chemotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) and the key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS), in participants with metastatic or locally advanced NSCLC with an EGFR-activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R) after failure of third-generation (eg, osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, alflutinib) EGFR TKI therapy.
