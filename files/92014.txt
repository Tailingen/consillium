Neoepitope-based Personalized DNA Vaccine Approach in Pediatric Patients With Recurrent Brain Tumors
The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety and feasibility of giving a personalized DNA vaccine to people with brain tumors that have returned or have been resistant to treatment.
Pediatric Recurrent Brain Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine|DEVICE: Papivax Biotech TDS-IM v2.0|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw
Safety and tolerability of adjuvant personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, Through 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Feasibility of adjuvant personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured the number of participants that had a neoantigen-specific DNA vaccine generated, From time of resection to time of initiation (approximately 12-14 weeks)
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from date of first dose of vaccine to date of progression or evidence of last progression free time.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of at least 1 target lesion, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of perpendicular diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The absolute increase in any dimension must be at least 5mm when calculating the products of perpendicular diameters. Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy\* not caused by comorbid events., 2 years|Median Overall Survival, -OS is defined as date of first dose of vaccine to date of death or date of last known alive., 2 years
The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety and feasibility of giving a personalized DNA vaccine to people with brain tumors that have returned or have been resistant to treatment.
