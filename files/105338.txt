Pharmacokinetic Profile of Vincristine Administered With Imatinib for Bcr-Abl Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Compared to That Without Imatinib for Bcr-Abl Negative ALL
This study is characterizing the pharmacokinetics of vincristine using two different cohorts of patients. The first cohort includes patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that are Bcr-Abl positive. This cohort of patients will receive vincristine along with imatinib in the induction chemotherapy regimen. The second cohort includes patients with ALL that are Bcr-Abl negative. This cohort of patients will receive vincristine without imatinib in the induction chemotherapy regimen. This study involves blood draws beginning on day 7 of the treatment protocol and these samples will be analyzed for pharmacokinetic parameters.

Imatinib and vincristine are both metabolized by the hepatic CYP 450 enzyme system. Imatinib is an inhibitor of the system and co-administration of imatinib and vincristine has the potential to increase the blood level of vincristine. This could explain the increased level of neurotoxicity that is currently being seen with the co-administration of these two agents in the treatment of Bcr-Abl positive ALL.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
To characterize the pharmacokinetics of vincristine in two patient cohorts: Bcr-Abl positive ALL patients treated with the standard protocol with imatinib and Bcr-Abl negative ALL patients treated with the same protocol but without imatinib., 18-24 months
To determine if there are any objective differences in peripheral neuropathy and ileus between the two groups at Day 14, and to correlate these neurologic assessments with PK results., 18-24 months
