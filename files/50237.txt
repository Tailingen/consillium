Study of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Bevacizumab to Treat Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the drug combination: gemcitabine, carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients that have been diagnosed with platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Determine the Antitumor Activity of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin/Bevacizumab Regimen as Measured by the Probability of Surviving Progression-free for at Least 6 Months or Responding., Progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST, and safety. RECIST verison 1.0 was used for the assessment of progression and was based on radiologic evaluation., up to 6 months
Overall Survival for Patients Treated With the Regimen., The period of time from study entry until disease progression or date of last contact., To progression of Disease
In this study participants will receive the drug combination gemcitabine/carboplatin and bevacizumab once every two weeks. As long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing and the participant is not experiencing any unacceptable side effects, participation can continue up to 2 years. The study is being done to find the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of this combination of chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab affects the growth of new blood vessels in the body. It is part of this study to see if stopping the growth of new blood vessels in the body will help stop the growth and the spread of cancer. The other two chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and carboplatin, are currently being used together for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
