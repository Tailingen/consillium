Obstruction of Malignancy: Percutaneous Renal vs Endoscopic Stent
This research study will compare two procedures commonly used to treat urinary obstruction due to cancer. Sometimes cancer blocks one or both ureters (narrow tubes in the body that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder). When these ureters become blocked, the body can no longer properly drain urine. This blocking of the ureters is called urinary obstruction, which can lead to kidney problems, infection, and pain. Treatment options for urinary obstruction include ureteral stent placement and percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. Both treatment options require a doctor to place soft tubes (like a catheter) inside the body to help the ureters properly drain urine. These two treatment options have different success rates, risks, and effects on quality of life. By doing this study, researchers hope to learn which treatment option is best for individuals who develop urinary obstruction because of cancer. Participation in this research will last about 3 months.

Trial Feasibility (as assessed by number of enrolled and recruited patients), The feasibility of a definitive randomized trial, specifically to quantify patient willingness to be randomly assigned treatment with retrograde ureteral stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for malignant ureteral obstruction. The number of patient eligible and subsequent recruitment rates. Feasibility will be defined as successfully enrolling 50 patients in the 12 month enrollment period., 3 months
Rate of Success for Participants Randomized to Percutaneous Nephrostomy vs. Ureteral Stent Placement, The rate of technical success when randomizing patients to percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement for managing malignant ureteral obstruction. This rate of technical success will be assessed by:

* Decompression failure (defined as any of the following: technical failure of study procedure, stable or worsening hydronephrosis on imaging at 3 months follow up, urosepsis within 3 months of procedure, or need for additional decompression procedure (stent or nephrostomy placement) within 2 months after initial procedure
* Adverse surgical events (defined as grade â‰¥3 Clavien-Dindo classification)
* Patient reported outcomes at baseline, 7-day, 30-day and 90-day post-procedure using the Brief Pain Inventory, PROMIS Adult Physical Function Short Form (v2.0), and American Urological Association Symptom Score
* Compliance rate with questionnaires
* Reasons for non-randomisation, percentage of non-consenting participants who choose nephrostomy vs. retrograde ureteral stenting, 6 months

Treatment options for urinary obstruction include ureteral stent placement and percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. Both treatment options require a doctor to place soft tubes inside the body to help the ureters properly drain urine. A ureteral stent is an internal drainage tube allowing urine to drain from your kidney down to your bladder. The percutaneous nephrostomy tube is a tube that comes out your back that drains urine into a bag. These two treatment options have different success rates, risks, and effects on quality of life. By doing this study, researchers hope to learn which treatment option is best for individuals who develop urinary obstruction due to cancer. Participation in this research will last about 3 months.

If you agree to participate:

* The study doctor will not pick which one of the two treatments described above you will receive. We will use a computer to place you in one of the two study groups. The group the computer picks is by chance, like a flip of a coin. This is also called "randomization." You will have an equal chance of being in either group.
* You will receive either a retrograde ureteral stent or a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. A member of the research team will tell you which of the two treatments you will get, after the selection has been made.
