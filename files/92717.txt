A Trial of Camrelizumab Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Levocetirizine in Metastatic or Recurrent TNBC
This is a phase II, explorative, open-labeled, multi-centered, double-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial of Camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with Nab-paclitaxel (a chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer) and Levocetirizine (an antihistamine) in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer. 60 subjects will be enrolled in multiple centers. This study aims to evaluate the effects of Camrelizumab combined with Nab-paclitaxel and Levocetirizine in the treatment of advanced TNBC.

This is a phase II, explorative, open-labeled, multi-centered, double-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial to evaluate the effects of Camrelizumab combined with Nab-paclitaxel and Levocetirizine in the treatment of advanced TNBC. The study aims to enroll 60 subjects in multiple centers. The primary objective is to assess the overall response rate (ORR). All enrolled patients will be treated with Camrelizumab 200mg (iv. 3mg/kg for patient whose weight is below 50kg) on day 1 of each 3 week, and Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2, iv, on d1,8,15 of each 4 week, in combination with Levocetirizine of 5mg, po., 3 days before 1st administration.
