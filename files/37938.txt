Safety and Feasibility of imILT Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC)
10 Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer, no further responsive to neoadjuvant treatments but with a Stage-III disease will be submitted to imILT (Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy). Safety and feasibility of imILT on LAPC will be evaluated as primary objective. Secondary objectives will be QoL after imILT, study of the immune reaction after imILT, oncological analysis of patients suffering from LAPC submitted to imILT.

PROCEDURE: immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy|DEVICE: Laser
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 24 months
The immunostimulating effects of imILT, This will be determined by measuring plasma levels of various pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune-related cells, Up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Up to 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), Up to 24 months|Disease specific survival (DSS), Up to 24 months
