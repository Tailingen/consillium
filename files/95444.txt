A Phase 1b Master Trial to Investigate CPX-351 in Subjects With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
JZP025-101 is an open-label, multicenter, multi-arm, nonrandomized phase 1b master trial to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-351 when administered in combination with various targeted agents in previously untreated subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are fit to receive intensive chemotherapy (ICT). Subjects will be assigned to treatment arms based on results of AML mutation testing.
