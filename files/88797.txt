SARC016: Study of Everolimus With Bevacizumab to Treat Refractory Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
To determine the clinical response rate of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab for patients with chemotherapy refractory sporadic or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). To evaluate the toxicity and safety of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab in individuals with MPNST
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors|MPNST|Sarcoma
DRUG: everolimus|DRUG: bevacizumab
Clinical Benefit Rate (Complete Response, Partial Response, and Stable Disease at â‰¥ 4 Months Using World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria) of Everolimus in Combination With Bevacizumab, Evaluate if the combination of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus combined with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab would result in a modest clinical benefit rate, which included confirmed partial and complete responses and disease stability for four or more treatment cycles based on WHO Response Criteria. Per WHO for target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all known disease, determined by two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart.

Partial Response (PR): A \> 50% decrease in the total tumor load of the lesions that have been measured to determine the effect of therapy not less than four weeks apart. The observations must be consecutive. Stable Disease (SD): A 50% decrease in total tumor area cannot be established nor has a 25% increase in the size of one or more measurable lesions been demonstrated., Assessed at Baseline and prior to Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., for up to 2 years. 1 cycle =28 days
Spectrum of Germline NF1 Mutations in Individuals With NF1 Associated MPNSTs, To evaluate the spectrum of germline NF1 mutations in individuals with NF1 associated MPNSTs, greater than or equal to 4 months|Number of Participants With Response Stratified by Individuals With Sporadic or NF1 Associated MPNST, To explore differences in the response rate to everolimus in combination with bevacizumab in individuals with sporadic and NF1 associated MPNST. Responses include confirmed partial and complete responses and disease stability for four or more treatment cycles based on WHO Response Criteria. Per WHO for target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all known disease, determined by two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Partial Response (PR): A \> 50% decrease in the total tumor load of the lesions that have been measured to determine the effect of therapy not less than four weeks apart. The observations must be consecutive. Stable Disease (SD): A 50% decrease in total tumor area cannot be established nor has a 25% increase in the size of one or more measurable lesions been demonstrated., Assessed at Baseline and prior to Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., for up to 2 years. 1 cycle =28 days|Relationship Between Response to Everolimus in Combination With Bevacizumab and the Presence of NF1 Mutations or NF1 Inactivation in MPNST Tumor Samples, To explore the relationship between response to everolimus in combination with bevacizumab and the presence of NF1 mutations or NF1 inactivation in MPNST tumor samples, greater than or equal to 4 months|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) Levels at Baseline and Pre-Cycles 3 and 5, To assess changes in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) Levels in peripheral blood specimens during treatment., Baseline, Pre-Cycle 3, Pre-Cycle 5|Utility of 3-D MRI Analysis in Comparison to 1-D and 2-D Measurements to More Sensitively Monitor Response to Everolimus in Combination With Bevacizumab, To evaluate the utility of 3-D MRI analysis in comparison to 1-D and 2-D measurements to more sensitively monitor response to everolimus in combination with bevacizumab, greater than or equal to 4 months
