Therapy With Abraxane and 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide (FEC) for Patients With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn how breast cancer tumors respond to a drug called Abraxane followed by a combination of 3 chemotherapy drugs commonly used for breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel followed by FEC
pathologic complete response rate in the breast for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) who receive Abraxane, pCR examined in breast tissue taken at surgery
pathologic complete response rate in the breast and axillary nodes (pCR breast and nodes) in all patients, pCR examined in breast and lymph node tissue taken at surgery|complete clinical response rate (cCR) of the sequential regimen in patients who present with palpable measurable disease, physical exam between the two chemotherapy regimens and at completion of the entire treatment regimen|complete clinical and imaging response rate (ciCR) of the sequential regimen in all patients, physical exam and breast imaging at 3-4 weeks after the last chemotherapy treatment|complete clinical response rate (cCR)of Abraxane in patients who present with palpable measurable disease, physical exam at completion of the Abraxane portion of the treatment regimen|toxicity of the sequential chemotherapy regimen, during treatment and for 3 to 4 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle|toxicity of the sequential chemotherapy regimen when administered concurrently with trastuzumab, during treatment and for 3 to 4 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle|2-year progression-free survival, from the first dose of study therapy to first date of disease progression or for a maximum of 24 months from study entry|2-year overall survival (OS), from the first dose of study therapy to date of death or for a maximum of 24 months from study entry|exploration of molecular and genetic correlates of response, after specimen procurement and continuing after completion of clinical phase of study
This is a Phase 2, non-randomized study of neoadjuvant treatment with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) every week for 12 weeks followed by 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in women with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients with HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer may receive trastuzumab concurrently with the chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator. The primary aim of this study is to determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of this sequential regimen.

Patients who achieve clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), or have resectable stable disease (SD) will undergo surgery. Surgery will consist of modified radical mastectomy or excision of the primary tumor site with clear surgical margins accompanied by axillary staging. Tumor samples taken prior to initiation of treatment will be analyzed for molecular and genetic changes which will be correlated with tumor response.

Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer without documented evidence of distant metastatic disease. Patients with clinical Stage IIB (T3N0 only), IIIA, or IIIB breast cancer will be potential candidates for this trial.
