Programmed Death Ligand (PD-L1) Combined With Chemotherapy for Patients With BTC
This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-group multi-center study of Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of KN035 compared to standard of care (SOC) Gemcitabine-based chemotherapies in the treatment of participants with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer.

The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants will have a longer overall Survival (OS) when treated with combined therapy than SOC.
Biliary Tract Neoplasms
DRUG: KN035 plus Gemcitabine & oxaliplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine & oxaliplatin
Overall Survival (OS), was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Observed by 12 weeks after progressive disease or end of treatment
Progression Free Survival (PFS), was defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first and was based on blinded independent Review Committee (BIRC) review., Observed by 6 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response or a Partial Response and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on BIRC evaluation., Observed by 6 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response or a Partial Response or stable disease and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on BIRC evaluation, Observed by 6 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), was defined as the time from the first met for complete response/partial response (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease was objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study), Observed by 6 weeks|Time to progression (TTP), was defined as the time from randomization to the first date that progressive disease was objectively documented, Observed by 6 weeks
