Nk Cell Therapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiform Patients
Glioblastoma multiform is one of the most invasive and deadly cancers that progresses rapidly and leads to death. Surgery with radiotherapy /chemotherapy, as a treatment approach is ineffective in some cases and is associated with relapse and death. Immunotherapy is a special strategy that used as an adjunct therapy in various cancers and among the various methods of immunotherapy; it seems that cell therapy with NK cells is of special importance. A previous study conducted at the Royan Research Institute showed that NK cell proliferation and amplification resulted in the removal of glioblastoma tumor masses in the animal model. The animals had no evidence of tumor recurrence after treatment, and all tumor-related complications resolved after treatment. Therefore, in this study, the investigators intend to evaluate the safety of ex vivo activated cells in 5 patients with glioblastoma multiform whose disease has returned after treatment and who have not had any appropriate treatment.
