Safety and Tolerability of I.V. Infusion of MB07133 in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver. MB07133 is being developed for the treatment of inoperable HCC, using a platform technology known as HepDirectTM, which enables drugs to be targeted specifically to the liver. The objective for this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of MB07133.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: MB07133 300mg/m2/day|DRUG: MB07133 600 mg/m2/day|DRUG: MB07133 1200 mg/m2/day|DRUG: MB07133 1800 mg/m2/day|DRUG: MB07133 2400 mg/m2/day
Safety and tolerability, To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of MB07133; To determine the maximum-tolerated continuous infusion dose (MTD) of MB07133, 7-day continuous infusion every 28-days as tolerated
Determine effect of MB07133 on tumor size, To determine the effect on HCC tumor size by using CT scanning, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, and performance status., 28 day cycles
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of MB07133 when administered as a 7-day continuous i.v. To characterize the safety profile and the pharmacokinetics of MB07133 and metabolites during and after continuous infusion. To determine the effect of MB07133 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor size.
