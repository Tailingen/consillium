Treatment of Metastatic Cancer in Terminally Diagnosed Patients
The objective is to provide terminally diagnosed patients with a last line of treatment while improving overall quality of life. Tempol can be added to any chemotherapy regimen to potentially reduce side effects and overcome chemoresistance.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Tempol
The objective is to provide terminally diagnosed patients assigned to palliative care and palliative chemotherapy a last line treatment with Tempol. In vivo studies have shown Tempol to work synergistically with a number of chemotherapy agents increasing treatment response and reducing chemoresistance. Additionally, Tempol has been shown to provide protection to non-cancerous cells allowing for increased chemotherapy dosing by reducing side effects. Tempol inhibits HIF-1/VEGF among others in cancerous cells while upregulating GSH/NrF2 among others in non-cancerous cells.
