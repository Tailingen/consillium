A Study of Single and Multiple Dose Administration of LP-001 in Healthy Subjects
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of LP-001 in healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1, the single ascending dose (SAD) is the first in human (FIH) study of LP-001 and Part 2, multiple ascending dose (MAD).
