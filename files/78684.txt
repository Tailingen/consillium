A Study Evaluating Different Doses of BI 765049 When Given Alone and When Given With Ezabenlimab to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Expressing the Protein B7-H6 on the Cell Surface
This study is open to adults with advanced solid tumors whose previous cancer treatment was not successful. People can participate if their tumor has the B7-H6 marker or if they have colorectal cancer.

The study tests 2 medicines called BI 765049 and ezabenlimab (BI 754091). Both medicines may help the immune system fight cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 765049 alone and in combination with ezabenlimab the participants can tolerate. In this study, BI 765049 is given to people for the first time.

Participants can stay in the study for up to 3 years, if they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they get BI 765049 alone or in combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.

The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by BI 765049 or ezabenlimab. The doctors also regularly monitor the size of the tumor.
