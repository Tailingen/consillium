A Phase I/IIa Study of JAB-23E73 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS Gene Alteration
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I/IIa to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-23E73 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS mutations or amplification. The study consists of 2 phases: Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Phase IIa Dose Expansion.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: JAB-23E73|DRUG: JAB-23E73
Phase 1: Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase. DLTs will be defined as the occurrence of any of the toxicities as described in the protocol., Up to 21 days|Phase 2a: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years
Phase 1/2a: Safety and Tolerability, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), treatment-related Adverse Events (TRAEs) and serious Adverse Events (SAEs), including incidence and severity of findings in laboratory values, ECG, ECOG and vital signs., Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: Pharmacokinetic (PK): Maximum concentration (Cmax) of JAB-23E73, PK: Cmax of JAB-23E73, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: PK: Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of JAB-23E73, PK: Tmax of JAB-23E73, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: PK: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of JAB-23E73, PK: AUC of JAB-23E73, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1: ORR, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR per RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to first documentation of response as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 1/2a: Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 2 years|Phase 2a: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until the date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
