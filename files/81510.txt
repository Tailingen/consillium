A Single Center Study on Comparing the Different Function of EndoAngel in Improving the Quality of Colonscopy
An artificial intelligence-based system, named EndoAngel,has been constructed previously,which has polyp detection and quality monitoring functions. This study aims to evaluate the two different functions of EndoAngle in improving adenoma detection rate.

Adenoma detection rate, The numerator is the number of cases of adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of cases of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months
Polyp detection rate, The numerator is the number of cases of polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of cases of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 months|The mean number of polyps per procedure, The numerator is the total number of polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 months|The mean number of adenomas per procedure, The numerator is the total number of adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 months|Detection rate of large, small and diminutive polyps, The numerator was the number of patients with large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 months|The mean number of large, small and diminutive polyps per procedure, The numerator was the number of large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 months|Detection rate of large, small and diminutive adenomas, The numerator was the number of patients with large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 months|The mean number of large, small and diminutive adenomas per procedure, The numerator was the number of large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 months|Detection rate of adenoma in different sites, The numerator is the number of cases of adenoma detected in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and ileocecal region during colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 months|The mean number of adenomas in different sites per procedure, The numerator is the total number of adenomas detected in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and ileocecal region during colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 months|Time of colonoscopic insertion, The duration of colonoscopic insertion from rectum to ileocecal valve or appendiceal opening, 3 months|Time of colonoscopic withdrawal, The duration of colonoscopic withdrawal from ileocecal valve or appendiceal opening to colonoscopy finished., 3 months|Cecal intubation rate, The numerator is the number of cases of colonoscopy reaching ileocecal valve or appendiceal opening, and the denominator is the total number of colonoscopy cases., 3 months
The detection and removal of precancerous polyps via colonoscopy can reduce the the risk of colon cancer. However, the detection rate of adenomatous polyps can vary significantly among endoscopists. EndoAngel is an artificial intelligence-based system,consisting of polyp detection and quality monitoring functions. The polyp detection function can remind endoscopists of the location of the polyp. The quality monitoring function can monitor the velocity of insertion of the endoscope, record the time of insertion and withdrawal of the endoscope, and remind endoscopists of the blind areas caused by intestinal segment slipping.This study aims to evaluate the two different functions of EndoAngle by 2 × 2 factorial design in improving adenoma detection rate and the quality of colonscopy .
