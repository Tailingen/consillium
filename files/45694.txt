Study of Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and PF-05212384 in Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC (UF-STO-LUNG-002)
The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug, Gedatolisib (PF-05212384), given in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin will work against unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gedatolisib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Dose Tolerability, To identify the maximum tolerated dose of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in subjects with NSCLC., 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To estimate the objective rate of response of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin administered to subjects with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, according to current RECIST criteria. ORR is defined as the number of participants who achieved either a partial or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. By these criteria, Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and Partial Response (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions., 1 year
Approximately 70% of patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who receive and progress through frontline chemotherapy will be eligible for second line treatments. Any of the agents which are available for frontline therapy can be used in the salvage setting, though only erlotinib, docetaxel, and pemetrexed (in non-squamous cell carcinoma) are FDA-approved in the salvage setting based upon their demonstrated survival benefit in randomized phase III trials. All three appear to be roughly equivalent in terms of clinical benefit, which is admittedly modest, with response rates \<10%, clinical benefit rates of approximately 50%, and overall survivals of approximately 6 months. Still, a substantial number of patients may not benefit from the agents in the salvage treatment setting, thus it is critical to identify those patients who stand to benefit the most.

The study will consist of two phases, Ib and II. The phase Ib portion will study dose escalations in separate 3+3 cohorts using escalating doses of PF-05212384. The phase II portion will consist of a two stage Simon design. The doses for paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, Q21 days) and carboplatin (AUC=6, Q21 days) do not adjust as part of the study design. The dose of PF-05212384 will be determined during the Phase Ib portion.

The primary endpoint of the phase Ib portion of this protocol is to determine a tolerable phase II dose of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The primary endpoint of the phase II portion of this study is to determine the objective response rate of disease to the administration of PF-05212384 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. A secondary endpoint of this study will be progression-free survival following PF-05212384 therapy.
