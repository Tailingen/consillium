Ablation Plus Tislelizumab Versus Ablation Alone for Intrahepatic Recurrent Early Stage HCC
This is a randomized, controlled, phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of ablation followed by tislelizumab versus ablation alone in patients with early recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.
Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab|PROCEDURE: Ablation
1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, It is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve a time interval of 1 year of no disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (by any cause) from date of enrollment, whichever occurs first., 1 year
2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, It is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve a time interval of 2 year of no disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (by any cause) from date of enrollment., 2 years|3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, It is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve a time interval of 3 year of no disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (by any cause) from date of enrollment., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death (due to any cause). Subjects who are alive will be censored at the last known alive dates., 3 years|Time to Recurrence (TTR), It is defined as the time between the date of enrollment and the date of first recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis)., From date of randomization up to 5 years, approximately|Safety of ablation and ablation plus Tislelizumab, Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, deaths and laboratory abnormalities in all treated patients., From date of randomization up to 5 years, approximately|Biomarkers in tumor and peripheral blood to evaluate association with clinical efficacy and/or incidence of AEs., Correlation of selected biomarkers with efficacy (RFS rate and OS) and safety (incidence of AEs) endpoints., From date of randomization up to 5 years, approximately|Evaluate the patient's cancer-related QoL using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaire (QLQ), the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-HCC18., Change in sub-scale and total scores of EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ- HCC18 from baseline through follow-up., From date of randomization up to 5 years, approximately
Ablation is one of the main treatments for early recurrent HCC, and its immune stimulation is expected to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Tislelizumab is a new immunotherapy agent with independent intellectual property rights in China, which is highly efficient and safe. It is of great value to combine Tislelizumab with ablation to reduce the risk of recurrence in HCC patients. In this study, early-stage HCC patients with high risk of recurrence would be included and randomly assigned to receive ablation plus Tislelizumab or ablation alone. The tumor recurrence, overall survival and safety would be observed and recorded to analyze whether Tislelizumab can reduce the recurrence rate.
