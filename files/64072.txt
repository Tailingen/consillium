Clinical Study on the Efficacy of Autologous Cell Factor Induced Killer Cells in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
This project plans to use CIK combined with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy to treat CRC patients, so as to explore the effectiveness of CIK treatment and the CRC subtypes more suitable for CIK treatment, thereby improving the survival rate and quality of life of CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens human health, and according to the international agency for research on cancer (IARC) data, in 2018, the number of new cases of CRC totalled more than 1.8 million and the number of deaths totalled more than 88million, making it the third most common cancer worldwide \[1\]. In recent years, with the development of economic level in China, changes in lifestyle and dietary structure, the incidence and mortality of CRC have shown a continuous increasing trend, and it is ranked 5th in all malignant tumors. According to statistics, at present, our country has 376000 new CRC cases and 191000 deaths annually, and the whole face extremely serious challenges.

Patients with advanced CRC have a more complicated disease, and the 5-year survival rate is even less than 5%. A single therapeutic means cannot achieve the desired therapeutic effect, and often multiple therapeutic modalities are used for intervention, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, interventional minimally invasive treatment, immunotherapy and molecular targeting, etc. Because of the potential efficacy of CIK treatment in controlling tumor growth and prolonging patient survival, but there are still few clinical studies about CIK combined with other treatment modalities, this protocol is intended to use CIK combined with chemotherapy, immune and targeted therapy in CRC patients, in order to explore the effectiveness of CIK treatment and more suitable CRC subtypes for CIK treatment, and then improve the survival rate and quality of life of CRC patients.
