A Phase 1 Pilot Study of the Subcutaneous (s.c.) Route to Facilitate the Administration of RRx-001
To investigate the dosage of RRx-001 by the subcutaneous route.
Malignant Solid Tumor|Lymphomas
DRUG: RRx-001
Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, 10 weeks
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of RRx-001-glutathione conjugate, 1 day|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of RRx-001-glutathione conjugate, 1 day
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of RRx-001. Subjects will receive RRx-001 administered as subcutaneous injections twice weekly for at least 8 weeks. At least three subjects must complete 2 weeks of treatment with RRx-001 at each dose level, before escalation to the next higher RRx-001 dose level; 2 doses-16 and 27 mg/m2- will be tested.

The purpose of the study is to extend the dosage options for RRx-001 since faster subcutaneous (SC) administration may increase convenience versus the traditional IV method. The study also will also measure the mean concentrations of an RRx-001 metabolite in the blood (pharmacokinetics; PK) versus the IV formulation.
