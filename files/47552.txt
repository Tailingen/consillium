Phase 1 Safety Testing of SAR405838
Primary Objectives:

* To determine safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR405838 through the characterization of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
* To assess biological activities in patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma during MTD cohort expansion.

Secondary Objectives:

* Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR405838.
* Biomarkers in association with SAR405838.
* Anti-tumor activity in response to SAR405838.
* Food effect on SAR405838 PK.
* Compliance with SAR405838 treatment.
* Cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) activity.
