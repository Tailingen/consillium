3-week plan of S-1 plus Oxaliplatin has been widely used,but it also has cumulative toxicity.Meanwhile elderly patients have poor tolerance and physical condition, we will prove 2-weeks schedule of oxaliplatin plus S-1 have a good efficacy and a better safety for elderly patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.Untreated elderly patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 (D1, q2w) and S-1(40mg BID for body surface area \< 1.25 m2; 50mg BID for body surface area of 1.25-1.5m2; and 60mg BID for body surface area \>1.5 m2; D1-10, q2w) as the first-line treatment. We will investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment, and expect to provide a good effective treatment plan and a better safety for elderly patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer in China.The primary endpoint is progression-free survival(PFS), and the secondary endpoints are objective response rate(ORR), overall survival(OS) and the safety.
