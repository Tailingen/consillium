Effectiveness and Safety of IV Zemplar in Patients on Hemodialysis and With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Using iPTH/100 as Initial Dose
The purpose of this study is to observe the effectiveness and safety of the use of a low initial dose regime (iPTH/100) in chronic kidney disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH\>300pg/mL) and that require dialysis at least 3 times per week.

The Percentage of Patients Reaching at Least a 30% Reduction in PTH and/or Values in Range 150-300 pg/mL, The percentage of participants who achieved at least a 30% reduction in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and/or an iPTH value in the range of 150 to 300 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) at any post-baseline visit during the study. An iPTH value of 150-300 pg/ml is the target range recommended by the NKF KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) for End Stage Renal Disease patients., 24 weeks
Time to Reach the First 30% Reduction in PTH and/or a Value Between 150-300pg/mL, Median time to achieve at least a 30% reduction in intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and/or an iPTH value in the range of 150-300 pg/mL., 24 Weeks|Number of Participants With Hypercalcemia (>10.5mg/dL), Hyperphosphatemia (>6.5mg/dL) and/or Elevations of the Ca X P Product (>65)., The number of participants with hypercalcemia (defined as at least one calcium value of more than 10.5 milligrams per deciliter \[mg/dL\]), hyperphosphatemia (phosphorus value of more than 6.5 mg/dL), and/or elevation of Calcium X Phosphorus product (value greater than 65) during the 24 week study., 24 Weeks
The study will be carried out in three dialysis centers in Peru. Each patient enrolled in the study will be followed during a 6 month period from the time of inclusion. Study visits will occur at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24 during the study.
