Early Assessment of Treatment Response Using Functional Diffusion Mapping
This study will evaluate the feasibility of identifying changes in diffusion MRI characteristics of bone that correlates with response to therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Diffusion MRI
Change in diffusion MRI measurements, Identify changes in Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements and correlate the changes with response to therapy., Baseline, 2 weeks and 9-12 weeks
Change in units/L of CK18Asp306, Levels of CK18Asp396 can be measured in serum using a commercially available ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay). Changes in serum CK18Asp396 (a marker of apoptosis) will be correlated with functional diffusion maps and treatment response., Baseline, 2 weeks and 9-12 weeks|Change in levels of bone turnover markers, Correlate the changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, with functional diffusion maps and treatment response., Baseline, 2 weeks and 9-12 weeks
This study will evaluate a special type of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan that measures the movement of water molecules through tissue called diffusion MRI. Researchers are using this new MRI technology to track the diffusion, or movement, of water through tumor tissue, and map these changes as a cancer patient undergoes treatment. Early research seems to indicate that tumor cells restrict the movement of water, so as tumor cells die, the movement of water changes within the tumor. These changes in the movement (diffusion) of water may help doctors determine earlier than traditional tests whether a patient's cancer is responding (getting better) to treatment. This study will evaluate the feasibility of identifying changes in diffusion MRI characteristics of bone that correlates with response to therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
