Study With Palonosetron Alone in Preventing Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Untreated Patients With Aggressive Non Hodgkin's Lymphomas Who Underwent Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy
This is an open-label, multicenter phase II study in patients with aggressive Non Hodgkin Lymphoma scheduled to receive moderately emetogenic polychemotherapy (according to modified Hesketh classification for antiemetic therapy).
