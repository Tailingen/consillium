A Study to Optimize Care for Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS)
This is a research study for participants who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and are receiving VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) lobectomy or segmentectomy. The overall objective of this study is to develop a database to collect data on participants who are undergoing VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy for lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: VATS-associated best practices
Readmissions rates within 30 days of the patient's surgery date, 30 Days|Incidence of post-operative complications within 30 days of the patient's surgery date, 30 Days|Total inpatient cost, 30 Days
Difference in readmission rates between the two cohorts, To compare current VATS-associated procedures with a set of best VATS-associated practives implemented across the participating study centers, 3 years
This database will be used as for quality improvement purposes. Furthermore, the database will help in collecting data in an organized fashion, which will help the investigators learn more about the details of the workup performed prior to the surgery, during the surgery, peri-operative management and early follow-up. The investigators hope that this database will help to determine a common guideline to perform VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy. By creating a common guideline for future treatment of VATS patients, the investigators predict the efficiency of the process will increase significantly without decreasing, and perhaps even improving, the quality of the procedure.
