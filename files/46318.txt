Study of FCN-011 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor（Phase I）and NTRK Fusion Positive Advanced Solid Tumor （Phase II）
A multicenter, open, single-arm phase I dose exploration and phase II extended study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and primary antitumor activity of FCN-011 in patients with advanced solid tumor (phase I) and NTRK fusion positive advanced solid tumor (phase II)
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: FCN-011
To determine the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events meeting the criteria for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 30 days|The recommended phase II dose for FCN-011, From first dose up to 30 days after last dose|Overall response rate (ORR) by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Baseline up to approximately 1 year
To quantify the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) reported in all subjects who received study drug, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|the death of the last medicine occurred within 30 days of frequency and cause of death, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|The occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs), From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|To quantify the last time point with a quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of FCN-011 after administration as a single agen, 2 months|To measure the time to reach the highest plasma concentrations (Tmax) of FCN-011 after single agent administration, 2 months|To quantify the terminal half-life (T1/2) of FCN-011 after administration as a single agent, 2 months|To quantify the dose-dependent serum concentrations (Cmax) of FCN-011 as a single agent, 2 months
This study is a multicenter, open, single-arm Phase I/II clinical study, which is divided into two research parts, namely phase I dose exploration study and phase II dose extension study. In the phase I dose exploration study, the safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of FCN-011 in patients with advanced solid tumors were determined, the MTD of oral fCN-011 was determined, and the RP2D of FCN-011 in the phase II clinical study was determined, and the efficacy of FCN-011 was preliminarily evaluated. The phase II dose extension study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of continuous oral ADMINISTRATION of FCN-011 in patients with inoperable NTRK fusion and advanced stage III or IV solid tumors, as well as the characteristics of population pharmacokinetics (PopPK).

A total of 35-82 patients were enrolled in this study, 15-24 patients were expected to be enrolled in the phase I study, and 20-58 patients were expected to be enrolled in the phase II study.
