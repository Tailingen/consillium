Radiofrequency Ablation During Surgery in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells. Combining radiofrequency ablation with surgery may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiofrequency ablation with surgery in treating patients who have stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the acute effects of intraoperative radiofrequency tumor ablation (RFA) in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer.
* Determine the treatment-related toxicity in patients treated with this therapy.
* Determine the dimensions of the RFA lesion produced by the ablation procedure in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo intraoperative radiofrequency tumor ablation over 10-15 minutes for each tumor immediately followed by tumor resection.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
