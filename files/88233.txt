Reduction of Allogenic Blood Transfusion in Locally Advanced Kidney Cancer
The Reduction of Allogenic Blood Transfusion in Locally Advanced Kidney Cancer Trial (RESTRICT).

The primary objective is to reduce the number of units of allogenic blood transfusion in locally advanced kidney cancer (â‰¥ cT2). Secondary objectives include reduction in perioperative complications, assessment of recurrence free-survival and improving overall survival.
Kidney Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood Sparing Protocol|PROCEDURE: Standard Blood Replacement
Number of units of allogenic blood transfusions, The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the impact of the blood sparing techniques on the reduction of allogenic blood transfusion in locally advanced kidney cancer. The total number of allogenic blood units used at the end of each case will be assessed, Baseline to 30 days postoperatively
Number of Complications, Number of complications will be assessed by Clavien-Dindo Index

Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions

Grade II Pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I.

Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention

* IIIa Not under general anesthesia
* IIIb Under general anesthesia

Grade IV Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)\* requiring IC/ICU- management

* IVa single organ dysfunction (including dialysis)
* IVb multiorgan dysfunction

Grade V Death, Baseline to 30 days and 90 days postoperatively|Grade of Complications, Grade of complications will be assessed by Clavien-Dindo Index

Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions

Grade II Pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I.

Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention

* IIIa Not under general anesthesia
* IIIb Under general anesthesia

Grade IV Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)\* requiring IC/ICU- management

* IVa single organ dysfunction (including dialysis)
* IVb multiorgan dysfunction

Grade V Death, Baseline to 30 days and 90 days postoperatively|Kidney Cancer Recurrence, Assessment of recurrence of kidney cancer by radiographic imaging (CT or MRI), Up to 3 years postoperatively|Overall Survival, Assessment of survival after surgery, Up to 3 years postoperatively|Quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FSKI-19), Assessment of quality of life measures postoperatively, scores range from 0-76, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms

Score range: 0-76 A score of "0" is a severely symptomatic patient and the highest possible score is an asymptomatic patient., Pre-operative, 1 and 3 months postoperatively
The Reduction of Allogenic Blood Transfusion in Locally Advanced Kidney Cancer Trial (RESTRICT) is a randomized study to investigate blood sparing using autologous normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) or cell salvage at the time of nephrectomy for locally advanced kidney cancer after assessing inclusion criteria patients will be randomized to undergo standard blood management including the possibility of allogenic transfusion vs autologous blood transfusion. There are multiple ways patients can receive allogenic or autologous blood, including veno-venous bypass or cardiopulmonary bypass (typically reserved for patients with a thrombus above the level of the hepatic veins or entering the heart).
