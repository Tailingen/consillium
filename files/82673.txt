The number of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity, as defined in the protocol., Dose-limiting toxicity as described in the protocol that is not related to disease progression, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications and that, despite optimal therapeutic intervention, meets protocol-defined criteria., Minimum observation period 28 days on treatment.|The number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03., Data will include clinical observations, ECG parameters, clinical chemistry and haematology and vital signs assessed as the number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events assessed by CTCAE v4.03., Minimum observation period 28 days on treatment, and will continue until the subject is off the study (approximately 1 year).
Objective Response Rate, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Weeks 8, 16 and 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year).|Duration of Response, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Weeks 8, 16 and 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year).|Clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Up to 24 weeks|Percentage Change in Tumour Size, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Weeks 8, 16 and 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year).|Progression Free Survival, Antitumour activity by evaluation of tumour response assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Weeks 8, 16 and 24 and then every 12 weeks (weeks 36, 48 and 60) until the end of the study (approximately 1 year).|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole at a series of timepoints to derive Cmax, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )|Time to observed Cmax (Tmax) for AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole at a series of timepoints to derive Tmax, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD9833 alone or in combination with Palbociclib, Everolimus, Abemaciclib, Capivasertib, Ribociclib or Anastrozole at a series of timepoints to derive AUC, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )|Renal clearance (CLR) for AZD9833, Urine samples will be collected to assess urine concentrations of AZD9833 at a series of timepoints to derive renal clearance, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period (approximately 16 weeks )|Assessment of biomarker changes, Blood samples will be collected to assess biomarker changes of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and Ki67 protein at a series of timepoints to derive AZD9833 activity in tumour cells., At pre-defined time intervals throughout the AZD9833 treatment period and at discontinuation. (approximately1 year)
This is a multicentre dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD9833, alone (Parts A and B), or in combination with palbociclib (Parts C and D), or in combination with everolimus (Parts E and F), or in combination with abemaciclib (± anastrozole) (Parts G and H), or in combination with capivasertib (Parts I and J), or in combination with ribociclib (± anastrozole) (Parts K and L), or in combination with anastrozole (Parts M and N) in women with endocrine-resistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative intent.
