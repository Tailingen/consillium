Image Guided Radiation Therapy For Prostate Cancer
During the 7 to 8 weeks of conformal radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma, the prostate has an intra-pelvic motion which is not detectable by the conventional portal imaging. This prostate motion may lead to a mistargeting, which possibly decreases the local control. On the other hand, the new 3D on board imaging (3D OBI) allows to localize the target but is expensive. The cost/effectiveness ratio is not well established, as well as the frequency of using such imaging during the course of radiation.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Control position by 3DOBI before the fraction|PROCEDURE: Standard imaging
Prostate position under the LINAC is checked by 3D OBI (mainly cone-beam imaging, CBI) performed before the fraction.|To validate the optimal strategy of IGRT for prostate adenocarcinoma based on 2 and 5 year-disease free survival rates (events= biochemical failure or death).
Rectal and bladder, acute and late toxicities (CTCAE, SOMA-LENT)|Cost comparison and cost/effectiveness analysis|2 and 5 years clinical relapse free survival rates|Lack of dose in the prostate in case of decreasing the CBI frequency (using the 1rst arm for testing)
