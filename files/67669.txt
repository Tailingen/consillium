Autologous Killer Cell Therapy in Colon Cancer Patients
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of activated and expanded autologous cytokine-killer cells in controlling disease recurrence in colon cancer patients with liver metastasis. 20 patients with confirmed stage IV colon carcinoma with metastasis will be assigned into two groups. Patients in both groups will receive the same therapeutic regimen as usual. Patients in one group additionally will be treated with a single infusion of autologous killer cells that had been previously prepared from peripheral blood.
Colon Cancer Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: Cytokine-induced killer cell|OTHER: Chemotherapy AND/OR Radiation Therapy
Safety of administering CIK cells plus chemotherapy, Patients will be continually assessed for unexpected adverse events or unexpected early mortality 30 days post infusion, one month post infusion|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The time from treatment initiation day to first documented progressive disease or death due to disease., 2 years|Time to progression (TTP), the time from randomization until cancer progression, not including death., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), The length of time that the patients are still alive at a defined period of time after treatment, 2 years|Patient quality of life, Quality of patients enrolling in the study assessed using EORTC-CR29 questionnaire, each 3 months for 2 years
