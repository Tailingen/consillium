Prevention of Osteoporosis in Men With Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy (POP Study)
The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effectiveness and safety of once weekly alendronate (Fosamax) in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy and to evaluate maintenance of bone mass following termination of therapy after one year.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Alendronate
Our primary outcome variable will be change in spine bone mineral density over one year and change during the second year (or both years).
Secondary endpoints will be bone mineral density at the hip and lateral spine.
While osteoporosis in women is recognized as a major public health problem, osteoporosis in men also has a profound clinical impact. Men over the age of 75 who sustain hip fractures have a higher mortality than women of the same age (30% versus 9%). Hip fractures in men account for one-third of all hip fractures. In 1995, male osteoporosis accounted for $2.7 billion in health care costs -- nearly one-third of the overall cost of osteoporosis. Alendronate has been shown to improve bone mass and decrease vertebral fractures in men with osteoporosis.

Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and the second leading cause of death in American men. Almost all men who progress to late stage disease are treated with androgen deprivation therapy for life, resulting in a 5-fold increased risk of hip fractures and a 13-fold increased risk of all osteoporosis fractures. Several studies suggest the merit of inducing androgen deprivation much earlier in the course of therapy for prostate cancer. It is therefore quite likely that androgen deprivation strategies will be employed with increasing frequency in patients with less advanced disease, resulting in longer life expectancy but greater bone loss.
