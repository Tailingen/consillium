Zometa and Circulating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastasis
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of Zometa (zoledronic acid, 1 mg per week versus 4 mg every four weeks) on the circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. Sixty patients will be randomized into two groups.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Bone Metastases
BIOLOGICAL: Zoledronic acid|DRUG: Zoledronic acid
Circulating VEGF levels in breast cancer patients with bone metastases, one month
Time to first skeletal-related event, 3 years|Time to bone progression disease, 3 years|Progression-free survival, 3 years|Overall survival, 3 years
The administration of Zometa in short intervals has been implied to be more potent in maximizing its antitumor and antiangiogenesis effects, while dosing every four weeks is an appropriate strategy for the prevention and management of bone metastases. This study was designed to explore the relationship between dosing of Zometa and level of circulating VEGF.
