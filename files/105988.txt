Dynamic Monitoring of ctDNA and HPV DNA in Plasma for the Early Prediction of Recurrence After Cervical Cancer Surgery
Assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of dynamic monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) combined with circulating HPV DNA (cfHPV DNA) for early prediction of recurrence in cervical cancer post-surgery or post-treatment, and compare its advantages and disadvantages with existing diagnostic methods.
