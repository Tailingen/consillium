Papillomavirus Infections
DEVICE: Papilocare vaginal gel
The assessment of effectiveness of PAPILOCARE® in the regression of cervix cytological abnormalities caused by HPV., The percentage of patients with normalized cytology with respective colposcopy findings, as a change from ASCUS or LSIL to normal cytology supported by colposcopy., Assessment at 6 months (or at 12 months)
Assessment of ΗPV clearance, The percentage of patients with complete or partial clearance of HPV confirmed by molecular HPV test (PCR or genetic diagnostic kits) that can detect High Risk (HR) strains., Assessment at 6 months (or at 12 months).|The assessment of patient satisfaction level from treatment, Changes in a 10-point satisfaction scale (0: "not satisfied at all", 10: "completely satisfied") from inclusion date., Assessment at 6 months (or at 12 months).|The assessment of device safety, Recording of adverse events throughout the treatment period., Treatment period (6 or 12 months).
The assessment of biopsy results (where available), The percentage of patients who improve and / or those who maintain the same degree of histological lesion at 6 months or 12 months from baseline., Assessment at 6 months (or at 12 months).
524 participants were enrolled in the study from approximately 44 Greek sites. At baseline (Visit 1) written informed consent was obtained, participants' eligibility criteria were checked and medical history data were collected. Participants were advised to be treated with Papilocare® for 6 months (1 cannula/day for 21 days during first month + 1 cannula/alternate days for subsequent 5 months). At 6 months (Visit 2) primary and secondary objectives were evaluated. If needed and based on physician's decision, treatment was extended to a total of 12 months (Visit 3) and primary and secondary endpoints were evaluated as well.
