Prospective Study of Lymphoproliferative Diseases
This study will help researchers learn more about non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma and how it is treated in Kenya. Researchers want to see if having certain viruses like Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV) affects lymphoma. Patients in Kenya who agree to be in this study will let the resesarchers look at their medical record, follow their normal cancer care, and have blood drawn to look at different proteins and viruses. Researchers would also like to look at part of the original tumor that was taken out of each patient. Some of these samples will be stored at Kenyatta National Hospital and research will be done on them later. This study does not involve any change in treatment, but only allows the study team to follow how a patient in Kenya with lymphoma is treated.

To determine the spectrum and natural history of lymphoproliferative disorders in Nairobi, Kenya, To determine the spectrum and natural history of lymophoproliferative disorders in Nairobi, Kenya by prospectively recruiting subjects with biopsy-proven malignant lymphoma including non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma regardless of age, sex and HIV-serostatus (cohort study), who are seen at the Kenyatta National Hospital for treatment., 2.5 Years
To perform a comprehensive clinicopathological study in these subjects., To perform a comprehensive clinicopathological study in these subjects with complete virological, immunophenotypic, and molecular characterization of retrieved tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples for purposes of identifying prognostic and predictive biomarkers of clinical outcome (i.e. treatment response, freedom from disease progression, and overall survival) in which to begin to frame pragmatic, risk-adapted therapeutic interventions suitable for the resource constrained setting in sub-Saharan Africa., 2.5 Years|Companion R01 proposal: Clinicopathological Cohort Study of EBV-Associated Lymphomas in Kenya, * Aim 1: Determine the tissue biomarkers of EBV infection in AIDS-related lymphomas (ARL) in Kenya
* Aim 2: Compare the pattern of EBV persistence in patients with EBV+ and EBV- lymphoma
* Aim 3: Determine predictors of treatment outcome in AIDS-related lymphomas (ARL), To be submitted next 6 months to 1 year
