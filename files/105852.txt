Anlotinib Plus Everolimus as First-line Treatment for Advanced Non Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride plus everolimus in patients with advanced non clear renal cell carcinoma as first-line treatment.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Anlotinib hydrochloride|DRUG: everolimus
Objective Response Rate(ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on investigator evaluation., up to approximately 24 months
Disease control rate（DCR）, Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), up to approximately 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), The PFS time is defined as time from randomization to locoregional or systemic recurrence, second malignancy or death due to any cause; censored observations will be the last date of: "death", "last tumor assessment", "last follow up date" or "last date in drug log", up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, OS time was censored on last date that participants were known to be alive., up to approximately 24 months
This is a single-arm, phase II trial in non-clear renal cell carcinoma patients. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with everolimus in patients with no systematic treatment advanced non clear renal cell carcinoma.

The primary objective: Overall Response Rate(ORR)(according to RECIST version 1.1). The second objectives: progression free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), Overall Survival(OS) and safety.
