Decellularized, Whole Donor Nipple-Areola Complex Reconstruction Grafts
The goal of this study is to evaluate safety and healing time after nipple-areolar complex (NAC) reconstruction with the BioAesthetics' decellularized human nipple-areolar complex (dcl-hNAC) graft in patients who have had autologous breast reconstruction for breast cancer. Secondary objectives will be to assess patient satisfaction, patient well-being, patient self-esteem, patient body image, patient psychological well-being, nipple dimensions and sensitivity following NAC reconstruction surgery with the BioAesthetics' dcl-hNAC graft.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: NACgraft
Time to healing of implanted NACgraft, Time to healing for each NACgraft will be as the first weekly visit at which the surgeon and central reviewer deem the graft \>99% epithelialized. This measurement will be reported as the number of weeks to healing. Degree of healing will be based on visual assessment by the surgeon and central reviewer with the following metrics on a visual analog scale (VAS): epithelialization (0-100%); granulation (0-100%); overall healing (0-100%). Photographs will be taken using a standardized 3d imaging device, stored and transmitted securely to a central reviewer for independent review. Time to complete healing will be defined as the first visit at which the surgeon and independent reviewer determine that there is \>99% epithelialization of the graft., 14 months
