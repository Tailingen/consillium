Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor Sequential GM-CSF and IL-2 for the Treatment of Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors (PRaG2.0)
This is a prospective multicenter clinical study to determine the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor sequential GM-CSF and IL-2 for advanced multiple metastatic solid tumors
