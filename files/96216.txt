Cryoablation Combined With Sintilimab Plus Lenvatinib in 1L Treatment of Advanced ICC (CASTLE-ICC-Chemo-free)
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib as first-line treatment in patients with advanced ICC.
Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation|DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) evaluated by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator., max 24 months
Duration of Response (DOR) evaluated by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented complete or partial response until disease progression, death from any cause, or censoring at date of last tumor assessment., max 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) evaluated by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from study treatment to disease progression or all-cause death as assessed by the investigator (whichever occurs first), max 24 months|Overall survival (OS) evaluated by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, OS is defined as the time from study treatment to the date of death of the subject, regardless of the cause of death, max 42 months|Disease control rate (DCR) evaluated by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), max 24 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experience at least one AE will be reported., max 42 months
Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus lenvatinib showed increased ORR in many types of human cancers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib as first-line treatment in patients with advanced ICC.
