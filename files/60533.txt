Diffusion -and Perfusion Weighted MRI for Response Prediction of Symptomatic Leiomyomas Following Uterine Artery Embolization
It is known that volumetric response of leiomyomas following uterine artery embolization correlates well with patients clinical outcome. The aim of this study is to assess diffusion -and perfusion weighted MRI for the prediction of volumetric response following uterine artery embolization in patients with symptomatic leiomyomas.
Leiomyomas
PROCEDURE: Diffusion -and perfusion weighted MRI including iv contrast agent injection
Diffusion -and perfusion weighted MRI as a predictor for volumetric response of leiomyomas after uterine artery embolization, Patients will be scanned before (baseline) and after (the day of embolization, 3 days and 3 months after embolization). Measurements of signal intensity (SI) will be performed placing ROIs in the central portion of the lesion avoiding areas of artifact. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) will be calculated at different time points (before and after embolization). Signal intensity measurements on the dynamic contrast enhanced imaging data sets will be performed., Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay (an expected average of 3 days) and will be systematically followed during their follow-up.
