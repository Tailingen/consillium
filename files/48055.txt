Study on Potential Biomarkers Associated With Clinical Phenotype of EGFR-TKIs in No-small Cell Lung Cancer in China
To understand 295 gene mutation mutation status (include EGFR, HER2, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA,ect) by deep sequencing in Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and their relationships with the patients' clinical features (including sex, age, smoking history and adenocarcinoma subtype), specify the predictive significance of the genes mutations for new targeted therapies in NSCLC patients, and better understand the molecular mechanism drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
Potential predictive biomarker to resistant to afatinib, Mutations of whole exon of 295 gene are analysed by deep sequencing in Chinese patients with NSCLC and their relationships with the patients' clinical features , specify the predictive significance of the genes mutations for new targeted therapies in NSCLC patients, and better understand the molecular mechanism drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs, baseline
This study is prospective to identify biomarkers to resistant to afatinibï¼Œgefitinib and erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Mutations of whole exon of 295 gene are analysed by deep sequencing in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer and their relationships with the patients' clinical features (including sex, age, smoking history and adenocarcinoma subtype), specify the predictive significance of the genes mutations for new targeted therapies in NSCLC patients, and better understand the molecular mechanism drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
