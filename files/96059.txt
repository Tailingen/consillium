Articulatory Adaptation Following Oral Cancer Treatment
The goal of this longitudinal study is to learn more about the articulatory consequences of surgical oral cancer treatment. The main aims are to study the coordination and development of speech articulation of patients who will undergo surgical treatment for oral cancer longitudinally and whether individual differences in the reliance on auditory or tactile information can predict the success of speech compensatory strategies.

Participants will perform multiple speech tasks while motion tracking sensors track the articulatory gestures.

Articulatory gestures, Articulatory movements in three dimensions of the tongue, lips and jaw as measured by the NDI Vox Electromagnetic Articulograph. Measures include: articulator speed (mm/s), total displacement (mm), coordinates (x,y,z) during specific gestures., 2022-2025|Acoustic outcomes, Speech acoustics will be measured in Praat and include the first and second formants of vowels (in Hz), global movement size in terms of acoustic working space (Hz-squared), and the centre of gravity of sibilants (in Hz), 2022-2025
