FOLFOXIRI With or Without Bevacizumab as First-line Treatment for Unresectable Liver-only Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients With RAS Mutation-type
BACKGROUND:

For patients with liver-limited metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), complete resection of liver metastases is the only potentially curative treatment. The current goal of medical treatment for colorectal cancer with initially unresectable liver metastases is to maximize the rate of secondary resection and prolong overall survival (OS). A strong correlation was found between response rate and secondary resection rate of metastases, and the triple drugs combination of infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOXIRI) was recommended can be used in selected patients with potentially resectable metastases in order to improve response rate and make resection more possible. The addition of a anti-VEGFs monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to increase response rate, resection rate and improve OS in the first-line treatment of mCRC patients. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in addition to triplet drugs were previously tested in OLIVIA trial, the resection rate of liver metastases of 49% was reported, and the response rate was 81%; most common grade 3-4 adverse events was neutropenia. On the basis of such promising results, we conducted the present randomized study to explore whether FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared with FOLFOXIRI alone as first-line treatment could improve radical resectability in patients with RAS mutation-type, unresectable liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of the FOBULM study is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab compared to FOLFOXIRI alone in patients with initially unresectable liver-limited RAS mutation-type mCRC.

Secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment, efficacy in terms of objective response rate (ORR), OS, progression free survival (PFS), quality of life and an assessment of biomarkers for predictive response and prognosis.

OVERVIEW OF TRIAL DESIGN

This FOCULM trial is a a two-arm, multicenter, open labelled, prospective, randomized phase II studies. Eligible patients with initially unresectable liver-limited mCRC will be randomised 1:1 to receive either FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI alone.
