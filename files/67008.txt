Conversion Therapy of Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Plus Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy in Stage IV Gastric Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to compare Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy combined with Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy as a conversion therapy for gastric Cancer Patients with peritoneal metastasis in Safety and Effectiveness.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Comparing Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: S1
R0 resection rate, 1 year
1 year overall survival, 1 year
Follow-up results from the PHOENIX study failed to show statistical superiority of intraperitoneal paclitaxel plus systemic chemotherapy. However, in the subgroup analysis, it can be seen that after correcting for the bias effect of ascites, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant, further proving the significance of ascites control on the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis. Based on the existing data, for patients with moderate amount of ascites, the IP regimen is recommended to control ascites and relieve ascites. Symptoms, purpose of improving quality of life and prolonging survival. HIPEC is traditionally used to treat peritoneal cancer. Patients who diagnosed with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis were divided into two groups based on whether they underwent HIPEC. The primary endpoint is the R0 resection rate and the secondary endpoints are 1-year overall survival, and Safety.
