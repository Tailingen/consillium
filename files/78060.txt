A Phase II Study of Single Agent MEK162 in Patients With Advanced Melanoma
The study will assess the safety and efficacy of single-agent MEK162 in adult patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic malignant cutaneous melanoma, harboring BRAFV600E or NRAS mutations.
BRAF or NRAS Mutant Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: MEK162
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Objective response as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.0, was defined as participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), were recorded from date of randomization or date of start of treatment until date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and sustained for at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of randomization or date of start of treatment until date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.0, was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization or date of start of treatment to first documentation of PD or date of death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. PD was defined for target disease as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of all measured target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (this included baseline sum if that was smallest on study), sum also demonstrated absolute increase of greater than or equal to (\>=) 5 mm, or appearance of \>=1 new lesions. For non-target disease: PD was defined as unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions and if overall tumor burden increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy; appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion was also considered PD. If a participant did not had an event, data censoring was done at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From date of randomization or date of start of treatment until date of first documentation of PD or date of death due to any cause or date of data censoring, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization or date of start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From date of randomization or date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause or date of censoring, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR:time from first documentation of OR (confirmed CR or PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause/data censoring date,whichever occurred first. As per RECIST v1.0, CR:disappearance of all target(T) and non-target (Non-T) lesions sustained for =\>4 weeks. Any pathological lymph nodes(T or non-T) reduced in short axis to \<10mm. PR:\>=30% decrease in sum of diameters(SOD) of T lesions, taking as reference baseline SOD. PD for T lesions:at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of T lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study treatment, with absolute increase of \>=5 mm,or appearance of \>=1 new lesions.PD for Non-T lesions:unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions/increase in overall tumor burden leading to discontinuation of therapy/appearance of new unequivocal malignant lesion.Data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants without an event,who started new anti-cancer treatment prior to assessment,who missed \>=2 tumor assessments., From first documentation of CR or PR until first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause or data censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.0, was defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization or date of start of treatment until first documented response (CR or PR) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) reduced in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Participants who did not achieve a confirmed PR or CR, were censored at last adequate tumor assessment date when they did not progress (including deaths not due to underlying disease) or at maximum follow-up (from study start to study end date) when participant had an event for progression-free survival., From the date of randomization or date of start of treatment to the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum duration of up to 33 months)|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.0, Adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in participants who received study drug.
