This is an open-label, single-group, Phase I/II study of itacitinib in combination with everolimus in subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL. Phase I will evaluate the safety and tolerability of itacitinib when combined with everolimus in subjects with relapsed refractory cHL using a 3 + 3 design; Phase II will evaluate the efficacy of the combination in subjects with cHL at the dose determined in Phase I using a Simon 2-stage expansion design. Subjects may continue to receive study treatment for 2 years or until evidence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, inability to obtain commercial everolimus or consent withdrawal.
