Effect of Genetic and Epigenetic Factors on the Clinical Response and Toxicity to Cisplatin Among Egyptian Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common histotype according to the global cancer observatory 2022. A variety of therapeutic options for advanced/metastatic non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC have recently been approved based on their impact on patient outcomes in terms of survival and safety profile. Current guidelines advocate for personalized treatment options based on molecular and immunologic characteristics, which drives the physician's decision toward tailored oncology.

In the last two to three decades, hundreds of cancer biological prognostic markers for non-small cell lung cancer have been proposed. Although they have shown a potential in this ﬁeld, validation studies are still required and, to date, there is in suﬃcient evidence to recommend the routine clinical use of any of these putative biomarkers. Therefore, the discovery of robust prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is imperative for advancing treatment strategies for the disease and improving patient care.
