Olaparib in Treating Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer AJCC v6 and v7
DRUG: Olaparib
Objective Response Rate, The primary endpoint was the objective response rate assessed by the investigator using the modified RECIST v1.1 criteria., 5 years 8 months
Progression Free Survival, The Progression Free Survival defined as the time from enrollment until radiologic disease progression and it is assessed by the investigator review using modified RECIST v1.1 criteria or by death by any cause. This was applied to all patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston Tx USA., 5 years 8 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death or last follow up. This was applied to all patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston Tx USA, 5 years 8 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with breast cancer, early onset (BRCA)ness.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To further determine the efficacy of olaparib in the study population.

SAFETY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To identify tissue based biomarkers of defective homologous recombination repair (HRD).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8 weeks thereafter.
