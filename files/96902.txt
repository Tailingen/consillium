Circulating Tumor DNA as Surgical Biomarker in Patients With PancrEatic Adenocarcinoma for Statement of Resectability
The main objective is the evaluation of the prognostic value of ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) as a marker of surgical futility in patients with operable PDAC.
PDAC - Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: ctDNA analysis
Disease relapse, disease relapse at 2 years after surgery, 2 years
In the era of personalized medicine and treatments guided by tumor biology, no specific tumor marker has real prognostic value. This is the reason why the search for a specific marker through a noninvasive blood test that can give indications on the usefulness of the resectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma would be very valuable. Our project proposes the evaluation of ctDNA during various treatment courses of patients with PDAC in order to evaluate its efficacy as a prognostic and predictive marker of response to treatment.
