Neoantigen DNA Vaccine in Combination With Nivolumab/Ipilimumab and PROSTVAC in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
This study study aims to elucidate the immune responses to a shared antigen vaccine (PROSTVAC) and tumor specific antigens generated DNA vaccine in combination with checkpoint blockade using nivolumab (anti-PD-1), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Additionally, the investigators will study the impact of the combination immunotherapy on peripheral T cell activation, as well as immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability to this novel personalized immunotherapy in combination with checkpoint blockade.

BIOLOGICAL: PROSTVAC-V|BIOLOGICAL: PROSTVAC-F|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Neoantigen DNA vaccine|DEVICE: TriGrid Delivery System|PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood|PROCEDURE: Fecal samples|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis
Safety and tolerability of regimen as defined by incidence of adverse events, -Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, Through 100 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 55 weeks)|Immune response as measured by tetramers, -MHC tetramers made against the identified neoantigens will be used to evaluate PBMC for neoantigen-reactive T cells, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Immune response as measured by genomic studies, -Laser capture microdissection will be performed to perform genomic studies on specific areas of tissue, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Immune response as measured by flow cytometry, -Multiparametric flow cytometry or CyTOF will be performed in parallel to evaluate for any shifts (in quality and quantity) in peripheral leukocyte subsets., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Safety and tolerability of regimen as defined by incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), -DLT is defined as any unexpected, treatment-related grade 4 or 5 adverse event that occurs with increased severity or incidence outside of known, expected toxicities, that occur in the first 6 patients enrolled (safety lead-in cohort), Through 100 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 55 weeks)
Failure-free survival (FFS), -Defined as time from day 0 of treatment to evidence of at least one of the following: biochemical failure; radiographic or clinical progression either locally, in lymph nodes, or in distant metastases; or death from prostate cancer) compared to historical controls (ADT + docetaxel). Biochemical failure is defined as three consecutive rises (at lease one week apart) in PSA levels with the date of failure being the midpoint between the PSA nadir and the first PSA rise. Radiographic progression is defined as either RECIST1.1 or PCWG3 criteria., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 65 weeks)|Milestone survival, -Defined as the Kaplan-Meier survival probability, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 65 weeks)|Number of participants who have PSA responses at 30% reduction level, * Baseline PSA prior to start of treatment will be compared to PSA nadir during treatment and then the investigators can calculate how many participants hit 30% reduction from pretreatment levels
* Participants who enroll with no detectable PSA will be considered not evaluable for this outcome measure, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Number of participants who have PSA responses at 50% reduction level, * Baseline PSA prior to start of treatment will be compared to PSA nadir during treatment and then the investigators can calculate how many participants hit 50% reduction from pretreatment levels
* Participants who enroll with no detectable PSA will be considered not evaluable for this outcome measure, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Radiographic progression as determined by RECIST 1.1, At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Radiographic progression as determined by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), * PCWG3 recommends that lymph nodes that were previously normal in size (\< 1.0 cm) or pathologic in size must have grown by at least 5 mm in the short axis from baseline or nadir and be ≥ 1.0 cm in the short axis to be considered to have progressed. If the node progresses to ≥ 1.5 cm in the short axis, it is pathologic and measurable. Nodes that have progressed to between 1.0 and less than 1.5 cm are pathologic subject to clinical discretion and are nonmeasurable
* The date of first metastasis is the date on which an unequivocal visceral lesion by RECIST 1.1 is determined
* Documentation of radiographic evidence of metastatic disease should include the time of the unequivocal development of new sites on bone scintigraphy, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), -Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is the time interval from baseline to the date when the first site of disease is found to progress (using a manifestation-specific definition of progression), or death, whichever occurs first. To better understand the effect of therapy on an individual site of disease, PCWG3 advises the date of progression in all specific sites be reported independently whether it is bone, nodes (pelvic or extrapelvic), visceral (lung, liver, adrenal, or CNS), or other., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)|Comparison of the immune correlates on matched tumor tissue and peripheral blood, Laser capture microdissection will be performed to perform genomic studies on specific areas of tissue (eg tumor core, high TIL areas, tumor-stromal interface, etc). These will be correlated with multiplexed immunofluorescence studies, as well as assays on peripheral blood., Pre- and post-treatment (estimated to be 41 weeks)
