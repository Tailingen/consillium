The goal of this study is to assess response to kisspeptin as well as the baseline patterns of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
Reproductive Disorder|PCOS|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: kisspeptin 112-121
Average change in LH pulse frequency, Average change in LH pulse frequency before and during kisspeptin infusion, 6 hours prior to kisspeptin infusion compared to the final 6 hours of kisspeptin infusion|Average change in LH pulse amplitude, Average change in LH pulse amplitude before and during kisspeptin infusion, 6 hours prior to kisspeptin infusion compared to the final 6 hours of kisspeptin infusion
Assignment: All study subjects will undergo the same interventions. Baseline LH secretion patterns of individuals with PCOS will be compared to their LH secretion patterns while receiving a kisspeptin infusion.

Delivery of Interventions:

* Prior to the inpatient study visit, the subjects will undergo a review of their medical history, physical exam, and screening laboratories.
* On the day of the study, the subjects will have an intravenous (IV) line placed and

  * Undergo up to q10 min blood sampling x 36 hours
  * Receive an infusion of kisspeptin x 24 hours
  * Receive up to two kisspeptin IV boluses
