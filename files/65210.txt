Vemurafenib and TIL Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma
Background:

Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been reported to induce durable clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. From patients own tumor material T cells are extracted, expanded and activated in vitro in a 4-6 weeks culture period. Before TIL infusion patients are preconditioned with a lymphodepleting chemotherapeutic regimen. After TIL infusion, patients are treated with IL-2 to support T cell activation and expansion in vivo.

The BRAF inhibitor is an approved treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by selectively inhibiting the BRAF mutated enzyme, consequently halting the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that vemurafenib has immunomodulatory effects that are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy, which has been confirmed in animal studies.

Objectives:

* To evaluate safety and feasibility when combining vemurafenib and ACT with TILs.
* To evaluate treatment related immune responses
* To evaluate clinical efficacy

Design:

* Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood samples and ECG.
* Patients will start vemurafenib 960 mg BID and will continue during TIL preparation.
* 7 days after start of vemurafenib, patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production.
* Patient stops vemurafenib and is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.
* On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 infusion continually following the decrescendo regimen.
* The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Lymphodepleting chemotherapy|DRUG: TIL infusion|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Number of Reported Adverse Events, Determine the safety of the administration of vemurafenib in combination with TIL therapy including lymphodepleting chemotherapy and interleukin-2 treatment by collecting adverse events according to CTCAE v. 4.0. From start of treatment until 24 weeks after T cell infusion., 0-40 weeks
Treatment Related Immune Responses, Number of patients whose infusion product contained anti-tumor reactive T cells by in vitro testing.

Anti-tumor reactive T cells is defined by positive staining for two of the three markers (interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha and CD107a) in an intracellular cytokine staining using flow cytometry., 0-24 weeks|Objective Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 12 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the start of treatment to death, will be described with the Kaplan-Meier curve., Up to 40 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be described with the Kaplan-Meier curve.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 40 months
