68-Ga-RM2 PET/MRI in Imaging Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
This trial studies how well 68-Ga RM2 works with PET/MRI in imaging patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. 68-Ga-RM2 is an agent used in diagnostic imaging.
Breast Carcinoma|Estrogen Receptor Positive
DRUG: Gallium Ga 68-labeled GRPR Antagonist BAY86-7548|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|DEVICE: Investigational software and coils in PET/MR scan
Detection of ER Positive Breast Cancer and Metastases on 68-Ga RM2 PET/MRI, Number of lesions identified on 68-Ga RM2 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). The outcome will be reported as the number of participants with successful PET based detection of estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer and metastases., up to 2 hours
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the feasibility of 68-Ga RM2 PET/MRI for identification of estrogen receptor positive primary breast cancer and metastases

OUTLINE:

Patients receive 68-Ga-RM2 intravenously (IV) and after 45 minutes undergo PET/MRI over 30-60 minutes.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-72 hours, and then for 12 months.
