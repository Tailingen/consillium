Efficacy of TACE With Endoscopic Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study is aimed to explore the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with endoscopic therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated with esophagogastric varices (EGV) and seek out predictors associated with survival.
