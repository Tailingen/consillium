Toripalimab Combined With CAV/IE Regimen
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CAV/IE chemotherapy combined with toripalimab versus CAV/IE chemotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas who failed in standard treatment.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Toripalimab Combined With CAV/IE chemotherapy|DRUG: CAV/IE alternate chemotherapy
Overall response rate, ORR, The percentage of patients with complete remission and partial remission in patients with evaluable curative effect., up to 24 months
Progression-free survival, PFS, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression or death., Up to 24 months|Disease-free surviva, DFS, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to recurrence of tumor or death., Up to 24 months|Overall survival, OS, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death., Up to 24 months
At present, there are many clinical trials of chemotherapy drugs combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of tumor, but the clinical study of CAV/IE chemotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue sarcoma has not been started, and the related research is still in the blank state. In view of the above problems, to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAV/IE chemotherapy combined with toripalimab versus CAV/IE chemotherapy alone in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue sarcoma patients, so as to provide more treatment options for patients with advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue sarcoma.
