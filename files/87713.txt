Continuous Pre-peritoneal Wound Infiltration Versus Epidural Analgesia in Cancer Surgery
the investigators aim is to investigate the effect of continuous preperitoneal bupivacaine wound infiltration versus epidural analgesia on the inflammatory cytokines response following radical cytectomy
Abdominal Neoplasms
DEVICE: epidural catheter|DEVICE: preperitoneal catheter
changes in the level of inflammatory cytokines in pg /ml, Blood samples taken all over the 24-hr. period were collected in plasma tubes containing ethyl-enediamine-tetra-acectic (EDTA), centrifuged and stored at 20â—‹c for assessment of Plasma concentrations plasma IL 1, IL 6, IL10 and TNF to assess inflammatory cytokines, 24 hours
Visual Analog Scale at rest and on coughing, pain intensity was assessed using a 10-cm VAS (0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain), 24 hours|opioid side-effects, observation of side effects and record incidence as nausea, vomiting and itching, 24 hours|patient satisfaction, scale ranging 1-4 :unsatisfactory, regular, satisfactory and excellent), 24 hours
