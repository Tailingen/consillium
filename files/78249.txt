The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy effects of two doses of asoprisnil (10 mg and 25 mg) compared with placebo when administered daily for 6 months to premenopausal subjects with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata.

No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Asoprisnil (10 mg and 25mg) is being evaluated in a Phase 3 program to establish long term safety and effectiveness and therefore provide women with a medical alternative to surgery.
