Breakthrough Improvement Collaborative for ColoRectal Cancer (BIC4CRC)
Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Europe and the third worldwide. Approximately 1 in 20 men and 1 in 35 women will develop colorectal cancer at some moment in their life. In Flanders, in 2014, there was an increase in the detection of colorectal cancer with 21% compared to 2013. Early detection improves the prognosis for the patient. In this early stage, colorectal surgery is one of the most important treatments, but it is also complex and has a high complication rate. However, over the last decade, surgical care for patients with colorectal cancer has become more standardized. The use of structured care methods, such as care pathways and protocols, has helped in standardizing care processes. Specifically for patients with colorectal cancer, perioperative care has shifted with the implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs. The goal of ERAS- protocols is to optimize the interventions during the perioperative hospitalization period and reduce postoperative complications. Despite the increasing evidence in favor of the use of these standardized protocols, adherence and implementation in daily practice remains challenging.

The primary goal of this quality improvement project is to enhance the standardization of key interventions in the ERAS care process for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

Therefore, adherence to the ERAS-guidelines will be investigated and hospitals will receive feedback to set up improvement initiatives. Moreover, interactive group sessions and on-site training activities will stimulate knowledge sharing and define best practices.
