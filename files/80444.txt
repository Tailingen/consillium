Comparing Transperineal to Transrectal MRI-US Fusion Prostate Biopsy
This will be a prospective cohort trial that compares transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy
Prostate Biopsy
PROCEDURE: Transperineal mpMRI-US Fusion prostate biopsy|PROCEDURE: Transrectal mpMRI-US Fusion prostate biopsy
Detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer, To compare the detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer between transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies., within 2 years
Percentage of cores positive per region of interest (ROI), To determine the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies - Percentage of cores positive per region of interest (ROI), within 2 years|Amount of volume of cores positive per region of interest (ROI), To determine the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies - Amount of volume of cores positive per region of interest (ROI), within 2 years
This will be a prospective cohort trial that compares transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy among men. The target population are males that are schedule to undergo MRI-US Fusion prostate biopsy and have an MRI of the prostate. All the pathological samples would be conducted from the area in the prostate that was found as suspicious of malignancy by previous MRI imaging, and defined as region of interest (ROI).

First the prostate biopsy will be preformed in a transperineal approach; Then a transrectal approach would be used to sample a few more cores.

The primary endpoint will be To compare the detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer between transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies. Additionally, the study aims to determine the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies.
