A Clinical Study of TQB2450 Combined With Anlotinib in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2450 in combination with anlotinib as maintenance therapy in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer who have not progressed after chemoradiotherapy.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Limited Stage
DRUG: TQB2450+Anlotinib|DRUG: TQB2450 placebo + Anlotinib placebo
Progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Random to the time of disease progression or death., up to 33 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by researcher, Random to the time of disease progression or death., up to 33 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from random to death., About 5 years|Objective mitigation rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to the predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit is the sum of the proportion of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)., up to 33 months|Remission duration (DOR), The period when the first judgment is complete or partial remission until it is found to be the progress of the disease., up to 33 months|Disease control rate, The number of cases with remission (PR+CR) and disease stability (SD) after treatment as a percentage of the number of evaluable cases., up to 33 months|No progress survival PFS rate in 12 or 24 months, If the tumor progresses or dies in 12 or 24 months, the time is from the beginning of the follow-up to the event. The proportion of all subjects who have not yet occurred at a certain time is called (no progress) survival rate., up to 33 months
