COBRA-Slim With or Without Fast Access to TNF Blockade for Remission Induction in Early RA
In the Care in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CareRA) trial (NCT01172639) about 70% of early RA patients are in remission at the 2 year evaluation point independent of the combination scheme used.

Interesting to see is that the 30% of insufficient responders can be identified in an early stage of the treatment course.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate if, for patients with an insufficient response to a COBRA-Slim regimen, accelerated access to a short course of anti-TNF therapy already early after treatment initiation (from w8 until w32) could improve outcomes compared to a more traditional treat to target sequence.
