Vitamin C Intravenously With Chemotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose of AA aslo impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phase Ⅰ studies have found that high dose iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients.This protocol is a phase Ⅲ study of AA infusions combined with treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: ascorbic acid|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival, Time-to-event outcome measure (initial disease progression) measured in days from cycle 1 day 1 to day of first progression as defined by RECIST1.1 criteria from NCI, up to 5 years
Overall Survival, Time to event outcome measure (death), measured in days from cycle 1 day 1, up to 5 years|Response Rate, To utilize CT or PET/CT scans to assess overall tumor response rate (complete and partial response) and evaluate disease progression in subjects with advanced or recurrent RAS mutant colorectal cancer treated with the combination of ascorbic acid and FOLOX/FORFIRI +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX/FORFIRI +/- bevacizumab alone, up to 5 years|Assessment of treatment-related adverse events, Assessment of the percentage of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events observed throughout the study, and for 30 days after cessation of study treatment, up to 5 years
Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron have published two retrospective studies about using high dose vitamin C to treat cancer patients forty years ago. Their studies have shown that high dose vitamin C usage could significantly prolong overall survival of patients with advanced cancer. Recently, preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose of AA impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phaseⅠ clinical trials have found that high dose (1.5g/kg or 90g/m2) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients. This protocol is a phase Ⅲ, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab versus treatment with FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.
