Afatinib and Selumetinib in Advanced KRAS Mutant and PIK3CA Wildtype Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multi-center open-label proof-of-concept study consisting of two parts: PART A - a phase I dose-finding study (3 + 3 classical design) evaluating the RP2D of afatinib in combination with selumetinib in KRASm NSCLC; and PART B - a randomized phase II study investigating the progression free survival and safety of selumetinib/afatinib combination therapy compared to standard of care chemotherapy in KRASm NSCLC.

DRUG: Afatinib|DRUG: Selumetinib|DRUG: Docetaxel
Dose Limiting Toxicities (Phase I), Incidence of DLTs in the first treatment cycle, Cycle 1 (4 weeks)|Progression Free Survival (Phase II), PFS measured by RECIST v 1.1, CT scan every 6 weeks and monthly phone call until start of subsequent anticancer therapy or until all patients have been followed up for at least 18 months of have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first
Tolerability (Incidence and severity of adverse events per CTCAE v4.03), Incidence and severity of adverse events per CTCAE v4.03, Up to 28 days after last study drug intake|Plasma concentrations of afatanib and selumetinib, Plasma concentrations of afatanib and selumetinib will be measured at day 1,2,4,8,15, 22 in cycle 1, on day 1 and 2 in cycle 2 and subsequently before every treatment cycle to determine pharmacokinetics of both substances in combination and interindividual differences after a single dose and after multiple doses., On day 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 22 in cycle 1, on day 1 and 2 in cycle 2 and subsequently at every treatment cycle pre-dose|Efficacy (Phase II) (Overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) , time to response (TTR) and overall survival (OS) per RECIST v1.1), Overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) , time to response (TTR) and overall survival (OS) per RECIST v1.1, Assessed by CT scans every 6 weeks and by monthly phone call until all patients have been followed up for at least 18 months or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first.
Determinants and mode of response - Target proteins, Change in expression and/or phosphorylation status target proteins (e.g. pERK, pS6, heregulin, HER2) before, during and after treatment, At baseline, cycle 1 day 15 and at treatment discontinuation (expected 6-9 months after start)|Pharmacogenetics profiling to assess predictors of response and resistance- inducing mutations, Pharmacogenetic profiling to assess predictors of response and resistance- inducing mutations, Before treatment, every 6 weeks and at treatment discontinuation (expected 6-9 months after start)
