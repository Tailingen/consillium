A Study to Investigate the Effect of Itraconazole and Rifampin on Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Vemurafenib at Steady State
This is a two-part, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, two-period, one-sequence study to investigate the effect of itraconazole and rifampin on the PK of vemurafenib following multiple 960 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID) dosing in adult participants with unresectable Stage IIIC or Stage IV metastatic melanoma positive for the BRAF V600 mutation, or other malignant tumor types that harbor a V600-activating mutation of BRAF where the participant has no acceptable standard treatment options.
