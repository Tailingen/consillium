Diagnostic Value of Ultralow-dose Computed Tomography for the Detection of Pulmonary Nodules and Lung Parenchym Alterations Compared to Standard-dose CT
To investigate the diagnostic value of ultralow-dose computed tomography in the detection of pulmonary nodules and lung parenchym alterations (e.g. emphysema) compared to standard-dose-CT.
Multiple Pulmonary Nodules|Pulmonary Emphysema
RADIATION: Ultralow-Dose-CT
Number of pulmonary Nodules detected in the Ultralow-Dose thoracic CT, Difference in nodule detectability in Ultralow-Dose-CT compared to Standard-Dose-CT measured using McNemar test, Participants CT-scan will be read out on an average date of 6 weeks after the scan
Patients BMI (Body mass index), Measures assessed at time of read-out on an average date of 6 weeks after the scan|Patients Nodule size (mm), Measures assessed at time of read-out on an average date of 6 weeks after the scan
