Changes in Phenotype and Genotype of Breast Cancers During the Metastatic Process and Optimization of Therapeutic Targeting (ESOPE)
The primary objective is to compare the phenotype and genotype of the primary tumor with those of its metastases in order to optimize the treatment of metastatic disease, in patients presenting with first metastatic progression of breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
OTHER: biopsy or cytopuncture
To assess the phenotype ant genotype discrepancies regarding hormonal receptor, FISH status and proliferation between the primary tumor and the first metastatic progression., 2 years
