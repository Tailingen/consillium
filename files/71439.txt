Novel Screening Modality for Early Gastric Cancer
Potential patients will be recruited at participating sites based on routine care with clinical indications for upper endoscopy. Following informed consent, patients will undergo their scheduled endoscopy with standard forceps biopsies along with the transepithelial brush samples. All samples, biopsy and brush samples, will be sent for pathology analysis, per standard clinical practice.

Potential patients will be recruited at participating sites based on routine care with clinical indications for upper endoscopy. Following informed consent, patients will undergo their scheduled endoscopy with standard forceps biopsies along with the transepithelial brush samples. All samples, biopsy and brush samples, will be sent for histologic analysis, with planned study of the diagnostic yields of each method.
