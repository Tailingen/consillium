Clinical Presentation
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, which include mycosis fungoides  and Sézary syndrome,  are neoplasias of malignant
T lymphocytes that usually possess the helper/inducer cell surface phenotype and initially present as skin involvement.[
1
]   Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas should be distinguished from other T-cell lymphomas that
involve the skin, such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (CD30 positive),
peripheral T-cell lymphoma (CD30 negative, with no epidermal involvement),
or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (usually with systemic involvement).[
2
,
3
]  For more information about these types of T-cell lymphomas, see
Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
.
Typically, the natural history of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is indolent.[
4
]  Symptoms of the disease
may be present for long periods, in a range  of 2 to 10 years, because cutaneous eruptions wax and wane
before being confirmed by biopsy.  Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are  treatable with
available topical therapy, systemic therapy, or both.  Curative modalities  have
proven elusive, with the possible exception of patients with minimal
disease confined to the skin.
In
addition, several benign or indolent conditions can be confused with
mycosis fungoides.  It is important to consult with a pathologist who has
expertise in distinguishing these conditions.[
1
]
Prognosis and Survival
The prognosis of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas is based on the extent of disease (stage) at
presentation.[
5
] The presence of lymphadenopathy and involvement of
peripheral blood and viscera increase in likelihood with worsening cutaneous
involvement and define poor prognostic groups.[
5
-
8
] The Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium retrospectively reviewed 1,275 patients and found that the following four independent prognostic markers indicate a worse survival:[
9
]
Stage IV disease.
Age older than 60 years.
Large cell transformation.
Elevated lactate dehydrogenase.
The median survival
following diagnosis varies according to stage.  Patients with stage IA disease
have a median survival of 20 years or more.  Most deaths for this
group are not caused by, nor are they related to, mycosis fungoides.[
10
,
11
]  In contrast, more
than 50% of patients with stage III through stage IV disease die of mycosis fungoides, with a
median survival of approximately 5 years.[
7
,
9
,
12
,
13
] The Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic index used male sex, age older than 60 years, plaques, lymph nodes, blood involvement, and visceral involvement as poor prognostic factors to define predicted overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival in both early-stage and advanced-stage groups.[
14
]
A report on 1,798 patients from the
National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program
database found an increase in second malignancies in patients with mycosis fungoides (standardized incidence ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.52), especially for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma.[
15
] Another report on 4,459 patients from the SEER database found that the 19.2% of African American patients with mycosis fungoides had shorter OS, potentially attributable to disease characteristics, socioeconomic status, and type of therapy (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.25–1.74;
P
< .001).[
16
]
Cutaneous disease can manifest as an eczematous patch or plaque stage
covering less than 10% of the body surface (T1), a plaque stage covering
10%  or more of the body surface (T2), or as tumors
(T3) that frequently undergo necrotic ulceration.[
17
,
18
]  Several retrospective studies showed that 20% of patients have disease that progresses from stage I or II to stage III or IV.[
19
-
21
] Sézary syndrome presents with generalized erythroderma (T4) and peripheral blood involvement.  However, there is some disagreement about  whether mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are actually variants of the same disease.[
22
] The same retrospective study with a median follow-up of 14.5 years found that only 3% of 1,422 patients progressed from mycosis fungoides to Sézary syndrome.[
19
]
There is consensus that patients with Sézary syndrome (leukemic involvement) have a poor prognosis (median survival, 4 years), with or without the typical generalized erythroderma.[
23
,
24
] Cytologic transformation from a low-grade lymphoma to a high-grade
lymphoma (large cell transformation) occurs rarely (<5%) during the course of these diseases and is associated
with a poor prognosis.[
25
-
27
]  A retrospective analysis of 100 cases with large cell transformation found reduced disease-specific survival with extracutaneous transformation, increased extent of skin lesions, and CD30 negativity.[
28
] A common cause of death during the tumor phase is
septicemia caused by  chronic skin
infection with staph species, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and fungal skin infections.[
29
,
30
]
Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides  is a variant of mycosis fungoides marked by folliculotropic, rather than epidermotropic, neoplastic infiltrates, with preferential location in the head and neck area.[
31
] Early plaque-stage folliculotropic mycosis fungoides have a very indolent prognosis, while extracutaneous disease portends a very poor prognosis.[

Cellular Classification of Mycosis Fungoides and Other Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas
The histological diagnosis of mycosis fungoides  and other cutaneous T-cell lymphomas 
is usually difficult to determine in the initial stages of the disease and may require the
review of multiple biopsies by an experienced pathologist.
A definitive diagnosis from a skin biopsy requires the presence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells
(convoluted lymphocytes), a band-like upper dermal infiltrate, and epidermal
infiltrations with Pautrier abscesses (collections of neoplastic
lymphocytes).  A definitive diagnosis of Sézary syndrome may be made from a peripheral blood
evaluation when skin biopsies are consistent with the diagnosis. Supportive evidence for circulating Sézary cells is provided by T-cell receptor gene analysis, identification of the atypical lymphocytes with hyperconvoluted or cerebriform nuclei, and flow cytometry with the characteristic deletion of cell surface markers such as CD7 and CD26.   However, none of these is individually pathognomonic for lymphoma.[
1
,
2
]
Established criteria for defining Sézary syndrome generally require identification of (1) a circulating T-cell clone by rearrangement of the T-cell receptor, plus (2) a level of Sézary cells in the blood of at least 1,000/μL.[
3
,
4
] It is less clear if other findings (such as a CD4:CD8 ratio ≥10, or the use of percentages instead of absolute numbers of atypical lymphocytes by flow cytometry) are reliable staging data in the absence of blood Sézary cell levels of at least 1,000/μL.[

Stage Information for Mycosis Fungoides and Other Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.[
1
]  Peripheral blood
involvement with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma  cells is correlated with more
advanced skin stage, lymph node and visceral involvement, and shortened
survival.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas also have a formal staging system proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer.[

For skin,
patch
indicates any size skin lesion without significant elevation or induration. Presence/absence of hypo- or hyperpigmentation, scale, crusting, and/or poikiloderma should be noted.
c
For skin,
plaque
indicates any size skin lesion that is elevated or indurated. Presence/absence of scale,  crusting, and/or poikiloderma should be noted. Histological features such as folliculotropism, large cell transformation (>25% large cells) and CD30 positivity or negativity, as well as clinical features such as ulceration, are important to document.

candidates for clinical trials evaluating new approaches to treatment.

Current Clinical Trials
Several forms of treatment can completely resolve skin
lesions at stages I and II, so the choice of therapy depends on local expertise
and the facilities available.  With therapy, the survival of patients with
stage IA disease can be expected to be the same as for age- and sex-matched
controls.[

There is no curative therapy and no clear difference in overall survival (OS) among the treatment options for patients with stage I and stage II mycosis fungoides.
A randomized study of 103 patients compared combined total-skin electron-beam radiation
(TSEB) plus combination chemotherapy with  sequential topical therapies.[
4
]  In the latter group, combination
chemotherapy was reserved for patients with symptomatic extracutaneous disease or disease
that was refractory to topical therapies.  Patients with any disease stage were eligible. 
Although the complete response rate was higher with combined therapy, toxic
effects were considerably greater,  and no difference was seen in disease-free
survival (DFS) or OS between the two  groups.[

Mycosis Fungoides
There is no curative therapy and no clear difference in overall survival (OS) among the treatment options for patients with stage III and stage IV disease.
The use of single alkylating agents has produced objective responses in 60% of
patients, with a duration of less than 6 months.  One of the alkylating agents
(e.g., mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil) or the antimetabolite
methotrexate is the most frequently used.  Single agents have not cured any patients, and insufficient data exist to determine whether these
agents prolong survival.  Combination chemotherapy is not definitely superior
to single agents.  Even in patients with stage IV disease, treatments directed at the skin
may provide significant palliation.
A randomized study of 103 patients compared combined total-skin electron-beam radiation
(TSEB) plus combination chemotherapy with conservation therapy consisting of
sequential topical therapies.[

]  In the latter group, combination
chemotherapy was reserved for patients with symptomatic extracutaneous disease or disease

Sézary Syndrome
Sézary syndrome is a rare leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is characterized by erythroderma, circulating Sézary cells with cerebriform nuclei, lymphadenopathy, and pruritus.[

] This condition typically progresses rapidly, with only a short duration of response to most therapies. A retrospective review of 176 patients with Sézary syndrome identified the following poor prognostic factors:[

High lactate dehydrogenase.
Previous diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.
Presence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in skin, blood, or both.
Remissions attained by using extracorporeal photophoresis, interferon alfa, or retinoids may be followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant. In an anecdotal series of 16 patients with Sézary syndrome after allogeneic transplant, 9 were in complete remission after 4 years.[

Radiation therapy
Photodynamic therapy
Chemotherapy
Other drug therapy
Biological therapy
Allogeneic stem cell transplant
Targeted therapy
Current Clinical Trials
The treatment of patients with relapsed mycosis fungoides  and Sézary syndrome involves the joint decisions of a dermatologist, medical oncologist, and
radiation oncologist.  It may be possible to re-treat localized areas of
relapse in the skin with additional electron-beam radiation therapy or  to repeat total-skin electron-beam radiation therapy (TSEB).[
1
]  Photon radiation to bulky skin or
nodal masses may prove beneficial.  If these options are not possible, then
continued topical treatment with other modalities, such as mechlorethamine or
psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) may be warranted to relieve
cutaneous symptoms.
Patients should consider clinical trials as a therapeutic
option.
Treatment Options for Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome
Treatment options under clinical evaluation  for recurrent mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome include the following:[

]
Radiation therapy
.
Photodynamic therapy
.
Chemotherapy
.
Other drug therapy
.
Biological therapy
.
Allogeneic stem cell transplant
.
Targeted therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Additional electron-beam radiation therapy or a repeat of TSEB.
Electron-beam radiation therapy of
appropriate energies will penetrate only to the dermis, and thus, the skin alone
can be treated without systemic effects.  This therapy requires a
radiation therapy facility with physics support and considerable
technical expertise to deliver precise dosimetry. TSEB can result in short- and long-term cutaneous
toxic effects and is not widely available.
This therapy can provide excellent palliation, with
complete response rates as high as  80%, and may be combined with systemic treatment. Based on the long-term survival of
these early-stage patients, electron-beam radiation therapy is sometimes used with 
curative intent.[
4
-
8
]  Long-term disease-free survival (DFS) can be achieved in
patients with unilesional mycosis fungoides treated with local radiation
therapy.[
9
]
Photon radiation to bulky skin or nodal masses.[
10
]
Photodynamic therapy
PUVA radiation therapy.[
11
-
16
]
Therapeutic trials with PUVA
have shown an 80% to 90% complete remission rate in patients, with those in early cutaneous stages
achieving the best responses.  PUVA may be used in conjunction with systemic
treatment.[
15
]  Continued maintenance therapy with PUVA at more
protracted intervals is generally required to prolong remission duration.[
11
-
13
,
15
] 
PUVA combined with interferon alfa-2a is associated with a high response 
rate.[
14
,
15
]
Narrowband ultraviolet B radiation.[
17
,
18
]
Single-arm and retrospective comparisons confirm the efficacy of narrowband ultraviolet B with 80% to 90% complete remission rates, especially for patients with early cutaneous stages.[
17
,
18
]
A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis compared PUVA with narrowband ultraviolet B radiation in 778 patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (stage IA, IB, and IIA). Significantly higher complete response rates were seen in patients treated with PUVA (73.8% vs. 62.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.76;
P
= .04). There were  no significant differences in adverse effects.[
16
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) has produced tumor
regression in patients who are resistant to other therapies.[
19
,
20
]
In a retrospective analysis of 65 patients, with a median follow-up of 48 months, use of ECP in the first to third line of treatment yielded a longer median time-to-next treatment (TTNT) than other systemic options (
P
< .03).[
21
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Chemotherapy
Topical treatment with mechlorethamine or PUVA.
This form of treatment may be
used palliatively or to supplement therapeutic approaches directed against
nodal or visceral disease.  Topical application of
mechlorethamine has produced regression of cutaneous lesions, with particular
efficacy in early stages of disease.  The overall complete remission rate is
related to skin stage; 50% to 80% of TNM classification T1 patients, 25% to 75% of
T2 patients, as many as  50% of T3
patients, and 20% to 40% of T4 patients  have complete responses.  The overall complete remission rate in 243 patients
was 64% and was related to stage; as many as 35% of stage IV patients had complete
responses. Treatments are usually continued for 2 to
3 years.  Continuous 5-year DFS may be possible in  as many as 33% of T1 patients.[

Pralatrexate (folate analogue).[
24
,
25
]
Chemotherapeutic agents generally yield short durations of response. In a retrospective review of 198 patients with advanced-stage disease, the median TTNT was 4 months.[

Targeted therapy
Brentuximab vedotin.[

Mogamulizumab.[
48
]
In a prospective randomized trial, 372 previously treated patients received either mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against C-C chemokine receptor 4, or the HDACi vorinostat.
With a median follow-up of 17 months, the median progression-free survival was 7.7 months for patients who received mogamulizumab and 3.1 months for patients who received vorinostat (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41−0.69;
P
< .0001).[
48
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Mogamulizumab appeared to be especially effective in patients with blood involvement, such as those with Sézary syndrome.
This preliminary study was not designed to detect differences in OS.
Mogamulizumab is often avoided in patients scheduled to undergo allogeneic SCT, based on data from a Japanese study that showed an increased risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated with mogamulizumab beforehand.[
49
] The relevance of these findings in other countries and the impact of different GVHD prophylaxis regimens in these patients remains to be determined.

Treatment of Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma presents in the skin only with no preexisting lymphoproliferative disease and no extracutaneous sites of involvement.[
1
-
3
] Patients with this type of lymphoma have disease ranging from clinically benign lymphomatoid papulosis, marked by localized nodules that may regress spontaneously, to progressive and systemic illness requiring aggressive doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy. This spectrum has been called the primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Patients with localized disease usually undergo radiation therapy. With more disseminated involvement, watchful waiting or doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy is used.[

Treatment of Subcutaneous Panniculitis-Like T-Cell Lymphoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma  (SPTCL) is localized to subcutaneous tissue and can be associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).[
1
-
4
] Anecdotal reports suggest that the presence or absence of HLH is an important prognostic indicator.[
5
] Patients with SPTCL  have cells that express alpha-beta phenotype.
Patients with gamma-delta phenotype have a more aggressive clinical course that is instead classified as primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma.[
6
-
8
] For more information, see
Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
.
The management of SPTCL depends on the clinical presentation—including the severity of symptoms, cytopenias, and the presence or absence of HLH—and the apparent disease trajectory and aggressiveness. Indolent or smoldering forms of SPTCL are often treated with immunosuppression, including oral methotrexate [
9
] or cyclosporine.[
10
] In contrast, aggressive forms are frequently treated with combination chemotherapy such as CHO(E)P (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with or without etoposide) with variable responses per anecdotal reports.[
11
] The JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has also been used in SPTCL with associated HLH, including anecdotal reports of responses in patients with disease that did not respond to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) therapy.[
12
]  In cases of particularly aggressive or relapsed disease, consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant has also been used.[

Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGDTCL) is a rare and extremely aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with a poor prognosis. These patients may manifest involvement of the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous region, or mucosa with or without ulceration. PCGDTCL is treated similarly to the most aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas, with CHO(E)P (cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with or without etoposide).[

Treatment of Primary Cutaneous Aggressive Epidermotropic CD8-Positive T-Cell Lymphoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8-positive T-cell lymphoma is another rare and especially aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Patients typically present with ulcerative plaques or tumors, and mucosal involvement is common. Neoplastic cells are characterized by expression of CD8 and a cytotoxic phenotype.[
1
] Multimodal chemotherapy, such as CHO(E)P (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with or without etoposide), is often used. Outcomes are generally poor, and prolonged remissions are extremely uncommon in the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplant.[

Cellular Classification of Mycosis Fungoides and Other Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas
Added
text
to state that established criteria for defining Sézary syndrome generally require identification of (1) a circulating T-cell clone by rearrangement of the T-cell receptor, plus (2) a level of Sézary cells in the blood of at least 1,000/μL (cited 2007 Olsen et al. as reference 3 and 2022 Olsen et al. as reference 4). It is less clear if other findings are reliable staging data in the absence of blood Sézary cell levels of at least 1,000/μL (cited Chrisman et al. as reference 5).
