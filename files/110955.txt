MOONRAY-01, A Study of LY3962673 in Participants With KRAS G12D-Mutant Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to assess safety \& tolerability and antitumor activity of LY3962673 as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapy agents in participants with KRAS G12D-mutant advanced solid tumor types. The study is expected to last approximately 5 years.
