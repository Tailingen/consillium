Clinical Application of Near-infrared Whole Body Heat Shock Multimodal Technique in Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
In this study, we propose to use the combination of ET-SPACE NIR irradiation whole-body thermal stimulation, ICI (Tislelizumab), and RTK inhibitor (Anlotinib) in the multimodal treatment of CRPC.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
DRUG: Immunotherapy|DRUG: Targeted therapy|DEVICE: Hyperthermia
Biochemical objective response rate (BORR), Detect blood PSA levels before and during treatment, compare baseline and post treatment PSA difference levels, and evaluate efficacy.

Bio Complete Response (BCR): PSA remains normal or decreases to normal (4ng/mL) for at least 3 weeks.

Partial Biochemical Response (BPR): PSA decreased by ≥ 50% from baseline and maintained for at least 3 weeks.

BPRR=BCR+BPR/All patients × 100%., 3 weeks
Bio-Disease Control Rate （BDCR）, Bio Complete Response (BCR): PSA remains normal or decreases to normal (4ng/mL) for at least 3 weeks.

Partial Biochemical Response (BPR): PSA decreased by ≥ 50% from baseline and maintained for at least 3 weeks.

Bio Progression Disease (BPD): PSA increased by ≥ 25% from baseline. BDCR=BCR+BPR+BPD/All patients × 100%., 3 weeks
The initial efficacy and safety of the multimodal therapy will be evaluated at the animal level to fully validate the potential feasibility of the therapy. Subsequently, the efficacy of the multimodal therapy will be verified at the organoid level, and based on which a translational randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the multimodal therapy at the human level, and the patients will be followed up for a long period of time, so as to collect detailed data on improvement of the quality of life. Finally, the synergistic effect of the multimodal therapy will be analyzed at the molecular and cellular levels.
