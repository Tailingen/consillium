For this study, the investigators propose a novel design to safely achieve tumor radiation dose escalation with proton therapy plus standard-of-care concomitant chemotherapy. Through mid-treatment image guidance, the tumor boost dose is determined; subsequently, only that GTV boost will receive a total dose of 80 Gy through hybrid hyperfractionation. This refers to twice-daily radiation in the last 15 fraction days. The combination of boost dose hyperfractionation and proton therapy is anticipated to prevent critical normal tissue damage within both the high- and intermediate-dose regions. This novel treatment approach aims to minimize critical toxicities while improving locoregional control for head and neck cancer patients who are at a higher risk of disease relapse.
