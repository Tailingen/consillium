A Collaborative Community Effort Using Belantamab Mafodotin in Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma
This is a research study to find out if a drug called belantamab mafodotin in combination with dexamethasone, a steroid, can be safely and effectively given in the community setting. Belantamab mafodotin (BLENREP) was approved in the US in August 2020 under an FDA program called accelerated approval. In November 2022, belantamab mafodotin was removed from the market because a study to further confirm its activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma did not deliver a supporting result. However, this confirmatory study demonstrated that some patients may still benefit from treatment with belantamab mafodotin, and that this benefit can be long lasting. Belantamab mafodotin is often given at large academic medical centers every 3 weeks. This study will assess whether it is possible to administer belantamab in the community setting every 6 weeks. It is unknown if administering belantamab every 6 weeks versus every 3 weeks will result in improved safety and/or reduced efficacy.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Belantamab mafodotin
Assess the feasibility of providing Belantamab mafodotin in a heavily pretreated, rural population of patients with multiple myeloma receiving this study regimen every 6 weeks instead of every 3-week cycles., Belantamab mafodotin will be evaluated in participants with RRMM (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma) in the community as assessed through the rate of 'unacceptable toxicity' and response rate as defined in Table 7 through all cycles, From registration until stopped early due to excess unacceptable toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Subjects followed for 2 years from end of treatment
Describe the efficacy of Belantamab mafodotin specifically in the elderly frail sub-population defined by the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) Geriatric Assessment, The score system (range 0-5), based on age, comorbidities, cognitive and physical conditions, developed by Palumbo A. et al1, identifies 3 groups of patients:

* Fit (score=0)
* Intermediate-Fitness (Score=1)
* Frail (Score â‰¥2), From registration until stopped early due to excess unacceptable toxicity and/or lack of efficacy. Subjects followed for 2 years from end of treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Full Analysis Population), ORR was determined according to the 2016 international myeloma working group (IMWG) response criteria by IRC. ORR was calculated as the percentage of participants with a confirmed partial response (PR) or better (that is \[i.e.\], PR, very good partial response \[VGPR\], complete response \[CR\] and stringent complete response \[sCR\]). Confidence intervals were based on the exact method., Up to 48 weeks|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) by Investigator Assessment (Full Analysis Population), CBR was determined by the investigator according to the 2016 IMWG response criteria. CBR was calculated as the percentage of participants with a confirmed minimal response (MR) or better (i.e., MR, PR, VGPR, CR and sCR). Confidence intervals were based on the exact method., Up to 48 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR) by Investigator Assessment (Full Analysis Population), DoR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of PR or better until the earliest date of documented disease progression (PD) per IMWG response criteria; or death due to PD among participants who achieved an overall response, i.e., confirmed PR or better. DOR based on responses assessed by investigator is presented. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of DOR are presented, Up to 48 weeks|Time to Response by Investigator Assessment (Full Analysis Population), Time to response is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first documented evidence of response (PR or better), among participants who achieve a response (i.e., confirmed PR or better). Time to response based on responses assessed by investigator is presented. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of time to response are presented., Up to 48 weeks|Progression Free Survival by Investigator Assessment, Progression free survival is defined as the time from enrollment until the earliest date of documented PD per IMWG, or death due to any cause. Progression free survival based on responses assessed by investigator is presented. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of progression free survival are presented., Up to 48 weeks|Time to Progression by Investigator Assessment, Time to progression is defined as the time from enrollment until the earliest date of documented PD per IMWG, or death due to PD. Time to Progression based on responses assessed by investigator is presented. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of time to progression are presented., Up to 48 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. Median and inter-quartile range (first quartile and third quartile) of overall survival are presented., Up to 48 weeks|Assess the safety of belantamab mafodotin in the elderly frail population for unacceptable toxicity Grade 3 or higher, The safety profile of belantamab mafodotin will be evaluated in participants with RRMM in the community as defined by the standard clinical and laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry, physical examination, vital sign measurements, and diagnostic tests) through the collection of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)., All adverse events whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the start of treatment until 70 days after the last dose of study treatment, until the subject withdraws consent for study participation, or until the subject starts new treatment|Corneal events will be graded according to the KVA Scale, All adverse events whether serious or non-serious, will be reported, From the start of treatment until 70 days after the last dose of study treatment, until the subject withdraws consent for study participation, or until the subject starts subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
