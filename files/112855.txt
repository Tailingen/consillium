MRD-directed Therapy for Low-risk and Intermediate-risk AML.
Acute myeloid leukemia(AML) patients with favorable and intermediate cytogenetics at diagnosis are generally excluded from first-line allo-SCT. However, these patients may eventually relapse in some cases. Our previous study found that stratification of treatment based on cytogenetics and therapeutic response could benefit low and intermediate AML. To further verify the results, we conducted a prospective multi-center study. The purpose of this study is to establish risk stratification based on cytogenetics and minimal-residual-disease (MRD) analysis to determine whether a MRD-directed therapy for low and intermediate AML patients has positive results in terms of overall survival.
