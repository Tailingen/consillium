Effect of Short Term Adrenal Suppression on Androgen Overproduction in Overweight Girls With Androgen Excess
Short term hydrocortisone to test whether improves excess androgen production from adrenal gland and ovaries
Hyperandrogenemia|Obesity|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Hydrocortisone
Changes in free testosterone after ACTH administration before and after hydrocortisone administration for 4 weeks, 30 and 60 minutes after ACTH, baseline, and after 4 weeks of hydrocortisone administration
Changes in adrenal steroid precursors after ACTH, baseline, and after 4 weeks of hydrocortisone administration, 30 and 60 minutes after ACTH, baseline, and after 4 weeks of hydrocortisone administration
This study will test whether short-term suppression of adrenal function can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that one month of oral hydrocortisone administration will improve androgen levels in girls with adrenal androgen overproduction. Specifically, this intervention will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation testing with adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH).
