Correlation Between Skin Carotenoid Levels and Previous History of Skin Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the difference of skin carotenoid levels between subjects with previous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), subjects with previous basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and a control group.

Skin Carotenoid Levels in Subjects With History of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Versus Control Subjects, Mean carotenoid levels in subjects with a history of squamous cell carcinoma were compared to mean carotenoid levels in control subjects without a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer., baseline
Skin Carotenoid Levels in Subjects With History of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Versus Subjects With History of Basal Cell Carcinoma, baseline|Skin Carotenoid Levels in Subjects With History of Basal Cell Carcinoma Versus Control Group, baseline
There has been experimental and clinical research evaluating association of different carotenoids and incidence of malignancies, including Non- Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC). An easy and inexpensive way to determine which subjects would benefit from supplementation with carotenoids or retinoids could be the measurement of skin carotenoid levels.The least invasive way to perform it is through Raman spectroscopy which is a technique that uses a laser light that can be used to quantify carotenoids on the skin. We will compare the skin carotenoid levels of subjects with previous history of SCC or BCC and subjects without history of previous NMSC.
