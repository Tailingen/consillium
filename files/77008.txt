Ph 1/2 CTO With Lomustine for Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioma
This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of CTO with lomustine in patients with recurrent malignant glioma to be treated at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke. The Primary Objectives are:

* Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CTO when combined with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV) who have not been previously treated with bevacizumab.
* Phase 2: To assess the efficacy of CTO (either in monotherapy or in combination with lomustine) compared to lomustine alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant gliomas that have not been previously treated with bevacizumab based upon 6-month progression free survival (PFS6).

Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.
Malignant Glioma (WHO Grade III or IV)
DRUG: CTO|DRUG: Lomustine
Phase 1: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CTO when combined with lomustine, A standard "3+3" design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. Subjects will be administered CTO orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule, while subjects will receive oral lomustine (110 mg/m2) every 6 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will accrue at each dose level of CTO, beginning with 225 mg/m2, until MTD is defined. The MTD is the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 experienced DLT., 1 year|Phase 2: Percentage of subjects who remain alive and progression-free at 6 months, Percentage of participants surviving six months from date of randomization without progression of disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, or to death due to any cause., 6 months
Phase 2: Percentage of subjects who experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during any cycle of protocol treatment, All toxicities will be collected using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. DLTs will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributable to CTO or lomustine:

Non-hematologic:

* Nausea/vomiting of Grade 3 or greater despite maximal antiemetic therapy
* Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater despite maximal antidiarrheal therapy
* Any other Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity

Hematologic:

* Any Grade 4 neutropenia
* Grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever of any duration or where significant sepsis results
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 2 years|Phase 2: Median Overall Survival (OS), Time in months from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. Patients alive as of the last follow-up had OS censored at the last follow-up date. Median OS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., 2 years|Phase 2: 12 month Overall Survival (OS), Percentage of participants surviving 12 months from date of randomization. OS was defined as time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause., 12 months|Phase 2: Percentage of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), Response is based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria as determined by investigator assessment. A confirmation of response was not required. Complete Response was defined as complete disappearance on MRI/CT of all enhancing tumor and mass effect, off all corticosteroids (or receiving only adrenal replacement doses), accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination, and maintained for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MRI/CT by bi-dimensional measurement, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids, accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination, and maintained for at least 4 weeks., 2 years|Phase 2: Median PFS, Time in months from date of randomization to the date of first progression according to RANO criteria, or to death due to any cause. Patients alive who had not progressed as of the last follow-up will have PFS censored at the last follow-up date. Median PFS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., 2 years
In the Phase 1 component of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the combination of CTO with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade III or IV). All patients will be bevacizumab-naïve. The dose escalation will be a standard "3+3" design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. The Phase 2 portion of this study will be a randomized screening study comparing CTO alone (Arm A) versus CTO with lomustine (Arm B) versus lomustine alone (Arm C) in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma who are bevacizumab-naïve. Subjects will be randomized with a treatment arm allocation ratio of 2:2:1.

Based on the results of patients who have already taken part in Phase 1 of the study, the Principal Investigator has decided to reduce the dose of lomustine used in combination with CTO in this study by 25% of the FDA-approved dose, due to hematologic side effects (side effects related to lower than expected blood counts). Therefore, the dose of lomustine received in combination with CTO is approximately 75% of the standard recommended dose.

Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.
