SGB Reduces the Incidence and Severity of CSA-AKI
The incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery is high, which increases postoperative mortality and is not conducive to the prognosis of patients. Stellate ganglion blocks increase renal blood flow, reduce inflammation and stress, and protect the heart muscle. In this study, stellate ganglion block was used to promote rapid recovery of kidney function after cardiopulmonary bypass cardiac surgery.
Stellate Ganglion Block
DRUG: Stellate ganglion block
The incidence and severity of CSA-AKI, Postoperative serum creatinine was detected once a day from the patient's arrival in the ICU until postoperative day 7. The severity of CSA-AKI was graded by the change in the plasma creatinine levels, according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, From the end of surgey to postoperative day 7
Changes of intraoperative left RBF parameters, The peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), mean blood flow velocity (V-mean), the diameter of the left renal artery (RAD)and velocity time integral (VTI) of the left renal artery were measured, 5 minutes after general anesthesia induction,15 minutes after the SGB procedure in Group S and 20 minutes after the completion of the first TEE examination in Group C, and 30 minutes after the end of CPB|Changes of perioperative BNP, CK-MB, IL-6, CRP, IL-18, and norepinephrine levels, Venous blood samples were collected to test BNP (Brain natriuretic peptide), CK-MB (Creatine kinase isoenzymes), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-18, and norepinephrine levels., preoperatively, Immediately after the surgery,the first day after surgery,the second day after surgery, and the seventh day after surgery|Comparison of recovery indicators between the 2 groups, The duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, length of ICU stay, length of postoperative hospitalization in the ward, and in-hospital mortality were recorded, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Hemodynamic changes during surgery., The MAP from the radial artery,HR,CVP, and cardiac output., after radial artery cannulation,5 min after general anesthesia induction,15 min after the SGB procedure ,30 min after CPB initiation,30 min after the end of CPB,and the end of surgery.
