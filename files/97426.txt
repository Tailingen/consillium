Venetoclax Combined With Homoharringtonine and Cytarabine in Induction for AML
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combined with homoharringtonine and cytarabine in the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

This is a phase II/III study that seeks to treat patients ages 18-60 who have acute myeloid leukemia but have never been treated before. In order to improve the outcome of patients with primary AML, venetoclax combined with homoharringtonine and cytarabine was applied in the treatment of primary AML. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with homoharringtonine and cytarabine in newly diagnosed subjects with AML.Depending on the level of recovery, patients will either be forced to come off study or have the option to continue the medication, receive maintenance therapy, or pursue an allogeneic stem cell transplant. After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 to 6 months for up to 2 years.
