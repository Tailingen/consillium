DEVICE: VIO System
VIO System Imaging Performance, Quantify imaging performance in various types of skin, which may include estimated in vivo resolution and imaging depth. Various types of skin includes skin of different people as well as skin in different locations on the body, and skin with skin disease, including basal cell carcinoma.

VIO System device design characteristics were iterated during the study to optimize image quality across subjects with various skin types, body locations, and skin disease states. The outcome measure of device imaging performance (acceptable/not acceptable) was assessed through engineering expert review of VIO images. The engineering expert review determined whether images were of consistent quality., 3 hours|VIO System Image Quality, Qualitatively evaluate image quality and interpretability by physicians trained in dermatopathology as a function of skin type.

VIO System device design characteristics were iterated during the study to optimize image quality across subjects with various skin types, body locations, and skin disease states. The outcome measure of device image quality (acceptable/not acceptable) was assessed through clinical expert review of VIO images. The clinical expert review determined whether VIO images could be interpreted by physicians trained in dermatopathology., 3 hours
