Individualized Lung Recruitment Maneuver Guide by Pulse-oximetry in Anesthetized Patients
General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation promotes atelectasis and airway closure. The open-lung approach (OLA) strategy restores the functional residual capacity. Pulse oximetry hemoglobin saturation (SpO2) using room air can diagnose shunt induced by lung collapse during general anesthesia and the SpO2 breathing air was useful to detect the lung´s opening and closing pressure during a recruitment maneuver (RM) in morbidly obese anesthetized patients.

Investigators hypothesized that the SpO2 breathing air can personalize the open-lung approach.

open-lung condition, The role of the SpO2 to detect lung´s closing and opening pressures was evaluated by the discrete receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. With PtpEE and PaO2/FIO2 as the reference methods, a binary classification of "1" to the open-lung condition defined as positive PtpEE or PaO2/FIO2 \>400 mmHg and "0" presence of lung collapse defined as negative PtpEE or PaO2/FIO2 \<400 mmHg. Also, a value of "1" was assigned when the SpO2 was ≥ 97% and a value of "0" when the value was \< 97%., During the experimental protocol (Intraoperative)
Increase in airway pressure until the SpO2 reaches 97% (lung´s opening pressure) during the incremental positive end-expiratory (PEEP) limb. Decrease in the PEEP level until the SpO2 decreases bellow 97% (lung´s closing pressure)
