E-Care Acceptability for Older People Undergoing Chemotherapy
The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the acceptability of clinical data collection using a semi-automated e-solution based on the use of text messaging among older adults undergoing chemotherapy treatment at home.

Most cancer diagnosis are made among the 70 years and over population. In this population, negative consequences of cancer treatments are of great concern, especially for those who are socially isolated or live in rural areas. International oncology societies recommend personalized treatments to reduce adverse events. However, few tools have been validated in this population to monitor compliance and risks of outpatient treatments. In addition, health professionals continue to manage unplanned patient calls which could disrupt effectiveness of their work. Our hypothesis is that the semi-automated collection of health data (text message questionnaires) during outpatient chemotherapy secures the patient's care pathway and optimizes care time, in particular for patients' education and support. Therefore, patients (and/or their caregivers) who benefit from calls follow-up (usual care), would have the possibility of receiving an additional weekly remote questionnaire (by email or SMS) via a CHATBOT on any terminal. This automated questionnaire collects data on tolerance and compliance with care plan.
