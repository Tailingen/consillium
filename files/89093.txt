Study Adding Multikinase Inhibitor Sorafenib to Existing Endocrine Therapy in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response rate to sorafenib when added to existing endocrine therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: sorafenib
Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Patients were followed monthly for clinical and toxicity evaluation. Disease response by RECIST criteria v1.0 was assessed after 3 months by appropriate scans and these were obtained every 2 months thereafter until progression., 12 weeks after treatment & 8 weeks after initial documentation of response
Time to Progression, continuously|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate is defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease (CR/PR/SD) as measured by Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for a minimum of at least 24 weeks., 24 weeks
A pilot Phase II study adding sorafenib to endocrine therapy in 11 patients with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was conducted. Primary end point was response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) after 3 months of sorafenib. Secondary end points included safety, time to progression and biomarker modulation. The study closed early owing to slow accrual.
