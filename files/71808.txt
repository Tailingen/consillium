This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study of ALTA2618, a mutant-selective and orally bioavailable AKT1 E17K inhibitor, in adults with AKT1 E17K-mutant solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary clinical activity of ALTA2618, and aims to find the best dose. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 - Dose Escalation and Part 1b - Dose Expansion.
