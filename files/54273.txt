Combination of Toripalimab and Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery has become the standard treatment option for locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC). However, only 20% to 40% of EC patients can achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT with favorable prognosis. Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints has demonstrated promising activity in advanced EC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of toripalimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) combined with neoadjuvant CRT in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
