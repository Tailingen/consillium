Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Participants Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-859/KEYNOTE-859)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3745) in combination with chemotherapy (Cisplatin combined with 5-Fluorouracil \[FP regimen\] or oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine \[CAPOX regimen\]) versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX regimens) in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in adult participants.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS).
