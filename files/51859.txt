Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study of RMC-6291 Monotherapy in Subjects With Advanced KRASG12C Mutant Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating doses of RMC-6291 (KRAS G12C(ON) inhibitor) monotherapy in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose.

This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study of RMC-6291 monotherapy in subjects with advanced KRASG12C-mutant solid tumors. The study will include 2 components: a Dose-Escalation and a Dose-Expansion. Subjects will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.
