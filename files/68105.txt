Re-optimization Based Online Adaptive Radiotherapy of Anal Cancer
A single-arm, prospective, Phase II, single-center clinical trial that will investigate if daily online adaptive radiotherapy for anal cancer will significantly reduce early treatment-related GI toxicity compared with the historically reported rate for non-adaptive intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
