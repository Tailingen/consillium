Comparison of an Interscalene Nerve Block With or Without Stellate Ganglion Block for Shoulder Surgery
This study describes the difference of analgesic effect of levobupivacaine 0.5% administered through an interscalene nerve block with or without a stellate ganglion block. The length of the analgesic effect is our primary outcome parameter. Half of the recruited patients will receive a stellate ganglion block and half of the patients won't.
