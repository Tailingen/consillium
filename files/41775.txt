Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) in DCIS
The goal of this study is to examine the role of Intraoperative Radiotherapy (IORT) in Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS) and to improve the understanding of the clinical, radiographic, and patient-related impact of adopting IORT.

Rate of local recurrence, Defined by ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, 5 years
Disease-free survival, Determine incidence of any distant or local recurrence after the breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and IORT, 5 years|Overall survival, Quantify the overall survival in women with DCIS following BCS and IORT at 5 years., 5 years|Acute Toxicities associated with IORT, Quantify the frequency of acute toxicities that occur within 6 months of having BCS and IORT. Measured using physician and patient reported toxicity surveys., 6 months|Longterm radiation toxicity, Quantify the frequency of toxicities that occur at greater than 6 months after having BCS and IORT.

With advances in technology and screening, the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have increased. Minimizing treatment toxicity and cost is a high priority area of research. Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT)is a form of radiation where a single high dose of irradiation is applied to the tumor bed at the time of lumpectomy. Its use has not been previously studied in DCIS. Proposed advantages include decreased toxicity to adjacent tissue and organs, reduction in healthcare costs, and improved quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that IORT is a safe and patient-friendly alternative to whole breast irradiation.
