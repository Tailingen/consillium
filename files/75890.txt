Prostate Impendance Test Project
Impedance-based analysis could provide an adequate response to the need to identify a safe and reliable tool alternative to bioptic diagnosis. Patients who are candidates for prostate biopsy as suffering from urinary symptoms accompanied by clinical suspicions such as high total PSA value and / or presence of prostate nodule and / or evidence of obvious lesion to available imaging methods will be subjected to impedance measurement. Aim of this study is to be able to structure a bivariate analysis of the distribution of impedances detected in patients with neoplasia in order to detect test median reference values.
