F-18-Fluorocholine PET/CT and MR Imaging/ Spectroscopy in the Management of Primary and Recurrent Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that realization of guided biopsies by multimodal imaging with 18F-fluorocholine PET / CT and MR Imaging/spectroscopy would allow to increase the rate of detection prostate cancer compared with the current approach and give an information about location and tumoral volume before surgery.:
Prostate Cancer
Sensitivity and specificity of FCH PET/CT, MR imaging, 3-D MR spectroscopy, and fusion PET/MR imaging for the intraprostatic localization of cancer in patients with radical prostatectomy as compared to histology as the gold standard, After prostatectomy (week 7-9 if Gleason score ≥ 8, week 7-15 if Gleason <8)|For prostate cancer patients with relapse: To determine the impact of FCH-PET imaging for localizing relapse patients in patients with biochemical failure as compared to the standard clinical workup, After PET/CT, week 1-2
To determine if imaging allows for a reliable estimation of tumor volume, as these limits imply a significantly different prognosis in elderly patients (insignificant disease = volume <0.5 cm3 vs. significant disease ≥0.5 cm3), After prostatectomy (week 7-9 if Gleason score ≥ 8, week 7-15 if Gleason <8)|To determine the utility of dynamic PET imaging using 10 × 1 min acquisitions (0-9 min) as compared to a 5 min static acquisition starting 3 min and a delayed static whole-body acquisition (1 hour after radiotracer injection), During PET/CT, week 1-2|To determine the impact of parametric PET/CT imaging based on dynamic PET acquisi¬tions with kinetic modeling, During PET/CT, week 1-2|Impact of image-guided biopsies in obtaining adequate tissue samples for histological examination as compared to TRUS-guided extended systematic 12-core biopsies, After TRUS biopsies (week 3)|For prostate cancer patients with relapse: To investigate the potential link between the overall accuracy of FCH and the serum androgen profile (total and free testosterone level) at the day of PET acquisition, After PET/CT, week 1-2
1. To evaluate the utility of F-18-FCH-PET/CT and MR imaging with 3-D MR spectroscopy in detecting, localizing, and estimating the volume of initial primary prostate cancer as compared to the current standard work-up using TRUS-guided biopsy. All imaging findings will be correlated with "gold standard" step slice histological examination. The hypothesis is that the combination of noninvasive imaging will improve the preoperative work-up as compared to the current approach.
2. To evaluate FCH-PET for the restaging of prostate cancer after biochemical relapse in a large patient cohort. This will run in parallel to the work-up of primary prostate cancer, as the FCH radiopharmaceutical will be available during the time of study at absolutely no cost to patients or CHUV. A number of studies have demonstrated the benefits of F-18-FCH-PET/CT for these patients and this indication is currently not reimbursed by Swiss obligatory health insurance providers.
