18F-AlF-FAPi-04 PET/CT Imaging in Patients With Solid Tumor
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 PET/CT for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in solid cancer.
Tumor, Solid
DRUG: Radiation: 18F-AlF-FAPi-04|DRUG: Radiation: 18F-FDG
Group A: Sensitivity and Specificity of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04, Performance \[sensitivity, specificity, accuracy\] of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 PET imaging to detect FAP-expressing cells, using surgical histopathological results as truth standard, 6 months after last dose administration|Group B: Sensitivity and Specificity of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04, Performance \[sensitivity, specificity, accuracy\] of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 PET imaging to detect FAP-expressing cells, using imaging follow-up or histopathological puncture results as truth standard, 6 months after last dose administration
Biodistribution of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04, The biodistribution of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 in normal and cancer tissues of patients with various malignancies will be measured by average and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax), 120 minutes after tracer injection
This is a prospective, single-center, two arms, open label, non-randomized study to evaluate the ability of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 to detect FAP expressing cells in patients with solid tumor, evaluate its biological distribution characteristics, impact on clinical treatment plans, and evaluate imaging differences between different probes. Taking histopathology and imaging follow-up as gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-AlF-FAPi-04 PET/CT will be calculated.
