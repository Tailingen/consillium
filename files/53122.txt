Strength, Aging, and Memory in Prostate Cancer
The objective of this study is to compare changes in neurocognitive function across a 12-month period between three groups: (1) men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer (PCa); (2) men under active surveillance for PCa; and (3) men without a history of cancer.

Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)
Change in appendicular lean mass index, Change in appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with higher scores indicating more lean mass. Appendicular lean mass, as measured by DXA, will be divided by height to determine ALMI. ALMI score is a continuous variable with no minimum or maximum value., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in physical function, The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will be used to assess physical function. Higher scores on the SPPB are indicative of better physical function. The SPPB has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 12., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in functional capacity, The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) will be used to measure functional capacity. The 6MWT is scored as distance walked in the 6 minutes with greater distance indicating greater functional capacity., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in upper body strength, Change in grip strength as measured by hand grip dynamometry with higher scores indicating greater upper body strength. Hand grip strength is a continuous variable with no minimum or maximum value., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in lower body strength, Change in quadriceps strength as measured by hand-held quadriceps dynamometry with higher scores indicating greater lower body strength. Quadriceps strength is a continuous variable with no minimum or maximum value., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in physical activity, Change in daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) will be measured via accelerometry with more minutes of daily MVPA indicating more physical activity., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)|Change in cancer-related fatigue, The Functional Assessment in Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) - Fatigue Scale will be used to measure cancer-related fatigue. Scores range from 0-52, with higher scores indicating less cancer-related fatigue., Baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), 12-month follow-up (M12)
Aim 1: This study will examine differences in neurocognitive function (cognitive performance, brain structural integrity) from baseline (within 30 days of ADT initiation or 90 days of diagnosis) to 6- and 12-month follow-up.

Aim 2: Examine group differences in components of frailty (e.g., lean mass, muscle strength, physical function, fatigue, physical activity) from baseline to 6- and 12-month follow-up.

Men will be recruited for this study if they are (1) recently diagnosed with PCa and scheduled to receive 6-months or more of ADT (ADT+ group, n=20), (2) recently diagnosed with PCa and under active surveillance (ADT- group, n=20), or (3) healthy men without a history of cancer (PCa- group, n=20). Eligible men (N=60) will be scheduled for two or three testing appointments at each testing timepoint. To assess Aim 1, participants will complete measures at baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), and 12-month follow-up (M12). Aim 1 measures include: neurocognitive tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (optional; n=10 ADT+ and n=10 ADT- only), and questionnaires. To assess Aim 2, outcomes indicated as components of frailty syndrome will be measured, including: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (e.g., appendicular lean mass), upper and lower body dynamometry, physical function and functional capacity, questionnaires (i.e., fatigue surveys), and physical activity monitoring (i.e., accelerometry). Findings from this study will build upon the scientific framework for the potential frailty pathway of cancer-associated cognitive decline in PCa patients in order to develop future evidence-based interventions to manage cognitive impairment in men diagnosed with PCa.
