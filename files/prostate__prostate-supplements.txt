PC-SPES
is also available.
Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer affecting men in the United States. On the basis of data from  2018 to 2021, it is estimated that  12.8% of U.S. men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes.[
1
]
Many studies suggest that
complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) use is common among prostate cancer patients, and the use of
vitamins
, supplements, and specific foods is frequently reported by these patients.  For example, the Prostate CAncer Therapy Selection (PCATS) study was a
prospective
study that investigated men’s decision-making processes about treatment following a diagnosis of local-
stage
prostate cancer. As part of this study, patients completed surveys regarding CAM use, and more than half of the respondents reported using one or more CAM therapies, with
mind-body modalities
and
biologically
based treatments being the most commonly used.[
2
]
International studies have reported similar findings. A Swedish study published in 2011 found that, overall, participants with prostate cancer were more likely to have used supplements than were healthy population-based
control subjects
. Supplement use was even more common among patients with the healthiest dietary patterns (e.g., high consumption of fatty fish and vegetables).[
3
]  In a Canadian study, CAM use was reported among 39% of recently diagnosed prostate cancer patients, and the most commonly used forms of CAM were
herbals
, vitamins, and
minerals
. Within those categories,
saw palmetto
,
vitamin E
, and
selenium
were the most popular. The two most popular reasons for choosing CAM  were to boost the
immune system
and to prevent
recurrence
.[
4
]  According to another Canadian study, approximately 30% of survey respondents with prostate cancer reported using CAM treatments. In that study,  vitamin E, saw palmetto, and
lycopene
were most commonly used.[
5
]     A British study published in 2008 indicated that 25% of prostate cancer patients used CAM, with the most frequently reported interventions being low-fat
diets
, vitamins, and lycopene. The majority of CAM users in this study cited improving
quality of life
and boosting the immune system as the main reasons they used CAM.[
6
]
Vitamin and supplement use has also been documented in men at risk of developing prostate cancer. One study examined vitamin and supplement use in men with a
family history
of prostate cancer. At the time of the survey, almost 60% of the men were using vitamins or supplements. One-third of the men were using vitamins and supplements that were specifically marketed for prostate health or
chemoprevention
(e.g., selenium, green tea, and saw palmetto).[
7
] A 2004 study examined herbal and vitamin supplement use in men who attended a prostate cancer
screening
clinic. Men who attended the screening clinic completed questionnaires about supplement use. Of the respondents,
analysis
revealed that a reported 70% used multivitamins, and 21% used herbal supplements.[
8
]
A
meta-analysis
published in 2008 reviewed studies that reported vitamin and mineral supplement use among cancer
survivors
. The results showed that, among prostate cancer survivors, vitamin or mineral use ranged from 26% to 35%.[
9
]
Although many prostate cancer patients use CAM treatments, they do not all disclose their CAM use to treating
physicians.
According to results from the PCATS study, 43% of patients discussed their CAM use with a health care professional.[
2
]  In two separate studies, 58% of respondents told their doctors about their CAM usage.[
4
,
6
]
How do prostate cancer patients decide whether or not to use CAM? A qualitative study published in 2005 described results from interviews with prostate cancer patients. The study identified differences in thinking patterns between CAM users and nonusers and suggested that no specific theme led patients to CAM; instead, patients were directed by a combination of ideas. For example, the perception of CAM as harmless was associated with the belief that
conventional medicine
resulted in many negative
side effects
.[
10
]  Results of a 2003 qualitative study suggested that decision making about CAM treatments by prostate cancer patients depended on both fixed (e.g.,
medical history
) and flexible (e.g., a need to feel in control) decision factors.[

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
Calcium
is required for certain
metabolic
functions such as vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function,
nerve
transmission,
intracellular
signaling, and hormonal secretion.
Major sources of calcium in the United States are food and
dietary supplements
.
Studies of the association between calcium and
prostate cancer
have been limited to
nutritional
sources of calcium, such as dairy products.
Some studies suggest that high total calcium intake may be associated with increased risk of advanced and
metastatic
prostate cancer, compared with lower intake of calcium.
Additional research is needed to clarify the effects of calcium and/or dairy products on prostate cancer risk.
General Information and History
Calcium, the most abundant
mineral
in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some
medicines
(such as antacids). Calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling, and hormonal secretion, although less than 1% of total body calcium is needed to support these critical metabolic functions.[
1
]
Serum
calcium is very tightly regulated and does not fluctuate with changes in dietary intake; the body uses bone
tissue
as a reservoir for, and source of, calcium to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in
blood
, muscle, and intercellular
fluids
.[
1
]
The major sources of calcium in the U.S. population are food and dietary supplements.[
2
] According to recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  data, U.S. adults obtain 38% of their dietary calcium from milk and milk products, such as yogurt and cheese.[
3
] Nondairy sources include vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Spinach provides calcium, but its
bioavailability
is poor. Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified; however, they contribute calcium to the
diet
because they contain small amounts of calcium, and people consume them frequently. Foods fortified with calcium include many fruit juices and drinks, tofu, and cereals.  In the United States, dietary supplements, including calcium supplements, are commonly used to prevent
chronic
diseases, including
cancer
.[
1
]
Mean
dietary calcium intakes for males aged 1 year and older ranged from 871 to 1,266 mg/day depending on life stage group (i.e., infant,
adolescent
, or adult).  About 43% of the U.S. population uses dietary supplements containing calcium, which increases calcium intake by about 330 mg/day among supplement users.[
1
,
2
]
To evaluate the association between calcium intake and prostate cancer
mortality
and
morbidity
, it may be important to assess objective,
biological
markers
of calcium, include data that account for nutritional and supplemental calcium intake, and control for other confounding factors.  However, studies of the association between calcium and prostate cancer have been limited to nutritional sources of calcium, such as dairy products. Although more than half of the U.S. population uses
vitamin
and mineral supplements (at an annual cost of over $11 billion), few studies include supplement use in the association of disease risk, including prostate cancer or mortality rates.[

,

Prostate Cancer Prevention
.
Companies distribute calcium as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of calcium as a treatment for cancer.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
Prostate
cancer cells
were treated with bovine milk, almond milk,
soy
milk, casein, or
lactose
in a 2011 study. Treatment with bovine milk resulted in growth stimulation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Growth of prostate cancer cells was not affected by treatment with soy milk, and treatment with almond milk resulted in growth inhibition.[
4
]
In vivo
studies
One study investigated the effects of dietary calcium on prostate
tumor progression
in LPB-Tag
transgenic mice
. The animals consumed low (0.2%) or high (2.0%) calcium diets and were sacrificed at age 5, 7, or 9 weeks.
Tumor
weight and progression were similar in mice that were fed low- and high-calcium diets.[
5
]
A 2012 study examined the impact of dietary
vitamin D
and calcium on prostate cancer growth in
athymic mice
. The mice were
injected
with human prostate cancer cells and were randomly assigned to receive specific diets (e.g., high calcium/vitamin D or normal calcium/no vitamin D). The mice that received the normal calcium/vitamin D-deficient diet exhibited significantly greater (
P
< .05) tumor volumes than did mice that received the other diets.[
6
]
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
Several
epidemiological
studies have found an association between high intakes of calcium, dairy foods, or both, and an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.[
7
-
9
] However, others have found only a weak relationship, no relationship, or a negative association between calcium intake and prostate cancer risk.[
10
-
14
] A 2022
prospective cohort study
examined 28,737 men who belong to the Seventh-day Adventist church. These men had  wide ranges of dairy and calcium intake. The study found that a higher intake of dairy foods or other potentially causal factors associated with dairy intake were associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer. This was not true for nondairy sources of calcium.   On the basis of these studies, interpretation of the evidence is complicated by the difficulty of separating the effects of dairy products from the effects of calcium. Additionally, earlier epidemiological studies had several limitations. The association between dairy foods, calcium intake, and  prostate cancer was limited to evidence from self-reported food frequency questionnaires of nutritional sources of calcium,  with a focus on dairy foods.[
14
-
16
]  Competing
risk factors
, such as other major
nutrients
in dairy (i.e., total fats, saturated fats,
calories
) and
concomitant
and confounding factors (i.e., age,
body mass index
,
steroid
hormones
, and other metabolic events in the causal pathway) were not accounted for. Additionally, no objective markers of calcium, such as serum calcium, were obtained from these
cohorts
.
Observational studies
overall, however, suggest that high total calcium intake may be associated with increased risk of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, compared with lower intake of calcium.[
11
,
12
,
17
-
19
] Another
analysis
of 886
prostatectomy
patients found an increased risk of being
diagnosed
with more
aggressive
disease in men with higher calcium intakes.[
20
] The hazard of disease
recurrence
after
surgical
treatment was increased in men with both very low and high calcium intakes. Additional research is needed to clarify the effects of calcium and/or dairy products on prostate cancer risk and to elucidate potential biological mechanisms.
Interventional studies
In a
randomized clinical trial
published in 2005, 672 men received either 3 g of
calcium carbonate
(1,200
mg
calcium) or
placebo
daily for 4 years and were followed for 12 years.  During the first 6 years of the study, there were significantly fewer prostate cancer cases in the calcium group compared with the placebo group. However, this difference was no longer
statistically significant
at the 10-year evaluation.[
21
]
Meta-analyses
A
meta-analysis
published in 2005 reported that there may be an association between increased risk of prostate cancer and greater consumption of dairy products and calcium.[
22
]
A 2008 meta-analysis reviewed 45 observational studies and found no evidence of a link between dairy products and risk of prostate cancer.[
23
] A meta-analysis of
cohort studies
published between 1996 and 2006 found a positive association between milk and dairy product consumption and risk of prostate cancer.[
24
]
In a recent review, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Evidence Syntheses, formerly Systematic Evidence Reviews, conducted  meta-analyses using Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects models for overall cancer
incidence
,
cardiovascular disease
incidence, and all-cause mortality. Vitamin D and/or calcium
supplementation
showed no overall effect on  cancer incidence and mortality, including prostate cancer.[
3
] In a meta-analysis of the association of calcium without the coadministration of vitamin D, a reduced risk of prostate cancer was observed, although there were only a few events.[
25
]
In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research reported that there was probable evidence that diets high in calcium increase the risk of prostate cancer and that there is limited suggestive evidence that milk and dairy products also increase the risk.[
26
] Since publication, 18 additional studies that evaluated dairy or calcium intake and the risk of prostate cancer have been published. A 2015 meta-analysis of this literature concluded that high intakes of dairy products, milk, low-fat milk, cheese, total dietary calcium, and dairy calcium may increase prostate cancer risk.[
27
] Supplemental calcium and nondairy calcium were not associated with an increased risk, although supplemental calcium was associated with an increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. The authors suggested that this association needs additional study.

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
Green tea is produced by a process of steaming and drying the leaves from the
Camellia sinensis
(L.) plant.
Some
research
results suggest that green tea may have a protective effect against
cardiovascular
diseases and against various forms of
cancer
, including
prostate cancer
.
Catechins
are phenolic
compounds
in tea that have been associated with many of green tea’s proposed health benefits.
Green tea catechins  (GTCs) include (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (
EGCG
), (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), but also include oligomeric proanthocyanidins derived from these catechin
monomers
.
Laboratory
,
preclinical
, and early-phase
clinical trials
have identified EGCG as one of the most potent modulators of
molecular pathways
thought to be relevant to
prostate
carcinogenesis
. EGCG has been shown to act as an
androgen
antagonist
and can suppress prostate cancer
cell proliferation
, suppress production of
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA)  by prostate cancer
cells
, and demonstrate potent and selective proapoptotic activity in prostate cancer
cell lines
in vitro
.
Oral
intake of either a GTC solution or EGCG alone was associated with significant reductions in
tumor
size, reduced
multiplicity
, and reduced development of prostate cancer in studies with
transgenic
adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice.
In Asian countries with a high
per capita
consumption of green tea, prostate cancer
mortality
rates are among the lowest in the world,  and the risk of prostate cancer appears to be increased among Asian men who abandon their original dietary habits upon migrating to the United States.
Case-control
and
cohort studies
, so far, have variously shown beneficial or neutral results, with the exception  of one study that showed an increased risk of developing advanced prostate cancer with consumption of green tea.
GTCs have been well tolerated in
clinical studies
that target healthy male subjects, men with precursor
lesions
, and men with prostate cancer.
Side effects
were reduced with a decaffeinated formulation and when green tea  was consumed in nonfasting conditions. The most common side effects related to GTC were mild
gastrointestinal
symptoms
.
At least two
randomized
controlled
trials have shown an overall decreased rate of
progression
to atypical small acinar proliferation or prostate cancer in men with
high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(HGPIN) treated with GTCs.
General Information and History
Sailors first brought tea to England in 1644, although tea has been popular in Asia since ancient times. After water, tea is the most-consumed beverage in the world.[
1
] Tea originates from the
C. sinensis
plant, and the process methods of the leaves determine the type of tea produced. Green tea is not fermented but is made by an
enzyme
deactivation step whereby intensive heat (i.e., roasting the freshly collected tea leaves in a wok or, historically, steaming the leaves) is applied to preserve the tea's
polyphenols
(catechins) and freshness. In contrast, the enzyme-catalyzed polymerization and
oxidation
of catechins and other components produce darker-colored black tea.[
2
] Oolong, a third major type of tea,  which is dark/black rather than green as a result of being partially fermented,  contains partially
oxidized
catechins.[
1
]
In this summary,
tea
refers to the leaves of the
C. sinensis
plant or the beverage brewed from those leaves.
Some observational and interventional studies suggest that green tea may have a protective effect against
cardiovascular disease
,[
3
] and there is evidence that green tea may protect against various forms of cancer.[
4
] Many of the health benefits associated with tea have been attributed to polyphenols. GTCs  include EGCG, EC, EGC, ECG, and oligomeric proanthocyanidins derived from these catechin monomers.  Among these compounds, EGCG is the most abundant catechin in green tea and has been widely researched;[
5
] however, it is  also classified as a promiscuous compound.[
6
]  Laboratory, preclinical, and early-phase clinical trials have identified EGCG as one of the most potent modulators of molecular pathways thought to be relevant to prostate carcinogenesis.[
5
] Tea leaves also contain considerable amounts of oligomeric catechins, in particular, oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Together with the catechin monomers, they constitute the green tea polyphenols (GTPs).  GTP composition and the ratio of monomeric to oligomeric catechins can vary widely, depending on processing and source of the tea leaves. Considering that EGCG and other monomeric catechins interfere with
in vitro
assays and exhibit a wide range of
biological
effects,[
6
,
7
] this indicates that the chemical factors responsible for the actual
in vivo
health benefits of green tea are mostly unknown.
Several companies distribute green tea as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).

Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
Prostate cancer cells treated with EGCG (concentrations, 0–80
μM
) demonstrated suppressed cell proliferation and decreased levels of PSA
protein
and
mRNA
in the presence or absence of androgen.[
8
]
In a 2011 study, human prostate cancer cells were treated initially with EGCG (concentrations,  1.5–7.5 μM) and then with
radiation.
The results showed that exposing cells to EGCG for 30 minutes before radiation significantly reduced
apoptosis
, compared with radiation alone.[
9
]
In another study, prostate cancer cells treated with EGCG (0–50 μM) exhibited
dose-dependent
decreases in cellular proliferation and increases in extracellular signal-regulated
kinase
(ERK) 1/2 activity. To further examine the effect of EGCG on the ERK 1/2 pathway, cells were treated with EGCG (0–50 μM) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (
MEK
) inhibitor or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (
PI3K
) inhibitor. Inhibition of MEK did not prevent ERK 1/2 upregulation, although the increase in ERK 1/2 after EGCG treatment was partially inhibited with the PI3K inhibitor. These findings suggest that EGCG may prevent prostate cancer cell proliferation by increasing the activity of ERK 1/2 via a MEK-independent, PI3K-dependent mechanism.[
10
]
According to a 2010 study, EGCG treatment (20–120 μM) resulted in changes in expression levels of 40
genes
in prostate cancer cells, including a fourfold downregulation of inhibitor of
DNA
binding 2 (ID2; a protein involved in cell proliferation and survival). In addition, forced expression of ID2 in cells treated with 80 μM EGCG resulted in reduced apoptosis, suggesting that EGCG may cause cell death via an ID2-related mechanism.[
11
]
Advances in
nanotechnology
—
nanochemoprevention
—may result in more-effective
administration
of EGCG to men at risk of developing prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cells were treated with EGCG-loaded (100 μM EGCG)
nanoparticles
or free EGCG. Although both treatments decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, the nanoparticle treatment had a greater effect at a lower
concentration
than did free EGCG. This finding suggests that using a nanoparticle delivery system for EGCG may increase its
bioavailability
and improve its
chemopreventive
actions.[
12
] In one study, EGCG (30 μM) was
encapsulated
in nanoparticles that contained polymers targeting prostate-specific
membrane
antigen
(PSMA). Prostate cancer cells treated with this
intervention
exhibited decreases in proliferation; however, the intervention did not affect
nonmalignant
control cells. The results suggest that this delivery system may be effective for selective targeting of prostate cancer cells.[
13
]
Research also suggests that
glutathione-S-transferase
pi (GSTP1) may be a
tumor suppressor
and that hypermethylation of certain regions of this gene (i.e., CpG islands) may be a
molecular marker
of prostate cancer. Increased
methylation
leads to silencing of the gene. A set of experiments investigated the effects of green tea polyphenols on GSTP1 expression. Treatment of different types of prostate cancer cells with green tea polyphenols (1–10
μg
/
mL
Polyphenon E
) resulted in re-expression of GSTP1 by reversing hypermethylation and by reducing expression of methyl-CpG–binding
domain
proteins, which bind to methylated DNA. These results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have chemopreventive effects via actions on gene-silencing processes.[
14
]
The results of a 2011 study suggested that green tea polyphenols may exert anticancer effects by inhibiting
histone
deacetylases (
HDACs
). Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer. Treatment of human prostate cancer cells with green tea polyphenols (10–80 μg/mL Polyphenon E) resulted in decreased class I HDAC activity and increased expression of Bax, a proapoptotic protein.[
15
]
Owing to the high concentrations of tea polyphenols used in some of the
in vitro
experiments, results should be interpreted with caution. Studies in humans have indicated that
blood
levels of EGCG are 0.1 to 0.6
µM
after consumption of two to three cups of green tea and that drinking seven to nine cups of green tea results in EGCG blood levels still lower than 1 μM.[
16
,
17
]
Animal  studies
Animal models
have been used in several studies investigating the effects of green tea on prostate cancer. In one study, TRAMP mice were given access to water or GTC–treated water (0.3% GTC solution; this exposure mimics  human consumption of 6 cups of green tea daily). After 24 weeks, water-fed TRAMP mice had developed prostate cancer, whereas mice treated with GTCs showed only prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, suggesting that GTCs may help delay the development of prostate  tumors.[
18
] In another study, castrated mice were
injected
with prostate cancer cells and then treated daily with
intraperitoneal
injections
of 1
mg
EGCG or vehicle. Treatment with EGCG resulted in reductions in
tumor volume
and decreases in
serum
PSA levels compared with vehicle treatment.
In a 2011 study, EGCG was shown to be an
androgen
antagonist; when added to prostate cancer cells, EGCG physically interacted with the androgen receptor’s ligand-binding domain. In addition, mice
implanted
with tumor cells and treated with EGCG (intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg EGCG, 3/wk) exhibited less
androgen receptor
protein expression
than did mice that were treated with vehicle.[
19
]
In a 2009 study, TRAMP mice were started on a green tea polyphenol intervention (0.1% green tea polyphenols in drinking water) at various ages (meant to represent different
stages
of prostate cancer development).[
20
] The results showed that, although all of the green tea–fed mice exhibited longer tumor-free survival than did water-fed control mice, there was an advantage for the mice that were fed with green tea the longest.[
20
] In one study, EGCG treatment (0.06% EGCG in drinking water; this exposure mimics human consumption of 6 cups of green tea/d) was initiated in TRAMP mice at age 12 or 28 weeks. EGCG treatment suppressed HGPIN in mice treated at age 12 weeks; however, EGCG did not prevent prostate cancer development in mice that began treatment at age 28 weeks.[
21
]
Using the TRAMP mouse model,[
22
]  one study  demonstrated that oral infusion of GTP extract at a human-achievable dose (equivalent to 6 cups of green tea/d) significantly delayed
primary tumor
incidence and
tumor burden
, as assessed sequentially by
magnetic resonance imaging
;   decreased prostate weight (64% of
baseline
) and genitourinary weight (72%); inhibited serum
insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)-1; restored insulin-like growth factor–binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels; and produced marked reduction in the protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen  in the GTP-fed TRAMP mice, compared with water-fed TRAMP mice. Furthermore, GTP consumption caused significant apoptosis, which possibly resulted in reduced dissemination of cancer cells, thereby causing inhibition of development, progression, and
metastasis
to distant
organ
sites. In another study,  119 male TRAMP mice and 119 C57BL/6J mice were treated orally with one of three doses of Polyphenon E (200, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/d) in drinking water
ad libitum
, replicating human-achievable doses. Safety and
efficacy
assessments were performed at baseline and when mice were 12, 22, and 32 weeks old. Results indicated that the number and size of tumors in treated TRAMP mice were significantly decreased, compared with untreated animals. In untreated 32-week-old TRAMP mice, prostate carcinoma metastasis to distant sites was observed in 100% of mice (8/8), compared with 13% of mice (2/16) treated with high-dose Polyphenon E during the same period.[
23
]
Animal safety studies
In a
National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP)–sponsored,  9-month, oral
toxicity
study, Polyphenon E was administered (200, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/d) to fasted male and female beagle dogs. The study was terminated prematurely because of excessive loss of animals due to
morbidity
and mortality in all treatment groups. These studies have revealed some unique
dose-limiting
lethal
liver
, gastrointestinal, and renal toxicities. Gross necropsy revealed therapy-induced lesions in the gastrointestinal tracts, livers, kidneys, reproductive organs, and
hematopoietic tissues
of treated male and female dogs. In the 13-week
follow-up
study, the no-observed-adverse-effect–level was greater than 600 mg/kg per day of Polyphenon E.[
24
]  When the study was conducted in nonfasted dogs under the same testing conditions and dose levels, the results were unremarkable. Nonspecific toxicity and a tenfold reduction in the
maximum tolerated dose
in fasted beagle dogs compared with fed beagle dogs were seen using a purified GTC containing less than 77% EGCG.[
25
]  However, in the follow-up NCI DCP–sponsored study, which compared fed dogs  with fasted dogs using several Polyphenon E formulations, no deaths occurred, suggesting that fasting may have rendered the target organ systems more vulnerable to the effects of
green tea extract
.
In a study [
23
] of several doses of a standardized Polyphenon E targeting TRAMP mice, no liver or other toxicities were observed. Long-term (32 weeks) treatment with Polyphenon E (200, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/d) was safe and well tolerated, with no evidence of toxicity in C57BL/6J mice.  The C57BL/6J mice showed no differences in appearance or behavior, or changes in prostate and body weights after 32 weeks of treatment for all three doses of Polyphenon E. No discernible
histopathological
changes were observed in the liver,
lung
, or any prostate
lobe
of C57BL/6J mice treated with the three different doses of Polyphenon E.[
23
]   Similarly, another
preclinical study
[
26
] did not observe liver or other toxicities with standardized EGCG at doses of up to 500 mg EGCG preparation/kg per day.
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
The relationship between green tea intake and prostate cancer has been examined in several
epidemiological
studies.
Two
meta-analyses
examined the consumption of green  tea and prostate cancer risk, with one meta-analysis including black tea.[
27
,
28
] For green tea, seven
observational studies
were identified, and most  were from Asia. The results indicated a
statistically significant
inverse association between green tea consumption and prostate cancer risk in the three case-control studies,  but no association was found in the four cohort studies. For black tea, no association was found between black tea consumption and prostate cancer risk.[
27
] The inconsistent results reported in these
population studies
may be attributed to confounding factors that include the following:[
29
-
33
]
Consumption of salted or very hot tea.
Geographical location.
Tobacco
use.
Alcohol
use.
Other dietary differences.
In Asian countries with a high
per capita
consumption of green tea, prostate cancer mortality rates are among the lowest in the world,[
34
] and the risk of prostate cancer appears to be increased among Asian men who abandon their original dietary habits upon migrating to the United States.[
34
]  Overall,  findings from population studies suggest that green tea may help protect against prostate cancer in Asian populations.[
27
,
35
] Currently, there are no epidemiological studies in other populations examining the association between green tea consumption and prostate cancer risk or protection from risk.  With the increasing consumption of green tea worldwide, including by the U.S. population, emerging data from ongoing studies will further contribute to defining the cancer preventive activity of green tea or GTCs.
Interventional studies
Bioavailability
Phase I/II
intervention studies have reported bioavailability of EGCG in
plasma
using single and repeated doses of EGCG, noting higher plasma EGCG concentrations in fasting conditions relative to fed conditions.[
36
-
38
] Studies using varying doses (400 mg, 800 mg EGCG) of GTCs and Polyphenon E administered in single and repeated dosing schedules for 3 to 6 weeks have reported
median
maximum concentrations of EGCG ranging from 68.8
ng
/mL to 390.36 ng/mL (see
Table  1
).[
38
-
40
] Not all individuals in the treatment arms of these and other studies [
31
,
41
,
42
] had detectable levels of EGCG, indicating potential variation in individual absorption. Catechins other than EGCG were nondetectable or below quantifiable levels in the plasma in many trials.
Catechin tissue levels have also been reported, and high variations were quite common.  Notably, catechin levels in prostate tissue were low to undetectable after the administration of Polyphenon E in one preprostatectomy study.[
39
] An
analysis
of prostate tissue obtained from the green tea drinkers revealed that both
methylated
and nonmethylated forms of EGCG are found in the prostate following a short-term treatment with green tea, with 48% of EGCG in the methylated form.[
39
] Methylated forms of EGCG are not as effective as EGCG in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that methylation status of EGCG may affect the chemopreventive properties of green tea. Methylation status may be determined by
polymorphisms
of the
catechol
-O-methyltransferase (COMT; the enzyme that methylates EGCG) gene.[

Prevention
In a single-center Italian study, 60 men diagnosed with HGPIN were randomly assigned to receive GTC
capsules
(GTCs,  600 mg/d) or a
placebo
every day for 1 year. After 6 months, 6 of the 30 men in the placebo group were diagnosed with prostate cancer, whereas none of the 30 subjects in the GTC group were diagnosed with prostate cancer. After 1 year, nine men in the placebo group and one man in the GTC group were diagnosed with prostate cancer (
P
< .01). These findings suggest that GTCs may help prevent prostate cancer in groups at high risk of the disease.[
44
] In 2008, follow-up results to this study were published, indicating that the inhibitory effects of GTCs on prostate cancer progression were long-lasting.[
45
] However, nearly all of the prostate cancer risk reduction in that study occurred at the 6-month
biopsy
, suggesting that the results may have been biased by a nonrandom distribution of occult prostate cancer at baseline.[
34
]  No reduction in serum PSA was observed in the treatment arm of this study compared with placebo.
A larger, multicenter, randomized trial (
NCT00596011
) in the United States studied 97 men with either HGPIN or atypical small acinar proliferation who received a GTC mixture (Polyphenon E, 200 mg, bid).[
42
] Atypical small acinar proliferation is an entity that reflects a broad group of lesions of varying clinical significance with insufficient cytological or architectural atypia to establish a definitive
diagnosis
of prostate cancer.[
9
,
27
] Results indicated that a daily intake of a standardized, decaffeinated catechin mixture containing 400 mg EGCG per day for 1 year, with detectable levels of catechins accumulated in the plasma,  was well tolerated,[
42
][
Level of evidence 1A
] but it did not significantly  reduce the
incidence
of prostate cancer in the treatment group  with Polyphenon E (5/49, 10.2%) compared with the placebo group (9/48, 18.8%;
P
= .25).  However, in a prespecified secondary analysis performed in men with HGPIN (without atypical small acinar proliferation) at baseline, Polyphenon E was associated with a significant decrease in the composite endpoint (prostate cancer plus atypical small acinar proliferation)  (3/26 Polyphenon E vs. 10/25 placebo,
P
< .024), with these findings largely driven by the absence of atypical small acinar proliferation on end-of-study biopsy on the Polyphenon E arm (Polyphenon E [0/26] vs.  placebo arm [5/25]).  Because  there is no clear evidence that HGPIN and atypical small acinar proliferation represent steps on a linear path to prostate cancer, these findings should be interpreted with caution.   A comparison of the estimated overall treatment effect showed a significantly greater reduction of serum PSA in men treated with Polyphenon E compared  with controls (-0.87 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval, -1.66 to -0.09).[
42
] A 2017
randomized clinical trial
targeted 60 men with HGPIN who received 600 mg of green tea catechins for 1 year. Although a significant reduction in serum PSA was observed, no reduction in incidence of prostate cancer  was observed in the  group treated with green tea catechins compared with the placebo group.[
46
] Although some of the findings of the clinical trials appear to refute the large effect size suggested by the Italian   study [
42
,
44
,
45
] that reported a 90% reduction in prostate cancer among men with HGPIN,  overall, the randomized controlled trials have shown a decrease in serum PSA as well as a decreased rate of progression to atypical small acinar proliferation or prostate cancer in men with HGPIN treated with GTCs. However, those clinical studies had relatively overall small sample sizes and not necessarily designed as pivotal
phase III
trials to allow confirmation of GTEs’ clinical benefits as a prostate cancer prevention drug.
Preoperative studies
Patients scheduled for
radical prostatectomy
were randomly assigned to drink green tea, black tea, or a soda five times a day for 5 days.
Bioavailable
tea polyphenols were found in prostate samples of the patients who had consumed green tea and black tea. In addition, prostate cancer cells were treated with participants’ serum, and the results showed that there was less proliferation using post-tea serum than using serum obtained before the tea intervention.[
47
] In an
open label
,
phase II
trial, 113 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to  drink six cups of green tea, black tea, or water before radical prostatectomy.[
48
]  Ninety-three patients completed the intervention. Although there were no significant differences in markers of proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidation in the prostatectomy tissue, only the men drinking green tea demonstrated small but significant decreases in PSA levels (
P
= .04).
In an open label, phase II clinical study, prostate cancer patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy consumed four Polyphenon E tablets containing tea polyphenols, providing 800 mg EGCG daily until
surgery
. The Polyphenon E treatment had a positive effect on a number of prostate cancer
biomarkers
, including PSA,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
, and IGF-1 (a protein associated with increased risk of prostate cancer).[
49
]
In a 2011 study, 50 prostate cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive Polyphenon E (800 mg EGCG) or a placebo daily for 3 to 6 weeks before surgery. Treatment with Polyphenon E resulted in  greater decreases in serum levels of PSA and IGF-1 than did treatment with placebo, but these differences were not statistically significant. The findings of this study suggest that the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols may be through indirect means and that longer intervention studies may be needed.[
39
]
Advanced prostate cancer
In a small, single-arm study,
hormone-refractory
prostate cancer patients received capsules of green tea extract twice daily (total polyphenols, 375 mg/d); not specified by polyphenol type) for up to 5 months. Although the green tea intervention was well tolerated by most  study participants, no patient had a PSA
response
(i.e., at least 50% decrease from
baseline
), and  all 19 patients were deemed to have
progressive disease
within 1 to 5 months.[
50
]
In a 2003 study, patients with
androgen-independent
metastatic
prostate cancer consumed 6 g of powdered green tea extract daily for up to 4 months. Among 42 participants, 1 patient exhibited a 50% decrease in serum PSA level compared with baseline, but this response was not sustained beyond  2 months. Green tea was well tolerated by most study participants. However, six episodes of grade 3 toxicity occurred, involving
insomnia
,
confusion
, and
fatigue
.  These results suggest that in patients with advanced prostate cancer, green tea may have limited benefits.[

Adverse Effects
The safety of tea and tea compounds is supported by centuries of consumption by the human population.  The bioavailability and tolerance to GTC at doses ranging from 600 to 1,000 mg EGCG at single and multiple doses, and a duration of a few days to 1 year has been well documented in phase I/II clinical trials.[
36
-
40
,
43
,
47
-
51
] The authors of a phase I trial of oral green tea extract in adult patients with
solid tumors
reported that a safe dose of green tea extract (1.0 g/m
2
, tid) was equivalent to seven to eight Japanese cups (120 mL) of green tea three times per day for 6 months.[
52
]  The authors concluded that the side effects (neurological and gastrointestinal) of the green tea extract preparation were
caffeine
related, and not from EGCG.
In four phase I, single-dose, and multidose studies that targeted healthy volunteers who took a
botanical
drug substance containing a mixture of catechins, Polyphenon E, and a dose range of 200 to 1,200 mg EGCG was well tolerated.[
33
,
34
,
40
-
42
,
44
,
45
]
Adverse effects
with a possible relationship to the study drug reported  in these studies have been grade 2 to 3 and included the following:
Asthenia
.
Headache.
Abdominal
pain.
Chest pain.
Diarrhea
.
Dyspepsia
.
Eructation
.
Flatulence.
Nausea
.
Vomiting
.
Dizziness.
Vasodilation.
Rash.
These studies have demonstrated that although increased oral bioavailability occurs when GTCs are consumed in a fasting state, increased gastrointestinal toxicity is also more common.   Gastrointestinal adverse effects were usually mild and seen most often at the higher dose levels. Onset of gastrointestinal events typically occurred within 2 to 3 hours of dosing and resolved within 2 hours.  No grade 3 or higher events were reported with a possible relationship to the study drug.[
49
]
Green tea has been well tolerated in clinical studies of men with prostate cancer.[
43
,
49
] In a 2005 study, the most commonly reported side effects were gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms were mild for all but two men, who experienced severe
anorexia
and moderate
dyspnea
.[
50
]  With the duration of intervention in these studies ranging from single, one-time administration to a maximum of 90 days, the safety data from these studies are limited to short-term safety of EGCG and GTCs.
Data from  clinical trials [
42
,
44
] report long-term safety of EGCG containing GTCs,  for use in men with precursor lesions of prostate cancer for prevention of prostate cancer. One study [
44
] administered approximately 300 mg EGCG per day for 1 year without any reported toxicities.
In a U.S. trial, 400 mg of EGCG containing Polyphenon E was administered for 1 year to nonfasting men with HGPIN and atypical small acinar proliferation.  More possible and probable grade 2 through grade 3 events in men who received Polyphenon E were observed and compared with those in men who received placebo. Only one man who received Polyphenon E reported  grade 3 nausea,  which was determined to possibly be related to the
study agent
.[
42
]
In recent years, oral consumption of varying doses and compositions of green tea extracts (GTEs) has been associated with several instances of hepatotoxicity.[
25
,
38
,
53
-
55
]  Most affected patients were women, and many were consuming GTEs for the purpose of weight loss. Although hepatotoxicity in most cases resolved within 4 months of stopping GTEs, there have been cases of positive rechallenge and liver failure requiring a liver
transplant
. One   report described a case of
acute
liver failure that required a transplant in a woman who consumed GTE capsules.[
54
] The capsules contained Polyphenon 70A (a concentrated, enriched, and pasteurized hot-water extract of green tea) and  120 mg GTE. Because no other causal relationship could be identified, the treating
physicians
concluded that the fulminant liver failure experienced by this patient was most likely related to the consumption of
over-the-counter
GTE weight-loss supplements. In addition, the sale of an ethanolic GTE sold as a weight-reduction aid was suspended  in 2003 after reports associated hepatotoxicity (four cases in Spain and nine cases in France) with its use.[
55
] Time to onset of hepatotoxicity following ingestion of GTEs ranged from several days to several months. Increased oral bioavailability occurs when GTEs are administered on an empty
stomach
after an overnight fast. Increased toxicity, including hepatotoxicity, is observed when Polyphenon E or EGCG is administered to fasted dogs.[
25
]
The FDA's Division of Drug Oncology Products has recommended that Polyphenon E be taken with food by subjects participating in clinical studies. In addition, frequent
liver function tests
should be considered  while individuals are on treatment, especially in the first few months of trial initiation.

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
Lycopene
is a
carotenoid
, a natural
pigment
made by plants and various fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, apricots, guavas, and watermelon.
Lycopene's
absorption
is improved with concurrent dietary fat intake.
Lycopene inhibits
androgen
receptor
expression in
prostate cancer
cells
in vitro
and,  along with some of its
metabolites
, reduces prostate cancer
cell proliferation
and may
modulate
cell-cycle
progression.
Lycopene may also affect the
insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)
intracellular
pathway in prostate cancer cells.
Results from several
in vitro
and
animal studies
have indicated that lycopene may have
chemopreventive
effects for cancers of the prostate,
skin
,
breast
,
lung
, and
liver
; however, human trials have been inconsistent in their findings.
Clinical trials
utilizing lycopene in prostate cancer patients with various different clinical presentations (e.g., early stage,
prostate-specific antigen
[PSA]
relapse
,
advanced disease
) have yielded inconsistent results.
The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has accepted the determination by various companies that their lycopene-containing products meet the FDA’s requirements for the designation of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).  In clinical trials involving prostate cancer patients,
doses
ranging from 10 to 120 mg/d have been well tolerated, with only occasional mild-to-moderate
gastrointestinal
toxicities.
General Information and History
Lycopene is a
phytochemical
that belongs to a group of pigments known as carotenoids. It is red and
lipophilic
. As a natural pigment made by plants, lycopene helps to protect plants from light-induced stress,[
1
]  and it also transfers light energy during
photosynthesis
.[
2
] Lycopene is found in a number of fruits and vegetables, including apricots, guavas, and watermelon, but the majority of lycopene consumed in the United States is from tomato-based products.[
1
]
Lycopene has been investigated for its role in
chronic
diseases, including
cardiovascular
disease and cancer. Numerous
epidemiological
studies suggest that lycopene may help prevent cardiovascular disease. Lycopene may protect against cardiovascular disease by decreasing
cholesterol
synthesis and increasing the degradation of low-density lipoproteins,[
3
] although some interventional studies have shown mixed results.[
4
]
A number of
in vitro
and
in vivo
studies suggest that lycopene may also be protective against cancers of the skin, breast, lung, and liver.[
5
] However, epidemiological studies have yielded inconsistent  findings regarding lycopene's potential in reducing cancer risk.
The few human
intervention
trials have been small and generally focused on intermediate
endpoints
, not response of clinically evident disease or overall survival and, thus have limited translation to practice.[
2
,
6
]
On the basis of overall evidence, the association between tomato consumption and reduced risk of prostate cancer is limited.[
7
]
Several companies distribute lycopene as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of lycopene as a treatment for
cancer
or any other medical
condition
.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
In vitro
studies that have examined a link between lycopene and prostate
carcinogenesis
have suggested several mechanisms by which lycopene might reduce prostate cancer risk.  Lycopene is broken down into a number of metabolites that are thought to have various
biological
effects, including
antioxidant
capabilities and a role in gap-junction communication.[
8
]
Treating normal human prostate
epithelial
cells with lycopene resulted in
dose-dependent
growth inhibition, indicating that inhibition of prostate cell proliferation may be one way lycopene might lower the risk of prostate cancer.[
9
]
In addition, treating prostate cancer cells with lycopene resulted in a significant decrease in the number of lycopene-treated cells in the S phase of the
cell cycle
, suggesting that lycopene may lower cell proliferation by altering cell-cycle progression. Moreover, apo-12’-lycopenal, a lycopene metabolite, reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation and may modulate cell-cycle progression.[
10
]
Some studies have suggested that cancer cells have altered cholesterol-biosynthesis pathways. Treating prostate cancer cells with lycopene resulted in dose-dependent decreases in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (the rate-limiting
enzyme
in cholesterol synthesis), total cholesterol, and cell growth, and an increase in
apoptosis
. However, adding
mevalonate
prevented the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene, indicating that the mevalonate pathway may be important to the anticancer activity of lycopene.[
11
]
Lycopene may also affect cholesterol levels in prostate cancer cells by activating the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARγ)-
liver X receptor alpha
(LXRα)-ATP-binding cassette, subfamily 1
(ABCA1) pathway
, which leads to decreased cholesterol levels and may ultimately result in decreased cell proliferation. ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux, and PPARγ has been shown to inhibit the growth and
differentiation
of prostate cancer cells. In one study, treating prostate cancer cells with lycopene resulted in increased expression of PPARγ, LXRα, and ABCA1 as well as lower total cholesterol. In addition, when the cells were treated with a PPARγ
antagonist
, cell proliferation increased, whereas treating cells with a combination of the PPARγ antagonist and lycopene decreased cell proliferation.[
12
]
Adding lycopene to medium containing the LNCaP human prostate
adenocarcinoma
cell line resulted in decreased
DNA
synthesis and inhibition of androgen-receptor gene-element activity and expression.[
13
] In a study that examined the
physiologically
relevant
concentration
of lycopene (2 mmol/L) or
placebo
for 48 hours on
protein expression
in human primary prostatic epithelial cells, proteins that were significantly upregulated or downregulated following lycopene exposure were those proteins involved in antioxidant responses, cytoprotection, apoptosis, growth inhibition, androgen receptor signaling, and the
AKT
/
mTOR
cascade. These data are consistent with previous studies, suggesting that lycopene can prevent
malignant
transformation
in human prostatic epithelial cells at  the stages of cancer initiation, promotion, and/or progression.[
14
]
A study examining the effect of lycopene on multiple points along the
nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-kappa B) signaling pathways in prostate
cell lines
demonstrated a 30% to 40% reduction in inhibitor of kappa B (I-kappa B)
phosphorylation
, NF-kappa B
transcriptional
activity  and a significant reduction in cell growth at the physiologically relevant  concentration of 1.25 μM or higher.[
15
]  These results  provided evidence  that the  anticancer properties of lycopene may occur through inhibition of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, beginning at the early stage of
cytoplasmic
IKK kinase activity, which then leads to reduced NF-kappa B–responsive gene regulation. Additionally, these effects in the cancer cells were observed at concentrations of lycopene that are relevant and achievable
in vivo
.
Some studies have assessed possible beneficial interactions between lycopene and conventional cancer therapies.  In one such study, various types of prostate cancer cells were treated with a combination of lycopene and
docetaxel
, a drug used to treat patients with
castration
-resistant prostate cancer, or each drug alone. The combination treatment inhibited proliferation in four of five cell lines to a greater extent than did treatment with docetaxel alone. The findings suggest that the mechanism for these effects may involve the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway.[
16
]
Animal studies
In a
chemoprevention study
, 59
transgenic
adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were fed diets supplemented with tomato paste or lycopene beadlets (both preparations contained 28 mg lycopene/kg chow). Mice that received lycopene beadlets exhibited a larger reduction in prostate cancer incidence compared with control mice than  mice supplemented with tomato paste, suggesting that lycopene beadlets may provide greater chemopreventive effects than tomato paste.[
17
]
Ketosamines are
carbohydrate
derivatives formed when food is dehydrated. In one study, FruHis (a ketosamine in dehydrated tomatoes) combined with lycopene resulted in greater growth inhibition of implanted rat prostate cancer cells than did lycopene or FruHis alone. In addition, in a N-methyl-N-nitrosourea/testosterone-induced prostate carcinogenesis model, rats fed a tomato paste and FruHis diet had longer survival times than rats fed only with tomato paste or tomato powder.[
18
]
Lycopene has also been studied for potential therapeutic effects in
xenograft
models. In one study,
athymic nude mice
were
injected
with human
androgen-independent
prostate cancer cells and were treated with either lycopene (4 mg/kg body weight or 16 mg/kg body weight) or
beta-carotene
(16 mg/kg body weight). Supplementing mice with lycopene or beta-carotene resulted in decreased
tumor
growth.[
19
] In an
in vitro
study, the investigators demonstrated the effect of lycopene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines.[
20
] In another study, nude mice were injected with human prostate cancer cells and treated with
intraperitoneal
injections of docetaxel, lycopene (15 mg/kg/d) administered via
gavage
, or a combination of both. Mice exhibited longer survival times and smaller tumors when treated with a combination of docetaxel and lycopene than when they were treated with docetaxel alone.[
16
]
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
Several epidemiological studies have assessed potential associations between lycopene intake and prostate cancer
incidence
.
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that populations with high intake of dietary lycopene have lower risk of prostate cancer.[
7
,
9
-
13
]   Prospective and
case-control studies
have shown lycopene to be significantly lower in the serum and tissue of patients with cancer than in controls,[
7
,
16
-
19
,
21
] while other studies have failed to demonstrate such a connection.[
22
]
An association between lycopene serum concentration and risk of cancer was also examined in men participating in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor study in Finland. In this
prospective cohort study
, an inverse association between lycopene levels and overall cancer risk was observed, suggesting that higher concentrations of lycopene may help lower cancer risk overall.  Men with the highest levels of serum lycopene had a 45% lower risk of cancer than did men with the lowest levels of lycopene (risk ratio [RR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–0.89;
P
= .015). However, when the analysis was restricted to specific cancer types, an association was observed for other cancers (RR,  0.43; 95% CI, 0.23–0.79;
P
= .007) but not prostate cancer.[
23
]
A 2015 systematic review and
meta-analysis
of studies investigating dietary lycopene intake/circulating lycopene levels  and prostate cancer risk found   that when lycopene intake was higher, the incidence of prostate cancer was reduced (
P
= .078).[
24
] Similarly, a higher level of circulating lycopene was associated with lower prostate cancer risk. Likewise, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated lycopene dietary intake and circulating lycopene with prostate cancer risk.  An inverse association between high levels of both circulating (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–0.98;
P
= .019)  and dietary lycopene (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98;
P
= .017) with prostate cancer risk was noted.[
25
]
The National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial is an ongoing, prospective study that has been a source of subjects for investigations of an association between lycopene intake and prostate cancer risk. A 2006 study examined lycopene and tomato product intakes and prostate cancer risk among PLCO participants who had been followed for an average of 4.2 years. Lycopene and tomato product intakes were assessed via food frequency questionnaires.  Overall, no association was found between dietary intake of lycopene or tomato products and the risk of prostate cancer. However, among men with a
family history
of prostate cancer, increased lycopene consumption was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk.[
26
]  A
follow-up
study was conducted that examined serum lycopene and risk of prostate cancer in the same group of PLCO participants. The results suggested no significant difference in serum lycopene concentrations between healthy participants and participants who developed prostate cancer.[
27
]
The Health Professionals Follow-up Study obtained dietary information and ascertained total and lethal prostate cancer cases from 1986 through January 31, 2010. Higher lycopene intake was inversely associated with total prostate cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–1.00) and lethal prostate cancer risk (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56–0.94). A subset analysis was restricted to men who had at least one negative PSA test at the onset, to reduce the influence of PSA screening on the association. The inverse association became markedly stronger (HR,  0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.75) for lethal prostate cancer. Levels of
tumor markers
for
angiogenesis
, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation and differentiation were
monitored
. Three of the tumor angiogenesis markers were strongly associated with lycopene intake, so that men with higher intake had tumors that demonstrated less angiogenic potential.[
28
]
At least two studies examined the effect of lycopene blood levels on the risk of
high-grade
prostate cancer. The first study examined the associations between carotenoid levels and the risk of high-grade prostate cancer, and also considered antioxidant-related genes and tumor instability. This study demonstrated that
plasma
carotenoids at diagnosis, particularly among men carrying specific somatic variations, were inversely associated with risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Higher lycopene concentrations were associated with less genomic instability among men with
low-grade
disease, indicating that lycopene may inhibit progression of prostate cancer early in its natural history.[
29
]
In another study examining whether carotenoid intake and adipose tissue carotenoid  levels were inversely associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness, results suggested that diets high in lycopene may protect against
aggressive
prostate cancer in White American men, and diets high in beta-cryptoxanthin may protect against aggressive prostate cancer in African American men.[
30
]
One study investigated the correlation between lycopene blood levels and the rate of progression of prostate cancer. This study  examined plasma carotenoids and tocopherols in relation to PSA levels among men with
biochemical recurrence
of prostate cancer. This study indicated  that the plasma cis-lutein/zeaxanthin level at 3 months was inversely related to PSA level at 3 months (
P
= .0008), while
alpha-tocopherol
(
P
= .01), beta-cryptoxanthin (
P
= .01), and all-trans-lycopene (
P
= .004) levels at 3 months were inversely related to PSA levels at 6 months. Percentage increase in alpha-tocopherol and trans-beta-carotene levels from baseline to month 3 was associated with lower PSA levels at 3 and 6 months. Percentage increase in beta-cryptoxanthin, cis-lutein/zeaxanthin and all-trans-lycopene was associated with lower PSA levels at 6 months only.[
31
]
A study examined the association of prediagnosis and postdiagnosis dietary lycopene and tomato product intake with prostate-cancer specific
mortality
in a prospective cohort of men diagnosed with
nonmetastatic
prostate cancer. No association between serum lycopene, tomato products, and prostate-cancer specific mortality was observed. Among men with high-risk cancers (T3–T4, Gleason score 8–10, or nodal involvement), consistently reporting lycopene intake  that was at or above the median was associated with lower prostate-cancer specific mortality.[
32
]
In a recently reported prospective study of 27,934 U.S. Adventist men who were followed for up to 7.9 years, consumption of canned and cooked tomato-based products (measured as
grams
for both tomato products and  lycopene),  was inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer compared with those with zero intake of  these foods.   Associations of prostate cancer risk with raw tomatoes was  not
statistically significant
. No differences in adjusted competing risk analyses  were observed between aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancers. The study was limited to self-reported food frequency questionnaires for data collection; however, lycopene concentrations were not quantified in this population.[
33
]
The variability  in these epidemiological study results may be related to lycopene source; exposure misclassification; inconsistent measures  of intake; differences in absorption; differences in individual lycopene metabolism; lack of a dose response; and confounding lifestyle factors,  such as obesity, use of tobacco and alcohol, other dietary differences, varying standardization of quantities and compositions of lycopene, geographical location, and  genetic risk factors. Most studies have examined the association of lycopene intake with the risk of all prostate cancers and have not separately considered indolent versus aggressive disease. Given these caveats, results based on epidemiological evidence should be interpreted with caution.
Interventional studies
A number of clinical studies have been conducted investigating lycopene as a chemopreventive agent and as a potential treatment for prostate cancer.
Bioavailability
The bioavailability of lycopene has been examined and demonstrated in several studies relating lycopene to prostate cancer and other diseases. The
bioavailability
of lycopene is greater in processed tomato products, such as tomato paste and tomato puree, than in raw tomatoes.[
4
] Lycopene  bioavailability  has been observed to be highly variable, which may lead to  varying biological effects after lycopene consumption. It is postulated that these variations, at least in part, can be attributed  to several
single nucleotide polymorphisms
in genes involved in red-pigment lycopene and lipid metabolism. In a study to define the impact of typical servings of commercially available tomato products on resultant plasma and  prostate lycopene concentrations,[
34
]    men scheduled to undergo prostatectomy (n = 33) were randomly assigned to either a lycopene-restricted control group (<5 mg/d) or a tomato soup (2–2¾ cups/d prepared), tomato sauce (142–198 g/d or 5–7 oz/d), or vegetable juice (325–488 mL/d or 11–16.5 fluid oz/d) intervention providing 25 to 35 mg of lycopene per day. The end-of-study prostate lycopene concentration was 0.16 nmol/g (standard error of the mean, 0.02) in the controls, but was 3.5-, 3.6- and 2.2-fold higher in tomato soup (
P
= .001), sauce (
P
= .001), and juice (
P
= .165) consumers, respectively. Prostate lycopene concentration was moderately correlated with postintervention plasma lycopene concentrations (correlation coefficient, 0.60;
P
= .001), indicating that additional factors have an impact on tissue concentrations. While the primary geometric lycopene isomer in tomato products was all-trans (80%–90%), plasma and prostate isomers were 47% and 80%
cis
-lycopene, respectively, demonstrating a shift towards cis accumulation. Consumption of typical servings of processed tomato products results in differing plasma and prostate lycopene concentrations. Factors including meal composition and genetics deserve further evaluation to determine their impacts on lycopene absorption, isomerization, and biodistribution.[
35
]
There is evidence that dietary fat may help increase the absorption of carotenoids, including lycopene. In one experiment, healthy volunteers consumed mixed-vegetable salads with nonfat, low-fat, or full-fat salad dressing. Analysis of blood samples indicated that eating full-fat salad dressing led to more carotenoid absorption than eating low-fat or nonfat dressing.[
36
]  Results of a
randomized
study published in 2005 demonstrated that cooking diced tomatoes with olive oil significantly increased lycopene absorption compared with cooking tomatoes without olive oil.[
37
] In another study,[
38
] there was no difference in
plasma
lycopene levels following consumption of tomatoes mixed with olive oil or tomatoes mixed with sunflower oil, suggesting that absorption of lycopene may not be dependent on the type of oil used. However, this study found that combining olive oil, but not sunflower oil, with tomatoes resulted in greater plasma antioxidant activity.
Pharmacodynamic studies
Healthy men participated in a crossover design study that attempted to differentiate the effects of a tomato matrix from those of lycopene by using lycopene-rich red tomatoes, lycopene-free yellow tomatoes, and purified lycopene. Thirty healthy men aged 50 to 70 years were randomly assigned to two groups, with each group consuming  200 g/d of yellow tomato paste (lycopene, 0 mg) and 200 g/d of red tomato paste (lycopene, 16 mg) as part of their regular diet for 1 week, separated by a 2-week washout period. Then, in a parallel design, the first group underwent supplementation with purified lycopene (16 mg/d) for 1 week, and the second group received a placebo. Sera samples collected before and after the interventions were incubated with lymph node cancer prostate cells to measure the expression of 45 target genes. In this placebo-controlled trial, circulating  lycopene concentration increased only after consumption of red tomato paste and purified lycopene. Lipid profile, antioxidant status, PSA, and IGF-1 were not modified by consumption of tomato pastes and lycopene. When prostate cancer cells were treated
in vitro
with sera collected from men after red tomato paste consumption, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and the ratio of Bax to Bcl2 were up-regulated, and cyclin-D1, p53, and Nrf-2 were down-regulated compared with expression levels obtained using sera taken after the first washout period. Intermediate gene expression changes were observed using sera collected from participants after consumption of yellow tomato paste with low carotenoid content. Cell incubation with sera from men who consumed purified lycopene led to significant up-regulation of IGFBP-3, c-fos, and uPAR compared with sera collected after placebo consumption. These findings suggest that lycopene may not be the only factor responsible for the cancer-protective effects of tomatoes.[
39
]
Prevention/early treatment
In another study, the effect of tomato sauce on apoptosis in
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) tissue and carcinomas was examined. Patients who were scheduled for
prostatectomy
were given tomato sauce pasta entrees (30 mg/day of lycopene) to eat daily for 3 weeks before
surgery
. Patients scheduled for surgery who did not receive the tomato sauce pasta entrees served as
control subjects
. Those who consumed the tomato sauce pasta entrees exhibited significantly decreased serum PSA levels and increased apoptotic cell death in BPH tissue and carcinomas.[
40
]
One study of 40 patients with high-grade
prostate intraepithelial neoplasia
(HGPIN) received 4 mg of lycopene twice a day or no lycopene supplementation for 2 years. A greater decrease in serum PSA levels was observed in men treated with lycopene supplements, compared with those who did not take the supplementation. During follow-up, adenocarcinomas were diagnosed more often in patients who had not received the supplements (6 of 20) than in men who had received lycopene (2 of 20). These findings suggest that lycopene may be effective in preventing HGPIN from progressing to prostate cancer.[
41
]  In another study, men at high risk of prostate cancer (e.g., HGPIN) were randomly assigned to receive a daily multivitamin (that did not contain lycopene) or the same multivitamin and a lycopene supplement (30 mg/day) for 4 months. No
statistically significant
difference was observed in serum PSA levels between the two treatment groups.[
42
] Another
randomized
placebo-controlled
study of consumption of a lycopene-rich tomato extract that was taken for approximately 6 months in 58 men with HGPIN reported no discernible effect on cell proliferation or
cell cycle inhibition
in
benign
prostatic
epithelium
or in serum PSA levels, despite a substantial increase in serum lycopene.[
43
]
In another study, 32 men with HGPIN received a lycopene-enriched diet (20–25 mg/day lycopene from triple-concentrated tomato paste) before undergoing a repeat biopsy after 6 months. No overall clinical benefit was seen in decreasing the rate of progression to prostate cancer. Baseline PSA levels showed no significant change. Prostatic lycopene concentration was the only difference between those whose repeat
biopsy
showed HGPIN,
prostatitis
, or prostate cancer. Prostatic lycopene concentration below 1 ng/mg was associated with prostate cancer at the 6-month follow-up biopsy (
P
= .003).[

Other studies have examined the potential therapeutic effect of lycopene-containing products in men with prostate cancer. The effects of lycopene supplementation on prostate tissue and prostate cancer biomarkers were investigated in men with localized prostate cancer in a 2002 pilot study. Men received either lycopene supplements (30 mg/d) or no intervention twice daily for 3 weeks before radical prostatectomy. Men in the intervention arm had smaller tumors (80% vs. 45%, less than 4 ml), less involvement of surgical margins and/or extraprostatic tissues with cancer (73% vs. 18%, organ-confined disease), and less diffuse involvement of the prostate by HGPIN (33% vs. 0%, focal involvement) compared with men in the control group. Mean plasma PSA levels were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group.[
44
] For more information on studies with lycopene, see the
Multicomponent Therapies
section.
In a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled trial,[
46
]  45 men with clinically localized prostate cancer received either 15, 30, or 45 mg of lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato) or no supplement from time of biopsy to prostatectomy (30 days).  Plasma lycopene increased from baseline to the end of treatment in all treatment groups, with the greatest increase observed in the 45 mg lycopene-supplemented arm. No toxicity was reported.   Overall, men with prostate cancer had lower baseline levels of plasma lycopene, compared with disease-free controls,  and similar to levels observed in previous studies in men with prostate cancer.[
52
,
53
] At the 30 mg lycopene dose level, a moderate decrease in mean free testosterone and significant increases in mean plasma estradiol and in serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (
P
= .022) were observed.  At the 45 mg/d dose, serum total estradiol increased (
P
= .006)  with no significant change in serum testosterone. However, serum testosterone and SHBG levels in the control group remained unchanged. The mean difference between groups who received the lycopene supplementation demonstrated a lower percentage of cells expressing Ki-67, compared with the control group. Notably, 75% of subjects in the 30 mg lycopene-supplemented arm had a decrease in the percentage of cells expressing Ki-67, compared with the subjects in the control group, in which 100% of the subjects observed an increase.  These changes were not statistically significant, compared with the changes in the control arm for this sample size and duration of intervention.  Although antioxidant properties of lycopene have been hypothesized to be primarily responsible for its beneficial effects, this study suggests that other mechanisms mediated by steroid hormones may also be involved.[
46
]
In a single-arm study of  previously untreated men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, investigators determined whether PSA velocity  was altered by a 1-year intervention with lycopene supplementation (10 mg/d). A statistically significant decrease in PSA velocity after lycopene treatment was observed (
P
= .0007). Analysis of the PSA-doubling time (pretreatment vs. post-treatment) showed a median increase after supplementation for 174 days; however, this was not statistically significant.[
47
]
In one study, prostate cancer patients  (N = 36) who had
biochemical relapse
following
radiation therapy
or surgery  received lycopene supplements twice daily for 1 year. There were six cohorts in the study, each receiving a different dose of lycopene (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 mg/d). Serum PSA levels did not respond to lycopene treatment. Plasma lycopene levels rose and appeared to plateau by 3 months for all doses. The results indicate that, although lycopene may be safe and well tolerated, it did not alter serum PSA levels in biochemically relapsed prostate cancer patients.[
48
]
In a 2004
open-label study
, patients with
hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (HRPC) (N = 20) received lycopene supplements daily (10 mg/d of lycopene) for 3 months. Of the study's participants, 50% had PSA levels that remained stable, 15% showed biochemical progression, 30%  showed a
partial response
, and one patient (5% of the total sample) exhibited a
complete response
after treatment.[
50
]  In a
phase II
study, HRPC patients took lycopene supplements daily (15 mg of lycopene/d) for 6 months. By the end of the study, serum PSA levels had almost doubled in 12 of the 17 patients, and 5 of 17 patients had achieved PSA stabilization. Although this was a small study without a
control group
,  the results suggest that lycopene may not be  beneficial for patients with advanced prostate cancer.[
51
]
In another study, 46 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer consumed either tomato paste or tomato juice daily (both preparations provided 30 mg of lycopene/d) for at least 4 months. Only one patient in this study exhibited a decrease in PSA level. Several episodes of gastrointestinal side effects were noted after eating the tomato paste or drinking the tomato juice.[
49
]
On the basis of the available evidence, early randomized clinical trials with lycopene as a single agent, in tomato products, and in combination with other agents (fish oil supplements, tomato products plus selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, soy isoflavones, grape/pomegranate juice and green/black tea) demonstrates bioavailability in serum and modulation of intermediate biomarkers implicated in prostate carcinogenesis and prostate cancer progression in most studies. Perhaps, future clinical trials should include longer duration of consistent lycopene exposure, while accounting for  variations in individual absorption of carotenoids and
heterogeneity
of high-risk (HGPIN, atypical small acinar proliferation) and prostate cancer patient populations (indolent vs. aggressive prostate cancer or androgen-dependent  vs. androgen-independent prostate cancer).

Adverse Effects
Studies evaluating lycopene in randomized clinical trials targeting men at high risk for prostate cancer and populations with prostate cancer have indicated relatively few toxicities at the dose and duration of intervention.[

50
]  Doses of lycopene ranging between 8 mg and 45 mg administered over a period ranging from 3 weeks to 2 years have been reported to be safe in randomized clinical trials targeting the prostate. When
adverse effects
occurred, they tended to present as gastrointestinal symptoms [
49
] and, in one study, the symptoms resolved when lycopene was taken with meals.[
51
] Another study reported that one participant withdrew because of
diarrhea

The FDA has accepted the determination by various companies that their lycopene-containing products meet the FDA’s requirements for the designation of GRAS.[

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
Citrus pectin (CP) is a complex
polysaccharide
found in the peel and pulp of citrus fruit and can be modified by treatment with high pH and temperature.
Preclinical
research suggests that modified citrus pectin (MCP) may have effects on
cancer
growth and
metastasis
through multiple potential mechanisms.
Very limited
clinical
research has been done with a couple of CP-containing products.  For
prostate cancer
patients, the results suggest some potential clinical benefits with relatively minor and infrequent
adverse events
.
General Information and History
Pectin is a complex polysaccharide contained in the primary
cell
walls of terrestrial plants. The word
pectin
comes from the Greek word for congealed or curdled. Plant pectin is used in food processing as a gelling agent also in the formulation of
oral
and
topical
medicines
as a stabilizer and nonbiodegradable matrix to support controlled
drug
delivery.[

]  CP is found in the peel and pulp of citrus fruit and can be modified by treatment with high pH and temperature.[
2
] Modification results in shorter
molecules
that dissolve better in water and are more readily absorbed by the body than are complex, longer chain CPs.[
3
] One of the molecular targets of MCP is galectin-3, a
protein
found on the surface and within mammalian cells that is involved in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell activation and chemoattraction, cell growth and differentiation, the
cell cycle
, and
apoptosis
; MCP inhibits galectin-3 activity.[
2
]
Some research suggests that MCP may be protective against various types of cancer, including
colon
,
lung
, and prostate cancer. MCP may exert its anticancer effects by interfering with
tumor
cell metastasis or by inducing apoptosis.[
4
]
MCP was also shown to
activate
natural killer cells
in
leukemic
cell cultures, suggesting it may be able to stimulate the
immune system
.[
5
]
Several companies distribute MCP as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of MCP as a treatment for cancer or any other medical
condition
.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
In a 2007 study, pectins were investigated for their anticancer properties. Prostate cancer cells were treated with three different pectins; CP, Pectasol (PeS, a dietary supplement containing MCP), and fractionated pectin powder (FPP). FPP induced apoptosis to a much greater degree than did CP and PeS.  Further analysis revealed that treating prostate cancer cells with heated CP resulted in levels of apoptosis similar to those following treatment with FPP. This suggests that specific structural features of pectin may be responsible for its ability to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.[
4
]
In a 2010 study, prostate cancer cells were treated with PeS or PectaSol-C,  the only two MCPs previously used in human trials. The researchers postulated that, because it has a lower molecular weight, PectaSol-C may have better
bioavailability
than PeS. Both types of MCP were tested at a
concentration
of 1 mg/mL and both were effective in  inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis through  inhibition of the MAPK/ERK
signaling pathway
and activation of the
enzyme
caspase-3.[
6
]
In one study, the role of galectin-3, a multifunctional
endogenous
lectin
,  in
cisplatin
-treated prostate cancer cells  was examined. Prostate cancer cells that expressed galectin-3 were found to be resistant to the apoptotic effects of cisplatin. However, cells that did not express galectin-3 (via silencing
RNA
knockdown of galectin-3 expression or treatment with MCP) were susceptible to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that galectin-3 expression may play a role in prostate cancer cell chemoresistance and that the
efficacy
of cisplatin treatment in prostate cancer may be improved by inhibiting galectin-3.[
7
]
Animal studies
Only a few studies have been reported on the effects of MCP in animals bearing
implanted
cancers and only one involving prostate cancer.[
8
,
9
]  The prostate cancer study examined the effects of MCP on the metastasis of prostate cancer cells injected into rats. In the study, rats were given 0.0%, 0.01%, 0.1%, or 1.0% MCP (wt/vol) in their drinking water beginning 4 days after cancer cell injection.  The analysis revealed that  treatment with 0.1% and 1.0% MCP resulted in
statistically significant
reductions in lung metastases but did not affect
primary tumor
growth.[
9
]
Human Studies
Interventional studies
In a 2007
pilot study
, patients with
advanced
solid tumors
(various types of cancers, including prostate cancer) received MCP (5 g MCP powder dissolved in water) 3 times a day for at least 8 weeks. Following  treatment,  improvements were reported in some measures of
quality of life
, including physical functioning, global health status,
fatigue
, pain, and
insomnia
. In addition, 22.5% of participants had
stable disease
after 8 weeks of MCP treatment, and 12.3% of participants had disease stabilization lasting more than 24 weeks.[
3
]
The effect of MCP on
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) doubling time (PSADT) was investigated in a 2003 study. Prostate cancer patients with rising PSA levels received six PeS capsules 3 times a day (totaling 14.4 g of MCP powder/d) for 12 months. Following treatment, 7 of 10 patients had a statistically significant (
P
≤ .05) increase in PSADT.[

Adverse Effects
In one
prospective
pilot study
, MCP was well tolerated by the majority of treated patients, with the most commonly reported
side effects
being
pruritus
,
dyspepsia
, and flatulence.[
3
] In another study,  no serious side effects from MCP were reported, although three patients withdrew from the study due to abdominal cramps and
diarrhea
that improved once treatment was halted.[

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
The
pomegranate
tree (
Punica granatum
L.) is native to Asia and cultivated widely throughout world.
Various components of the pomegranate fruit contain
minerals
and bioactive
polyphenolic
compounds
, in particular structurally distinct ellagitannins and derivatives, such as alpha-/beta-punicalagin, punicalin, and punigluconin.
Pomegranate juice and
extract
, as well as some of their bioactive components, inhibit the proliferation of various
prostate cancer
cell lines
in vitro
and induce
apoptotic
cell
death in a
dose-dependent
manner.
Cytochrome P450
enzyme
inhibition and effects on
insulin-like growth factor
binding
protein
-3 (IGFBP-3) have been identified as being involved in the
in vitro
activity.
Studies in rodent models of prostate cancer have shown that
ingestion
of pomegranate juice can decrease the rate of development, growth, and spread of prostate cancer.
The only fully reported
clinical trial
of the use of pomegranate juice in men with prostate cancer showed that, on average, study participants who drank the juice had an increase in their
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA)
doubling time
(PSADT) and it was associated with improved survival (i.e., slower progression of the disease).
No serious
adverse effects
have been reported in clinical trials of pomegranate juice
administration
(8 oz per day for up to 33 months).
A
phase II
study reported that pomegranate extract was associated with an increase of at least 6 month in PSADT in both treatment arms (different doses), without adverse effects. However, a
phase III
placebo-controlled
trial of pomegranate juice and extract did not show a significant increase in PSADT.
General Information and History
The pomegranate tree (
Punica granatum
L.) is a member of the Punicaceae family native to Asia (from Iran to northern India) and cultivated throughout the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, the East Indies, Africa, and the United States.[
1
]   The history of the pomegranate goes back centuries—the fruit is considered sacred by many religions and has been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times.[
2
]  The fruit is comprised of peel (pericarp), seeds, and aril (outer layer surrounding the seeds). The peel makes up 50% of the fruit and contains minerals and a number of bioactive polyphenolic
compounds
, in particular structurally distinct ellagitannins and derivatives, such as alpha-/beta-punicalagin, punicalin, and punigluconin. The arils are mainly composed of water and also contain phenolics and
flavonoids.
Anthocyanins, which are flavonoids present in arils, are responsible for the red color of the fruit and its juice.[
3
]  The majority of
antioxidant
activity comes from ellagitannins.[
4
] It has been shown that conversion of pomegranate ellagitannins by gut microbes produces a variety of
metabolites
, such as the urolithins.[
5
]
Research studies suggest that pomegranates have beneficial effects on a number of health
conditions,
including
cardiovascular
disease,[
6
] and may also have positive effects on
oral
or dental health.[

Several companies distribute  pomegranate as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease

cancer
or any other medical condition.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
Research studies in the laboratory have examined the effects of pomegranate on many prostate cancer cell lines and in rodent models of the disease.
Ellagitannins (the main polyphenols in pomegranate juice) are hydrolyzed to ellagic
acid
, and then to urolithin A (UA) derivatives. According to a
tissue
distribution experiment in wild-type mice, the prostate
gland
rapidly takes up high concentrations of UA after oral or
intraperitoneal
administration (0.3 mg/mouse/dose).  Ellagic acid (EA) was detected in the prostate following intraperitoneal, but not oral, administration of pomegranate extract (0.8 mg/mouse/dose).[
8
]
Treating human prostate cancer cells with  individual components of the pomegranate fruit has been shown to inhibit cell growth.[
9
-
12
] In one study,
dihydrotestosterone
-stimulated LNCaP cells were treated with 13 pomegranate compounds at various concentrations (0–100
µM
).[
10
] Four of the 13 compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), delphinidin chloride, kaempferol, and punicic acid, exhibited an ability to inhibit cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Treating cells with EGCG, kaempferol, and punicic acid further resulted in
apoptosis,
with punicic acid (a major constituent of pomegranate seeds) being the strongest inducer of apoptosis. Additionally, findings from this study suggested that punicic acid may activate apoptosis by a caspase-dependent pathway.[
10
]
Pomegranate extracts have also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells
in vitro
.[
11
,
13
,
14
]   In one study, three  prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, LNCaP-AR, and
DU-145
) were treated with pomegranate polyphenols (punicalagin [PA] or EA), a pomegranate extract (POMx, which contains EA and PA), or pomegranate juice (PJ, which contains PA, EA, and anthocyanins) in concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 50 µg/mL (standardized to PA content). All four treatments resulted in
statistically significant
increases in apoptosis and dose-dependent decreases in
cell proliferation
in the three cell lines. However, PJ and POMx were stronger inhibitors of cell growth than were PA and EA. In this study, the effects of PA, EA, POMx, and PJ on the expression of
androgen
-synthesizing enzyme
genes
and the androgen
receptor
were also measured. Although statistically significant decreases in
gene expression
occurred in LNCaP cells following treatment with POMx and in DU-145 cells following treatment with EA and POMx, significant decreases in gene expression and androgen receptor occurred in LNCaP-AR cells following all of the treatments.[
11
]   In a second study, treating PC3 cells (human prostate cancer cells with a high
metastatic
potential) with POMx (10–100 µg/mL) resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, both in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of CWR22Rv1 cells (prostate cancer cells that express the androgen receptor and
secrete
PSA) with POMx (10–100 µg/mL concentrations of pomegranate fruit extract) led to the inhibition of cell growth, a dose-dependent decrease in androgen receptor
protein expression
, and dose-dependent reductions in PSA protein levels.[
14
]
The enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP1B1) has been implicated in cancer development and progression. As a result, CYP1B1 inhibitors may be effective
anticarcinogenic
targets. In a study reported in 2009, the effects of pomegranate metabolites on CYP1B1 activation and expression in CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were examined. In this study, urolithins A and B inhibited CYP1B1 expression and activity.[
15
]
In addition, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in prostate cancer. A   study reported in 2010 examined the effects of a POMx on the IGF system. Treating LAPC4 prostate cancer cells with POMx (10 µg/mL concentration of pomegranate extract prepared from skin and arils minus seeds) resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, but treating the cells with both reagents led to larger effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis. However, these substances may have induced apoptosis by different mechanisms. Other findings suggested that POMx treatment reduced
mTOR
phosphorylation
at Ser2448 and Ser2481, whereas IGFBP-3 increased phosphorylation at those sites. In addition, CWR22Rv1 cells treated with POMx (1 and 10 µg/mL) exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in IGF1
mRNA
levels, but treatment with IGFBP-3 or IGF-1 did not alter levels of IGF1; these results suggest that one way POMx decreases prostate cancer cell survival is by inhibiting IGF1 expression.[
13
]
In a  study reported in 2011, human
hormone
-independent prostate cancer cells (DU145 and PC3 cell lines) were treated with 1% or 5% PJ for times ranging from 12 to 72 hours. The results showed that treatment with PJ increased adhesion and decreased the migration of prostate cancer cells. Molecular analyses revealed that PJ increased the expression of cell-adhesion related genes and inhibited the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal function and cellular migration. These findings suggested that PJ may be beneficial in slowing down or preventing cancer cell
metastasis.
[
16
]
Animal studies
The effects of pomegranate on prostate cancer have been examined using a number of rodent models of the disease. In one study,
athymic nude mice
were
injected
with tumor-forming cells. Following inoculation, animals were randomly assigned to receive normal drinking water or PJ (0.1% or 0.2% POMx in drinking water, which resulted in an intake corresponding to 250 or 500 mL of PJ per day for an average adult human). Small,
solid tumors
appeared earlier in mice drinking normal water only than in mice drinking PJ (8 days vs. 11–14 days). Moreover, tumor growth rates were significantly reduced in mice drinking PJ compared with mice drinking normal water only. Animals drinking PJ also exhibited significant reductions in
serum
PSA levels compared with  animals drinking normal water only.[
14
]  In other studies,  treatment with a POMx resulted in decreased tumor volumes in SCID mice that had been injected with prostate cancer cells.[
8
,
17
]
Similarly, when nude mice were injected with  pomegranate seed oil (2 µg/g body weight),  pomegranate pericarp (peel) polyphenols (2 µg/g body weight), or
saline
5 to 10 minutes before being implanted with solid prostate cancer tumors, mice injected with the  pomegranate extracts had  significantly smaller tumor volumes compared with the  mice injected with saline (
P
< .001).[
9
]
In a  study reported in 2011, 6-week-old
transgenic
adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice received normal drinking water or PJ (0.1% or 0.2% POMx in drinking water) for 28 weeks. The results showed that 100% of the mice that received water only developed tumors by age 20 weeks, whereas just 30% and 20% of the mice that received 0.1% and 0.2% PJ, respectively, developed tumors. By age 34 weeks, 90% of the  water-fed mice exhibited metastases to distant
organs
whereas only 20% of the mice that received pomegranate juice showed metastasis. The PJ-supplemented mice exhibited significantly increased life spans compared with the water-fed mice.[
18
]
Human Studies
Three clinical studies have examined the effect of interventions with pomegranate products on changes in PSADT in patients with biochemically
recurrent
prostate cancer who had a rising PSA level after
surgery
or
radiation therapy
for presumed
localized
cancer.[
19
]  The first study was a single-arm trial of 48 patients who drank 8 ounces (570 mg/d total polyphenol gallic acid equivalents) of PJ for up to 33 months.  PSADT rose from a mean of 15 months (±11 months) at baseline to a mean of 54 months (±102 months,
P
< .001) on treatment (with a twofold increase in median PSADT from 11.8 to 24 months,
P
= .029).[
20
]
The second phase II study was published in 2013 and randomly assigned  92 patients to either 1 g (polyphenol gallic acid  content equivalent to 8 ounces of pomegranate juice) (n = 47)   or 3 g of pomegranate extract powder (n = 45 )for up to 18 months. Overall, median PSADT increased from 11.9 to 18.5 months (
P
< .001), but no dose effect was seen (
P
= .554). Median PSADT increased from 11.9 to 18.8 months in the low-dose arm and from 12.2 to 17.5 months in the high-dose arm.[
21
]
The third trial was a
randomized,
double-blinded
, placebo controlled study published in 2015.  Of the 183 patients who enrolled, 64 patients were treated with placebo, 17 patients were treated with PJ, and 102 patients were treated with pomegranate liquid extract, which contained the same compounds found in PJ, with the exception of a higher proportional content of pomegranate polyphenol and a lower anthocyanidin content. The median change in PSADT was 4.5 months for the placebo group, 1.6 months for the extract group, and 7.6 months for the juice group; however, no paired comparison of groups was statistically significant.[
22
]
The differences in results between the trials may be partly because of less aggressive disease in the 2006 patient population with lower starting PSA values, but they may also be because the first two trials lacked a placebo arm. All three trials found that pomegranate extract was safe to consume. Of note, in both the 2006 and 2013 studies, two patients in each trial had a 50% decline in PSA.  In light of these findings, researchers wondered if there may be a sensitive subpopulation that might benefit from PJ.  One potential genetic biomarker candidate is manganese superoxide dismutase (
MnSOD
), which is the primary antioxidant enzyme in
mitochondria
. A
polymorphism
at
codon
16 of the
MnSOD
gene in men encodes either alanine (A) or valine (V). The AA
genotype
has been associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and with more sensitivity to antioxidants than the VA or VV genotype.[
23
] A preplanned
subset analysis
in the 2015 study of the 34 (22%) men with
MnSOD
AA genotype  demonstrated a greater PSADT lengthening in the liquid extract group (median PSADT increased from 13.6 months to 25.6 months,
P
= .03) while no significant change was seen in the placebo group of
MnSOD
(median PSADT increased from 10.9–12.7 months,
P
= .22).  In summary, the finding that men with the AA genotype who received pomegranate extract had greater lengthening of PSADT (i.e., slower progression of disease) than did men in the placebo arm, along with the safe profile of PJ and extract in three large studies, suggest that there may be benefit in further studies in the AA
MnSOD
subpopulation.

Adverse Effects
In a  study of  prostate cancer patients reported in 2006, the PJ intervention was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were observed.[
20
]
In a
pilot study
reported in 2007, the safety of PJ in patients with
erectile dysfunction
was examined. No serious adverse effects were observed during this study, and no participant dropped out due to adverse
side effects
. In the
analysis
of the results,  no statistical comparisons were made of the adverse side effects observed in the intervention arm and the

arm.[

Animal

The results of epidemiological studies suggest some complexity in the association between
blood
levels of selenium and the risk of developing
prostate cancer
.
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), a large
multicenter
clinical trial
, was initiated to examine the effects of selenium and/or
vitamin E
on the development of prostate cancer.
Initial results of SELECT, published in 2009, showed no
statistically significant
difference in the rate of prostate cancer in men who were randomly assigned to receive the selenium supplements.
In 2011, updated results from SELECT showed no
significant
effects of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk, but men who took vitamin E alone had a 17% increase in prostate cancer risk compared with men who took a placebo.
In 2014, an analysis of    SELECT results showed that men who had high selenium status at
baseline
and who were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplementation had an increased risk of
high-grade
prostate cancer.
General Information and History
Selenium is an essential trace mineral involved in a number of biological processes, including enzyme regulation, gene expression, and immune function. Selenium was discovered in 1818 and named after the Greek goddess of the moon, Selene.[
1
] A number of selenoproteins have been identified in humans, including selenoprotein P (SEPP), which is the main selenium carrier in the body and is important for selenium
homeostasis
.
Food sources of selenium include meat, vegetables, and nuts. The selenium content of the soil where food is raised determines the amount of selenium found in plants and animals. For adults, the recommended daily allowance for selenium is 55
µg
.[
2
] Most
dietary
selenium occurs as selenocysteine or selenomethionine.[
1
] Selenium accumulates in the
thyroid gland
,
liver
,
pancreas
,
pituitary gland
, and renal medulla.[
3
]
Selenium is a component of the enzyme
glutathione
peroxidase, an enzyme that functions as an
antioxidant
.[
4
] However, at high
concentrations
, selenium may function as a
pro-oxidant
.[
2
]
Selenium is implicated in a number of disease states. Selenium
deficiency
may result in Keshan disease, a form of childhood cardiomyopathy, and Kaskin-Beck disease, a bone
disorder
.[
5
] Some clinical trials have suggested that high levels of selenium may be associated with
diabetes
[
6
] and high
cholesterol
.[
2
]
Selenium may also play a role in cancer. Animal and epidemiological studies have suggested there may be an inverse relationship between selenium supplementation and cancer risk.[
7
] The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPC) was a
randomized
,
placebo-controlled
study designed to test the
hypothesis
that higher selenium levels were associated with lower
incidence
of
skin cancer
. The results indicated that selenium supplementation did not affect risk of skin cancer, although incidences of
lung
,
colorectal
, and prostate cancer were significantly reduced.[
8
]
There is evidence that selenoproteins may be associated with
carcinogenesis
. For example, reduced expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 and SEPP have been observed in some
tumors
, while increased expression of glutathione peroxidase 2 occurs in colorectal and lung tumors.[
7
]
Some companies distribute selenium as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of selenium as a treatment or prevention for cancer.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
Different selenium-containing
compounds
have variable effects on prostate cancer
cells
as well as normal cells and
tissues
.  Both naturally occurring and
synthetic
organic forms of selenium have been shown to decrease the growth and function of prostate cancer cells.[
9
]  In a 2011 study, prostate cancer cells were treated with various forms of selenium; selenite and methylseleninic
acid
(MSeA) had the greatest
cytotoxic
effects.[
10
]
Studies have suggested that selenium
nanoparticles
may be less
toxic
to normal tissues than are other selenium compounds. One study investigated the effects of selenium nanoparticles on prostate cancer cells. The treated cells had decreased activity of the
androgen
receptor
, which led to
apoptosis
and growth inhibition.[
11
]
Sodium selenite
In a 2010 study, prostate cancer cells treated with
sodium
selenite (a natural form of selenium) exhibited increased levels of
p53
(a
tumor suppressor
). Findings also revealed that p53 may play a key role in selenium-induced apoptosis.[
12
]
In a second study, the hormone-sensitive prostate
cancer cell line
LNCaP was modified to separately
overexpress
each of four antioxidant enzymes. Cells from the modified cell line were then treated with sodium selenite. The cells overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase (
MnSOD
) were the only ones able to suppress selenite-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that superoxide production in
mitochondria
may be important in selenium-induced apoptosis occurring in prostate cancer cells and that levels of
MnSOD
in cancer cells may determine the effectiveness of selenium in inhibiting those cells.[
13
]
One study treated prostate cancer cells and
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) cells with sodium selenite. Growth of LNCaP cells was stimulated by noncytotoxic, low concentrations of sodium selenite; while growth inhibition occurred in hormone-insensitive PC-3 cells at these concentrations—prompting the authors to suggest that selenium may be beneficial in advanced prostate cancer—selenium supplementation may have
adverse effects
in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.[
14
] However, the relevance of these findings to the
clinical
setting is unclear.  These experiments used selenium concentrations of 1 µg/
mL
to 10 µg/mL, whereas the average U.S. adult male
serum
selenium concentrations are about 0.125 µg/mL,[
15
] and prostate tissue concentrations are about 1.5 µg/g.[
16
]
Animal studies
A 2012 study investigated whether various forms of selenium (i.e., SeMet and selenium-enriched yeast  [Se-yeast]) differentially affect
biomarkers
in the prostate. Elderly dogs received nutritionally adequate or supranutritional levels of selenium in the form of SeMet or Se-yeast. Both types of selenium supplementation increased selenium levels in toenails and prostate tissue to a similar degree. The different forms of selenium supplementation showed  no significant differences in
DNA
damage, proliferation, or apoptosis in the prostate.[
17
]
At least one study has compared these three forms of selenium in
athymic nude mice
injected
with human prostate cancer cells and found that MSeA was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than was SeMet or selenite.[
18
]  Another study investigated the effect of age on selenium
chemoprevention
in mice. Mice were fed selenium-depleted or selenium-containing (at nutritional or supranutritional levels)
diets
for 6 months or 4 weeks and were then injected with PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Adult mice that were fed selenium-containing diets exhibited fewer tumors than did adult mice fed selenium-depleted diets. In adult mice, selenium-depleted diets resulted in tumors with more
necrosis
and
inflammation
compared with selenium-containing diets. However, in young mice, tumor development and
histopathology
were not affected by dietary selenium.[
19
]
The effects of MSeA and methylselenocysteine (MSeC) have also been explored in a transgenic model of
in situ
murine prostate cancer development, the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse.[
20
]  Treatment with MSeA and MSeC resulted in slower
progression
of
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN) lesions, decreased
cell proliferation
, and increased apoptosis compared with treatment with water.  MSeA treatment also increased survival time of TRAMP mice. TRAMP mice that received MSeA treatment starting at age 10 weeks exhibited less
aggressive
prostate cancer than did mice that started treatment at 16 weeks, suggesting early
intervention
with MSeA may be more effective than later treatment.  The same research group later investigated some of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the different effects of MSeA and MSeC.   MSeA and MSeC were shown to affect proteins involved in different cellular pathways.  MSeA mainly affected proteins related to prostate
differentiation
, androgen receptor signaling, protein folding, and endoplasmic reticulum-stress responses, whereas MSeC affected enzymes involved in
phase II detoxification
or cytoprotection.[
21
]  One study suggested that MSeA may inhibit cell growth and increase apoptosis by inactivating PKC isoenzymes.[
22
]
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
The results of
epidemiological
studies suggest some complexity in the association between the blood levels of selenium and the risk of acquiring prostate cancer.  As part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Heidelberg study, men completed dietary questionnaires, had blood samples taken, and were monitored every 2 to 3 years for up to 10 years. The findings revealed a significantly decreased risk of prostate cancer for individuals with higher blood selenium concentrations.[
23
] In a
prospective
pilot study
, prostate cancer patients had significantly lower whole blood selenium levels than did healthy males.[
24
]  However, in a 2009 study of prostate cancer patients, men with higher
plasma
selenium levels were at greater risk of being
diagnosed
with aggressive prostate cancer (
relative risk
, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99–1.84).[
25
]
Various molecular pathways have been explored to better understand the association between blood selenium levels and the development of prostate cancer.  In the EPIC-Heidelberg study,
polymorphisms
in the selenium-containing enzymes
GPX1
and
SEP15
genes
were found to be associated with prostate cancer risk.[
23
] Another study that used DNA samples obtained from the EPIC-Heidelberg study suggested that prostate cancer risk may be associated with
single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in thioredoxin reductase and selenoprotein K genes along with selenium status.[
26
] A 2012 study investigated associations between variants in selenoenzyme genes and risk of prostate cancer and prostate cancer–specific
mortality
. Among SNPs analyzed, only
GPX1
rs3448 was related to overall prostate cancer risk.[
27
]
A
retrospective
analysis
of prostate cancer patients and healthy controls showed an association between aggressive prostate cancer and decreased selenium and
SEPP
status.[
28
]  In the Physicians' Health Study, links between SNPs in the
SEPP
gene (
SEPP1
) and prostate cancer risk and survival were examined. Two SNPs were significantly associated with prostate cancer incidence: rs11959466 was associated with increased risk, and rs13168440 was associated with decreased risk. Tumor
SEPP1
mRNA
expression levels were lower in men with lethal prostate cancer than in men with nonlethal prostate cancer.[
29
] In one study, the direction of the association between blood selenium levels and advanced prostate cancer incidence differed according to which of two polymorphisms a patient had for the gene encoding the enzyme MnSOD.  For men with the alanine-alanine (AA)
genotype
, higher selenium levels were associated with a reduced risk of presenting with aggressive disease, whereas the opposite was seen among men with a valine (V)
allele
.[
25
]
An analysis of 4,459 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were initially diagnosed with prostate cancer found that selenium supplementation of 140 μg or more per day after
diagnosis
of
nonmetastatic
prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. The authors recommended caution in the use of selenium supplements among men with prostate cancer. Risk of prostate cancer mortality rose at all levels of selenium consumption. Men who consumed 1 to 24 μg/day, 25 to 139 μg/day, and 140  μg/day or more of supplemental selenium had a 1.18-fold (95% CI, 0.73–1.91), 1.33-fold (95% CI, 0.77–2.30), and 2.60-fold (95% CI, 1.44–4.70) increased prostate cancer mortality risk compared with nonusers, respectively (
P
trend
= .001). The authors reported no statistically significant association between selenium supplement use and
biochemical recurrence
,
cardiovascular disease
mortality, or overall mortality.[
30
]
In summary, these epidemiological studies present a conflicting picture. Some studies showed that  higher selenium levels were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer;  others showed a correlation between higher selenium levels and more aggressive prostate cancer.
Genetic
differences in the
SEPP
gene may explain the different responses to selenium.
Interventional studies
Interventional studies have examined the
efficacy
of selenium in preventing and treating prostate cancer.
Prevention
In one study, 60 healthy adult males were randomly assigned to receive either a daily
placebo
or 200 µg of selenium glycinate supplements for 6 weeks. Blood samples were collected at the start and end of the study. Compared with the placebo group, men who received selenium supplements had significantly increased activities of two blood selenium enzymes and significantly decreased levels of
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) at the end of the study.[
31
]
A
meta-analysis
published in 2012 reviewed human studies that investigated links between selenium intake, selenium status, and prostate cancer risk. The results suggested an association between decreased prostate cancer risk and a narrow range of selenium status (plasma selenium concentrations up to 170 ng/mL and toenail selenium concentrations between 0.85 and 0.94 µg/g).[
32
]
However, in 2013, results of a
phase III
randomized, placebo-controlled trial were reported. The trial investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on prostate cancer incidence in men at high risk for the disease. Participants (N = 699) were randomly assigned to receive either daily placebo or one of two
doses
of high–Se-yeast (200 µg/d or 400 µg/d). The participants were monitored every 6 months for  up to 5 years. Compared with placebo, selenium supplementation had no effect on prostate cancer incidence or
PSA velocity
.[
33
] Another study examined men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia  (HGPIN) who were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 200 µg of selenium daily for 3 years or until prostate cancer diagnosis. The results also suggested that selenium supplementation had no effect on prostate cancer risk.[
34
]
A 2018 Cochrane review that examined the role of selenium in cancer prevention consolidated these studies in a meta-analysis and noted a risk ratio of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.90–1.14) when four prostate cancer studies were reviewed that involved 18,942 patients.[
35
]
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
On the basis of findings from earlier studies,[
8
,
36
] the SELECT, a large multicenter clinical trial, was initiated by the
National Institutes of Health
in 2001 to examine the effects of selenium and/or vitamin E on the development of prostate cancer. SELECT was a phase III, randomized,
double-blind
, placebo-controlled, population-based trial.[
37
] More than 35,000 men, aged 50 years or older, from more than 400 study sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, were randomly assigned to receive vitamin E (
alpha-tocopherol
acetate
, 400
IU
/d) and a placebo, selenium (L-selenomethionine, 200 µg/d) and a placebo, vitamin E and selenium, or two placebos daily for 7 to 12 years. The
primary endpoint
of the clinical trial was incidence of prostate cancer.[
37
]
Initial results of SELECT were published in 2009. There were no statistically significant differences in rates of prostate cancer in the four groups. In the vitamin E–alone group, there was a nonsignificant increase in rates of prostate cancer (
P
= .06); in the selenium–alone group, there was a nonsignificant increase in incidence of
diabetes mellitus
(
P
= .16). On the basis of those findings, the data and safety monitoring committee recommended that participants stop taking the study supplements.[
38
]
Updated results of SELECT were published in 2011. When compared with the placebo group, the rate of prostate cancer detection was significantly higher in the vitamin E–alone group (
P
= .008) and represented a 17% increase in prostate cancer risk. The incidence of prostate cancer was also higher in men who took selenium than in men who took placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant.[
39
]
A number of explanations have been suggested, including the dose and form of vitamin E used in the trial and the specific form of selenium chosen for the study. L-selenomethionine was used in SELECT, while selenite and Se-yeast had been used in previous studies. SELECT researchers chose selenomethionine because it was the major component of Se-yeast and because selenite was not absorbed well by the body, resulting in lower selenium stores.[
40
] In addition, there were concerns about product consistency with high–Se-yeast.[
41
] However, selenomethionine is involved in general protein synthesis and can have numerous metabolites such as methylselenol, which may have
antitumor
properties.[
42
,
43
]
Toenail selenium concentrations were examined in two-case cohort subset studies of SELECT participants. Total selenium concentration in the absence of supplementation was not associated with prostate cancer risk. Although selenium supplementation in SELECT had no effect on prostate cancer risk among men with low selenium status at baseline, it increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer in men with higher baseline selenium status by 91% (
P
= .007). The authors concluded that men should avoid selenium supplementation at doses exceeding recommended dietary intakes.[
44
]
Complicating this picture, an international collaboration compiled and reanalyzed data from 15 studies, including the SELECT trial, that investigated the association between blood and toenail selenium concentrations and prostate cancer risk.[
45
] In the analysis of 6,497 men with prostate cancer and 8,107 controls, blood selenium level was not associated with the risk of total prostate cancer, but high blood selenium level was associated with a lower risk of aggressive disease. Toenail selenium concentration was inversely associated with risk of total prostate cancer (
odds ratio
, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.22–0.40;
P
trend
< .001), including both aggressive and nonaggressive disease.
In a case-cohort analysis of the SELECT trial, 1,434 men underwent analysis of SNPs in 21 genes, investigators found support for the hypothesis that
genetic variation
in selenium and vitamin E metabolism/transport genes may influence the risk of overall and high-grade prostate cancer;  selenium or vitamin E supplementation may modify an individual's response to those risks.[
46
]
In summary, data from the SELECT trial did not provide evidence that selenium, when given to unselected populations, decreased the risk of prostate cancer. Subsequent analyses have shown that baseline selenium levels may influence the outcomes of selenium supplementation, though the evidence remains conflicting. Emerging evidence suggests that SNPs in genes related to both selenium and prostate cancer likely modify the effect of selenium supplementation. Further research is needed to better understand which patients may benefit from or be harmed by selenium supplementation.
To date, the most recent literature demonstrates that when administered to a non-selected population, selenium has no significant effect on either prostate cancer prevention or PSA levels.
Treatment
A study explored the potential role of selenium in prostate cancer patients on
active surveillance
. It examined 140   men who were randomly assigned to receive low-dose selenium (200 µg/d), high-dose selenium (800 µg/d), or placebo daily for up to 5 years. Selenium was given in the form of Se-yeast.  The results showed no significant difference in PSA velocity across treatment groups.  Concerningly, men who received  high-dose selenium and had the highest baseline plasma selenium levels, had a higher
PSA velocity
than did men in the placebo group. There was no significant effect of selenium supplements on PSA velocity in men who had lower baseline levels of selenium.[
47
]
Another study  examined the  potential role selenium played in the adjuvant setting.  Prostate cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive either combination
silymarin
(570
mg
) and selenomethionine (240 µg) supplement or placebo daily for 6 months following
radical prostatectomy
. While there was no change in PSA levels between the groups after 6 months, the participants who received supplements reported improved
quality of life
and showed decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol.[

Adverse Effects
Selenium supplementation was well tolerated in many clinical trials. In two published trials, there were no differences reported in adverse effects between placebo or treatment groups.[

P
= .08).[

Overview
This section contains the following key information:
Soy
foods (e.g., soy milk, miso, tofu, and soy flour) contain
phytochemicals
that may have health benefits and,  among these, soy
isoflavones
have been the focus of most of the research.
Soy isoflavones are
phytoestrogens
.  The major isoflavones in
soybeans
are
genistein
(the most abundant),
daidzein
, and glycitein.
Genistein affects components of multiple growth and
proliferation
-related pathways in
prostate cancer
cells
, including the
COX-2
/
prostaglandin
,
epidermal growth factor
(EGF), and
insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) pathways.
Some
preclinical studies
have indicated that the combined effect of multiple isoflavones may be greater  than that of a single isoflavone.
Some
animal studies
have demonstrated prostate cancer
prevention
effects with soy and genistein; however, other animal studies have yielded conflicting results regarding beneficial effects of genistein on prostate cancer
metastasis
.
Epidemiological
studies have generally found high consumption of nonfermented soy foods to be associated with   a decreased risk of prostate cancer.
Early-phase
clinical trials
with isoflavones, soy, and soy products for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer have been limited to relatively short durations of intervention and sample sizes with low statistical power.  These studies  targeted
heterogeneous
prostate cancer patient populations (in high-risk, early- and later-
stage
disease) and varying doses of isoflavones, soy, and soy products, and have not demonstrated evidence of reducing prostate cancer
progression
.
Other trials evaluating the role of isoflavones, soy, or soy products in  the management of
androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT)
side effects
have found no improvement with isoflavone treatment compared with placebo.
Soy products are generally well tolerated in patients with prostate cancer.  In clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effects were mild
gastrointestinal
symptoms.
General Information and History
Soybean, a major food source and a medicinal substance, has been used in China for centuries. Soybean was used as one of the early food sources in China.[
1
,
2
] Soybean was mentioned in the book titled,
The Classic of Poetry
(Shijing, 11th–7th centuries BCE), with its collection and cultivation. During the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), soybean became one of five major foods (“five grains”) of the Chinese. The medical use of  soybean was also discussed in one of the major Chinese medicine books titled,
Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor
(Huangdi Neijing, 400 BCE and 260 BCE), which stated that  “five grains are used to nourish and replenish the body." In
traditional Chinese medicine
, soybean has been used to treat
kidney
conditions
, promote water retention and reduce swelling, and for weakness, dizziness, poor sleep, and
night sweats
.
Although records of soy use in China date back to the 11th century BCE, it was not until the 18th century that the soy plant reached Europe and the United States.  The soybean is an incredibly versatile plant. It can be processed into a variety of products including soy milk, miso, tofu, soy flour, and soy oil.[
3
]
Soy foods contain a number of phytochemicals that may have health benefits, but isoflavones have garnered the most attention. Among the isoflavones found in soybeans, genistein is the most abundant and may have the most
biological
activity.[
4
]  Other isoflavones found in soy include daidzein and glycitein.[
5
] Many of these isoflavones are also found in other legumes and plants, such as
red clover
.
Isoflavones are quickly taken up by the gut and can be detected in
plasma
as soon as 30 minutes after the consumption of soy products. Studies suggest that maximum levels of isoflavone plasma
concentration
may be achieved by 6 hours after soy product consumption.[
6
]  Isoflavones are phytoestrogens that bind to
estrogen receptors
. Prostate
tissue
is known to express estrogen receptor beta and it has been shown that the isoflavone genistein has greater
affinity
for estrogen receptor beta than for estrogen receptor alpha.[
7
]
A link between isoflavones and prostate cancer was first observed in epidemiological studies that demonstrated a lower risk of prostate cancer in populations consuming considerable amounts of dietary soy.[
8
,
9
]  Subsequent studies evaluating the role of soy in experimental models further showed anticancer properties of soy, specifically  relevant to prostate
carcinogenesis
.  These early studies have led to a few clinical trials in humans using soy food products or supplements that targeted men with varying stages of prostate cancer.  Although these studies showed modulation of intermediate
endpoints
or surrogate
biomarkers
of prostate cancer progression, the results indicating beneficial effects from soy or soy products have been mixed.
Several companies distribute soy as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of soy as a treatment for
cancer
or any other medical condition.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
Individual isoflavones
A number of
laboratory studies
have examined ways in which soy components affect prostate cancer cells. In one study, human prostate cancer cells and normal prostate
epithelial
cells were treated with either an ethanol vehicle (carrier) or isoflavones. Treatment with genistein decreased COX-2
mRNA
and
protein
levels in cancer cells and normal epithelial cells more than did treatment with the vehicle. In addition, cells treated with genistein exhibited reduced
secretion
of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reduced mRNA levels of the prostaglandin
receptors
EP4 and FP, suggesting that genistein may exert
chemopreventive
effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which promote
inflammation
.[
10
]  In another study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein or daidzein. The isoflavones were shown to down regulate
growth factors
involved in
angiogenesis
(e.g.,
EGF
and IGF-1) and the
interleukin
-8
gene
, which is associated with cancer progression. These findings suggest that genistein and daidzein may have chemopreventive properties.[
11
] Both genistein and daidzein have been shown to reduce the proliferation of LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells
in vitro
. However, during the 72 hours of
incubation
, only genistein provoked effects on the dynamic
phenotype
and decreased invasiveness in PC-3 cells. These results imply that invasive activity is at least partially dependent on
membrane
fluidity and that genistein may exert its antimetastatic effects by changing the mechanical properties of prostate cancer cells. No such effects were observed for daidzein at the same dose.[
12
]
Combinations of isoflavones
Some experiments have compared the effects of individual isoflavones with isoflavone combinations on prostate cancer cells. In one study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with a soy
extract
(containing genistin, daidzein, and glycitin), genistein, or daidzein. The soy extract induced
cell cycle
arrest and
apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells to a greater degree  than did treatment with the individual isoflavones. Genistein and daidzein activated apoptosis in noncancerous
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) cells, but the soy extract had no effect on those cells. These findings suggested that products  containing a combination of active
compounds
(e.g.,
whole foods
) may be more effective in preventing cancer than individual compounds.[
13
]  Similarly, in another study, prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein,
biochanin A
, quercetin, doublets of those compounds (e.g., genistein + quercetin), or with all three compounds. All of the treatments resulted in decreased cell proliferation, but the greatest reductions occurred using the combination of genistein, biochanin A, and quercetin. The triple combination treatment induced more apoptosis in prostate cancer cells than did individual or doublet compound treatments. These results indicate that combining phytoestrogens may increase the effectiveness of the individual compounds.[
14
]
At least one study has examined the combined effect of soy isoflavones and
curcumin
.  Human prostate cancer cells were treated with isoflavones, curcumin, or a combination of the two. Curcumin and isoflavones in combination were more effective in lowering PSA levels and expression of the
androgen
receptor than were curcumin or the isoflavones individually.[
15
]
Animal studies
Animal models
of prostate cancer have been used in studies investigating the effects of soy and isoflavones on the disease. Wild-type and
transgenic
adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were fed control diets or diets containing genistein (250 mg genistein/kg chow). The TRAMP mice fed with genistein exhibited reduced cell proliferation in the prostate compared with TRAMP mice fed a control diet. The genistein-supplemented diet also reduced levels of ERK-1 and ERK-2 (proteins important in stimulating cell proliferation) as well as the growth factor receptors epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in TRAMP mice, suggesting that down regulation of these proteins may be one mechanism by which genistein exerts chemopreventive effects.[
16
]  In one study, following the appearance of spontaneous
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
lesions
, TRAMP mice were fed control diets or diets supplemented with genistein (250 or 1,000 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice fed low-dose genistein exhibited more cancer cell metastasis and greater osteopontin expression than mice fed the control or the high-dose genistein diet. These results indicate that timing and dose of genistein treatment may affect prostate cancer outcomes and that genistein may exert biphasic control over prostate cancer.[
17
]
In a  study reported in 2008, athymic mice were implanted with human prostate cancer cells and fed a control or genistein-supplemented diet (100 or 250 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice that were fed genistein exhibited less cancer  cell metastasis but no change in primary tumor volume, compared with mice fed a control diet. Furthermore, other data suggested that genistein  inhibits metastasis by impairing cancer cell detachment.[
18
]
In contrast, in a study reported in 2011, there were more metastases in secondary
organs
in genistein-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice.  In this latter study,  mice were implanted with human prostate cancer
xenografts
and treated daily with genistein dissolved in peanut oil (80 mg genistein/kg body weight/d or 400 mg genistein/kg body weight/d) or peanut oil vehicle by
gavage
.   In addition, there was a reduction in tumor cell apoptosis in the genistein-treated mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice. These findings suggest that genistein may stimulate metastasis in an animal model of
advanced
prostate cancer.[
19
]
Radiation therapy
is commonly used in prostate cancer, but, despite this treatment,   disease
recurrence
is common. Therefore, combining radiation with additional therapies may provide longer-lasting results.  In one study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with soy isoflavones and/or radiation. Cells that were treated with both isoflavones and radiation exhibited greater decreases in cell survival and greater expression of proapoptotic
molecules
than cells treated with  isoflavones or radiation only. Nude mice were implanted with prostate cancer cells and treated by gavage with genistein (21.5 mg/kg body weight/d), mixed isoflavones (50 mg/kg body weight/d; contained 43% genistein, 21% daidzein, and 2% glycitein),  and/or radiation. Mixed isoflavones were more effective than genistein in inhibiting prostate tumor growth, and combining isoflavones with radiation resulted in the largest inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, mice given soy isoflavones in combination with radiation did not exhibit
lymph node
metastasis, which was seen previously in other experiments combining genistein with radiation. These preclinical findings suggest that mixed isoflavones may increase the efficacy of radiation therapy for prostate cancer.[
20
]
In the treatment of prostate cancer, bone health is a common concern in the setting of
hormone
deprivation therapy, which is associated with bone loss. Because of increased beta versus alpha estrogen receptor binding, soy-derived compounds are  thought to be protective of bone. Animal studies have shown that genistein and daidzein can prevent or reduce bone loss in a manner similar to
synthetic
estrogen.   Both isoflavones may
modulate
bone remodeling by targeting and regulating
gene expression
and may inhibit
calcium
urine
excretion, which also helps to maintain
bone density
.[
21
,
22
]
Human Studies
Human studies evaluating isoflavones and soy for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer have included epidemiological studies and early-phase trials.  Several phase I-II
randomized
clinical studies have examined  isoflavones and soy product for
bioavailability
, safety, and effectiveness in prostate cancer prevention or treatment.[
23
-
25
]  These studies have included a wide range of subject populations, including high-risk men; prostate cancer patient populations (
localized
and later-stage disease); varying doses of isoflavones, soy, and soy products; and were limited to relatively short durations of
observation
or intervention and sample sizes with low statistical power.
Epidemiological studies
In 2018, a
meta-analysis
of studies  that investigated soy food consumption and  risk of prostate cancer was reported. The results of this meta-analysis suggested that high consumption of nonfermented soy foods (e.g., tofu and soybean milk) was significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer. Fermented soy food intake, total isoflavone intake, and circulating isoflavones were  not associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.[
26
] However, these data from
population studies
must be interpreted with caution as the studies relied on self-reported data obtained using varying forms of dietary data collection instruments with recall
bias
, in addition to numerous forms of individual or multiple isoflavones, soy supplements, and soy foods. Additionally, these studies failed to account for other confounding
genetic
or behavioral variables that may affect the risk of prostate cancer.
Prevention studies
Too few randomized
placebo-controlled
trials have been completed to evaluate the effect of isoflavones or soy in preventing prostate cancer progression (see
Table 3
). The studies targeted men with negative prostate biopsies and elevated
serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (2.5–10 mcg/mL at
baseline
). The duration of intervention was between 6 months [
15
] and 1 year [
27
,
28
], with varying formulations of isoflavones derived from soy [
15
,
27
] and red clover.[
28
] In a single trial that showed no significant changes in serum PSA  after intervention with isoflavones, a reduction in prostate cancer progression at 1 year in a subgroup of men older than 65 years was demonstrated. Other than mild to moderate adverse events, no treatment-related
toxicities
were observed in all three trials.

Treatment of prostate cancer
Clinical trials evaluating isoflavones, soy supplements, and soy products (see
Table 4
and
Table 5
) for treating localized prostate cancer before
radical prostatectomy
have used window-of-opportunity trial designs (from biopsy to prostatectomy). These trials have primarily focused on evaluating serum and tissue biomarkers implicated in prostate cancer progression, bioavailability in plasma and prostate tissue, and toxicity at various doses. The trials are small in size and of short duration. They are useful for informing the design of well-powered larger clinical trials in the future, but they provide inadequate data to inform clinical practice.

ADT is commonly used for
locally advanced
and metastatic prostate cancer. However, this treatment is associated with a number of adverse side effects including sexual
dysfunction
, decreased
quality of life
, changes in
cognition
, and
metabolic syndrome
. Three studies have examined men undergoing ADT who were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or an isoflavone supplement (soy protein powder mixed with beverages; isoflavones, 160 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Two studies assessed ADT side effects. Neither study found an improvement in side effects following isoflavone treatment, compared with placebo.[

In this study of men undergoing ADT, participants were randomly assigned to receive high-dose isoflavone supplements (providing 160 mg/d total isoflavones, and containing 64 mg genistein, 63 mg daidzein, and 34 mg glycitein) or a placebo for 12 weeks.  The results showed no difference between the two groups in PSA levels or in levels of
metabolic
and
inflammatory
parameters (e.g., glucose, interleukin-6).[

Overview
Vitamin D
is made naturally by the body when exposed to sunlight.
Preclinical studies
suggest that vitamin D may have effects on
prostate cancer
cells
through various pathways.
Numerous
epidemiological
studies have researched the relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer.
Some
intervention
studies have focused on
calcitriol
, the hormonally active form of vitamin D, in prostate cancer patients.
General Information and History
Vitamin D, also called calciferol,
cholecalciferol
(D3), or
ergocalciferol
(D2), is a
fat-soluble vitamin
found in fatty fish, fish liver oil, eggs, and fortified dairy products. Vitamin D is made naturally by the body when exposed to sunlight.
In 1922, researchers discovered that heated, oxidized cod-liver oil, called
fat-soluble factor A
and later known as vitamin D, played an important role in
curing
rickets
in rats.[
1
]
Vitamin D performs many roles in the body, including the following:
Promotes
absorption
of
calcium
in the
small intestine
.
Improves muscle strength and
immune function
.
Helps to reduce
inflammation
.
Helps to maintain adequate
blood
levels of calcium and
phosphate
.
Vitamin D is needed for bone growth and protects against
osteoporosis
in adults.[
2
]  Vitamin D status is usually checked by measuring the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the blood.
Companies distribute vitamin D as a
dietary supplement
. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of vitamin D as a  treatment for
cancer
.
Preclinical/Animal Studies
In vitro
studies
To study the role of vitamin D in cancer cell adhesion to endothelium, one study developed a microtube system that simulates the microvasculature of
bone marrow
. The study reported that 1,25-alpha-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) suppressed adhesion of prostate cancer cells in the microtube system. In addition, it was shown that 1,25-D3  increased E-cadherin expression, which may prevent prostate cancer cell adhesion to endothelium by promoting cancer cell aggregation.[
3
]
Vitamin D–binding
protein
(VDBP) transports vitamin D in the bloodstream.  Studies have shown that one of its products, VDBP-
macrophage
activating factor (VDBP-maf), may have
antiangiogenic
and
antitumor
activities. One study examined the effects of VDBP-maf on prostate cancer cells. Treating prostate cancer cells with VDBP-maf resulted in inhibited cellular migration,
proliferation
, and reduced levels of
urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor
(uPAR; activity of this receptor correlates with
tumor
metastasis
). These findings suggest that VDBP-maf has a direct effect on prostate cancer cells.[
4
]
Studies have reported that 1,25-D3 may play an important role in prostate cancer biology. Studies have suggested that protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (PDIA3), may function as a
membrane
receptor binding to 1,25-D3. According to one study, PDIA3 is expressed in normal prostate cells as well as in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer
cell lines
. In addition, their findings suggest that 1,25-D3 may act on prostate cancer cells via multiple signaling pathways, indicating there may be a number of potential
therapeutic
targets.[
5
]
Androgen
metabolism
in prostate cancer cells may be altered by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)
2
D), providing an additional antitumor mechanism. Vitamin D
compounds
activate
enzymes
involved in
cholesterol
and
steroid
hormone
metabolism. This may reduce
intracellular
testosterone
levels in prostate cell lines and decrease the availability of pro-survival androgenic steroids.[
6
]
Vitamin D has also been combined with
radiation
in an
in vitro
study. In this study, prostate cancer cells were treated with
valproic acid
(VPA) and/or 1,25-D3, followed by radiation. Cells that were treated with VPA and/or 1,25-D3 and radiation had greater decreases in cell proliferation than did cells treated solely with radiation. The greatest reduction in cell proliferation occurred in cells treated with VPA, 1,25-D3, and radiation.[
7
]
In vivo
studies
Tumor progression
was compared in two murine models of prostate cancer. In vitamin D receptor–knockout animals, the rate of tumor progression and
cellular proliferation
were greater than in wild type animals.  However, in mice that were supplemented with testosterone, these differences did not occur, suggesting that there may be
significant
interaction between androgen signaling and vitamin D signaling.[
8
]
In a 2011 study, nude mice were fed a control
diet
or a diet deficient in vitamin D and then
injected
with prostate cancer cells into bone marrow or
soft tissues
.
Osteolytic
lesions
were larger and progressed at a faster rate in vitamin D–deficient mice that had bone marrow injected with cancer cells than in mice that had adequate levels of vitamin D. However, there was no difference in soft tissue tumors among mice with different vitamin D levels. Results of this study show that vitamin D
deficiency
is associated with growth of prostate cancer cells in bone but not in soft tissue.[
9
]
A 2014 study evaluated
calcitriol
and a less-calcemic vitamin D
analogue
in an aggressive
transgenic
adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Neither vitamin D analogue impacted the rate of development of
castration
-resistant prostate cancer in mice, whether they were treated before or after castration. However, both vitamin D analogs slowed progression of primary tumors in hormone-intact mice but enhanced distant
organ
metastases after prolonged treatment. In sum, intervention with potent vitamin D compounds in TRAMP mice slowed androgen-stimulated tumor progression but, over time, may have led to more aggressive disease as indicated by increased
distant metastases
(
P
= .0823).[
10
] This preclinical data supports findings of the 2008
retrospective study
[
11
] of an association between
serum
vitamin D levels and aggressive prostate cancer. For more information about this study, see the
Human Studies
section.
Vitamin D as adjuvant therapy
Cryotherapy
may be used for treating prostate cancer. Studies have been conducted to identify potential agents that may help improve
efficacy
of the freezing procedure. In a 2010 study, mice were injected with prostate cancer cells and treated with calcitriol,
cryoablation
, or both. The combination treatment group experienced larger necrotic areas, more
apoptosis
, and less cell proliferation than did the other
experimental
groups.[
12
] A subsequent study corroborated these findings, showing that combining calcitriol and cryoablation resulted in more cell death than cryotherapy alone.[
13
]
In vitro
and
in vivo
studies have shown that vitamin D compounds potentiate the cytotoxicity of many anticancer agents, including
docetaxel
.[
6
] The effect is most pronounced when vitamin D compounds are administered before or simultaneously with the cytotoxic agents.
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
The relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer has been examined in numerous epidemiological studies with mixed results. A meta-analysis published in 2011 reviewed 25 studies that examined the link between prostate cancer incidence and indicators of vitamin D intake or sufficiency. No association was found between dietary vitamin D or circulating concentrations of vitamin D and risk of prostate cancer.[
14
]
Low sun exposure
An important means of obtaining vitamin D is by sunlight. Studies have investigated the potential link between sunlight exposure and prostate cancer. According to a 2006 study,
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels rise at a slower rate during spring and summer than at other times of the year; this may be related to higher vitamin D levels obtained during those months.[
15
] One study found that while men with low levels of sun exposure had increased risk of all prostate cancers, less sun exposure was associated with lower risk of advanced disease in men with prostate cancer. Results of a meta-analysis, published in the same report, showed that men with low sun exposure had an increased risk of incident and advanced prostate cancer.[
16
]
Dietary vitamin D
The association between dietary vitamin D or circulating concentrations of vitamin D and risk of prostate cancer has been studied. In a study of 699 patients with prostate cancer who underwent
screening
and 958 healthy controls, calcium and vitamin D intake were evaluated using food frequency questionnaires.[
17
] The study population included 888 African American patients, 620 European American patients, 111 Hispanic American patients, and 38 Asian or  Middle Eastern American patients. The study found that high calcium intake was significantly associated with higher odds of developing aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] Q1 vs. Q4, 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01–3.91), while high vitamin D intake was associated with lower odds of developing aggressive prostate cancer (OR Q1  vs. Q4,  0.38; 95% CI, 0.18–0.79). This finding was statistically significant for African American men.
In a  cross-sectional analysis of 119 men (88 African American patients and 31 European American patients) who underwent a  prostatectomy, tumor proliferation (as indicated by Ki-67 measured in prostate tissue) demonstrated an inverse correlation between serum 1,25(OH)
2
D and Ki-67 in tumor cells. These results provided preliminary evidence of an antiproliferative activity of vitamin D. No correlation was observed between 25(OH)D and a
biomarker
of tumor proliferation (Ki-67).[
18
]
Serum 25(OH)D
A
meta-analysis
of 19
prospective
or
cohort
studies examined the correlation between circulating 25(OH)D and the development of prostate cancer. The study explored the summary
relative risk
(RR) assessed per 10 ng/mL increments in circulating 25(OH)D concentration levels.[
19
] A higher 25(OH)D concentration was significantly correlated with an elevated risk of prostate cancer (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.24).
Another meta-analysis of 19
prospective studies
provided individual participant data on circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)
2
D for up to 13,462 men with incident prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants. Results showed that 25(OH)D concentration was positively associated with a risk of total prostate cancer (multivariable-adjusted OR that compared highest vs. lowest study-specific fifth, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.13–1.31;
P
trend
< .001).[
20
] However, this association varied by disease aggressiveness (
P
heterogeneity
= .014). Higher circulating 25(OH)D was associated with a higher risk of nonaggressive disease (OR per 80 percentile increase, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13–1.36) but not with aggressive disease, defined as stage 4, metastases, or prostate cancer death (OR per 80 percentile increase, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78–1.15). 1,25(OH)
2
D concentration was not associated with risk of prostate cancer overall or by tumor characteristics.[
20
]
In a case-control study of men who had undergone prostate
biopsies
, results showed that men who had lower vitamin D levels before biopsy were more likely to have cancer detected at biopsy than did men whose prebiopsy vitamin D levels were not lower.[
21
] Serum 25(OH)D levels were obtained from 667 men in Chicago who underwent a  first prostate biopsy for an elevated PSA level or an abnormal digital
rectal
exam.[
21
] Severe vitamin D deficiency (<12
ng
/
mL
) was associated with increased risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy among African American men. Severe deficiency was positively associated with higher Gleason score (≥4+4), higher clinical stage (>cT2b), and overall risk category in both White American and African American men.
Genetic factors
Investigators conducted an updated two-sample mendelian randomization analysis that examined the effect of 25(OH)D on prostate cancer.[
22
] Six genetic
variants
associated with plasma 25(OH)D concentration were used as instrumental variables. Summary statistics for the outcome were extracted from the largest
genome-wide association study
to date that included 79,148 prostate cancer patients and 61,106 controls. No evidence was found to support a causal association between 25(OH)D and the risk of prostate cancer (OR per 25 nmol/L increase 1.00 [0.93–1.07];
P
= .99) or advanced disease (OR per 25 nmol/L increase 1.02 [0.90–1.16];
P
= 0.72). However, even with a large number of participants, the authors  stated that they could not “exclude a modest or non-linear effect of vitamin D” on the risk of prostate cancer.
Several studies have explored a possible connection between the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and risk of prostate cancer. A 2011 prospective study (N = 841) examined VDR expression in prostate tumors. Patients with high levels of VDR expression had lower PSA levels at diagnosis, less
advanced
tumor stage, and reduced risk of lethal prostate cancer compared with patients with lower levels of VDR expression in tumors.[
23
]  A 2010 study examined
polymorphisms
in the VDR receptor, the vitamin D activating enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (
CYP27B1
), and deactivating enzyme 24-hydroxylase (
CYP24A1
). Variations in the three
genes
were associated with changes in the risk of
recurrence
and progression of prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality.[
24
] In a case-
controlled study
of more than  1,000 patients and controls in each group, multiple VDR
single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were compared with serum 25(OH)D levels. Vitamin D-related SNPs influenced serum 25(OH)D, but gene-serum 25(OH)D effect modification for prostate cancer was marginally observed only for
CYP24A1
/
rs2248359
and
high-grade
prostate cancer.  VDR correlations varied between African American and White populations.[
25
] In another case-controlled study, two SNPs in VDBP were associated with increased prostate cancer risk and high Gleason grade.[
26
] However, in another large cohort-consortium study, a statistically significant association was not observed for either 25(OH)D or vitamin D-related SNPs with fatal prostate cancer.[
27
]
In a 2009 study, genetic variants in VDR were analyzed in patients with prostate cancer who participated in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial (N = 1,604). This analysis was combined with information from a meta-analysis of 13 studies. Five polymorphisms of VDR were identified in the participants. A meta-analysis, published in the same report, revealed no association between specific variants and prostate cancer stage (
TNM staging system
), but found that three genotypes (
Bsm1
,
Apa1
, and
Taq1
) may be associated with cancer grade (Gleason score). This suggests that there may be a link between specific VDR polymorphisms and advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis.[
28
]
In a retrospective study of 515 patients with prostate cancer  and an independent  cohort of 411 patients, two VDR binding site variants (
HFE
and
TUSC3
) were identified as plausible susceptibility genes.[
29
]
A meta-analysis of 27 studies was conducted that  included 9,993 prostate cancer cases and 9,345 controls. The pooled results showed that the
Bsm1
polymorphism of vitamin D metabolism was not associated with prostate cancer risk in an overall analysis.[
30
]
Survival
In a  Danish Prostate Cancer  Registry, a total of 4,065 men who underwent a  prostate
biopsy
and had a vitamin D level checked between 2004 and 2010 were monitored.[
31
] No association between serum vitamin D level and prostate cancer risk was found. However,
overall survival
was lowest in men with serum vitamin D deficiency. A significantly higher prostate cancer–specific
mortality
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.45–3.90;
P
< .001) and all-cause mortality (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.33–3.24;
P
= .001) were observed in patients with vitamin D deficiency compared with patients with  serum vitamin D sufficiency. A
dose
-response meta-analysis of seven cohort studies with 7,808 participants also concluded that higher levels of 25(OH)D  were associated with a reduction of mortality in patients with prostate cancer.[
32
] A study of 1,000 men who were followed for 23 years examined prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D and prostate cancer survival.[
33
] Men with higher serum 25(OH)D were less likely to die of prostate cancer (HR Q5 vs. Q1, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52–0.99;
P
trend
= .006).
One analysis examined 943 participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and enrolled in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. The relationship between prediagnostic levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) and survival was examined.[
34
] The
mean
time from
diagnosis
until the end of
follow-up
was 9.1 years (standard deviation [SD], 4.5 years), and the mean time from inclusion until end of follow-up was 16.6 years (SD, 4.9 years). The study found a trend toward higher survival with vitamin D levels above 85 nmol/L. This finding became
statistically significant
in the third quartile of 25(OH)D levels (85–102 nmol/L), compared with  the first quartile (<68 nmol/L). The  HR was 0.54 (0.34–0.85) when adjusted for age, time of inclusion, and
body mass index
. The association was further strengthened when adjusted for age at diagnosis,
Gleason score
, and TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification, with an HR of 0.36 in the third quartile (0.22–0.60;
P
=  .03).
One hundred ninety men who participated in a large epidemiological study underwent
radical prostatectomy
for clinically
localized
prostate cancer.[
35
] At the time of
prostatectomy
, 87 men (45.8%) exhibited adverse pathology, defined as primary Gleason  4, any Gleason  5, or extraprostatic extension. Men with adverse pathology had a lower
median
serum 25(OH)D (22.7 ng/mL) compared with their counterparts (27.0 ng/mL), and were also more likely to have a serum 25(OH)D level of less than 30 ng/mL.
In the MARTINI-Lifestyle cohort study,
biochemical recurrence
(BCR) after radical prostatectomy was studied in 3,849 men who were followed for 3 years and  had levels of serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured at the time of
surgery
.[
36
] When stratified according to median vitamin D levels, the BCR-free survival rate at follow-up was 82.7% in patients with vitamin D levels of less than 19.3 μg/L and 83.0% in patients with levels of 19.3 μg/L or greater (
P
≤ .59). The authors concluded that “a recommendation should therefore be made to compensate for a potential deficiency and not with the expectation of a reduction in the risk of progression."
In another retrospective study, 111 men with prostate cancer had serum levels of plasma 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)
2
D measured at 4.9 years or 8.6 years postdiagnosis. An analysis  examined all-cause and prostate-specific mortality.[
37
] Plasma 1,25(OH)2D levels (but not 25(OH)D levels) were inversely associated with all-cause mortality (HR for highest relative to lowest quartile,  0.45; 95% CI, 0.29–0.69) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14–1.19). In a subset analyses, these associations were apparent only in men with aggressive prostate cancer;  the all-cause mortality HR was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.15–0.52;
P
= .07) and the prostate cancer-specific mortality HR was  0.26 (95% CI, 0.07–1.00).
A study of 943 patients with prostate cancer examined serum levels of vitamin D and aggressive prostate cancer.[
38
] There was a possible relationship between vitamin D and low-risk tumors. There were both positive and negative interactions between
parathyroid hormone
, calcium, and vitamin D and the risk of prostate cancer. These results were similar for low-risk and aggressive cases.
In a study of 155 African American men with prostate cancer, vitamin D levels were measured at diagnosis.[
39
]  The study found that vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) significantly increased the risk of aggressive disease (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.03–9.57;
P
= .04). Stratification by total calcium dietary intake showed that high calcium intake (≥800 mg/day) modified this association (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.15–47.68;
P
interaction = .03). The genetic variant
rs11568820
appeared to increase the magnitude of association between deficient serum vitamin D levels and aggressive prostate cancer (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.12–11.75;
P
= .05).
Interventional studies
In a 2009 study, patients  with
locally advanced
or metastatic prostate cancer and
asymptomatic
progression of their PSA levels were treated with
vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol) at either 10
μg
or 25 μg daily. The investigators reported that about  20% of these patients had at least a 25% drop in PSA level 3 months after initiating the vitamin D2.[
40
]
Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D), the hormonally active form of vitamin D, has been the focus of some studies in prostate cancer patients. In an
open-label
,
phase II
study, patients with recurrent prostate cancer were treated with calcitriol and
naproxen
for 1 year. This treatment was effective in decreasing the rate of rising PSA levels in study participants, suggesting it may slow disease progression.[
41
] In a 2010 study, patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with calcitriol and
dexamethasone
. The results indicated that while the treatments were well tolerated, they did not have an effect on participants' PSA levels.[
42
]
In a 2018 randomized controlled trial, men aged 50 years or older and women aged 55 years or older received vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and
omega-3 fatty acid
supplements for the prevention of cancer and
cardiovascular disease
. The vitamin D supplement did not result in a lower incidence of any cancer, including prostate cancer, or cardiac disease compared with a
placebo
.[
43
]
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 before-after studies and 6 randomized controlled studies evaluated the effect of vitamin D
supplementation
on PSA change, PSA response proportion, mortality, and
adverse effects
. The analysis of controlled clinical trials found  no significant difference between vitamin D supplementation and the placebo groups for PSA change from baseline (weighted mean difference,  -1.66 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.69 to 0.36;
P
= .543), PSA response proportion (RP) (RP, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.97–1.45;
P
= .104), and mortality rate (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81–1.36;
P
= .713). Single-arm trials revealed that vitamin D supplementation had a modest effect on PSA response proportion. Nineteen percent of enrolled patients had at least a 50% reduction in PSA levels by the end of treatment (95% CI, 7%–31%;
P
= .002). The authors believed that the evidence from these studies did not show important benefits from vitamin D supplementation and thus such supplementation should not be recommended as part of treatment.[
44
]
A post hoc analysis was conducted on data from two randomized controlled trials. Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer received the combination of a
statin
and vitamin D with abiraterone (AA). The analysis reported that one study (
COU-AA-301
) found that the use of AA with a statin and vitamin D reduced the risk of death by 38% (
P
= .0007), while AA alone was associated with a decrease in the risk of death by 10% (
P
= .025). The second study (
COU-AA-302
) compared AA plus a statin and vitamin D  with
prednisone
alone and found that the use of AA plus a statin and vitamin D was associated with a reduced risk of death by 26% (
P
= .0054).[
45
]
Symptom management
A small group of patients (N = 59) who underwent
androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) were randomly assigned to receive high-dose vitamin D (600
IU
/day plus 50,000 IU/week), low-dose vitamin D (600 IU/day), or a placebo for 24 weeks.[
46
] Muscle mass was measured using bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), and strength was measured before and after supplementation. Muscle mass improved with high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation, but strength did not. No other measures of cancer outcomes were reported.

Adverse Effects
Vitamin D toxicity
In most cases,
symptoms
of vitamin D
toxicity
are caused by
hypercalcemia
, but limited evidence suggests high concentrations of vitamin D may also be expressed in various organs, including the following:
Kidneys
.
Bones.
Central nervous system
.
Cardiovascular
system.
Symptoms of toxicity may be observed at an intake of 10,000 to 50,000 IU per day over a period of many years. Hypercalcemia results from the vitamin D–dependent increase in
intestinal
absorption of calcium, leading to rapid increases in blood calcium levels.
Side effects
include loss of the
urinary
concentrating mechanism of the kidney tubule (resulting in polyuria and polydipsia), decrease in growth factor receptor, hypercalciuria, and the metastatic
calcification
of soft tissues. The central
nervous system
may also be affected, resulting in severe
depression
and
anorexia
.[
47
]
A  systematic review of the interactions and
pharmacokinetics
of vitamin D and drugs used for the treatment of cancer was published.[
48
] Based on the review, 26 articles met the inclusion criteria.  Calcitriol was the most commonly administered form of vitamin D, and adults with prostate cancer and
solid tumors
were the most well-represented populations in this systematic review. Hypercalcemia (at a dose of 74 μg/wk [3,000 IU]; 125 μg/wk [5,000 IU] with the addition of dexamethasone) was the most frequently reported side effect.
Hypophosphatemia
was also observed in two studies [
49
,
50
]   that administered vitamin D in conjunction with docetaxel in men with prostate cancer. The authors concluded that no adverse effects were experienced beyond what was expected from high-dose calcitriol supplementation and was denoted as having a low risk of interaction.  Some chemotherapeutic
regimens
appear to reduce serum 25(OH)-D3 and/or 1,25-D3.
A number of studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of high-dose calcitriol in conjunction with
chemotherapy
drugs in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer,
hormone-refractory
prostate cancer, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.[
50
-
52
]  In the studies that used docetaxel plus calcitriol for men with androgen-independent prostate cancer, no increased toxicity was observed when compared with docetaxel alone.
In men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, one study examined the activity and tolerability of weekly high-dose calcitriol (32 μg/wk [1,300 IU]) with docetaxel in patients who had previously received docetaxel treatment.[
49
]  Calcitriol was given orally in three divided doses, and docetaxel was given intravenously (30
mg
/m
2
) with dexamethasone (8 mg) orally 12 hours before, at the time of, and 12 hours after docetaxel
administration
.  Most of the side effects were expected toxicities related to the chemotherapy.  Grade 2 hypercalcemia was observed in one patient. Administration of calcitriol was discontinued until hypercalcemia resolved. Supplementation was restarted after 2 weeks.  In another patient, persistent grade 3
fatigue
was observed, and treatment of calcitriol was discontinued as docetaxel was reduced.
Phase I trials
Phase I
studies have looked at the
maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of weekly intravenous and oral calcitriol in conjunction with various chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. One study examined the MTD of calcitriol in conjunction with
gefitinib
at 250 mg/day (
oral chemotherapy
used to treat
lung cancer
) in 32 patients with advanced solid tumors that were metastatic or
unresectable
.[
53
] At doses up to 74 μg (3,000 IU) per week, no
dose-limiting
toxicities were observed. Grade 2 hypercalcemia was observed in two of four patients receiving 96 μg per week (3,900 IU) of calcitriol and was denoted nontolerable. No
significant
bone marrow suppression was observed at any dose. A dose of 74 μg (3,000 IU) per week was denoted as the MTD. The study suggests no major interaction between calcitriol and gefitinib.
A second phase I study examined the MTD and pharmacokinetics of calcitriol when administered with
paclitaxel
over the course of 6 weeks.[
54
]  Thirty-six patients (
heterogenous
diagnoses) were enrolled in the trial and received escalating doses of oral calcitriol starting at 4 μg (160 IU) for 3 consecutive days, increasing to 38 μg (1,520 IU) with an 80-mg/m
2
infusion
of paclitaxel given weekly. Results demonstrate that very high doses of calcitriol can be safely administered with paclitaxel. There was no dose-limiting toxicity in the trial, and at a dose of 38 μg/wk, no clinically significant hypercalcemia occurred. However, it is important to note that participants were administered from 8 to 76
capsules
of calcitriol with no report of adherence to the
prescribed
dose of calcitriol.

Overview
Most
dietary
vitamin E
comes from gamma-tocopherol.  Food sources of vitamin E include vegetable oil, nuts, and egg yolks.
Research suggests that vitamin E may protect against a number of
chronic
diseases, such as
cardiovascular disease
.
Studies suggest that
alpha-tocopherol
–associated
protein
(TAP) may have capabilities as a
tumor suppressor
in
prostate cancer
.
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), a large
multicenter
clinical trial
, was initiated by the
National Institutes of Health
(NIH) in 2001 to examine the effects of
selenium
and/or vitamin E on the development of prostate cancer.
In 2011, updated results from SELECT showed that men who took vitamin E alone had a 17% increase in prostate cancer risk compared with men who took
placebo
.
In 2014, an analysis of    SELECT results showed that men who had high selenium status at
baseline
and who were randomly assigned to receive selenium
supplementation
had an increased risk of
high-grade
prostate cancer, but vitamin E supplementation had no effect among men with high selenium status.
General Information and History
Vitamin E was discovered in 1922 as a factor essential for reproduction.[
1
]
Vitamin E occurs in eight different forms: four tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and sigma-) and four tocotrienols (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and sigma-).[
2
] Compared with other tocopherols, alpha-tocopherol (the form of vitamin E commonly found in dietary supplements) is the most abundant in the body and the most biologically active. Most dietary vitamin E  comes from gamma-tocopherol.  Food sources of vitamin E include vegetable oil, nuts, and egg yolks.[
3
]
The
bioavailability
of vitamin E depends on a number of factors, such as the food matrix containing vitamin E (e.g., low- or high-fat food).[
4
] Vitamin E is delivered to
tissues
by high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively). Delivery by LDL occurs via an endocytic pathway, while the protein’s
ATP
-binding cassette, subfamily 1 and scavenger
receptor
class B type 1 (SR-BI) are involved in HDL vitamin E transport.[
5
]
Research suggests that vitamin E may protect against a number of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease.[
5
] Many of vitamin E’s health benefits have been ascribed to its actions as a powerful
antioxidant
; as with other antioxidants, vitamin E protects
cell
membranes
by interfering with reactions that would form
lipid
hydroperoxide products.[
5
] Vitamin E also has nonantioxidant functions; it has been shown to
modulate
signaling pathways and
gene expression
.[
3
]
Companies distribute vitamin E as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe.  Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and  there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of vitamin E as a treatment for cancer.
Human Studies
Epidemiological studies
The National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study was initiated to examine whether supplemental vitamin E and dietary tocopherol intakes may prevent prostate cancer. Participants in the study completed food-frequency questionnaires and were
monitored
for 5 years. No association between vitamin E supplements and prostate cancer risk was found. However, a reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer was observed with high intakes of gamma-tocopherol.[
6
]
In a 2010 study, levels of
trace elements
and vitamin E were measured in prostate cancer patients who had significantly lower levels of
plasma
vitamin E than did healthy controls. In addition, there was an inverse association between
prostate-specific antigen
levels and plasma vitamin E.[
7
]
Studies suggest that alpha-tocopherol–associated protein (TAP) may have capabilities as a
tumor
suppressor in prostate cancer. In a 2007 study, prostate cancer specimens, which had been obtained from
radical prostatectomy
, were examined for TAP expression. Results showed reduced TAP expression in prostate cancer
tissue
and lower levels of TAP were associated with higher
clinical stage
and larger tumor size.[
8
]
A study published in 2011 examined
serum
alpha-tocopherol and supplemental vitamin E intake with sex
steroid
hormones
in participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Results showed an inverse association between serum alpha-tocopherol levels and sex steroid hormones, but only in smokers.[
9
]
Serum alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol levels and prostate cancer risk were examined in participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial. An inverse relationship was observed between alpha-tocopherol levels and prostate cancer, but only in current and recently former smokers.[
10
] A
meta-analysis
of nine nested
case-control studies
, representing approximately 370,000 men from several countries, also found an inverse relationship between
blood
alpha-tocopherol levels and prostate cancer risk in all patients studied rather than limited to a smoking subset.[
11
] No association was seen with gamma-tocopherol levels in this analysis. The risk of prostate cancer decreased by 21% for every 25 mg/L increase in blood alpha-tocopherol levels.
The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project investigated racial and geographic differences in prostate cancer
aggressiveness
.[
12
] The effects of food intake of tocopherols, vitamin E supplementation, and adipose tissue
biomarkers
of tocopherol were studied. In 1,023 African American men and 1,079 White men with incident prostate cancer, inverse associations were observed between dietary sources of tocopherol and prostate cancer aggressiveness that were
statistically significant
in White men but not in African American men.
Interventional studies
The Physicians’ Health Study II investigated whether
vitamin C
or vitamin E prevents prostate cancer and other
cancers
in men. Participants were randomly assigned to receive vitamin E (
synthetic
alpha-tocopherol, 400
IU
qod) and/or vitamin C (synthetic
ascorbic acid
, 500
mg
/d) supplements and were monitored for an average of 8 years. The overall rates of prostate cancer were very similar in the vitamin E supplement and placebo groups, suggesting that vitamin E may not prevent prostate cancer. Furthermore, vitamin E did not have an effect on total cancer or
mortality
in these participants.[
13
]
Although not primarily designed for this purpose, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study has been a resource for researchers investigating prostate cancer and vitamin E.[
14
] A long
follow-up
study of participants in the ATBC Study was conducted. Baseline serum alpha-tocopherol levels and dietary intake of vitamin E was assessed and participants were monitored for up to 19 years. Findings revealed that while there was no association between dietary vitamin E levels and prostate cancer risk, higher serum alpha-tocopherol levels may be associated with a decreased risk for developing advanced prostate cancer.[
15
] In a 2009 study, blood samples obtained from participants in the ATBC Study were analyzed and genotyped. Results showed that
genetic
variations in the
TTPA
and
SEC14L2
genes
were associated with serum alpha-tocopherol but did not directly affect prostate cancer risk. However, results suggested that
polymorphisms
in
SEC14L2
may influence the effect of alpha-tocopherol supplementation on prostate cancer risk.[
16
] One study also focused on the ATBC Study and investigated whether serum alpha-tocopherol levels
affected
survival time in men
diagnosed
with prostate cancer. Serum alpha-tocopherol levels were assessed at baseline and 3 years later. Higher serum alpha-tocopherol levels, at both baseline and the 3-year point, were associated with improved prostate cancer survival.[
17
] Findings from 28 years of follow-up of the
cohort
confirmed the lack of association between serum alpha-tocopherol levels and prostate cancer risk.[
18
] However, high alpha-tocopherol
concentration
was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer among participants in the trial who were supplemented  with alpha-tocopherol (fifth quintile vs. first quintile; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79;  95% CI, 0.64–0.99).
A 2011 study examined links between serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherols and risk of prostate cancer among participants in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET). CARET was a
randomized
,
placebo-controlled
study that investigated whether daily supplementation of
beta-carotene
and
retinyl palmitate
would reduce the risk of
lung cancer
in heavy smokers and
asbestos
-exposed workers. Results indicated that among current smokers, higher levels of serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherols were associated with reduced risk of aggressive prostate cancer. In addition, findings suggested there may be an interaction between myeloperoxidase (MGO) G-463A
genotype
, serum alpha-tocopherol level, and prostate cancer risk. There was an inverse relationship between prostate cancer risk and serum alpha-tocopherol levels in certain genotypes.[
19
]
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
On the basis of findings from earlier studies,[
14
,
20
] the SELECT, a large
multicenter
clinical trial
, was initiated by the NIH in 2001 to examine the effects of selenium and/or vitamin E on the development of prostate cancer. SELECT was a
phase III
, randomized,
double-blind
, placebo-controlled, population-based trial.[
21
] More than 35,000 men, aged 50 years or older, from more than 400 study sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico were randomly assigned to receive vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol
acetate
, 400 IU/d) and a placebo, selenium (L-selenomethionine, 200 µg/d) and a placebo, vitamin E and selenium, or two
placebos
daily for 7 to 12 years. The
primary endpoint
of the clinical trial was
incidence
of prostate cancer.[
21
]
Initial results of SELECT were published in 2009. There were no statistically significant differences in rates of prostate cancer in the four groups. In the vitamin E–alone group, there was a nonsignificant increase in rates of prostate cancer (
P
= .06); in the selenium–alone group, there was a nonsignificant increase in incidence of
diabetes mellitus
(
P
= .16). On the basis of those findings, the data and safety monitoring committee recommended that participants stop taking the study supplements.[
22
]
Updated results were published in 2011. When compared with placebo, the rate of prostate cancer detection was significantly greater in the vitamin E–alone group (
P
= .008) and represented a 17% increase in prostate cancer risk. There was also greater incidence of prostate cancer in men who had taken selenium than in men who had taken placebo, but those differences were not statistically significant.[
23
]
Toenail selenium levels were
assayed
in a two-case
cohort study
of a subset of SELECT participants. Vitamin E supplementation alone had no effect in men with high selenium status at baseline but increased the risks of total (63%;
P
= .02),
low-grade
(46%;
P
= .09), and high-grade (111%;
P
= .008) prostate cancer among men with lower baseline selenium status. The authors concluded that men older than 55 years should avoid supplementation with either vitamin E or selenium at
doses
exceeding dietary recommendations.[
24
] In a case-cohort analysis of 1,434 men in the SELECT who underwent analysis of
single nucleotide polymorphisms
in 21 genes, investigators found support for the
hypothesis
that
genetic variation
in selenium and vitamin E metabolism/transport genes may influence the risk of overall- and high-grade prostate cancer and that selenium or vitamin E supplementation may modify an individual's
response
to those risks.[
25
]
The dose and form of vitamin E used in SELECT may have contributed to the results. On the basis of the results of the ATBC Study, all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate was the form of vitamin E used in SELECT. The dose used in SELECT (400 IU) was higher than that in the ATBC Study. SELECT researchers opted for the higher dose because it was found in vitamin supplements, there was evidence for benefits of higher doses (including reductions in Alzheimer’s disease and
age-related macular degeneration
), and it was thought the higher dose would be more protective against prostate cancer than a lower dose.[
26
] A study of serum metabolomic response to vitamin E supplementation found that high-dose (400 IU/d) but not low-dose (50 IU/d)  vitamin E resulted in a significant reduction in a novel C22 lactone sulfate that was highly correlated with alterations of androgenic steroid metabolites, possibly explaining the discordant results of the two trials.[
27
] Following the results of SELECT, it has been posited that high levels of alpha-tocopherol may affect levels of gamma-tocopherol, another form of vitamin E that may have
chemopreventive
effects.[
28
] Another important difference between the ATBC Study and SELECT that may explain the findings was the smoking status of study participants. Participants in the ATBC Study were smokers, while 7.5% of SELECT participants used
tobacco
products.[

Adverse Effects
Alpha-tocopherols have been deemed Generally Recognized as Safe by the FDA.[
30
]
In the Physicians’ Health Study II, there were no significant adverse effects reported for
gastrointestinal tract
symptoms
,
fatigue
, drowsiness, skin discoloration or rashes, or migraine. However, participants who took vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol, 400 IU qod) experienced a greater number of hemorrhagic strokes than did participants who took placebo.[
13
] An increase in hemorrhagic strokes among participants in the vitamin E group (alpha-tocopherol, 50 mg/d) also was noted in the ATBC Study.[
14
]
In the initial report of results from SELECT,  there were no significant differences between incidences of less severe
adverse effects
(e.g.,
alopecia
,
dermatitis
, and
nausea
) experienced by the groups that received vitamin E (rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 400 IU/d) and those experienced by the other treatment groups.[
22
] Follow-up analysis of SELECT participants revealed an increased risk of prostate cancer among men in the vitamin E–alone group.[

Adverse effects
Pomi-T (Pomegranate, Green Tea, Broccoli, and Turmeric)
In a
placebo-controlled
,
double-blind
,
randomized
study, 199 men with
localized
prostate cancer
were randomly assigned to either a food supplement, Pomi-T, or
placebo
(2:1) for 6 months.[
1
]  Pomi-T contained 100
mg
each of
pomegranate
whole fruit powder, broccoli powder, and
turmeric
powder; and 20 mg of
green tea extract
(equivalent to 100 mg of tea). The
herbal
ingredients in this supplement were raw, dry, powdered plant materials and one plant
extract
, none of which were
chemically
standardized. Chemical standardization is widely performed with herbal extracts, as a means of enhancing the reproducibility of studies with herbal
dietary supplements
via qualitative and quantitative chemical
analysis
. There were no
significant
differences in age or
Gleason score
between the groups. Forty percent of the patients had rising
prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels following
local therapy
and 60% were on
active surveillance
(prelocal therapy).  The study found a
median
rise in PSA of 14.7% after 6 months in the Pomi-T group compared with a 78.5% median rise in PSA in the placebo group.  The supplement was well tolerated with no significant increase in
adverse events
compared with placebo, although a trend was noted towards increased flatulence and loose
bowels
in the supplement group.
Important differences exist between the various pomegranate preparations and their standardization. While dried fruit powder is commonly found in the marketplace, an equal amount of pomegranate fruit extract has a much higher content of
polyphenols
that are considered the bioactive constituents and can be used for the chemical standardization of preparations.
Lycopene, Selenium, and Green Tea
In a randomized,
double-blinded
, placebo-controlled study  of a supplement containing
lycopene
(35 mg),
selenium
(55 µg), and green tea
catechins
(600 mg) that was given for 6 months and targeted men with
high-grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(HGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation, a higher incidence of prostate cancer was seen on rebiopsy in men who received the supplement. Although the expected (or historical) rate of progression to prostate cancer is less than 20% (even at 1 year), more than 25.5% of this population of men had a
diagnosis
of prostate cancer at 6 months, which  may be attributed to inadequate sampling and potentially missed cancers at
baseline
.  A high percentage of positive biopsies raises the concern for cancers missed on baseline
biopsy
, and further study is warranted.[
2
]
Lycopene and Other Components
One study randomly assigned 79 men before
prostatectomy
to a
nutritional
intervention
with tomato products containing 30 mg of lycopene daily; tomato products plus selenium,
omega-3 fatty acids
,
soy
isoflavones
, grape/pomegranate juice, and green/black tea; or a control
diet
for 3 weeks.[
3
] There were no differences in PSA values between the intervention and
control groups
. However, a post hoc exploratory analysis found lower PSA values in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who consumed the tomato products and in men with the highest increases in lycopene levels.
Zyflamend
Overview
Zyflamend is a dietary supplement that contains  supercritical
fluid
(CO
2
) and hydroalcoholic extracts of the following herbs, combined and suspended in olive oil: rosemary, turmeric,
ginger
, holy basil, green tea, hu zhang, Chinese goldthread, barberry, oregano, and Baikal skullcap.
The individual components of Zyflamend have
anti-inflammatory
and possible
anticarcinogenic
properties.
In various
preclinical studies
, Zyflamend has been shown to suppress the expression of certain
genes
involved in the
inflammatory
response
and in
cancer
progression
, such as cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1),
COX-2
, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and 12-LOX.
In other preclinical studies, Zyflamend demonstrated single-agent anticancer activity, and it improved cancer suppression when used with hormonal and
chemotherapy
agents.
Results of a
phase I
study of Zyflamend suggest that use of this supplement is not associated with serious
toxicity
or
adverse effects
.
General information and history
Zyflamend is a dietary supplement that contains CO
2
and hydroalcoholic extracts of the following herbs, combined and suspended in olive oil:
Rosemary (
Rosmarinus officinalis
L.).
Turmeric (
Curcuma longa
L.).
Ginger (
Zingiber officinale
Roscoe).
Holy basil (
Ocimum sanctum
L.).
Green tea (
Camellia sinensis
[L.] Kuntze).
Hu zhang (
Polygonum cuspidatum
Siebold & Zucc.).
Chinese goldthread (
Coptis chinensis
Franch.).
Barberry (
Berberis vulgaris
L.).
Oregano (
Origanum vulgare
L.).
Baikal skullcap (
Scutellaria baicalensis
Georgi).
The individual components of Zyflamend have anti-inflammatory and possible anticarcinogenic properties. For example, results of a 2011 study suggest that Zyflamend may inhibit the growth of
melanoma
cells
.[
4
]
The extracts in Zyflamend have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. COXs are
enzymes
that convert arachidonic
acid
into
prostaglandins
, which are thought to play a role in
tumor
development and
metastasis
. One COX enzyme, COX-2, is activated during
chronic
disease states, such as cancer.[
5
]
The  antitumorigenic mechanisms of action of Zyflamend are unknown, but according to one study, Zyflamend may suppress activation of
nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-kappa B) (a nuclear
transcription
factor involved in tumorigenesis) and NF-kappa B–regulated gene products.[
6
]
Several companies distribute Zyflamend as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of Zyflamend as a treatment for cancer or any other medical
condition
.
Preclinical/animal studies
In vitro
studies
In a  study reported in 2012, human
prostate cancer
cells were treated
in vitro
with Zyflamend. Cells treated with the supplement at concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 0.5
μL
/
mL
exhibited
dose-dependent
decreases in
androgen
receptor
and PSA expression levels compared with cells treated with the
dimethyl sulfoxide
vehicle control. Prostate cancer cells that were treated with a combination of Zyflamend (0.06 μL/mL) and
bicalutamide
(25
μM
), an androgen receptor inhibitor, showed reductions in cell growth, PSA expression, and
antiapoptotic
protein expression
compared with cells treated with Zyflamend or bicalutamide alone.[
7
]
Although the individual components of Zyflamend have been shown to influence COX activity, one study examined the effects of the drug on COX-1 and COX-2 expression  in prostate cancer cells. The results revealed that Zyflamend, at a
concentration
of 0.9 μL/mL, inhibited  expression of both COX-1 and COX-2. At a concentration of 0.45 μL/mL, the degree of COX-2 inhibition was observed, but the level of COX-1 inhibition was reduced by 50%. At a concentration of 0.1 μL/mL, Zyflamend effectively  inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells and increased the level of caspase-3, a proapoptotic enzyme. However, a separate experiment indicated that the prostate cancer cells used in the study (LNCaP cells, which  are androgen sensitive) did not express high levels of COX-2, suggesting that Zyflamend’s effects on prostate cancer cells may result from a COX-independent mechanism.[
5
]
The lipoxygenase isozymes 5-LOX and 12-LOX are also proteins associated with
inflammation
and tumor growth. In a 2007 study, the effects of  Zyflamend on 5-LOX and 12-LOX expression were investigated. The findings indicated that 0.25 μL/mL to 2 μL/mL of Zyflamend produced decreases in  5-LOX and 12-LOX expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells (cells that have high
metastatic
potential). The supplement also inhibited
cell proliferation
and induced
apoptosis
. In addition, Zyflamend treatment resulted in a decrease in Rb
phosphorylation
(Rb proteins control
cell-cycle
-related genes). These results indicate that Zyflamend may inhibit prostate cancer cell growth through a variety of mechanisms.[
8
]
In a 2011 study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with Zyflamend (200
µg
/mL). After 48 hours of treatment, a
statistically significant
reduction
in cell growth was observed for Zyflamend-treated cells, compared with control cells (
P
< .005). In another experiment, prostate cancer cells were treated with
insulin-like growth factor
-1 (IGF-1; 0–100
ng
/mL) alone or in combination with Zyflamend (200 µg/mL). Cells treated with IGF-1 alone exhibited statistically significant, dose-dependent increases in cell proliferation, whereas  cells treated with both IGF-1 and Zyflamend showed significant decreases in cell proliferation. Zyflamend was also shown to decrease cellular levels of the IGF-1 receptor and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.[
9
] A 2014 investigation by this team found that Zyflamend inhibits the expression of class I and class II
histone deacetylases
(HDAC) and upregulated their downstream target p21 suppressor gene.[
10
] The extracts of the individual components of the 10 botanicals in Zyflamend were also evaluated in an effort to identify which compounds contributed most to the inhibition of HDAC expression. Chinese goldthread and baikal skullcap appeared to be the most likely major contributors to the overall Zyflamend effect on HDAC expression.
Animal studies
Additional evidence that Zyflamend promotes apoptosis in cancer cells was obtained in laboratory and
animal studies
reported in 2012.[
11
]  Treatment of human
colorectal
carcinoma
cell lines
in vitro
with Zyflamend was shown to  significantly down regulate expression of antiapoptotic proteins, up regulate expression of Bax (a proapoptotic
protein
), and  increase expression of
death receptor 5
(DR5), a receptor important in apoptosis. Moreover, when nude mice with
pancreatic cancer
cell implants were randomly assigned to receive Zyflamend or a control treatment for 4 weeks, tumor cells from the Zyflamend-treated mice showed significant reductions in antiapoptotic proteins and significantly increased expression of DR5, compared with tumor cells from control-treated animals.
In a 2011 study, mice were also implanted with pancreatic cancer cells and then treated with
gemcitabine
and/or Zyflamend. The combination treatment resulted in a significantly greater decrease in tumor growth than did treatment with gemcitabine or Zyflamend alone. Other  findings from this study suggest that Zyflamend  exerted its effects by sensitizing the pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine through suppression of multiple targets linked to tumorigenesis.[
12
]
Human studies
Interventional studies
In one
case report
,  a patient with HGPIN received Zyflamend 3 times daily for 18 months. Zyflamend did not affect this patient's PSA level, but, after 18 months, repeat core
biopsies
of the prostate did not show PIN or cancer.[
13
]
In a 2009 phase I study designed to assess safety and toxicity, patients with HGPIN were assigned to take Zyflamend (780
mg
) 3 times daily for 18 months, plus combinations of dietary supplements (i.e.,
probiotic
supplement, multivitamin, green and white tea extract, Baikal skullcap, docosahexaenoic acid, holy basil, and turmeric). Zyflamend and the additional dietary supplements were well tolerated by the patients, and no serious adverse events occurred. After 18 months of treatment, 60% of the study subjects had only
benign
tissue
at biopsy; 26.7% had HGPIN in one core; and 13.3% had prostate cancer.[
14
]
Adverse effects
Zyflamend was well tolerated in the previously described  2009
clinical study
. Mild heartburn was reported in 9 of 23 subjects, but it resolved when the study supplements were taken with food. No serious toxicity or adverse events were reported in the study.[

Other Prostate Health Supplements
In This Section
Overview
African Cherry/
Pygeum africanum
Beta-Sitosterol
Overview
Many  widely available
dietary supplements
are marketed to support
prostate
health. African cherry (
Pygeum africanum
) and
beta-sitosterol
are two related supplements  that have been studied as potential
prostate cancer
treatments.  Note: A separate
PDQ
summary on
PC-SPES
is also available.
Several companies distribute medicinal
P. africanum
or beta-sitosterol as dietary supplements. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as a separate category from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. Unlike drugs, dietary supplements do not require premarket evaluation and approval by the FDA unless specific disease
prevention
or treatment claims are made. The quality and amount of ingredients in dietary supplements are also regulated by the FDA through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The FDA GMPs requires that every finished batch of dietary supplement meets each product specification for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may
adulterate
dietary supplements. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency every year, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot and there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present (or are present in the specified amounts). The FDA has not approved the use of
P.  africanum
or beta-sitosterol as a treatment for
cancer
or  any other medical
condition
.
African Cherry/
Pygeum africanum
P. africanum
is a tree from the Rosaceae family that grows in tropical zones. It is found in a number of African countries including Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda, and Nigeria. Bark from the
P. africanum
tree was used by African tribes to treat
urinary
symptoms
and
gastric
pain.[
1
] In the 18th century, European travelers learned from South African tribes that
P. africanum
was used to treat
bladder
discomfort and
old man’s disease
(enlarged prostate).
Since 1969, bark
extracts
from
P. africanum
have been available as
prescription
drugs in Europe and have been widely used to treat
benign prostatic hyperplasia
.[
2
,
3
] The bark contains a number of
compounds
including
saturated
and unsaturated
fatty acids
,
phytosterols
(e.g., beta-sitosterol), pentacyclic triterpenoids (e.g., oleanolic acid), alcohols, and
carbohydrates
. The extract is obtained by macerating and solubilizing the bark in an organic
solvent
, and evaporation of the solvent.[
1
]
Two components of
P. africanum
bark extracts, atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-
sulfonamide
, are
androgen
receptor
inhibitors, as indicated by both
in vitro
[
4
-
6
] and
animal
in vivo
[
7
] studies.  This activity is produced by each of these components at
concentrations
that are significantly lower than the clinically achieved concentration of the
antiandrogen
flutamide
.[
8
]
Beta-Sitosterol
Beta-sitosterol is a member of the phytosterol family of
phytochemicals
. It is  found ubiquitously in plants and has recently been classified as an invalid/improbable metabolic
panacea
(IMP) compound.[
9
]
Pygeum ®um
,
saw palmetto
(
Serenoa repens
), and some legumes can contain rather high concentrations. As a type of phytosterol (or
plant sterol
), beta-sitosterol has a similar structure to
cholesterol
. Phytosterols, including beta-sitosterol, reduce
absorption
of dietary cholesterol and their potential to  protect against
cardiovascular disease
is under investigation.
Mean
plasma
beta-sitosterol concentration in a small group of healthy male volunteers in Vienna, Austria, was 2.83
μg
/
mL
(approximately 7
μM
).[
10
]    Interestingly, however, a rare condition caused by
mutations
in the
adenosine triphosphate
-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
ABCG5
or
ABCG8
genes
results in an
inherited
sterol storage disease with markedly increased
serum
concentrations of plant sterols such as sitosterol and leads to premature atherosclerosis and large xanthomas.[
11
]
Research has also suggested that phytosterols may have
anticarcinogenic
properties, but the exact mechanisms are unknown.[
12
]  Phytosterols may exert
antitumor
effects by acting on immune and hormonal systems, or by directly targeting
cell cycles
and inducing
apoptosis
in
tumor
cells
.[
13
]
Beta-sitosterol at very high concentrations (i.e., 16 μM or 6.64
mg
/mL) has been shown to significantly inhibit growth of PC-3 prostate cancer cells and induce apoptosis.[
14
,
15
] Beta-sitosterol is very poorly
bioavailable
, with an estimated 0.41% of dietary beta-sitosterol absorbed, and circulating
blood
levels of about 3 μg/mL to 9 μg/mL in individuals consuming
diets
containing normal to high amounts of plant-based foods (approximately 1,000 times less than the concentration used in the study).[
10
,
16
]  Associated with these effects are decreasing levels of cell cycle regulators p21 and p27 in the cancer cells and an increased production  of
reactive oxygen species
.

Summary of the Evidence for Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements
To assist readers in evaluating the results of human studies of integrative, alternative, and complementary therapies for
cancer
, the strength of the evidence (i.e., the
levels of
evidence
) associated with each type of treatment is provided whenever
possible.  To qualify for a level of evidence
analysis
, a study must:
Be published in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal
.
Report on a
therapeutic
outcome
or outcomes, such as
tumor
response
, improvement in survival, or measured improvement in
quality of life
.
Describe
clinical
findings in sufficient detail that a meaningful evaluation can be made.
Separate levels of evidence scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and
scientific
strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e.,
endpoints
) measured. The resulting two scores are then combined to produce an overall score. For an explanation of the scores and additional information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see
Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies
.
