Study to Evaluate the Safety, Biodistribution, Radiation Dosimetry and Tumor Imaging Potential of [131I]-SGMIB Anti-HER2 VHH1 in Healthy Volunteers and Breast Cancer Patients
Primary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of \[131I\]-SGMIB Anti-HER2 VHH1 in healthy volunteers and patients with HER2+ breast cancer.

Secondary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the tumor uptake of \[131I\]-SGMIB Anti-HER2 VHH1 in patients with HER2+ breast cancer.
Healthy Volunteers|Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: [131I]-SGMIB Anti-HER2 VHH1
Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1 day
The Tumor Targeting Potential Will be Visually Scored on the Planar Total Body Scan, Cancer lesions above 3 cm will be visually interpreted by an experienced nuclear medicine physician. Lesions will be scored positive if CAM-H2 uptake in the lesion is higher than surrounding background., 1 day
