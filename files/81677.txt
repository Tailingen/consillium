Study of Gemcitabine and Abraxane for Pancreas Cancer
A Phase II trial of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in the second line setting
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine and Abraxane
4 month progression free survival, The proportion of patients at 4 months from study entry with progression or death, 2.5 years
Disease control rate, Confirmed classification of stable disease, partial response or complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 2.5 years|Progression Free Survival, The time in days from study entry until progression or death, 2.5 years|Overall Survival, The time in days from study entry until death, 3 years
This is an open label Phase II study to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) as second line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in the first line setting. All patients will receive both drugs on Days 1, 8, 15 every 28 days. The hypothesis is that this combination will have a 4-month progression free survival of 70% or higher.
