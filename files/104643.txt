This study includes a safety run in and a cohort expansion. The safety run in will include patients with any of the indications under study including:

Recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma Recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma Advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer

Cohort expansion will include patients with advanced malignancies who have received at least two prior systemic therapies in the same indications.
