Study of IBI3009 in Participants with Unresectable, Metastatic or Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IBI3009 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of IBI3009.
