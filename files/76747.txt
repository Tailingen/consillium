A Phase I Study of PLX038 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, two-arm, dose escalation study of PLX038 intravenous infusion administered to patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors. This study will explore two different dosing schedules: Arm 1, once every 3 week (q3w), and Arm 2, once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks of a 4-week cycle.

Number of patients with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of PLX038, Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03). Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE., Continuous starting on day of first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose
PLX038 is an investigational drug product that has demonstrated reasonable antitumor activity in preclinical colorectal, gastric and lung tumor models in animals. This is a first in human trial to determine the maximum, safest dose of PLX038 IV that can be administered to patients either once every 3 weeks or once every 2 weeks.
