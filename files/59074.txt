Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy With or Without Para-Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Breast Cancer
Sentinel lymph node biopsy（SLNB） is an established way of predicting axillary nodal metastasis in early breast cancer. We aim to determinethe，in a prospective randomized, controlled trial, effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node(SLN) dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node dissection on outcomes after breast surgery.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Patients receive SLNB
Disease free survival, Time from randomization to recurrence, metastasis, appearance of a second primary tumor, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 10 years., Up to 10 years
Overall survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 10 years., Up to 10 years
Aim: Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients who are randomized to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node dissection group vs. those receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node dissection

Outline:

Patients are randomized assigned to the following one of two groups and are followed annually.

Arm I: Patients receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node dissection Arm II: Patients receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node dissection
