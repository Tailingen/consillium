Nutritional Supplementation in Head and Neck Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine whether multimodal nutrition therapy (primary nutrition intervention + adjuvant nutrition therapy) will support patients to optimize their total caloric intake during cancer treatment by measuring the difference in mean cumulative energy intake between the intervention and control group over the duration of cancer treatment.

Change in mean cumulative energy intake, Energy intake is calculated from a one-day diet record in which the patient lists the identity and quantity of all foods and beverages consumed in the designated 24 hour time period at the end of each week (Baseline - Week 14)., Up to 14 weeks
Change in mean cumulative protein take, Energy intake is calculated from a one-day diet record in which the patient lists the identity and quantity of all foods and beverages consumed in the designated 24 hour time period at the end of each week (Baseline - Week 14), Up to 14 Weeks|Change in body weight (kg), Change in weight (kg) from the previous week., Baseline-Week 14|Change in Nutritional blood biomarkers, A sample of blood will be collected for albumin, absolute neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, standard complete blood count-differential White Blood cell count and to measure serum CRP and albumin, Baseline measures will be compared to levels at weeks 7 and 14|Head and Neck Symptom Checklist, A survey tool for HNC patient self-assessment of the presence and degree of interference with eating, over the past 3 days, of 17 symptoms known to impact dietary intake. Scores range from 34 to 170 pts, where higher scores reflect a greater presence and interference with eating. Completed at weeks 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, Up to 14 weeks|Taste and smell survey, A survey tool for patient self-assessment of the presence, characterization and severity of taste and smell alterations. This tool yields a 'chemosensory complaint score' of up to 16 (greatest severity of taste and smell alterations). Completed at weeks 0, 4, 7, 11, 14., Up to 14 weeks|Medication use for pain, Use of pain medication will be captured weekly by a one- day pain medication log., Up to 14 weeks|Percent oral intake from oral nutritional supplements, The volume (mL) of study products consumed will be determined from the weekly one-day diet record., Up to 14 weeks|Product Sensory Assessment questionnaire, A product evaluation form for the Medical Nutrition products will be used to evaluate product overall sensory assessment, including acceptance and perception of characteristic product attributes that influence overall sensory acceptance. Medical Nutrition sensory acceptance will be evaluated by "overall liking" on the 9-point hedonic scale (1= dislike extremely; 9 = like extremely). Completed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14., Up to 14 weeks|Functional Assessment of Anorexia-Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) 5 Question Anorexia/Cachexia subscale (AC/S), The FAACT is a validated Quality of Life Scale to capture patient experience of cancer related cachexia - anorexia. Completed at weeks 0, 4, 7,11, 14, Up to 14 weeks|Cumulative energy intake (kcal/kg BW), Energy intake is calculated from a one-day diet record in which the patient lists the identity and quantity of all foods and beverages consumed in the designated 24 hour time period at the end of each week (Baseline - Week 14), Up to 14 weeks|Cumulative protein take (g pro/kg BW), Protein intake is calculated from a one-day diet record in which the patient lists the identity and quantity of all foods and beverages consumed in the designated 24 hour time period at the end of each week (Baseline - Week 14), Up to 14 weeks|Change in computed-tomography (CT) defined skeletal muscle and fat mass), Imaging for body composition (muscle, fat), Within 30 days prior to start of treatment, Week 14|Tertiary hospital admission, Review of patient medical records for instances of hospitalization with date(s) of admission falling between baseline and week 14 of study., Up to 14 weeks
This will be an randomized, open label, parallel assignment study during cancer treatment (Baseline - Week 7 for Primary endpoint) comparing multimodal oral nutrition therapy versus standard care. Starting at Week 8, all patients receive the intervention arm until study ends at Week 14. Patients in the intervention arm continue the intervention, patients on the standard care arm cross over to the intervention (deferred nutrition intervention).

The primary objective is to assess a multimodal nutrition therapy with two Medical Foods (primary nutrition intervention+ adjuvant nutrition therapy) with features adapted for patients with cancers of the head and neck receiving chemo-radiotherapy treatment, to maintain oral dietary intake during treatment.
