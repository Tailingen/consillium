Neoadjuvant Afatinib Combination With Chemotherapy for Stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutation
The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were perioperative chemotherapy. The adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage lung cancer improved about 5% 5-year survival. As for advanced NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combination with chemotherapy had improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with EGFR-TKI alone. We propose this trial of Neoadjuvant Afatinib Combination With Chemotherapy for Stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC With EGFR Activating Mutation, which would maximize benefit early in a patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions before and after treatment, so as to accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response of different therapy.

The prognosis of stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was worse, with 5-year survival rate between 26%-60%. The recommended adjuvant therapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC were adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As for advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation, EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy had improved survival compared with EGFR-TKI alone. The Chinese Thoracic Oncology Group-1103 (CTONG-1103) trial showed that neoadjuvant erlotinib has better PFS than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The investigators propose that neoadjuvant EGFR-TKI combination with chemotherapy for stage Ⅱa-Ⅲb NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation might have better pathological response and disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy alone, and maximize benefit early in a patient's treatment course. At the same time, dynamic 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) was used to evaluate the standardized uptake value (SUV) and uptake rate constant (Ki) changes of lesions before and after treatment, so as to accurately and quantitatively monitor the tumor response of different therapy.
