Intravenous Vesicular Stomatitis Virus in Patients With Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) carrying the human (h) sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and Interferon (IFN) beta (β) genes (VSV-hIFNβ-NIS) in combination with ipilimumab and cemiplimab in patients with T-cell lymphoma. A virus, called VSV-hIFNβ-NIS, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Immunotherapy with ipilmumab and cemiplimab may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher, Assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Up to 2 years
Clinical response, Response to treatment will be recorded as stringent Complete Response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD)., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study enrollment to disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from study enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNβ-NIS in combination with ipilimumab and cemiplimab in patients with T-cell lymphoma \[Group E\].

Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, position emission tomography (PET) scan throughout the study. Patients may undergo tumor biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and blood sample collection throughout the study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year or until progressive disease, then every 6 months for 1 year.
