A Study of Nilotinib in Growing Vestibular Schwannomas
Acoustic Neuromas (otherwise known as Vestibular Schwannoma -VS) are benign tumors which grow on the hearing nerve and can cause progressive hearing loss and compression of vital brain structures and even death if it continues. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS. Secondary objectives of this study is to evaluate the toxicity profile, quality of life and symptom management of Nilotinib in the treatment of patients with progressing VS.
Growing Vestibular Schwannomas
DRUG: Nilotinib
volume change of Vestibular Schwannoma, Primary Outcomes of interest will be volumetric tumor response and lack of tumor progression. A response to treatment will be defined as a 20% or greater, change in volume, as defined by Plotkin et al., 3 years - 1 year drug treatment, 2 year follow-up
UHN laboratory has demonstrated that targets of Imatinib (c-Kit and PDGFR-α and PDGFR-ß) are overexpressed and activated in both sporadic and NF2 VS.It has also been shown pre-clinically that Imatinib induced a reduction in proliferation and cell viability, with increased apoptosis, in HEI-193 human NF2-null VS cells.Nilotinib is a newer generation RTK inhibitor, with a similar target profile as Imatinib. It was designed by modifying the Imatinib molecule62, and has 30-fold increased potency compared to IImatinib43. In clinical studies of patients with CML or GIST resistant to Imatinib, Nilotinib has demonstrated efficacy with minimal toxicity. Nilotinib (Tasigna®, code number AMN107) was first approved in 2007 for use in Philadelphia chromosome positive CML in the chronic or accelerated phase in patients resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Thus making Nilotinib an ideal drug to study in understanding its benefit in VS patients.
