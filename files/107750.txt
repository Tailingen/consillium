Clinical Trial of ssCART-19 Cell Injection in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Including Central Nervous System Infiltration)
This study is a Phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ssCART-19 Cell Injection in the treatment of patients with CD19 positive Relapsed or Refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including central nervous system infiltration.
Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: ssCART-19|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Determine the efficacy of ssCART-19 cells in patients with CD19-positive relapsed or refractory acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)., Overall Remission Rate (ORR), which includes Complete Remission (CR) and complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) and Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi) as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC)., At 3 months after infusion
Observe the anti-tumor response of ssCART-19 cells to refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia., Overall remission rate (ORR) with negative micro residual disease (MRD) within 3 months after ssCART-19 infusion., 3 months|Best overall response (BOR)assessment during the 3 months after ssCART-19 infusion., The proportion of patients who have achieved the best effect (CR or CRi) after the experimental treatment., 3 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR means the duration from reaching the response CR or CRi to the first defined relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., 24 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS), RFS means the duration from reaching the response CR or CRi to the first defined relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., 24 months|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS means duration from the ssCART-19 Cell Injection infusion to death for any reason after remission, relapse, treatment failure, no response, or termination (because of death, adverse event, lack of efficacy, progression, new anti-tumor treatments., 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the ssCART-19 Cell Injection infusion to the date of death due to any cause., 24 months|Incidence of adverse events following ssCART-19 infusion, Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0) Dose-limiting toxicity after ssCART-19 infusion., 24 months|Pharmacodynamic of ssCART-19 cells, Peak value of eripheral blood (Cmax), 28 days|Pharmacodynamic of ssCART-19 cells, Area under the eripheral blood concentration versus time curve (AUC), 28 days|Pharmacodynamic of ssCART-19 cells, Time of peak value, 28 days
Anti-drug antibody, Detect titer of anti-drug antibody (ADA), 24 months
This study is a Phase II, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ssCART-19 Cell Injection in the treatment of patients with CD19 positive Relapsed or Refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including central nervous system infiltration. The study consists of screening period (8 weeks), treatment period (4 weeks), and follow-up period. All subjects who have received ssCART-19 infusion will be followed for safety and efficacy up to 2 years.
