TTNT is defined as the time from the first administration of any study drug to the institution of next anti-neoplastic therapy (for any reason including disease progression, treatment toxicity and participant preference) or death of any cause, whatever comes first., Approximately 4.5 years after first participant enrolled; Approximately 6.5 years after first participant enrolled|Event-free Survival (EFS) by IRC Evaluation, EFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of the first administration of any study drug to the date of tumour progression, first initiation of a new non-study anti-neoplastic therapy or death from any cause whichever comes first., Approximately 4.5 years after first participant enrolled; Approximately 6.5 years after first participant enrolled|Serum Drug Levels of MOR00208, The pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of MOR00208 was investigated by quantifying serum drug levels at baseline and after repeated IV administrations for up to 24 treatment cycles using sparse sampling.

MOR00208 PK sample was taken pre-dose and 1 hour Â± 10 min after the end of MOR00208 infusion for Cycle 1 to Cycle 23. MOR00208 PK sample (pre-dose only) were taken in odd numbered additional treatment cycles only (e.g., treatment Cycles 13, 15,17, 19, 21, 23)., Cycle 1 Days 1, 4, 15 predose and 1 hr post-dose; Cycle 2 Days 1, 15 predose and 1 hr post-dose; Cycle 3 Days 1, 15 predose and 1 hr post-dose; Cycles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 Day 1 predose; End of Treatment|Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-MOR00208 Antibodies, The Anti-MOR00208 Antibodies were investigated by quantifying serum drug levels at baseline and after repeated intravenous (IV) administrations planned for up to 24 treatment cycles using sparse sampling. Anti-MOR00208 antibody sample (pre-dose only) were taken in odd numbered additional treatment cycles only (e.g., treatment Cycles 13, 15,17, 19, 21,23)., Baseline, Up to a maximum of 23 cycles.|Number of Participants That Experienced Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs are defined as any adverse event reported in the following time interval (including the lower and upper limits): date of first administration of study treatment; date of last administration of study treatment + 30 days, or if they are considered to be related to the study drug., Approximately 6.5 years after first participant enrolled|Severity of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Number of participants with Severity of TEAEs during MOR00208 and LEN combination therapy., Approximately 6.5 years after first participant enrolled
The aim of this single-arm, multicentre, open-label Phase II study is to evaluate the Lenalidomide (LEN) combined with Tafasitamab (MOR00208) in adult participants with DLBCL who had relapsed after or were refractory to at least one, but no more than three previous systemic regimens administered for the treatment of their DLBCL and who were not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent Autologous stem cell transplants and were thus considered to have exhausted their therapeutic options. One prior therapy line had to include an anti-CD20 targeted therapy (e.g., rituximab \[RTX\]).

MOR00208 and LEN were administered for up to 12 cycles (28 days each), followed by MOR00208 monotherapy until progression, in participants with at least stable disease or a better response.
