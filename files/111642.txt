Study of Romiplostim for Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia in Adult Subjects with Gastrointestinal, Pancreatic, or Colorectal Cancer
Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia
BIOLOGICAL: Romiplostim|OTHER: Placebo
Incidence of a Thrombocytopenia-induced chemotherapy dose modification during the second or third on study chemotherapy cycles., No thrombocytopenia-induced modification of any myelosuppressive treatment agent in the second and third cycles of the planned on-study chemotherapy regimen. Thrombocytopenia-induced modifications include chemotherapy dose reduction, delay, omission, or chemotherapy treatment discontinuation due to platelet counts below 100 x 10 9/L, 48 days
Depth of Platelet Count, the depth of the platelet count nadir from the start of the first on-study chemotherapy cycle through the end of the treatment period, 48 days|First platelet response, The time to first platelet response, defined by platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L in the absence of platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days, 7 Days|Bleeding Events, the duration-adjusted event rate of

≥ grade 2 bleeding events, as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grading scale, 48 days|Overall Survival, 1-year overall survival, 1-year|Subject incidence of Platelet Transfusion, platelet transfusion(s) during the treatment period, 48 days|Platelet Count, achieving a platelet count equal to or greater than 100 x 10 9/L at any time after study day 1 to week 4 (ie, 7 days after the planned third dose of investigational product) and in the absence of platelet transfusions during the preceding 7 days, 7 days|AEs/SAEs overall safety of romiplostim, Through end of study, up to 36 months, 36 months
RECITE: A phase 3 Randomized Placebo-controlled Double-blind Study of Romiplostim for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia in Patients Receiving Oxaliplatin-based Chemotherapy for Treatment of Gastrointestinal, Pancreatic, or Colorectal Cancer
