Growth Factor Levels in the Blood of Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Epithelial Cancer
RATIONALE: Measuring levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the blood of patients with epithelial cancers (head and neck, lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate) may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment with radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: This research study is measuring levels of TGF-beta in patients with epithelial cancers who are undergoing radiation therapy.
Breast Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Lung Cancer|Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: venipuncture|RADIATION: radiation therapy
TGF-beta levels, TGF-beta is a protein that can be detected in the blood., day 1 prior to treatment, 24-72 hours after 1st treatment, weekly at treatment (optional) and at completion of treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine whether there is a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta following radiotherapy in patients with epithelial cancers.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to treatment, 24-72 hours after the first fraction of radiotherapy, and at the end of radiotherapy. Patients will also be asked for a weekly blood sample, but this is optional. Samples are analyzed to compare pre- and post-treatment TGF-beta levels.
