TACE Combined With "Target Immune" Therapy for First-line Treatment in the Treatment of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This study is a prospective, multicenter, open, real-world clinical study. All eligible patients were assigned to experimental group (TACE combined with multi-target drugs and PD-1 inhibitors), and control group (conventional intravenous chemotherapy), to explore the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with multi-target drugs and PD-1 inhibitors as first-line treatment compared with traditional systemic intravenous chemotherapy in the treatment of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization|DRUG: Multi-target Drug Therapy|DRUG: Immunocheckpoint Inhibitor Therapy|PROCEDURE: Systemic Intravenous Chemotherapy
Progression-free Survival, The most common primary endpoint in cancer trials. The 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years progression-free survival, The time from enrollment to tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, measured in "months", assessed up to 2 years.
Overall Survival, The best efficacy endpoint in cancer clinical trials., Time from randomization to death from any cause, in "months", assessed up to 2 years. For patients who are still alive at the time of data analysis, OS is calculated based on the date when the patient is last known to be alive.|Time To Tumor Untreatable Progression, End point of antitumor drug trial., The time interval between receiving TACE or intravenous chemotherapy and the patient's inability to receive further intra-arterial treatment, assessed up to 12 months.|Objective Response Rate, Evaluation index of clinical efficacy of anticancer drugs., Proportion of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) according to mRECIST criteria, assessed up to 12 months.|Disease Control Rate, Evaluation index of clinical efficacy of anticancer drugs., Proportion of patients with complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to mRECIST criteria, assessed up to 12 months.|Duration of Overall Response, Evaluation index of clinical efficacy of anticancer drugs., The time from the first assessment of the tumor as complete remission or partial remission to the first assessment as disease progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months.|The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, According to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0., The time from randomization to every follow-up time, assessed up to 2 years.
This study is a prospective, multi-center, open, and double-arm clinical study in the real world, which belongs to a practical clinical trial. The type of comparison is the non-inferiority test. This study enrolls 98 patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma at multiple centers across the country. In the experimental group, 49 patients will receive TACE combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and multi-target drugs; In the control group, 49 patients will receive traditional systemic intravenous chemotherapy with GEMOX regimen.
