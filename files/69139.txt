TKI Followed by Thoracic Radiotherapy for Stage IV EGFR Mutant NSCLC
In this phase II trial with single arm, we aim to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity profile of local radiotherapy on all disease sites for EGFR-mutant oligo-metastatic NSCLC (no more than 3 metastatic lesions) who did not experience disease progression after at least 3 months of TKI therapy.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been widely accepted as the first-line therapy for stage IV NSCLC with active mutation of EGFR. Olio-metastasis is a disease status between localized and extended status of disease, namely with the limited number of lesions, which is generally defined as â‰¤ 5. A couple of phase II studies have shown that consolidation local management was able to prolong the local-regional tumor control and might further improve overall survival (OS) for oligo-metastatic NSCLC who have gained disease control from systemic therapy. However, there is lack of data regarding whether local radiotherapy (RT) could improve progression free survival (PFS) and OS for NSCLC with active EGFR mutation who have benefited from TKI. In this phase II trial with single arm, we aim to investigate the clinical efficacy and toxicity profile of local radiotherapy on all disease sites for EGFR-mutant oligo-metastatic NSCLC (no more than 3 metastatic lesions) who did not experience disease progression after at least 3 months of TKI therapy.
