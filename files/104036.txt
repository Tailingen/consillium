Evaluation of Amino Acid Metabolism Changes in Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer is associated with undernutrition in more than half of all cases. The current management of undernutrition-cachexia in cancer is not specific. It is well recognized that the nutritional support currently offered to cancer patients is not effective in combating cachexia, which progresses inexorably, leading to the patient's death. It is therefore necessary to offer specific and adapted care, in particular by optimizing the quality of nitrogen intake. To achieve this, the investigators first need to define the specific amino acid requirements of cancer patients.
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: dynamic test for amino acid metabolism
metabolism of each amino acid, in women with non-immediately resectable ovarian cancer (with or without peritoneal metastases) of high-grade serous type., degree of consumption of each amino acid estimated by the difference in plasma concentration in Âµmol/L measured after 90 minutes (H 1.5) and 270 minutes (H 4.5) of perfusion., 270 minutes
