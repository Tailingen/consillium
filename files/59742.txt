STOP HCC: Mailed HCV Treatment Outreach Program for HCC Prevention
Aim 1: The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing two strategies to promote HCV screening, follow-up testing, and treatment among baby-boomers (i.e. persons born between 1945-1965): inreach with electronic medical record alerts and provider education vs. combination of inreach and provider education plus mailed outreach and patient navigation.

Aim 2: The investigators will evaluate patient navigation strategies to promote follow-up testing and treatment evaluation among non-baby boomer Parkland patients (i.e. born before 1945 or after 1965) who are either: a) HCV antibody positive but have not completed follow-up viral load testing or b) HCV viral load positive and who have not completed in-clinic treatment evaluation.
Hepatitis C|HepatoCellular Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Mailed outreach
Hepatitis C Screening, Proportion with HCV Ab within 3 months of randomization, 3 months
Hepatitis C Screening, Proportion with HCV Ab within 12 months of randomization, 12 months|Hepatitis C Confirmation, Proportion with HCV Viral Load within 3 months of positive antibody result, 3 months|Hepatitis C Linkage to care, Proportion with clinic visit within 6 months of positive HCV Viral Load, 6 months|Cost: Cost-per patient screened, The primary measure of costs will be the cost per Ab completion., 3 months|Cost: Cost per-HCV diagnosis, The primary measure of costs will be the cost per-patient diagnosed with HCV., 12 months
