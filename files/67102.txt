Study of CD4-Targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells (CD4- CAR-T) in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter, study of LB1901 administered to adult subjects with histologically confirmed CD4+ relapsed or refractory Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (PTCL not otherwise specified \[PTCL-NOS\] and angioimmunoblastic \[AITL\]), or relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (Sézary syndrome \[SS\] and mycosis fungoides \[MF\]).

BIOLOGICAL: LB1901
To characterize the safety and tolerability of LB1901 and determine the optimal dose or recommended dose for expansion (RDE)., Multiple doses will be tested to establish a recommended dose., Up to 2 years|To further characterize the safety and tolerability of LB1901 with the RDE identified in the dose escalation and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)., Treatment of additional patients at the recommended dose as identified in the initial dose escalation part of the study., Up to 2 years
