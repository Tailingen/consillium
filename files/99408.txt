Retrospective Study of Long-Term Survival of "Immuncell-LC" in Patients Undergoing Curative Resection for HCC in Korea
To observation that long term follow-up study of 'Immuncell-LC groups' and 'Non-treatment groups' in patient undergo curative resection (PEIT, RFA or Operation) for hepatocellular carcinoma in Korea
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Immuncell-LC|BIOLOGICAL: No Interventions
Recurrence-free Survival(RFS), RFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first recurrence or to death from any cause.

Radiological test should be operated by dynamic CT, dynamic MRI or by angiography., up to 9 years
Overall Survival(OS), Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization until death from any cause. And OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)., up to 9 years|Cancer-specific Survivals(CSS), Cancer-specific survival was measured from the date of randomization until death resulting from HCC., up to 9 years
The purpose of this study is to retrospectively compare the long-term survival of patients who participated in the "Randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Immunocel-LC treatment and no treatment in Korean patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received potentially curative treatment \[surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI)\] (NCT00699816). HCC was diagnosed by pathological evaluation or radiological imaging studies. Eligibility criteria also included hepatic function of Child-Pugh class A and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1. Exclusion criteria included autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency, previous or current malignant tumor other than HCC, and severe allergic disorders. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women planning to become pregnant were also excluded. All eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant immunotherapy using a CIK cell agent (the immunotherapy group) or no adjuvant treatment (control group) in a 1:1 ratio.
