Barrett's Esophagus|Early Esophageal Adenocarcinoma

Response to treatment, presence of persistent or recurrence of barrett's esophagus and/or dysplasia, at time of surveillance intervals
To assess the effect of ablation therapy on Barrett's esophagus. Proposal Ablation therapy is an FDA approved treatment to decrease cancer risk in Barrett's esophagus mucosa. This is being performed in our Barrett's Esophagus Unit on a regular basis. However, the longterm outcomes of this therapy is not established and there are patients who have been treated who later re-develop Barrett's mucosa. This study will allow us store tissue samples that can later be used to assess the effect of ablative therapy on Barrett's esophagus.
