A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Intratumoral VCN-01 Injections With Gemcitabine and Abraxane® in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of three intratumoral injections of VCN-01 combined with Abraxane®/gemcitabine, and to determine the recommended phase II dose of VCN-01 combined with Abraxane®/gemcitabine.

Investigational treatment is a dose-escalation regimen consisting of three VCN-01 intratumoral injections (once every 28 days at the same dose) in combination with intravenous Abraxane® and gemcitabine.
