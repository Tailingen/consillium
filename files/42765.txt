A Phase 2 Study of Avutometinib (VS-6766) Plus Defactinib
The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness and safety of the study drugs (VS-6766 and defactinib), and see what effects (good and bad) these drugs have on the patients with endometrioid cancer, mucinous ovarian cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, or solid gynecological cancer.
Endometrioid Cancer|Mucinous Ovarian Cancer|High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer|Cervical Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: Avutometinib (VS-6766) + defactinib
Proportion of Patients with objective response rate, To evaluate the efficacy of Avutometinib (VS-6766) + defactinib in endometrioid, MOC, HGSOC and solid gynecological cancer patients with RAS/BRAF/NF1 mutations on confirmed overall response rate (ORR; partial response \[PR\] + complete response \[CR\] defined according to RECIST 1.1) as assessed by the investigator., 2 years
Incidence of Adverse Events, To characterize the safety and toxicity profile of Avutometinib (VS-6766) + defactinib combination measured by the incidence of Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), physical examinations, clinical laboratory values and tolerability (dose interruptions/reductions), 2 years|Duration of Response, Calculated for those subjects with a CR or PR as elapsed time from the first response to PD or death, as assessed by the investigator., 2 years|Progression Free Survival, elapsed time of first treatment to PD or death from any cause., 2 years|Disease Control Rate, CR+PR+ stable disease (SD) â‰¥8 weeks), 2 years|Overall Survival, elapsed time from the first treatment to death., 2 years
This is a single-stage exploratory, Phase 2, multicenter, parallel cohort, open label study designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of VS-6766 + defactinib.

Enrolled study patients will receive the study drugs (VS-6766 and defactinib) to take orally based on the study procedures. Patients will follow the study procedures and attend all the study visits where various procedures including physical examinations, vitals, assessing the size of the patient's tumor, and examination of urine and blood may take place. Additional visits may be done to assess any other side effects a patient's experiences.
