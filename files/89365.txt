A Phase 1 Trial of CIML NK Cell Infusion for Myeloid Disease Relapse After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
This research study is studying cytokine induced memory-like natural killer (CIML NK) cells combined with IL-2 in adult patients (18 years of age or older) with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) who relapse after haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) or HLA matched stem cells. This study will also study CIML NK cell infusion combined with IL-2 in pediatric patients (12 years of age or older) with AML, MDS, JMML who relapse after stem cell transplantation using HLA-matched related donor or related donor haploidentical stem cells.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm|Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CIML NK|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Safety, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CIML NK cell infusion followed by low-dose IL-2, 6 Weeks
ORR (Objective Response Rate), To determine complete remission (CR/CRi) rate after CIML NK cell infusion plus IL-2, 28 days|LFS and OS, To determine the rate of leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) at day 100 and at 1 year post cell CIML NK cell infusion plus IL-2, 100 Days, 1 Year|Acute GVHD (Incidence, Severity), To determine the incidence and severity of acute GVHD rates after CIML NK cell infusion plus IL-2, 100 Days, 6 Months|Chronic GVHD (Incidence, Severity), To determine the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD rates after CIML NK cell infusion plus IL-2, 1 Year
This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved CIML NK Cell Infusion as a treatment for relapsed disease.
