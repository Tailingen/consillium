Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Laser Angiography; Postoperative Outcomes for Autologous Tissue Flaps
The purpose of this study is to identify and compare complication rates between autologous breast reconstruction techniques with and without the inclusion on intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Indocyanine green angiography
Major complications, Major complications included necrosis of most of the flap (2/3), total flap loss and surgical evacuated hematoma., Measured at 6 months followup.
Minor complications, A minor complication included clinical sign of infection, prolonged wound healing (defined as prolonged healing time requiring dressing changes assisted by health personnel), fat necrosis and skin necrosis., Measured from day 0 with 6 months followup|Timing of reconstruction, Comparison of the timing of the reconstruction with the complication rate, comparing immediate reconstructions with delayed reconstructions., Measured from day 0 with 6 months followup
ICG-angiography is a real-time visualization of tissue perfusion using intravenous fluorescence. It allows the surgeon a tool for intraoperatively assessment of tissue perfusion of the autologous flap, providing a basis for trimming of hypo perfused areas. The study evaluates the effect of inclusion of this technique by examine postoperative outcomes retrospectively. This is done by differentiation between major and minor complications to evaluate the greatest gains of the intervention.
