Phase II Trial Assessing Efficacy and Toxicity of Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in the 1st, 2nd or subsequent line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and also in the neo-adjuvant and adjuvant setting of resectable metastases.

Primary Endpoint: Objective response rates

Secondary Endpoints: Treatment related toxicity Progression free survival (If not resected) Disease free Survival (From metastastectomy, if resected) Overall Survival 60 Day all cause mortality Number undergoing liver resections/curative resection (Ro) rate
