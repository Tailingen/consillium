Study to Assess the Safety of Alpelisib Plus Fulvestrant, in Men and Post-menopausal Women With HR-positive, HER2-negative, Advanced Breast Cancer (aBC) With PIK3CA Mutation, Whose Disease Progressed on or After Endocrine Treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of alpelisib plus fulvestrant in men and post-menopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer (aBC) with a PIK3CA mutation, whose disease has progressed on or after endocrine-based treatment
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Percentage of participants with at least one on-treatment adverse events (AEs), Percentage of participants with at least one on-treatment AEs. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (an unfavourable/unintended sign - including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease) in a participant.

On-treatment period is defined as up to 30 days after last dose of study drug, From start of treatment up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, assessed up to approximately 7 months
Percentage of participants with Serious AEs (SAEs), Percentage of participants with SAEs. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant, or is an abnormal pregnancy outcome, From start of treatment up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, assessed up to approximately 7 months|Percentage of participants with Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), Percentage of participants with ADRs. An ADR is defined as AEs that are, in the investigator's opinion, of causal relationship to the study treatment, From start of treatment up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, assessed up to approximately 7 months
This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative interventional study to assess the safety of alpelisib plus fulvestrant in men and post-menopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, aBC with a PIK3CA mutation, whose disease has progressed on or after endocrine-based treatment.

Participants will be treated with alpelisib 300 mg orally once daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 in combination with fulvestrant (intramuscular injection) 500 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15, and Day 1 of every cycle thereafter in a 28 day cycle. Patients may be discontinued from treatment earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or at the discretion of the investigator or the patient.
