This is a single-arm, open label, "3+3" dose escalation, phase I study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of C-CAR039 in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. 10 patients are planned to be enrolled.

Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of C-CAR039. Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to C-CAR039 infusion. All subjects who have received C-CAR039 infusion will be followed for up to 24 months.
