ECLECTIC: EstroTEP and Circulating Biomarkers for ER-positive HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
Eclectic is a strategy trial; once the class of treatment (endocrine therapy or chemotherapy) has been allocated according to 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-oestradiol (18F-FES) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) results and circulating tumor biomarkers, clinicians will decide which treatment to use.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death, among randomized patients., 54 months
Progression-Free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression (per PERCIST 1.0) or death, among randomized patients with available Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) evaluation., 54 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, among randomized patients (arms B and C), 54 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on local investigator assessment, among randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline,, 54 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR at 24 weeks is defined as the proportion of randomized patients who have achieved either a confirmed complete or partial response, or stable disease for at least 24 weeks after treatment start based on local investigator assessment., 24 weeks|Efficacy criteria: PFS at 24 weeks, PFS at 24 weeks will be evaluated in patients allocated to arm A., 24 weeks|Efficacy criteria: OS at 24 weeks, OS at 24 weeks will be evaluated in patients allocated to arm A., 24 weeks|Efficacy criteria: ORR at 24 weeks, ORR at 24 weeks will be evaluated in patients allocated to arm A., 24 weeks|Efficacy criteria: CBR at 24 weeks, CBR at 24 weeks will be evaluated in patients allocated to arm A., 24 weeks|Safety and toxicity and their relationship to study treatment, Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (AEs) graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, 54 months|EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) after 2 months of treatment, Questionnaire to measure physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of multi-item scales and single items range from 0 to 100. A higher score represents better function and a higher quality of life., 2 months
All patients deemed eligible for a second line endocrine therapy will undergo a 18F-FES PET/CT scan and circulating tumor biomarkers assessment (circulating tumor cells (CTC) and, if not available, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)). All 18F-FES PET/CT scan will be anonymized and reviewed centrally, and compared to the 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT results before treatment initiation; circulating biomarkers status will be assessed centrally and will remain blinded to investigator and patients.

Endocrine therapy in Arm A and C may consist in single agent endocrine therapy or in combination with targeted therapy. Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LH-RH) agonist will be used in combination with endocrine therapy whenever appropriate and per label. Chemotherapy in Arm B may consist in single agent chemotherapy, poly-chemotherapy, or antibody-drug conjugates. Patients who are eligible (per drug label) may receive Poly-adenosine-5'-diphosphate-ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor if allocated to Arm B.
