Study of Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy Combined With Recombinant Human Endostatin for Local Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
It is a trials to evaluate the overall survival (OS) of radiotherapy / EP combined with recombinant human endostatin in treatment of locally advanced (Ⅲ A / unresectable Ⅲ B) non-small cell lung cancer.
