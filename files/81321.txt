Comprehensive Analysis of Predictors of the Treatment With Pembrolizumab and Olaparib in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic HER2 Negative Breast Cancer and a Deleterious Germline Mutation or a Homologous Recombination Deficiency (COMPRENDO
This study will examine the combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib in three populations.

* Cohort 1: aBC patients with a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2,
* cohort 2: aBC patients with a germline mutation in one of the moderate penetrance homologous repair genes (ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, SLX4, XRCC2), and
* cohort 3: aBC patients with a HRD as assessed by whole genome sequencing.
Malignant Neoplasm of Breast|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab Injection [Keytruda]|DRUG: Olaparib Oral Tablet [Lynparza]
Efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and olaparib via overall response rate, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of participants with a confirmed best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1., baseline up to 27 weeks
duration of response (DOR) time, DOR is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR) to the date of first tumor progression per RECIST v1.1., between the date of first response to the date of first tumor progression for up to 18 months after therapy start|progression free survival (PFS) time, PFS is defined as the time between the date of study entry and the first date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, between the date of study entry and the first date of progression or death for up to 18 months after therapy start|overall survival (OS) time, OS is defined as the time between the date of study entry and the date of death due to any cause, between the date of study entry and the date of death for up to 18 months after therapy start|safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib, Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), incidence of deaths, and incidence of abnormalities in the laboratory diagnostics, study start until 90 days post last dose
This is a multicenter, prospective, phase II, one-arm, three-cohort, open-label study of pembrolizumab in combination with olaparib in patients with advanced HER2 negative breast cancer who have either

* a deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1/2 irrespective of tumor HRD status (Cohort 1),
* or a deleterious germline mutation in ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, SLX4, XRCC2 irrespective of tumor HRD status (Cohort 2),
* or a centrally confirmed high tumor HRD status, but no deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1/2, ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCC, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, SLX4, XRCC2 (Cohort 3). HRD assessment needs to be performed on a tumor biopsy not more than 12 months before study entry.

All eligible participants according to the definition of cohorts 1-3 will receive pembrolizumab i.v. 200 mg q3w in combination with olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily (total dose 600 mg per day).

Study medication will be withdrawn/ended in case of onset of unacceptable toxicities, progression, withdrawal of consent, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first. Safety follow-up is planned for 90 days after the last application of study medication. Participants will be followed for survival for a maximum of 18 months after therapy start.
