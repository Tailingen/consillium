Study of HX008 for the Treatment of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC)
There are currently no target therapies approved for treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), leading to a clear need for improving therapy for ATC. This is a single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HX008 injection in patients with metastatic or locally advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.
