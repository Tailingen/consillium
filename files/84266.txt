Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
There are limited treatment options available for patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the drugs capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients who have been diagnosed with advanced and metastatic PDAC treated in the first and second lines.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Response Rate, Response rate (RR) is defined as the proportion of participants achieving partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on RECIST 1.0 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Response was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every two cycles (42 days ±2 days) on treatment. Participants received a median (range) of 2 cycles (1-12) of CAPOX.
Best Response, Best response on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria: Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Both require confirmation no fewer than 4 weeks apart. CR/PR assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Stable disease is defined as any condition not meeting above criteria., Response was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every two cycles (42 days ±2 days) on treatment. Participants received a median (range) of 2 cycles (1-12) of CAPOX.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive and estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods., Participants were followed long-term for survival every 3 months from the end of treatment until death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 10.8 months (95% CI: 7.1-37.7) in this study cohort.|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from treatment or death. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease evaluations occurred every two cycles (42 days ±2 days) on treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed for progression up to 38 months.
