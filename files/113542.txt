Avastin/[18-F]-5-fluorouracil PET/CT Imaging Feasibility Project
To determine whether using a radiolabelled analog of 5-FU, \[18F\]-5-fluorouracil, for PET/CT imaging can visually demonstrate differential chemotherapy delivery to known tumor sites before and after administration of bevacizumab and determine the optimal timing of bevacizumab administration to maximize the chemotherapy delivery into the tumor for improved cancer treatment.

Determine whether[18F]-5-Fluorouracil PET/CT scanning can demonstrate a difference in [18F]-5-Fluorouracil tumor uptake before and after the administration of Avastin, 1-4 days
Determine if [18F]-5-Fluorouracil PET/CT imaging demonstrates that there is a difference in maximal [18F]-5-Fluorouracil tumor uptake that is dependent on the time point of post-Avastin scanning, 1-4 days
