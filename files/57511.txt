Pan-canceR Early DetectIon projeCT (PREDICT)
PREDICT is a prospective, multicenter study for the early detection of pan-cancer through cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation-based model, in which approximately 14,000 participants will be enrolled. The development and validation of the model will be conducted in participants with cancers or benign diseases, along with non-tumor (healthy) individuals through a two-stage approach. The sensitivity and specificity of the model in cancer early detection will be evaluated, and the accuracy of the identification for tissue of origin will be obtained.
