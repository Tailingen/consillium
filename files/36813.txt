Telephone-Based Intervention to Treat Depression and Anxiety in Hispanic Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of administering a telephone-based intervention to treat depression and anxiety in Hispanic cancer survivors.
Survivorship|Cancer|Depression, Anxiety
BEHAVIORAL: Telephone interview|BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Participation Rate - Percentage Who Agreed to Participate, To determine participation rate, investigators will track the total number of individuals approached, the number of individuals who met all eligibility criteria and percent who agree to participate., 12 weeks after start of intervention|Accrual Rate, Accrual rates will be calculated by calculating the mean number of participants recruited per month., 12 weeks after start of intervention|Retention Rate - Percentage of Completed Visits, Study retention will be estimated by the proportion of participants who complete the Week 13 visit. Drop-out is defined as 100% minus the dropout %, 13 weeks after the start of intervention|Adherence - Percentage of Completed Therapy Sessions, Intervention adherence will be estimated as the mean percentage of therapy or check-in sessions each participant completes. Participants must complete at least 9 of the 12 sessions (75%) to be considered adherent., 12 weeks after start of intervention
Anxiety Questionnaire - General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7, The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 is a self-report measure of DSM-IV symptoms of general anxiety disorder. Participants rate 7 questions on a scale of 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days) and 3 (nearly every day); one additional question assesses the interference of these symptoms with functioning. The first 7 questions are summed to create a total score. Scoring range is 0-21 with the higher score indicating a higher level of anxiety (scores 0 to less than or equal to 9 = no/mild anxiety; scores greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 14 = moderate anxiety; scores greater than or equal to 15 to 21 = severe anxiety)., At baseline, 7 weeks and 13 weeks after start of intervention|Depressive Symptoms Questionnaire - Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is a self-report measure of DSM-IV symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. Participants rate how often they have experienced nine symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all); 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days) and 3 (nearly every day). Responses are summed, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. Scoring scale = 0-27 (scores 0 to less than or equal to 7 = no/mild depressive symptoms; scores greater than or equal to 8 to less than or equal to 14 = moderate depressive symptoms; scores greater than or equal to 15 to 27 = severe depressive symptoms), At baseline, 7 weeks and 13 weeks after start of intervention|Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Questionnaire, The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI; severity subscale) will be used to measure self-reported fear of recurrence. This 9-item subscale measures the presence and severity of the intrusive thoughts or images associated with the fear of recurrence. Scoring scale ranges from 0 (not at all or never) to 4 (a great deal or all of the time). Score ranges from 0-36. The higher the score, the greater the participants' fear of recurrence., At baseline and 13 weeks after start of intervention
Primary Objectives

* To assess the feasibility (participation, accrual, retention, adherence) of administering the intervention in Hispanic cancer survivors.
* To culturally adapt an existing behavioral intervention for cancer survivors based on stakeholder feedback.

Exploratory Objectives

* To summarize emotional distress (anxiety, depressive symptoms) and fear of recurrence in these post-treatment Hispanic cancer survivors.
* To describe the therapy process in terms of satisfaction with treatment and the therapist-participant relationship.
