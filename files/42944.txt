Gene-activated Bone Substitute for Maxillofacial Bone Regeneration
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the gene-activated bone substitute consisting of octacalcium phosphate and plasmid DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for maxillofacial bone regeneration. The patients with congenital and acquired maxillofacial bone defects and alveolar ridge atrophy will be enrolled.

DEVICE: Gene-activated matrix (OCP + plasmid DNA with VEGF gene)
Bone tissue formation in the field of gene-activated bone substitute implantation, To determine the quantity of newly formed bone tissue the following morphometric parameters will be measured on CT scan using special tools ("ROI", region of interest, etc.):

* average density (in HU);
* size (length, width, height) and volume.

All together both measurements allow to determine "bone tissue formation" as a value derived from the presence of newly formed bone tissue and its volume correspondence with the quantity of the material implanted., 6 months
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Evaluation of the Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events frequency, 6 months|Surgical failure rate, Evaluation of the events frequency when the surgery was not completed due to the reasons related with gene-activated bone substitute, 6 months
All participants of the study will receive standard treatment according to the medical care standards for diseases and pathological conditions characterized by maxillofacial bone defects and/or alveolar ridge atrophy. Bone grafting procedures as part of the surgical treatment will be performed with the use of investigated medical device. The safety and efficacy of the implanted gene-activated bone substitute will be evaluated by clinical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, and computer tomography within 6 months after surgery.
