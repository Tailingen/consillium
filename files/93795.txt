Phase I/II Study of Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Followed by AG-mFOLFOX in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) and gemcitabine followed by modified FOLFOX (AG-mFOLFOX) in patients with previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
