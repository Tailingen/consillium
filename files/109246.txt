A Study of Genetic Based Chemotherapy Dosing for Breast Cancer Patients
Epirubicin is a common chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of breast cancer. However, chemotherapy dosing is calculated based on people's height and weight, which may not be the most accurate way. The purpose of this study is to see if epirubicin dosing based on people's genetic profiles is better than the usual methods.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Epirubicin
The goal of this study is to determine the safety of pharmacogenetic guided dosing of epirubicin for each UGT2B7 genotype., Primary Objectives To describe the side effects of pharmacogenetically individualized FEC chemotherapy in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer., 10 years
Secondary Objectives i) To verify relationships between uridine glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 polymorphisms and epirubicin pharmacokinetics ii) To verify relationships between body composition and epirubicin pharmacokinetics, 10 years
