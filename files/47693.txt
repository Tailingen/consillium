Preoperative, Proton- Radiotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This is an interventional, single arm, open-label, feasibility trial with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, followed by concomitant proton therapy and capecitabine, followed by re-evaluation and surgery (when feasible) for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer|Proton Therapy
RADIATION: Proton Ions|DRUG: Nab-PACLitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Capecitabine|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection of the pancreas (when feasible)
Toxicity - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, Incidence of CTCAE version 5.0 Grade 4 non hematological toxicity from enrollment to six months after surgery, from enrollment to six months after surgery|Perioperative Mortality and Complications, Incidence of 90-days-perioperative mortality and incidence of Clavien Dindo Grade III complication rate during hospitalization, 90 days postoperatively
Toxicity - CTCAE v5.0, CTCAE V5.0 toxicity from enrollment to six month after surgery, from enrollment to six months after surgery|Tumor recurrence, local and loco-regional (i.e. in-field) tumor recurrence, 260 weeks after therapy|Progression free survival, loco-regional progression-free survival, 260 weeks after therapy|Overall survival, Overall survival, 282 weeks|Pathologic tumor response, Assessment of pathologic tumor response to pre-operative combined proton- chemotherapy (R0 margin and N0, degree of tumor cell necrosis in the resected tumor specimen), 260 weeks|Radiologic response, Assessment of radiologic response of pre-operative chemoradiotherapy. Response to preoperative treatment will be scored with the Japan Pancreas Society (JPS) classification which is a synthesis from the Evans and College of American Pathologists classification (Grade 1: poor or no response to Grade 4: complete response), 263 weeks after proton therapy|Quality of Life questionnaire: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), Patient reported Quality of Life (for assessing disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life). The higher the score the better the Quality of Life., 282 weeks|Quality of Life questionnaire: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30), Questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., 282 weeks|Quality of Life questionnaire: Brief Pain Inventory, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a measurement tool for assessing clinical pain.The interference items were now presented with 0-10 scales, with 0=no interference and 10=interferes completely., 282 weeks
This is an interventional, single arm, open label, feasibility trial of preoperative chemotherapy + concomitant chemo-proton therapy followed by surgery (when feasible) for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Aim of this study is to test referral and enrollment procedures as well as technical feasibility. Proton therapy will be delivered in MedAustron, which is a stand alone facility. Pancreatic cancer patients are typically complex cases that require multidisciplinary care. Moreover delivery of high dose of proton therapy to large volumes including the upper abdomen lymphnodes and pancreatic neural plexus is technically challenging, therefore a feasibility study is deemed necessary. Following this study, a larger study will be performed aiming to confirm the ability of preoperative chemotherapy + concomitant chemo-proton therapy to improve resectability and ultimately outcome of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer without increase in toxicity.
