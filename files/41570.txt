Ga-DOTATATE PET for Phosphaturic Mesenchymal Tumors in Patients With Tumor Induced Osteomalacia
The researchers are trying to evaluate a newer imaging technique (Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT) to see if it is more sensitive to localize the source of the hormone, which has caused the low phosphate levels.
Osteomalacia
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT
Number of Participants With Positive Localization of Phosphaturic Mesenchymal Tumors (PMTs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET maximum intensity projection images will be analyzed to evaluate for the localization of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs)., One year
Subjects will be contacted (phone script attached) to inform them of the study and the imaging modality. The first 10 patients that agree to participate in the study will be asked to present to the Mayo Clinic where they can provide a written consent and perform the imaging study.

Enrolled subjects will be evaluated in the clinical practice prior to having 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging performed. The treating endocrinologist will be informed of the imaging results and will review the results with the subject using a follow-up visit or phone call; when a tumor is localized, the endocrinologist will discuss appropriate management options.

Subjects will be follow for one year post 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT.
