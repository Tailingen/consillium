A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study to Evaluate HLX43 in Combination With Serplulimab in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
The study is being conducted to explore the reasonable dosage and evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HLX43 (Anti-PD-L1 ADC) in combination with Serplulimab (anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody injection) in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors

This study is an open-label phase Ib/II clinical study to explore the reasonable dosage and evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HLX43 (Anti-PD-L1 ADC) in combination with Serplulimab (anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody injection) in Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. The study is divided into two phases: phase Ib dose escalation and phase II dose expansion.The subjects will receive different dosages of HLX43 combined with a fixed dosage (300 mg) of serplulimab, administered via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) .
