Magnetic Anastomosis Device Relief of Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction
The purpose of this study is to determine if the Cook Magnetic Anastomosis Device can be used to safely and successfully create a patent gastrojejunal anastomosis in subjects requiring treatment of gastric outlet obstruction caused by malignancy.
Gastric Outlet Obstruction
DEVICE: Cook Magnetic Anastomosis Device (MAD) with Stent
Success Rate Associated With the Creation of a Gastro-jejunal Anastomosis Using the Cook Magnetic Anastomosis Device With Trans-anastomotic Deployment of a Gastro-jejunal or Duodenal Stent, Success is defined as placement of the gastric and jejunal magnets, creation of the anastomosis, and deployment of the gastro-jejunal stent., Approximately 8-10 days
Surgical treatments for malignant gastric outlet obstructions carry substantial risks and are associated with postoperative morbidity. External compression from advancing tumor or tissue growth through the stent can cause stenosis or re-obstruction. In these patients, the creation of a patent fistula that allows gastric emptying may significantly improve palliation. Minimally invasive techniques that carry no greater risks than enteral stenting may provide a viable palliative treatment. The primary objectives are safety, and successful creation of a gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Secondary objectives are successful resumption or improvement in the ability to tolerate PO feeding, rate of stent migration, and duration of stent and anastomosis patency.
