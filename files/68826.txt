The study is divided into 2 phases. Phase1 dose escalation part will enroll 19-42 patients to evaluate safety and tolerance of BN104 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Acute Leukemia to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase2 dose (RP2D), including 10-12 patient with specific mutations (KMT2A gene rearrangement or NPM1 gene mutation) enrolled at dose optimization phase.

Phase II expansion part will enroll 30-48 patients and be conducted at the selected dose level to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of BN104, as well as preliminary efficacy in Acute leukemia subjects with specific mutations (KMT2A gene rearrangement or NPM1 gene mutation). Patients will be allocated into 3 Acute Leukemia subgroup cohorts depends on their genotype.

* Cohort A: Subjects with Relapsed/refractory AML subjects with NPM1 mutations
* Cohort B: Subjects with relapsed/refractory AML with KMT2A rearrangements.
* Cohort C: Subjects with relapsed/refractory ALL or mixed spectrum leukemia with KMT2A rearrangements Patients will receive orally administrated BN104 once daily or twice daily. Study drug will be administered in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, death, Informed consent withdraw ect.

Laboratory tests will be performed weekly in Cycles 1-2, bi-weekly in Cycle3 and every 4weeks from Cycle 4 onwards. Efficacy assessment will be performed on baseline, C2D1, C3D1 and every 2 cycles from Cycle3 onwards. Additional clinical assessments and laboratory tests may be performed at discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated.
