Brassica Vegetables or Indole-3-Carbinol in Treating Patients With PSA Recurrence After Surgery for Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Eating a diet high in vegetables may lower the risk of some types of cancer. Brassica vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) and indole-3-carbinol (a substance found in cruciferous vegetables) may help lower the risk of prostate cancer recurrence.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well Brassica vegetables work compared with indole-3-carbinol in treating patients with PSA recurrence after surgery for prostate cancer.

BEHAVIORAL: behavioral dietary intervention|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Brassica vegetable|DRUG: indole-3-carbinol|OTHER: counseling intervention|OTHER: medical chart review|OTHER: questionnaire administration|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy
Feasibility of Brassica vegetable intake and indole-3-carbinol supplementation, will be measured at 2-Months, 4-Months, and 6-Months after Baseline start for the diet intervention|Adverse events, will be measured at 2-Months, 4-Months, and 6-Months after Baseline start for the diet intervention|Effects of intervention on prostate-specific antigen, Not noted
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility of Brassica vegetable intake and indole-3-carbinol supplement use in patients with prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy.
* Identify adverse events in these patients.
* Quantify the effects of each intervention on PSA in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by pretreatment prostat-specific antigen (PSA) growth rate (low \[0.00-0.15\] vs medium \[0.16-0.30\] vs high \[\> 0.30\]). They are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms, and randomization status to arms II and III is double-blinded.

* Arm I (Brassica vegetables): Patients consume Brassica vegetables at least 2 servings (Â½ cup/serving) daily for 6 months. Patients meet one-on-one with the study dietician, and are instructed on the potential health benefits of Brassica vegetables and purchase and preparation of the vegetables. Patients undergo telephone counseling periodically in months 1-5, to monitor their progress and identify barriers to adherence and to develop solutions to overcome these barriers.
* Arm II (Placebo): Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months.
* Arm III (Indole-3-carbinol supplement): Patients receive oral indole-3-carbinol supplement (capsules) once daily for 6 months.

Blood and urine samples (for urinary isothiocyanate levels) are collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 months. Patients complete questionnaires assessing demographics, family cancer history, and health history and measuring changes in medications, lifestyle, adverse events, and health. Medical records are reviewed for prostate cancer-related information, surgical dates, dose and type of radiation, and PSA history.
