This project is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-dose, multiple-administration dose-finding study, which aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy characteristics of the PANK-003 cell preparation in subjects after adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for solid tumors.

The study will enroll subjects with pathologically diagnosed solid tumors (lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer) who have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical treatment or after neoadjuvant therapy plus surgical treatment.

The study includes a screening period, a treatment period, and an observation and follow-up period.

The main objectives :

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple injections of PANK-003 cell injection combined with standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with solid tumors.

The secondary objectives :

To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of multiple injections of PANK-003 cell injection combined with standard postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with solid tumors.
