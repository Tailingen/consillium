QUILT-3.047: NANT Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) Vaccine: Combination Immunotherapy in Subjects With HNSCC Who Have Progressed on or After Chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination therapy in subjects with HNSCC who have progressed on or after previous chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year or until they experience progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
