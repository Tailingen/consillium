CERTICOEUR: A Secondary Prevention Study of Skin Cancers in Heart Transplant Patients. Everolimus Versus Calcineurin Inhibitors Multicenter Trial
Heart transplant is a recognized therapeutic strategy in refractory heart failure. Its success is however hampered by severe cancer occurrence and recurrence. The new m-tor inhibiting drugs Sirolimus and Everolimus have shown potential for reducing the incidence of cancer in animal models. They are potent immunosuppressant, antiproliferative and antiangiogenic drugs. This open labelled randomized multicenter study aims at evaluating the beneficial antineoplastic effect of Everolimus in 159 heart transplant patients suffering of recurrent skin cancer. Primary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the number of new skin cancers. Secondary end point will be time of recurrence, incidence of non skin cancer, graft function following switch (including death), renal function evolution following calcineurin inhibitors reduction or withdrawal, Everolimus tolerance profile, schemes of calcineurin inhibitors reduction management in centers.
