HMPL-453 in Advanced Malignant Mesothelioma
This is a phase II, single arm, multicenter and open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced Malignant Mesothelioma
Advanced Malignant Mesothelioma
DRUG: HMPL-453
Overall response rate (ORR), Evaluating ORR of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma, measured up to 6 months after the last subject has been enrolled or all subjects have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first
Disease control rate (DCR), Evaluating DCR of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma, measured up to 6 months after the last subject has been enrolled or all subjects have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first|12 weeks DCR, Evaluating 12 weeks DCR of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma, measured on 12 weeks|Time to Response (TTR), Evaluating TTR of HMPL-453 in patient who achieved partial response or complete response according to RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST 1.1, measured on 4 weeks|Duration of response (DoR), Evaluating DoR of HMPL-453 in patient from subject first achieve a complete remission, or partial remission to patient PD, or death whichever comes first., measured on 30 weeks|12 weeks PFS, Evaluating 12 weeks PFS rate of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma, measured on 12 weeks|Progression free survival (PFS), Evaluating PFS of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma., measured on 20 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Evaluating OS of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant mesothelioma, measured on 60weeks|Adverse Event (AE) of HMPL-453 monitoring, The safety endpoints include adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Reporting of safety, extent of exposure, concomitant medications and discontinuation of study therapy will be based on all subjects who received at least 1 dose of treatment. The adverse events will be registered according to NCI CTCAE 5.0., Measured from the first dose to within 30 days after the end of treatment.|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HMPL-453, Evaluating Cmax of Continuous dosing of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant, measured on Cycle 1 day 15 and day 16|The time to Cmax (Tmax) of HMPL-453, Evaluating Tmax of Continuous dosing of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant, measured on Cycle 1 day 15 and day 16|The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of HMPL-453, Evaluating AUC from 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration of HMPL-453 in patient with advanced malignant, measured on Cycle 1 day 15 and day 16
