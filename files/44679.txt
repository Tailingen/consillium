Genomic Risk in Retroperitoneal Sarcoma
The protocol intends to explore the biology which may underlie recurrences of retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Surgery remains the only curative intent intervention for this disease. Often, tumors recur in locations within the retroperitoneum remote from the original primary tumor. This study hypothesizes that normal appearing retroperitoneal fat actually harbors underlying genetic changes which predispose to development of future liposarcoma. To accomplish this goal, retroperitoneal fat is sampled from quadrants within and remote from the primary tumor and is subsequently subjected to genetic analyses looking for such predisposing factors.
Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma
OTHER: Biospecimen sample collection during standard-of-care surgery
Presence of MDM2 amplification in "normal" retroperitoneal fat, MDM2 amplification of primary tumors and fat samples will be tested by immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization., Through study completion, an average of 3 years
