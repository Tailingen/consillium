Induction Chemotherapy and Toripalimab Followed by Radiotherapy in Unresectable Laryngeal/Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to define whether combination of induction chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor (Toripalimab) followed by radiotherapy improve progression-free survival, for patients with unresectable laryngeal/hypopharyngeal carcinoma.

Historically, induction chemotherapy has been shown to increase laryngeal-preservation rate, improve disease-free survival and reduce the risk of distant metastasis. However, the prognosis of locally advanced laryngeal/ hypopharyngeal carcinoma remains poor. Recently, phase I-II clinical studies demonstrated excellent pathological response of induction PD-1 inhibitor with/without chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. The aim of this study is to define whether combination of induction chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor (Toripalimab) followed by radiotherapy improve progression-free survival, for patients with unresectable laryngeal/hypopharyngeal carcinoma.
