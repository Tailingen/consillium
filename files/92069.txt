A Pilot Study of VEGF Inhibition in Patients With Lymphedema Following Breast Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bevacizumab in women with lymphedema as a result of previous treatment for breast cancer.

The primary objective of this study is:

â€¢ To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm volume in patients with ipsilateral lymphedema

The secondary objectives of this study are:

* To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm interstitial fluid pressure (IFP)
* To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in extracellular fluid (ECF) volume based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) by lymphometer
* To assess the safety and tolerability of VEGF inhibition in this patient population
* To assess the clinical benefit in patients with ipsilateral lymphedema treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition by evaluating patient responses to a quality of life questionnaire (FACT-B+4 lymphedema questions)
* To determine the impact of VEGF inhibition on circulating VEGF levels in patients with lymphedema
