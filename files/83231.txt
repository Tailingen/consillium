Pilot Study of SBRT and CDX-1127 in Prostate Cancer
This study evaluates the combination of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and CDX-1127 in subjects with castration resistant prostate cancer. Subjects will be randomized to one of three arms to receive SBRT prior to, after, or in conjunction with the first dose of CDX-1127.
Prostatic Neoplasms|Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CDX1127|RADIATION: SBRT
Number of adverse events, Up to day 270|Immunologic (CD8+ T cell and T regulatory cell (Treg) infiltration), • Estimate the effect of SBRT, CDX-1127 and the combination of SBRT and CDX- 1127 on CD8+ T cell and T regulatory cell (Treg) infiltration in prostate tumors., Up to day 43
Immunologic (lymphocyte composition of blood over time)., • Estimate the effect of SBRT, CDX-1127, and the combination of SBRT and CDX-1127 on the lymphocyte composition of blood over time., Up to day 270
This pilot study will be conducted in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer in order to define whether inclusion of immune regulation agents such as CDX-1127 augments immune responses to SBRT-treated primary tumors or metastases, and whether inclusion of CDX-1127 in the treatment regimen results in immune responses in untreated metastases.
