Using Positive Pressure Ventilation for Preoxygenation During Panendoscopy.
the aim of the study is to determine if Spontaneous Ventilation with Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) preoxygenation allows a longer non hypoxemic apnea time during panendoscopy compared to spontaneous breathing preoxygenation.

the hypothesis is PPV extends the residual functional capacity of lung so it provides more oxygen during apnea.
ENT Cancer Screening
DEVICE: positive pressure ventilation|PROCEDURE: Oxygenation with simple breathing mask
non hypoxemic apnea time, time the oxygen saturation is going down to 90% during apnea, up to 5 minutes after stopping oxygenation
surgical laryngoscopy frequency, number of stopped surgical laryngoscopy because of a low oxygen saturation under 90% with necessity to ventilate the patients during apnea, up to 15 minutes after stopping oxygenation|preoxygenation time, time to reach expired oxygen fraction to 90%, up to 10 min after the start of oxygenation
