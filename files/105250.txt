Robotic Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions
In this study, the feasibility of performing robotic navigation of peripheral airways in human subjects for the purpose of biopsying peripheral lung lesions will be evaluated.
Lung; Node
DEVICE: Robotic assisted bronchoscopy
Number of Participants With Device or Procedure Related Adverse Events, Computed as the number of patients with device or procedure related adverse events divided by number of patients who underwent the robotic bronchoscopy procedure., 24-84 hours post-procedure|Successful Navigation to Targeted Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions, Successful navigation is confirmed using radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS). the R-EBUS will be inserted into the working channel of the endoscope and advanced beyond the tip of the inner scope as the inner scope is advanced into the lung periphery towards the targeted lesion. As the endoscope is guided towards the targeted lesion, R-EBUS will confirm successful lesion localization prior to biopsies being performed., During the procedure, approximately 1 hour
Incidence of Complications Unrelated to Device, Computed as the number of patients with events unrelated to device or procedure divided by number of patients who underwent the robotic bronchoscopy procedure., 24-84 hours post-procedure|Time to R-EBUS Confirmation (Lesion Localization), Defined by the time the robotic bronchoscope is inserted into the oropharynx until the localization of the targeted lesion is confirmed by REBUS., During the procedure, approximately 1 hour|Total Procedure Time, Defined by the time the robotic bronchoscope is inserted into the oropharynx until the time a biopsy tool is removed., During the procedure|Diagnostic Yield, Determined from the results of the bronchoscopy., Data was collected (as part of standard of care) through 1-year for calculation of diagnostic yield.
Successful biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions remains a challenge due to a number of factors, one of which may be the ability to gain access to peripheral lesions due to the size and maneuverability of conventional bronchoscopes. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of a new technique using a robotic endoscope with the Monarch navigational platform to both access and biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions. The Monarch platform is a "robotic" assisted or electromechanical, software driven endoscopy system designed to be used by qualified physicians to provide bronchoscopic visualization of and access to patient airways for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
