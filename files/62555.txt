Scale of Therapeutic Adherence to Respiratory Rahabilitation for Lung Cancer
The goal of this non experimental, transversal instrument study is to Construct and determine the reliability and validity of the Scale of Therapeutic Adherence for Respiratory Rehabilitation in Lung Cancer in Mexican patients with a lung cancer diagnosis.

The main question it aims to answer is: What is the reliability and validity of the Scale of Therapeutic Adherence for Respiratory Rehabilitation in Lung Cancer of the patients with this diagnosis that are currently undergoing an assessment or follow up program of Respiratory Rehabilitation?

The Scale of Therapeutic Adherence for Respiratory Rehabilitation in Lung Cancer (STA-RR-LC) will be psychometrically valid and reliable for the evaluation of therapeutic adherence on patients with lung cancer that are undergoing an assessment or follow up of Respiratory Rehabilitation.Participants will be asked to fill out an Identification card and fill out the fifty-six items presented on the STA-RR-LC.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Scale of Therapeutic Adherence to Respiratory Rahabilitation for Lung Cancer (STA-RR-LC)
Contruction of the Scale of Therapeutic Adherence for Respiratory Rehabilitation in Lung Cancer (STA-RR-LC), The validity of the construction is carried out with an exploratory factor analysis using the Maximum Likelihood extraction method and the oblique rotation (direct Oblimin). Confiability is determitated using the Alpha of Cronbach coefficient., the STA-RR-LC will be applied for one time and as soon as the patient has completed one month attending the Respiratory Rehabilitation Service.
Verify the concurrent validity of the instrument, It will be verified using the current scores of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, specifically the Module of Lung Cancer (EORTC-QLQ-LC29)., the STA-RR-LC will be applied one time, as soon as the patient has completed one month attending the Respiratory Rehabilitation Service
For the recruitment patients with lung cancer diagnosis that arrive at the Respiratory Rehabilitation service will be asked if they are willing to participate and fill out the STA.

It will be explained to them as clearly as possible the objective, procedure, risks and benefits of the study and a copy of the Informed Consent will be provided. Lung cancer patients attending the Pulmonary Rehabilitation service will be approached and a verbal explanation of the study will be given.
