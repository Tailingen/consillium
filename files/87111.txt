Contrast-Enhanced MRI for the Characterization of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)
\*REFERRALS TO THIS TRIAL MUST BE THROUGH BREAST CARE CLINICIANS ONLY\*

RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced MRI, may help find and diagnose ductal carcinoma in situ.

PURPOSE: This study is to develop and refine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods for pre-operative staging of ductal carcinoma in situ, a pre-invasive form of breast cancer, and atypical ductal hyperplasia, a risk factor for developing cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)|DRUG: Gadavist
Comparison of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-optimized MRI quality, Conspicuity of DCIS lesion, agreement of disease extent with biopsy, and overall image quality will be used to determine the overall image quality for each MRI., 1 month|Comparison of two DCIS-optimized MRIs for variability in enhancement levels for DCIS, Conspicuity of DCIS lesion, agreement of disease extent with biopsy, and overall image quality will be used to determine the overall image variability for each MRI., 1 month
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the DCIS optimized MRI to the standard clinical MRI. Using a scale of 1-5 from poor to excellent, images will be assessed for conspicuity of DCIS and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) lesions, agreement of disease extent with biopsy, and overall image quality (artifact level, uniformity of fat suppression, contrast to noise ratio and signal to noise ratio).
* Subjects with ADH, a benign condition that can also show enhancement on MRI, will be enrolled to explore the utility of the DCIS optimized MRI for distinguishing DCIS and ADH.
