Comparing Anastrozole-Placebo to the Combination Anastrozole-ZD1839 in Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor and/or Progesterone Receptor Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is being carried out to see if treatment with ZD1839 (Gefitinib) combined with Arimidex (Anastrozole) has improved efficacy over Arimidex alone in preventing progression of metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Anastrozole
Time to progression, To estimate TTP in the 2 treatment arms of postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer, Duration of study
Objective response rate, To estimate the ORR (complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\] as defined by RECIST for the 2 treatment arms, Duration of Study|Overall clinical benefit rate, To estimate the clinical benefit rates (CBR; defined as CR+PR\[as per RECIST\]+stable disease \[SD\]\>24 weeks) for the 2 treatment arms, Duration of Study|Overall survival, To estimate overall survival (OS) for each of the 2 treatment arms, Duration of Study|Safety, To compare the tolerability of anastrozole/placebo to that of anastrozole/ZD1839, Duration of Study|Pharmacokinetic variables, To determine steady-state plasma trough concentrations of anastrozole in all patients. To determine steady-state trough concentrations of ZD1839 and to relate values to historical data, Duration of Study|Biomarker objectives, To obtain tumor tissue and blood samples for biologic studies in the limited population available and measure expression of markers that may potentially correlate with response to treatment in this patient population, Duration of Study
This is a phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomized in a double-blind manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 250 mg/day ZD1839 or matched placebo in combination with 1 mg/day anastrozole. The dose of ZD1839 has been selected based on clinical studies in other tumor types suggesting identical efficacy together with a better toxicity profile in patients treated at 250 mg compared to 500 mg/day. The 1 mg dose of anastrozole is the standard approved dose.
