RC48-ADC Combined With Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Solid Tumors With HER2 Expression
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and preliminary efficacy of Disitamab Vedotin(DV, RC48-ADC) intravenously combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced solid tumors with HER2 expression
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Disitamab vedotin
DLT, Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), First DV dose to 28 days after the last RT|AE, the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE);, First DV dose to 90 days after the last RT
PK Characterize, The concentration of DV binding antibodies, total antibodies, and free MMAE., Cycle1Day1 to Cycle1Day8 (each cycle is 14 days)|Immunogenicity assessment, Anti-RC48 antibodies, Cycle1Day1 to Cycle1Day8 (each cycle is 14 days)|ORR, (RECIST 1.1 standard, evaluated by investigators): objective response rate (ORR), the relationship between HER2 expression and therapeutic efficacy., approximately 2 years from the first dose
This study is a single arm, open, single site clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and efficacy of Disitamab Vedotin intravenously combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced solid tumors with HER2 expression. Unresectable locally advanced solid tumor patients whose SOC is concurrent chemoradiation but ineligible or refuse to standard chemotherapy should be enrolled.
