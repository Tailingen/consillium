Metastases-directed Radiotherapy in Addition to Standard Systemic Therapy in Patients With Oligometastatic Breast Cancer
The prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer has improved continuously. Systemic therapies alone are not able to cure the disease permanently.

Investigators initiated this randomized controlled multinational and multicenter clinical trial to analyse the impact of a local metastases-directed radiotherapy in addition to standard systemic therapy in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer on progression-free survival and quality of life.

RADIATION: Metastases-directed Radiotherapy
First co-primary outcome measure is progression-free survival (PFS), Co-primary progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), at least 12 months after randomization|Second co-primary outcome measure is quality of life, Co-primary quality of life according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer patients with 30 items (QLQ-C30) sum score, 12 weeks after randomization
Feasibility (per-protocol within intention-to-treat), Proportion of participants treated per protocol, 12 weeks|Overall survival, Time between randomization and death, at least 1, up to 5 years|Toxicity (number and degree of reported toxicities in both treatment arms), Proportion of participants with degree of toxicities as defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and by Radiation Treatment Oncology Group (RTOG) by point in time of follow-up with higher degree indicating higher intensity, 0 to 5 years|Neoplasia-specific quality of life, Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionaire for Cancer patients with 30 items (QLQ-C30) with different scales, quarterly up to 5 years|Breast cancer-specific quality of life, Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionaire for breast cancer patients with 23 items (QLQ-BR23) on 4-point Likert scales with different directions, quarterly up to 5 years|Patient satisfaction, Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Patient satisfaction questionnaire for cancer patients with 33 items (PATSAT-C33) on 5-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction, 12 weeks|Frequency of adverse events, Number of patients with adverse and serious adverse events, 0 to 5 years
Preferably ablative radiotherapy (radiosurgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT)) with few high-dose fractions. Larger lesions or lesions with critical normal tissue involvement should be treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy (depending on the size and location of the target volume and the decision of the radiooncologist). For critical organs in the target volume, standard fractionated radiotherapy can be used.
