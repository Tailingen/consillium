Psychosocial and Patient Education Needs of Prostate Cancer Patients Selecting Watchful Waiting
This study includes an interview with men who have selected "watchful waiting" or "active surveillance" for their localized prostate cancer, in lieu of active treatment (such as surgery or radiation). We hope to understand the educational and support needs of men on surveillance so that we can develop a new intervention that will improve quality of life for such men.
