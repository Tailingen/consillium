A Phase 1 Study Of An Intravenously Administered Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor In Patients With Advanced Cancer
AG-024322 may work in cancer by stopping cancer cells from multiplying. AG-024322 is and intravenous drug from a new class of drugs call cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK inhibitors). This research study is the first time that AG-024322 will be given to people.
Neoplasms|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: AG-024322
To test the safety of AG-024322 when taken by people who have cancer|To find the AG-024322 dose that should be used in future clinical trials that will study effectiveness|To assess how the human body handles blood concentrations of AG-024322
The study was prematurely discontinued due to the inability of the compound to adequately differentiate from other treatment options in the clinical endpoint and necessary product profile on April 13, 2007. Safety profile was not the reason that led to the discontinuation of the program.
