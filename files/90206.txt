De-implementation of Outdated Colonoscopy Surveillance Interval Recommendations Among Patients With Low-risk Adenomas
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three standard of care outreach approaches (i.e., mailed letter, secure message, and telephone call) on patient adoption of the new 10-year colonoscopy surveillance interval recommendation for a random sample of health plan members who have a now-outdated 5-year surveillance interval due to a finding of 1-2 small adenomas at their prior colonoscopy. The primary study endpoint is the proportion of patients in each outreach arm who adopt the new 10-year colonoscopy surveillance interval.
