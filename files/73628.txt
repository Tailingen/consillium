Prospectively Predict the Immunotherapy Response of Gastric Cancer Based on Circulating Exosomal LncRNA-GC1 Biopsy
To vertify the function of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 on predicting and monitoring immunotherapeutic outcomes of GC
Advanced Gastric Carcinoma|Immunotherapy
DEVICE: Circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 detection
Levels of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1, Circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 was detected by the RT-PCR followed by isolating exosomes., Circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 was detected, analysis and reported at the baseline|Levels of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1, Circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 was detected by the RT-PCR followed by isolating exosomes., Circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 was detected, analysis and reported through study completion, average 1 year
Survival outcomes of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1, Analysis participants' survival with different levels of circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 detected by RT-PCR., up to 3 years
The investigator's previous work identified circulating exosomal lncRNA-GC1 as a GC-specific tumor burden marker and this novel biomarker showed promising efficiency in monitoring disease progression during treatment.

Hence in this stuty, the investigator plan to recruit a prospective cohort to support the conclusions, and provide biomarkers to realize predicting and monitoring immunotherapeutic outcomes of GC.
