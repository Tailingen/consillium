A Study of RO5479599 Alone or in Combination With Cetuximab or Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced Malignant Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER3) Expressing Solid Tumors of Epithelial Cell Origin
This dose-escalating study consists of 3 parts (A, B and C) and will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of RO5479599, alone or in combination with cetuximab or erlotinib, in participants with metastatic and/or locally advanced malignant HER3-positive solid tumors. Cohorts of participants will receive escalating doses of intravenous RO5479599 as monotherapy (Part A) or in combination with cetuximab (in Part B) or with erlotinib (in Part C) followed by an extension phase for each part.

In an imaging substudy, participants will receive one or two doses of zirconium-89-labeled RO5479599 (89ZrRO5479599) in addition to unlabeled RO5479599 to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution and organ pharmacokinetics of RO5479599.
