MRI Study of Changes in Blood-Brain/Tumor-Barrier Permeability in Patients With Brain Metastases During and After Radiotherapy
This study aims to assess changes in vascular permeability in the brain tumor, and in the surrounding brain, due to radiation therapy, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

RADIATION: Single Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)|RADIATION: Fractionated Whole Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT)|RADIATION: Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (FSRT)|DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Assessments
Percentage of the Gross Tumor Volume With a BTB Opening of Ktrans > 0.005 Min-1, Fifty metastatic lesions from 21 patients received WBRT and 14 lesions from 9 patients treated by SRS were analyzed. Permeability of BTB (Blood-Tumor-Barrier) was quantified by the transfer constant, Ktrans, derived from dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI that were acquired pre, 1-2 weeks after starting, and 1-month post-radiotherapy. A percentage volume of the BM with Ktrans \>0.005 min-1 (%Vall) was used to evaluate the extent of BTB opening pre-RT and subsequent changes after receiving radiotherapy. The 50 lesions, from the 21 patients treated with Whole Brain Radiation Therapy, were divided into two subgroups: low-leaky (%Vall \<50%) and high-leaky, based upon pre-RT measurements. Of the 50 lesions, 7 were classified as low leaky and 43 were classified as high leaky. All 14 SRS lesions were classified as high leaky., Pre-Treatment, 1-2 Weeks Post Treatment (SRS), 1 Month Post Treatment|Change in Magnitude and Regional Variability of Blood Tumor Barrier (BTB)/Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) Permeability (Per Minute) in Tumor, Tumor Margin, Normal Brain and Brain Metastases, An in-house program, based on a general kinetic model, along with an MRI contrast agent, Gadopentetic Acid (Gd-DTPA), will be used to estimate vascular permeability (per minute)., Week -2 to -1, End of Treatment (WBRT), 1-2 Weeks Post Treatment (SRS), 1 Month Post Treatment
