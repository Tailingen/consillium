Study of a Reduced-toxicity Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen Using Fludarabine and Full Doses of Intravenous Busulfan in Pediatric Patients Not Eligible for Standard Myeloablative Conditioning Regimens
The purpose of this study is to assess transplant-related mortality (TRM) at one year after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) prepared by a "reduced toxicity myeloablative" conditioning regimen in young patients (children and adolescents) with hematologic malignancies.
Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: Fludarabine IV- Busulfan IV (Busilvex®) - Anti-thymocyte globulines (Thymoglobuline®)
Transplant-related mortality (TRM), Evaluation of the cumulative incidence of TRM at 12 months after transplantation, 12 months
Incidence of engraftment, Incidence of engraftment defined as the first day of neutrophil (\>500/μl for 3 consecutive days). Engraftment failure is defined as neutrophil \<500/μl at day+42 after allo-SCT., Day+42|Evaluation of overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), Evaluation of overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year after transplantation, 12 months|Cumulative incidence of relapse, death from disease, and non-relapse mortality (NRM), Cumulative incidence of relapse, death from disease, and non-relapse mortality (NRM), 12 months|Cumulative incidences and severity of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host disease, Cumulative incidences and severity of acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host disease, 12 months|Immune Recovery (to be determined in a subgroup of patients), Immune Recovery parameters: blood counts, bone marrow aspiration with evaluation of morphological response., 12 months
