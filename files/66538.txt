The drug tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to treat people who have advanced malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) for alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days.

This open label study enrolled 59 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of 10 dose escalation arms:

* Alisertib 5 mg once daily (QD) for 7 Days (D)
* Alisertib 80 mg QD 7D
* Alisertib 150 mg QD 7D
* Alisertib 50 mg twice daily (BID) 7D
* Alisertib 60 mg BID 7D
* Alisertib 75 mg BID 7D
* Alisertib 100 mg BID 7D
* Alisertib 50 mg QD 14D
* Alisertib 50 mg QD 21D
* Alisertib 70 mg QD 21D

All participants received treatment until their disease progressed or they experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity.

This multi-center trial was conducted in Spain. The overall time to participate in this study was 730 days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.
