Irinotecan in Treating Children With Refractory Solid Tumors
This phase II trial is studying irinotecan to see how well it works in treating children with refractory solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
Objective response (PR or CR), recorded according to standard solid tumor response criteria, Up to 8 years
Toxicity, graded using the NCI CTCAE version 2.0, Up to 8 years|Pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride, Day 1 of course 1
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in children with refractory CNS or solid tumors.

II. Assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in this patient population.

III. Determine patient UGT1A1 genotype and correlate genotype with toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of solid tumor (Ewings/PNET vs neuroblastoma vs osteosarcoma vs rhabdomyosarcoma vs other solid tumors excluding lymphomas and brain tumors) or brain tumor (medulloblastoma/PNET vs brain stem glioma vs ependymoma vs other CNS tumors).

Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter until death or until patient enters another POG study.
