A Study of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 With Veledimex in Subjects With Breast Cancer
This is a single-arm, phase Ib/II study to examine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of one cycle of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy in women with advanced breast cancer and pre-study SD or PR after completion of a minimum 12 week course of standard first- or second-line chemotherapy. The patient population will include patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Ad-RTS-hIL-12|DRUG: Veledimex
Composite measure of safety and tolerability of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy following a first-or second-line standard treatment in HER2-negative subjects, or together with a first- or second-line anti-HER2 antibody therapy in HER2-positive subjects, Composite measure of safety and tolerability based on lab parameters, vitals, physical examination data and deaths, SAEs, and AEs resulting in patient discontinuation. Toxicity stopping rules when applicable will be determined based on a clinical assessment made by the SRC., 2.5 years
Progression rate at 12 weeks after the start of one cycle of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy, 2.5 years|Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the rate of complete response (CR) plus the rate of partial response (PR) at 12 weeks following the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy, 2.5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks following the start of one cycle of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy, 2.5 years|Number of subjects whose baseline tumor status (stable disease or partial response) improves to partial response or better at 12 weeks following the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy, 2.5 years|Comparison of radiographic tumor responses by irRC with RECIST, 2.5 years|Impact of treatment on serum immune biomarkers such as cytokines, chemokines, soluble receptors and antibodies to tumor antigens, 2.5 years
Subjects who have PD or a CR after the standard chemotherapy are not eligible for the study. Following entry into the trial, patients will go on a treatment holiday from chemotherapy and enter an immunotherapy phase of treatment. Continuation of HER2-targeted antibody therapy is permitted during this immunotherapy phase for women with HER2+ disease. Scans will be conducted at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 immunotherapy to determine tumor response. Radiographic PD at week 6 must be confirmed at least 4 weeks later, either at week 12 or earlier if clinically necessitated.
