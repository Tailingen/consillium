Novel Crown-cut Biopsy Needle (FNB) vs Standard Aspiration Needle (FNA) for EUS-guided Diagnosis of SPLs
The aim of this study is to compare tissue quality and molecular yield between a novel crown-cut biopsy needle (FNB) and a standard aspiration needle (FNA) for EUS-guided diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions.
