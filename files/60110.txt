A Clinical Study of ONCT-534 in Subjects With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.
A first-in-human clinical trial to test the investigational treatment ONCT-534 in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What are the most tolerable doses of ONCT-534? (Phase 1)
* Does ONCT-534 have anti-tumor activity at tolerable doses? (Phase 2)

This is a dose escalation and expansion study where participants will receive daily oral doses of ONCT-534.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: ONCT-534
Dose Limiting Toxicities Through Study Day 28, Incidence of DLTs through Study Day 28, Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities Through Study Day 28
Reduction of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) by More Than 50%, Proportion of patients who achieve at least a 50% drop in PSA from baseline (PSA50), Up to 51 Weeks
This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor acitivity of ONCT-534 in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study consists of 2 phases: a Phase 1 Dose Escalation and a Phase 2 Dose Expansion.

* During the dose escalation in Phase 1 a group of participants will be assigned a certain dose level. Once the dose level is considered safe, the next group will be assigned a higher dose level. The dose level may be raised or lowered depending on any safety events that occur throughout Phase 1. There will be approximately 27 participants enrolled in Phase 1. At the end of Phase 1, two dose levels will be chosen to be tested in Phase 2.
* During Phase 2, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 dose levels chose in Phase 1. Approximately 16 participants will be enrolled in each of the 2 dose level groups, for a total of 32 participants.
