Enhanced Genetic Awareness and Genetic Evaluation for Men Through Technology, ENGAGEMENT Study
This study assesses perceived usefulness of a web-based virtual prostate cancer genetics board for providers across academic, community, and veteran affairs settings to discuss prostate cancer genetics cases, precision treatment, and screening recommendation. Information gained from interviews and surveys of participants taking part in the virtual genetics board may lend insights into perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, acceptability, self-efficacy, genetics knowledge, and barriers/facilitators to implementation to refine the process.

Mean Likert scaled perceived usefulness scores of the virtual genetics board, Perceived usefulness will be judged against a benchmark mean score of 5/7., After virtual genetics board
Means or changes in means of Likert scaled acceptability/feasibility, Will be summarized by means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals., Before and after virtual genetics board|Perceived ease of use, Will be summarized by means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals., After virtual genetics board|Self-efficacy for recommendations, Will be summarized by means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals., Before and after virtual genetics board|Change in mean scores on 17 genetics knowledge test questions, Will be summarized by means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals., Baseline up to post-virtual genetics board
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess perceived usefulness of a virtual genetics board.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess acceptability/feasibility, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy for recommendations, genetics knowledge.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete a survey about genetic knowledge and self efficacy and then attend virtual genetics board. After virtual genetics board meeting, participants complete a second survey about perceived usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, feasibility, self-efficacy and genetic knowledge. Participants may also complete a semi-structured interview after virtual genetics board.
