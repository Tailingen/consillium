Phase 1/2a Two-Arm Dose-Escalation Study of BAX69 in Subjects With Malignant Ascites of Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAX69 monotherapy given either as intraperitoneal (IP) infusion (Single-Route Arm); or as IP infusion after intravenous (IV) infusion (IV+IP) (Double-Route Arm), and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each Arm separately, in subjects with refractory ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant ascites. In both Arms, the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAX69 will be characterized, and pharmacodynamics (PD) markers will be explored in plasma and ascites. Two expansion cohorts will further assess the tolerability of the RP2D and explore clinical signs of efficacy.

The Occurrence of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as any drug related treatment-emergent adverse event that occurs during the 28-day period after the first dose of Imalumab and that meets any of these criteria: - Any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity assessed by the investigator as related to study drug (except: single lab value out of normal range not necessarily translating or considered a feature of clinical diagnosis requiring an intervention per investigator's interpretation and resolves to ≤ Grade 2 with adequate measure in 7 days; Transient grade 3 elevations of hepatic transaminases in the absence of simultaneous increase in serum bilirubin; Alopecia) - Any toxicity resulted in dose delay for ≥14 days - Any grade 4 hematologic toxicity (except lymphopenia) - Grade 3 febrile neutropenia - Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding - Any life-threatening complication/abnormality not covered in the NCICTCAE v4.03, 4 weeks|The Ratio of Puncture Free Survival (PuFS) Over Puncture-free Interval at Baseline, PuFS is defined as the time from the last dose of Imalumab to the first therapeutic paracentesis after that, or death, whichever occurs first. Puncture-free interval at baseline is calculated as the time between the last 2 therapeutic paracenteses immediately before the first dose of Imalubmab., 4 weeks
Ratio of Time to First Paracentesis Post-treatment Over Puncture-free Interval at Baseline, Time to first paracentesis post-treatment is calculated as the time between the last dose of Imalumab to subsequent first therapeutic paracentesis., 4 weeks|Change in Ascites Volume Per Unit Time With Treatment, The volume of ascites from the last dose of Imalumab to the first post-treatment paracentesis per unit time will be compared to the volume of the last pre-treatment paracentesis per unit time. At each paracentesis, the volume of fluid that can be removed safely (measured by ultrasound-guided paracentesis) to achieve close to dryness should be withdrawn, measured, and documented., Up to 4 weeks|Changes in Ascites-related Symptoms, Ascites related symptoms: anorexia, nausea, early satiety, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, dyspnea, fatigue, swollen ankles, heartburn, Baseline, weekly during the treatment period, and every 2 weeks during the safety follow-up period, up to approximately 6 months)|Occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Regardless of Causality or Relationship to Study Drug, Throughout the study period of approximately 22 months|Occurrence of Binding and/or Neutralizing Anti-imalumab (BAX69) Antibodies Following Treatment With Imalumab (BAX69), Throughout the study period of approximately 22 months|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Minimum Observed Concentration (Cmin), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Area Under the Concentration vs Time Curve (AUC), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Half-life (t1/2), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Apparent Systemic Clearance (CL), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Imalumab (BAX69) Plasma Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Volume of Distribution (V), Predose; and post-dose at 1.5, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours|Quality of Life (QoL) Measure - European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Questionnaire, QoL will be assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30., Weekly from the baseline visit to the last week of safety follow-up (8 weeks or longer, if additional treatment will be implemented)
