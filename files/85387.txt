68Ga-HSA PET/CT Imaging for Protein-losing Enteropathy
In this project, based on the DTPA-HAS kit, investigators plan to develop a positron nuclide 68Ga labeled DTPA-HSA molecular probe in order to obtain high sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio and high-resolution PET/CT imaging images, aiming to find the specific site of intestinal leakage while diagnosing Protein-Losing Enteropathy (PLE), and analyze the pathological mechanism of intestinal leakage in combination with pathology, so as to provide molecular imaging guidance for the treatment of PLE patients. PLE is a rare gastrointestinal protein-losing syndrome, and the radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-DTPA-HSA (99mTc-human serum albumin) approved by the State Food and Drug Administration has the diagnostic ability of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), but due to the low resolution of SPECT/CT, the image clarity and signal-to-noise ratio need to be improved, it is a classic probe in the last century, unable to meet the existing clinical needs.
Cancer
DRUG: 68Ga-HSA
Standard Uptake Value Value, The standardized uptake value(SUV) of 68Ga-HSA in suspected PLE lesions measured by the PET/CT, 1 year|SUVR, Ratio of the SUV of 68GA-DTPA-HSA in the suspected PLE lesions to the SUV of 68Ga DTPA-HSA in the normal tissues corresponding to the PLE (SUVR), 1 year
This project developed a a new type of nuclide Ga-68 labeled DTPA-HSA probe, and with the inherent advantages of this nuclear medicine department, it has promoted the formulation of the production filing standard of the drug, and obtained the 68Ga-HSA injection that can be used for preclinical research and meets the clinical standards. Clinical research on 68Ga-HSA PET/CT imaging was carried out to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of PLE patients.
