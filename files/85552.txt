Comparable Study of Different Thoracic Radiotherapy Regimens for Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
Most patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who undergo chemotherapy, and prophylactic cranial irradiation, have persistent intrathoracic disease. A Dutch study recently proved that thoracic radiotherapy(TRT), using 30 Gy in 10 fractions of 3 Gy, could improve 2-year overall survival(OS) of this patient group compared with non-TRT group. But intrathoracic progression was still high, either with or without progression elsewhere, occurring in 43.7% in the TRT group. The ideal TRT regimen for ES-SCLC is undefined. Maybe higher dose can provide better local control(LC) and overall survival. In this study, the investigators propose to give an increased dose of TRT to determine whether higher dose will improve 2-year OS, LC and progression-free survival.
Carcinoma, Small Cell|Lung Neoplasms
RADIATION: high-dose TRT|RADIATION: standard-dose TRT
overall survival, The time interval between diagnosis and death, 2 years
progression-free survival, The time interval between diagnosis and disease progression, 2 years|Incidence of tumor recurrence in local or regional area, Number of patients experienceing recurrences in local or regional area divided by number of all enrolled patients, 2 years|Incidence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy induced toxicities assessed by CTCAE v 4.0, Number of patients experienceing any toxicities induced by radiotherapy or chemotherapy divided by number of all enrolled patients, 2 years
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomised phase III study. For patients with ES-SCLC who respond to chemotherapy after four to six cycles of standard chemotherapy (platinum etoposide), 45Gy/15F of thoracic radiotherapy will be used in experimental arm, while 30Gy/10F of thoracic radiotherapy will be used in the control arm. Both survival and toxicity of the two arms will be observed and compared.
