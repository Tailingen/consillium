Low Dose Total Skin Electron Beam Radiation Therapy and Mechlorethamine Hydrochloride Gel in Treating Patients With Mycosis Fungoides
This phase II trial studies how well low dose total skin electron beam radiation therapy and mechlorethamine hydrochloride gel work in treating patients with mycosis fungoides. Total skin electron beam radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays directed at the entire surface of the body to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Mechlorethamine hydrochloride gel may help patients in remission of disease, reduction in disease staging, and enhanced quality of life. Giving total skin electron beam radiation therapy and mechlorethamine hydrochloride gel may work better in treating patients with mycosis fungoides.
Mycosis Fungoides
DRUG: Mechlorethamine Hydrochloride Gel|PROCEDURE: Total Skin Electron Beam Radiation Therapy
Time to progression, Will be evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival curves., Up to week 54
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the time to progression of patients treated with total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) followed by the year-long maintenance mechlorethamine hydrochloride gel (Valchlor) regimen.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the response rate (complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]) of patients treated with total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) followed by the year-long maintenance Valchlor regimen.
