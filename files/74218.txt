Endoscopic Detection of Dysplasia in Crohn 's Disease Patient
Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have an increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). Long duration of CD is the main risk factor. SB dysplasia has been associated with SBA in 20% of cases, always described in diseased sites. The progression to neoplasia and natural history remains unknown but progression of inflammation to dysplasia and then to adenocarcinoma is suspected.

As for surveillance recommendations for colorectal carcinoma in long standing inflammatory colonic disease, endoscopic screening of SB could be proposed in CD patients with risk factors of SBA. No study can be found in literature.

The investigators propose a multicenter exploratory open study on prospective cohort of CD patients with high risk of dysplasia or cancer. The goal is evaluate the rate of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma detected by enteroscopy with biopsies in a high risk CD population
Crohn Disease Located in Jejunum or Ileum
PROCEDURE: enteroscopy
Frequency of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, dysplasia will be described as high or low level Samples will be analysed by 2 different team of anapathologists, 2 months
Success of endoscopic detection, the success will be measured by reaching at least one pathologic area during the endoscopic procedure, 1-3 Months
