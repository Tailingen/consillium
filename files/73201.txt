Hippocampus Avoidance PCI vs PCI
Using Intensity Modulated radiotherapy it is possible to treat the entire brain to standard dosages of whole-brain radiation, while keeping the radiation dose to the hippocampus low. However, a clear relationship between radiation dose and damage to the hippocampal stem cells has not been established yet.

This study is initiated to investigate the early and delayed neurotoxicity of PCI and to assess in a randomised design the benefits and risks of sparing the hippocampus in Small Cell Lung Cancer patients who receive PCI.

neurocognitive decline, Each patient's total recall score recorded at 4 months will be compared to baseline and dichotomized into success (decline less or equal 5 points) or failure (decline more than 5 points). The difference between the groups, in terms of dichotomized decline will be tested by means of the Fisher's exact test. A p-value less than 0.049 will be considered significant. The primary analysis will be based on an intention-to-treat principle., 4 months
safety, Brain metastases Time from randomization to the occurrence of brain metastases will be calculated and depicted in a cumulative incidence plot. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess the value of PCI vs HA-PCI treatment once considering patients dying without distant brain metastases to be censored and once using competing risk analysis considering distant metastases and death as separate events, 2 years
