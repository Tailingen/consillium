Phase I/II Study of Ribavirin Given as Monotherapy in Solid Tumour Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to learn whether oral Ribavirin is safe and effective in treating patients with solid tumour cancers, that have high levels of the protein eIF4E.
Malignant Solid Tumour
DRUG: Ribavirin
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), Average 1.5 years|Phase II: Determine the overall response rate to therapy with ribavirin, Average 1.5 years
Incidence and nature of DLTs, 3 years|Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events, 3 years|Time to and duration of response, defined as the first occurence of documented objective response until the time of recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years|Clinical benefit rate, defined as the overall response rate and stable disease for greater than or equal to 24 weeks, 3 years|Pharmacokinetic parameters of ribavirin determine by total exposure, maximum plasma concentration, etc., 3 years|Correlation between eIF4E activity and response, 3 years|To determine the effect of ribavirin on the activity of eIF4E related pathways through correlative studies, 3 years
This is a dose escalating, open-label, Phase I/II study of single agent oral ribavirin administered daily in solid tumour cancer patients who have failed standard treatments, overexpress eIF4E, and have easily accessible disease for serial biopsies.
