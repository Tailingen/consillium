"neoBREASTIM": Atezolizumab Plus RP1 Oncolytic Immunotherapy in the NeoAdjuvant Setting of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
Neoadjuvant treatment is an important part of the treatment strategy for locally advanced TNBC having established a positive and significant correlation of pathologic Complete Response (pCR) with long-term clinical benefit such as Event-Free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS) as shown via large meta-analysis. Much effort has been made to identify novel agents and new drug combinations that can improve pCR rates in this specific clinical setting, which is the leading rationale to evaluate RP1 oncolytic immunotherapy in combination with Atezolizumab.

Response rate of RCB Score <= 1 at three cycles, Rate of RCB 0-1 after cycle 3 (in patients with no increase in ctDNA after cycle 3), 26 months|Safety and toxicity of the combination Atezolizumab plus RP1 oncolytic immunotherapy, Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (AEs) graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 from the treatment start to the surgery, 60 months|Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), iDFS will be measured using regular follow-up visits, 60 months|Percentage of TILs, The percentage of TILs will be estimated and compared between RCB rates 0-1 versus 2-3, 30 months|Pre-treatment expression of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), Expression of PD-L1 will be estimated and compared between RCB rates 0-1 versus 2-3, 30 months|Correlation between RCB rates and response by Positron Emission Tomography-Scan (PET-CT) or breast MRI, To correlate the response by RCB rates with response by PET-CT or breast MRI will be studied, 60 months|RCB rates and response, To correlate the response by breast MRI with RCB 0-1 rates,, 60 months|Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS), The rate of Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS) will be presented, 30 months|Correlation between RCB rates and radiomics analyses, To correlate the RCB rates with response by radiomics analyses., 30 months
The combination of RP1 plus Atezolizumab, while being expected to result in increased efficacy, is not expected to result in significant additional toxicity, as compared to either agent alone. Capitalizing on the strong prognostic and predictive value of the TIL infiltrate in early-stage TNBC and the capacity of circulating tumor DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (ctDNA) detection to predict response to immunotherapy and NeoAdjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC), neoBREASTIM - a single-arm phase 2 study - will evaluate a novel, biomarker-driven combination of Atezolizumab plus RP1 oncolytic immunotherapy in the neo-adjuvant setting of patients diagnosed with early-stage, TIL-high TNBC.
