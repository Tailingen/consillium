Agnostic Therapy in Rare Solid Tumors
The ANTARES study is a phase II basket trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors.

The study aims to treat rare malignancies with PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10), regardless of the tumor's tissue type or location. Patients who have not responded to standard treatments will be included, and treatment will last for up to 12 months. The study will assess objective response, progression-free survival, and biomarkers such as PD-L1, ctDNA, and microvesicles, in a multicenter collaborative effort to provide innovative therapeutic options for this underrepresented population

Primary Objective, Overall survival (in months) of patients with advanced or metastatic rare malignancies and CPS ≥ 10 following disease progression after prior treatments while receiving the anti-PD1 antibody Nivolumab., 2 years|Primary Endpoint, The primary outcome of the study is the disease control rate (DCR) based on imaging, considering the best response to treatment. A response rate of 5% will be considered non-promising, and a response rate of 25% will be considered promising. The study follows Simon's two-stage design, with type I error (alpha) set at 0.05 and type II error (beta) at 0.10. In the first stage, if at least 1 out of the first 9 participants achieves disease control (stable disease, partial response, or complete response), 16 additional participants will be recruited for the second stage.

The study will be deemed positive if at least 3 out of 25 participants achieve disease control (partial response, complete response, or stable disease). A 10% drop-out rate (3 participants) is anticipated, bringing the maximum total recruitment to 28 participants., 2 years

The ANTARES study is a phase II "basket" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A "basket" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.

Rare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.

In this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.

This multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site
