A Study For Using Radiosurgery On Limited Metastases
The standard therapy in cases such as yours is surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy alone or in combination. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether radiosurgery alone affects your quality and length of life. A second purpose of this study is to determine if the levels of special types of protein (called cytokines) found in the blood are related to your quality of life during your course of treatment and follow-up.
Neoplasms, Metastatic
PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Percentage of Curatively Treated Patients With Progression-free Survival, Curatively treated patients were those with metastatic disease confined to the thorax and or with total metastases limited to five total lesions., 24 months|Percentage of Palliatively Treated Patients With Progression-free Survival, Palliatively treated patients were those with more extensive disease wherein lung metastasis were considered the most life limiting component of their disease., 24 months
Quality of Life and Correlation With Pro-apoptotic, Inflammatory, and Anabolic Cytokine Profiles, Correlation of data from QOL questionnaires and blood markers., 30 months from date of registration.|Analyze Impact of Disease Bulk and Number of Sites Involved., Analysis or response and progression., From the date of radiation therapy treatment to the date of first failure or last follow-up, assessed up to 10 years
In this research study high dose stereotactic body radiation therapy will be directed at the site of metastasis. This treatment will be given once a day, 5 times a week (Monday through Friday) for one to four weeks depending on the location and size of the disease to be treated. Blood for the cytokine tests will be drawn before your therapy starts, weekly during therapy and at the follow-up visits as stated in the next paragraphs. Two to four tablespoons of blood will be removed each time.
