A Study to Determine the Optimal Tolerated Regime and Safety of PEP005 Topical Gel
The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal tolerated regime of PEP005 for the treatment of actinic keratoses of the face or face and scalp.
Actinic Keratoses
DRUG: PEP005
Optimal tolerated regime of PEP005 Topical Gel in patients, when administered as either two day or three day application schedules to a 25 cm2 contiguous AK treatment area on the face or face and scalp
Efficacy at 2 or 3day application PEP005 Topical Gel at the MTD of 0.025% in the Expanded Cohort, and at 2 lower concs of 0.0175% and 0.0125% at either a 2 or 3day application, when applied to 25cm2 AK treatment area on face or face/scalp.
Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer. Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus being researched.
