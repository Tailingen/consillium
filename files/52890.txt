Study of DCC-2812 in Participants With Advanced Genitourinary Cancers
This is a multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary activity of the selective general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) activator DCC-2812 as monotherapy in advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate cancer.
