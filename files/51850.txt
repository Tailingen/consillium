Image-Guided Navigation for High Dose Rate Temporary Interstitial Brachytherapy in the Palliative Management of Previously Treated Tumors of the Spine and Pelvis
The purpose of this study is to see if using a form of imaging during surgery helps the doctors to guide the placement of radiation catheters more accurately.

This method, called "image-guided surgical navigation" may allow the doctors to deliver radiation to the tumor that the patient needs and decrease the amount of radiation delivered to the nearby areas.
Metastatic or Recurrent Lesions in the Spine|Metastatic or Recurrent Lesions in the Pelvis
RADIATION: Ir-192 high dose rate (HDR)
Maximum Radiation Dose, Verify feasibility of HDF treatment of spinal and/or pelvic lesions using catheters placed under image-guided navigational techniques, to provide improved dosimetric coverage of lesions such that Cord/Cauda Dmax of \<8 Gy, 1 year
Number of Grade 3 of Higher Toxicities, For previously irradiated lesions of the spine and/or pelvis, defined as an acceptable level of severe toxicity (both acute and late effects) in the setting of HDR brachytherapy treatment. Severe toxicity will be defined as â‰¥ grade 3 NCI CTCAE v 4.0 toxicity that is at least possibly related to treatment, 1 year
