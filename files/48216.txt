Prospective Identification of Predictive Biomarkers of Trabectedin Efficacy in Non-L Soft-tissue Sarcoma Patients
This is a biology driven, monocentric study, designed to identify biomarkers of activity of trabectedin in patients with advanced non-L soft-tissue sarcoma. The aim of this study is to implement high-throughput profiling technologies to identify predictive biomarkers of trabectedin efficacy through sequential tumor biopsies and blood sample collection in sarcoma patients.

The identification of predictive biomarkers of the clinical benefit of trabectedin is a crucial issue to identify potential responders particularly for non-L sarcomas. Considering that the molecular profile of STS can change over time, an analysis of archival tumor material may not be a reliable method to identify predictive biomarkers of response, and thus high-throughput technologies may be promising to identify STS markers for prediction of response to trabectedin. For study purpose, blood and tumor samples will be obtained for genetic and immunological profiling at baseline, during treatment by trabectedin and at disease progression.
