A Phase 1 Study of LY2874455 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 regimen of study drug that may be safely administered to participants with advanced and or metastatic cancer. The study consists of two parts: a dose escalation and a dose confirmation.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: FGF Receptor|DRUG: Phosphate Binders
Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies : Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD was determined after the evaluation of Part A portion of the trial. Dose escalation proceeded at 1.3 times the preceding cohort once a Grade 3 non-laboratory toxicity or Grade 2 laboratory toxicity was noted in â‰¥ 1 participant until MTD was achieved. Doses up to 24 mg (48 mg/day) were evaluated in Part A. The effects at this dose and at 18 mg (36 mg/day) suggested that a reasonable number of participants might not tolerate LY2874455 for chronic administration at these dose levels because of the constellation of effects observed individually or in combination in participants at these dose levels. Therefore, the dose of 16 mg BID of LY2874455 (total dose 32 mg per day) was selected as the initial dose for Part B. Selection of the dose level was based on the tolerability of this dose and without specific toxicities identified., Baseline Up to 32 Weeks
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are events which were not present at baseline or pre-existing conditions at baseline that worsened in severity following the start of treatment. A summary of other non-serious Adverse Events (AEs), and all Serious Adverse Events (SAE's), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Baseline Up to 60 Weeks|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR), BORR is evaluated using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to \<10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.

Best overall response rate = (unconfirmed CR+ unconfirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population.

Objective response rate = (confirmed CR+ confirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population., BORR: Baseline Up to 60 Weeks ; ORR: Baseline Up to 60 Weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of LY2874455, Maximum observed concentration during a dosing interval., Part A and B: Cycle 1, Day 1, Pre-Dose, 0.5 Hr (H), 1 H, 2 H, 4H,8 H,12 H,24 H; Day 28, Pre-Dose, 0.5 H, 1 H, 2 H, 4 H, 8 H|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration vs Time Curve 0 to Tau ( AUC[0-t]) of LY2874455, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval (e.g., BID) calculated by a combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear-up/log-down method)., Part A and B: Cycle 1, Day 1, Pre-Dose, 0.5 Hr (H), 1 H, 2 H, 4H,8 H,12 H,24 H; Day 28, Pre-Dose, 0.5 H, 1 H, 2 H, 4 H, 8 H
