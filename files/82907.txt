Molecular Profiling for Individualized Treatment Plan for DIPG
This is a single arm multi-center pilot trial within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC). The current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor genomic profiling consisting of whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing as well as predictive modeling.
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)
OTHER: Specialized tumor board recommendation|RADIATION: Standard radiation therapy
To determine OS12 of children with newly diagnosed DIPG that are being treated based on a specialized tumor board recommendation which is based on RNA based expression analysis, WES and predictive modeling., 12 months
The current study will test whether patients gain a clinical benefit from such a treatment approach by comparing overall survival at 12 months (OS12) to historical controls. Newly diagnosed patients will receive an individualized treatment recommendation including up to four FDA approved drugs based on the molecular profile of the patient's tumor as determined by gene expression analysis, Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and predictive modeling, age of the patient and other existing medical conditions. Initial therapy will consist of standard radiation therapy per institutional guidelines followed by molecular based therapy with FDA approved drugs.
