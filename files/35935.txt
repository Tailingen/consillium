ORR (complete response \[CR\] plus partial response \[PR\]), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 To be assigned a best ORR of PR or CR, changes in tumour assessments must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were met., every 6 weeks (up to cycle 4) or 12 weeks (after cycle 4) (every cycle is 3 weeks), up to 6 months in Main treatment period and up to 1 year|Serum Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER-2) Shed Antigen Value, Serum Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) shed antigen values at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) and the last assessments., day 1 of each cycle (every cycle is 3 weeks), Up to approximately 5.5 years
Patients will receive CT-P6 or Herceptin.
