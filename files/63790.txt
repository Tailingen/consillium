BRAF/MEK Inhibition in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (BIRMA)
Trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma after failure of at least two treatment regimens and with BRAFV600E/K Mutation to evaluate the efficacy of the kinase inhibitors Encorafenib (LGX818 in) combination with Binimetinib (MEK162).
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Patients With BRAFV600 E or BRAFV600K Mutation
DRUG: Encorafenib|DRUG: Binimetinib
Response is assessed by quantification of monoclonal protein in serum and urine and by immunofixation of serum and urine, response assessment is performed after each cycle of therapy (28 days)
Correlation of overall survival with cytogenetic characteristics deletion 17p and translocation 4;14, Time from start of therapy until timepoint of death will be measured for all patients up to 30 months.|MEK162 Response will be categorized according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria, response assessment after each cycle of therapy (28 days)|To evaluate the adverse events profile of LGX818/MEK162 in this indication (with respect to all adverse events and serious adverse events), Observation period starts with the first administration of study drug and ends 30 days after the last administration of study drug or upon start of of the subsequent therapy, whatever comes first.
Correlation of response rates and Adverse Events rates with the cytogenetic characteristics deletion 17p and translocation 4;14, 9 months after end of study (final data analysis)|Target inhibition will be analyzed in bone marrow biopsies by detection of BRAF/MEK inhibition using immunochemistry and whole genome sequencing., at day 28 of the first treatment cycle and at time of progression, assessed up to 30 months|Comparative genome sequencing at start of study treatment and at timepoint of progression to investigate the potential mechanism of resistance to combined BRAF/MEK inhibition, start of study treatment and at timepoint of progression, assessed up to 30 months
An open-label, single-arm, multi-centre phase II trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma and with BRAFV600E/K Mutation to evaluate the efficacy of the kinase inhibitors Encorafenib (LGX818 in) combination with Binimetinib (MEK162). The patients must have received at least two prior therapy regimen (at least one immunomodulatory drug and one proteasome inhibitor).

The subjects receive LGX 818 450 mg. p.o. once daily and MEK 162 45 mg p.o. twice daily until disease progression or toxicity requiring discontinuation of treatment. 1 cycle is defined as 28 days.
