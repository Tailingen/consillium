Flatbush FHC Proactive Colorectal Cancer Screening and Navigation
The proposed study is a randomized controlled pilot trial designed to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a proactive screening outreach program on colorectal cancer screening rates on eligible patients in the Flatbush Family Health Center medical practice.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Proactive CRC Screening Outreach|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care
Number of Participants Who Complete Initial Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) at 6 Months, Number of Participants who completed CRC screening via FIT by 6 months past the start of intervention, Up to Month 6|Number of Participants Who Completed Colonoscopy at 6 Months, Number of Participants who underwent colonoscopy by 6 months past the start of intervention, Up to Month 6
Number of Participants With Positive FIT Test Who Complete Colonoscopy at 6 Months, Number of Participants who underwent colonoscopy after a positive FIT result by 6 months past the start of intervention, Up to Month 6
The proposed study is a randomized controlled pilot trial designed to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a proactive screening outreach program on colorectal cancer screening rates on eligible patients in the Flatbush Family Health Center medical practice, which provides free and subsidized health services to underrepresented minorities. The investigators will randomize patients to the proactive screening outreach arm which will include mailed letters providing patients with information regarding their eligibility for and instructions for performing colorectal cancer screening with FIT testing or colonoscopy. Colorectal cancer screening rates via FIT testing or colonoscopy will be compared in the proactive outreach group and the usual care group. The investigators hypothesize that rates of colorectal cancer screening will improve in underserved populations with the implementation of a proactive approach that incorporates a mailed outreach invitation to screen, followed by active assistance to a colonoscopy completion if preferred or indicated.
