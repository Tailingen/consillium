Pilot Study on the Evaluation of Irreversible Electroporation Technique in Infiltrating Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma
The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of irreversible electroporation in the treatment of locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma. This technique would allow to treat the unresectable part of the tumor to make it more accessible for a secondary surgery.
Cholangiocarcinoma|Interventional Imaging
PROCEDURE: Irreversible electroporation
The success rate of the technique, being the realisation of the irreversible electroporation., The study will be considered positive if the success rate is above 90% and the complication rate below or equal to 30%, At Day 0
