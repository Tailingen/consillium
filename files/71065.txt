Optimization of the Core Number and Location for Targeted Prostate Biopsy
This study aims to investigate the effect of core number and location optimization for targeted prostate biopsy on pathological accuracy.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: MRI/Ultrasound Fusion Saturation Biopsy
The significant prostate cancer detection rate with different combinations of core number and location in the targeted saturated biopsy area, When histology results available, at an expected average of 3 days post-biopsy
This is a single-center prospective study. The investigators perform MRI/US image fusion targeted saturation biopsy on prostate lesions with PI-RADS score 4, to investigate the effect of core number and location optimization for targeted prostate biopsy on pathological accuracy.
