Combined Treatment of Sintilimab, Peg-aspargase Plus Anlotinib in NK/T Cell Lymphoma
This study aims to investigate the treatment of previously untreated stage I-II Extranodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma with sintilimab, peg-aspargase and anlotinib, "sandwich" with radiotherapy.

The primary endpoint is the complete response rate (CRR) at the end of the treatment, and the second endpoints are CRR after two cycles of the combined regimen (CRR2), overall response rate (ORR) at the end of the treatment, survival time (OS and PFS) and toxicities.
