Phase 2 Study of VELCADE With Fludarabine in Comparison to Rituximab With Fludarabine in Follicular Lymphoma Patients Previously Treated With Rituximab
This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multicenter Phase 2 study of VELCADE+fludarabine in comparison with rituximab+fludarabine in subjects with relapsed advanced follicular lymphoma. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the 2 treatment arms (55 subjects per arm).
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: fludarabine|DRUG: rituximab|DRUG: VELCADE
Complete Response Rate, The proportion of response-evaluable subjects who achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or complete response unconfirmed (CRu). Disease response and progression were evaluated according to modified International Workshop Response Criteria (IWRC) criteria by radiographic imaging and other procedures as necessary., Up to 8 cycles (1 cycle is 35 days: 280 days)
Overall Response Rate, The proportion of subjects who achieve CR, CRu, or partial response (PR) relative to the response evaluable population. Disease response and progression were evaluated according to the modified IWRC criteria by radiographic imaging and other procedures as necessary., Up to 8 cycles (1 cycle is 35 days: 280 days)
