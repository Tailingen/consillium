Radiolabeled Glass Beads Used for Treating Patients With Primary Liver Cancer When Surgery is Not an Option
Fewer than 15% of hepatoma patients are suitable candidates for surgical removal of their cancer. The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at Oregon Health and Science University to Y-90 treatment to provide these patients access to an alternate therapy. The radioactive beads are placed directly near or into the liver tumor with the intention of destroying the tumor cells.
