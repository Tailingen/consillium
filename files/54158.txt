Combined Elastography and Color Doppler Ultrasonography for Breast Screening With Ultrasound
The investigators hypothesis is that the combined use of elastography and color doppler ultrasonography can increase positive-predictive value of breast screening with ultrasound.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Ultrasonography
Positive predictive value of breast screening with US, Stability for 1 year of follow-up is needed for the confirmation of benign lesions if they do not undergo biopsy., 1 year after enrollment
Sensitivity, Stability for 1 year of follow-up is needed for the confirmation of benign lesions if they do not undergo biopsy., 1 year after enrollment|Specificity, Stability for 1 year of follow-up is needed for the confirmation of benign lesions if they do not undergo biopsy., 1 year after enrollment|Diagnostic accuracy, Stability for 1 year of follow-up is needed for the confirmation of benign lesions if they do not undergo biopsy., 1 year after enrollment
* Asymptomatic women who undergo breast screening with ultrasound and has breast masses of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 or higher will be examined with conventional B-mode US as well as combined elasto-doppler US by breast radiologists.
* The likelihood of malignancy and BI-RADS category of the breast masses are assessed for each dataset of B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US, respectively.
* Reference standard: Biopsy or 1 year of follow-up examination.
* The positive-predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy (assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) are evaluated and compared between B-mode US alone and B-mode US with elasto-doppler US.
