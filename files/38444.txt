A Prospective Trial of an Endoscopic Quality Improvement Project
Randomized prospective multi-site validation study.
Colon Polyps
OTHER: Educational Training
Change in adenoma detection rates., The primary outcome will be the change in adenoma detection rates between baseline and the intervention. Validate the effect of a quality improvement training program on the proportion of patients among whom at least one adenoma is detected, 6 months
GI practice sites that have recently agreed to participate in the GIQuIC program will be randomized on a site-basis, to the EQUIP intervention or control.

Baseline ADR and polyp/surveillance predication accuracy will be collected for approximately 3 months.

Sites randomized to the EQUIP intervention will undergo face-to-face training by a study investigator, followed by active monitoring and feedback.

Control sites will not receive supplemental training and will be monitored by with no feedback. After completion of the study all sites will be offered the intervention (as is standard feedback in GIQuIC ).
