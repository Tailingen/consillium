Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from penile  (and other male genital) cancer in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 2,190.
Deaths: 510.
Risk Factors
Penile cancer is rare in most developed nations, including the United States, where the incidence rate is less than 1 per 100,000 men per year.  Some studies suggest an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and penile cancer.[
2
-
5
]  Observational studies have shown a lower prevalence of penile HPV in men who have been circumcised (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval,  0.16–0.85).[
6
]  Some, but not all, observational studies also suggest that male newborn circumcision is associated with a decreased risk of penile cancer.[
7
,
8
]  According to  published data,  if the relationship is causal, the number needed to treat was about 909 circumcisions to prevent a single case of invasive penile cancer.[
9
]
Treatment Overview
When diagnosed early (
stage 0
,
stage I
, and
stage II
), penile cancer is highly curable. 
Curability decreases sharply for
stage III
and
stage IV
disease.  Because of the rarity of
this cancer in the United States, clinical trials specifically for penile
cancer are infrequent.  Patients with stage III and stage IV cancer are candidates
for phase I and phase II clinical trials testing new drugs, biological therapy, or surgical
techniques to improve local control and distant metastases.
The selection of treatment depends on the following tumor characteristics:[
10
,
11
]
Size.
Location.
Invasiveness.
Stage.
Fluorouracil dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
12
,
13
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
12
-
14
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
15
-
17
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
18
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Cellular Classification of Penile Cancer
Virtually all penile carcinomas are of squamous cell origin and include the following subtypes:
Verrucous carcinoma.[
1
]
Warty carcinoma (verruciform).[
2
]
Basaloid carcinoma.[
3
]
Although they are less common subtypes, warty carcinoma and basaloid carcinoma appear to be more highly associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV), particularly HPV 16, than typical squamous cell carcinoma or verrucous carcinoma of the penis.[
3
-
5
]
Neuroendocrine carcinomas can also be seen.[

Treatment of Stage 0 Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Stage 0 penile cancer is defined by the following TNM classifications:[
1
]
Tis, N0, M0
Ta, N0, M0
Carcinoma
in situ
of the penis is referred to as erythroplasia of Queyrat when it occurs on the glans, and Bowen disease when it occurs on the penile shaft.  These precursor lesions progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma in 5% to 15% of cases.  In case series studies, human papillomavirus DNA has been detected in most of these lesions.[
2
,
3
] With no data from clinical trials in this disease stage, treatment recommendations are largely based on case reports and case series involving limited numbers of patients.
Treatment options:
Surgical excision can result in scarring, deformity, and impaired function.  To minimize these effects, Mohs micrographic surgery, which involves the excision of successive horizontal layers of tissue with microscopic examination of each layer in frozen section, has been used in patients with
in situ
and invasive penile cancers.[

Topical application of fluorouracil cream has been effective in cases of erythroplasia of Queyrat [
6
] and Bowen disease.[

Treatment of Stage I Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Stage I penile cancer is defined by the following TNM classification:[
1
]
T1a, N0, M0
Stage I penile cancer is curable.[
2
]
Treatment options:
For lesions limited to the foreskin, wide local excision with circumcision may
be adequate therapy for control.
For infiltrating tumors of the glans with or without involvement of the
adjacent skin, the choice of therapy is dictated by tumor size, extent of
infiltration, and degree of tumor destruction of normal tissue.  Equivalent
therapeutic options include:
Penile amputation.[
3
]
Radiation  therapy (i.e., external-beam radiation therapy and  brachytherapy).[
4
,
5
]
Microscopically controlled surgery.[
6
]
Nd:YAG laser therapy has offered excellent control/cure with preservation of
cosmetic appearance and sexual function (under clinical evaluation).[
7
,
8
]
Because of the high incidence of microscopic node metastases, elective
adjunctive inguinal dissection of clinically uninvolved (negative) lymph nodes
in conjunction with amputation is often used for patients with poorly
differentiated tumors.  Lymphadenectomy  can carry substantial
morbidity, such as infection, skin necrosis, wound breakdown, chronic edema,
and even a low, but finite, mortality rate.  The impact of prophylactic
lymphadenectomy on survival is not known.  For these reasons, opinions vary on its use.[

Treatment of Stage II Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Stage II penile cancer is defined by the following TNM classifications:[
1
]
T1b, N0, M0
T2, N0, M0
T3, N0, M0
Treatment options:
Stage II penile cancer is most frequently managed by penile amputation for
local control.  Whether the amputation is partial, total, or radical will
depend on the extent and location of the neoplasm.  External-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy with
surgical salvage are alternative approaches.[

Nd:YAG laser therapy has been used to preserve the penis in selected patients
with small lesions (under clinical evaluation).[

Treatment of Stage III Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Stage III penile cancer is defined by the following TNM classifications:[
1
]
T1–3, N1, M0
T1–3, N2, M0
Inguinal adenopathy in patients with penile cancer is common but may be the
result of infection rather than neoplasm.  If palpable enlarged lymph nodes
exist 3 or more weeks after removal of the infected primary lesion and completion of a
course of antibiotic therapy, bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection should
be performed.
In cases of proven regional inguinal lymph node metastasis without evidence of
distant spread, bilateral ilioinguinal dissection is the treatment of
choice.[
2
-
5
]  Because many patients with positive lymph nodes are not
cured, clinical trials may be appropriate.
Treatment options:
Clinically evident regional lymph node metastasis without evidence of
distant spread is an indication for bilateral ilioinguinal lymph node
dissection after penile amputation.[
6
]
Radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative to lymph node
dissection in patients who are not surgical candidates.
Postoperative radiation therapy may decrease incidence of inguinal recurrences.
Clinical trials using radiosensitizers or cytotoxic drugs are appropriate.  A
combination of vincristine, bleomycin, and methotrexate has been effective as
both neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy.[
7
]  Cisplatin (100 mg/m²) as neoadjuvant therapy plus continuous-infusion fluorouracil has also
been effective.[
6
]  Single-agent cisplatin (50 mg/m
2
) was tested in a large trial and was ineffective.[
8
]
Because of the high incidence of microscopic node metastases, adjunctive
inguinal dissection of clinically uninvolved (negative) lymph nodes in
conjunction with amputation is often used for patients with poorly
differentiated tumors. Lymphadenectomy  can carry substantial
morbidity, such as infection, skin necrosis, wound breakdown, chronic edema,
and even a low, but finite, mortality rate.  The impact of prophylactic
lymphadenectomy on survival is not known.  [

Treatment of Stage IV Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Stage IV penile cancer is defined by the following TNM classifications:[
1
]
T4, Any N, M0
Any T, N3, M0
Any T, Any N, M1
No standard treatment  exists that is curative for patients with stage IV penile cancer. 
Therapy is directed at palliation, which may be achieved either with surgery or
radiation therapy.
Treatment options:
Palliative surgery may be considered for control of the local penile lesion
and even for the prevention of the necrosis, infection, and hemorrhage that
can result from neglected regional adenopathy.
Radiation therapy may be palliative for the primary tumor, regional adenopathy,
and bone metastases.
Clinical trials combining chemotherapy with palliative methods of local control
are appropriate. Tested chemotherapeutic drugs with some
efficacy include vincristine, cisplatin, methotrexate, and bleomycin.  The
combination of vincristine, bleomycin, and methotrexate has been effective both
as adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy.[

Treatment of Recurrent Penile Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Patients with locally recurrent disease can be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. 
If the initial treatment of radiation therapy fails,  patients often undergo
penile amputation.  Patients with nodal recurrences not controlled
by local measures are candidates for phase I and phase II clinical trials testing new
biological and chemotherapeutic agents.[
