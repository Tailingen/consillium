Stellate Ganglion Blockade in Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) Positive Patients
This study will establish the safety and efficacy of using stellate ganglion blocks in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 disease.
COVID 19|ARDS
DRUG: Stellate Ganglion Block
Evaluate the Safety of a New Modified Stellate Ganglia Block (SGB) in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a) differences in mean/median values for SGB vs standard of care (SOC) will be assessed at each of the study designated time points for all the continuous biomarker measures - by assessing magnitude of difference and its 95% confidence level and testing differences for statistical significance at each of the time points;, 3 month
Evaluating Stellate Ganglion Block Adverse Events., e) Differences between SGB vs SOC in frequency and time to occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias;, 3 month
The stellate ganglion block (SGB) will be performed in the ICU. Nurse will provide patient monitoring and assistance during the procedure. Standard monitors and advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) resuscitative equipment will be immediately available. A norepinephrine solution will be at bedside to treat potential hypotension associated with SGB. The SGB perineural catheter will be placed using standard sterile technique. Initial perineural bolus injection - clonidine 100 mcg, Decadron sodium phosphate (PF) 5mg, and 0.25% bupivacaine 5 ml is delivered. An ONQ brand perineural infusion 0.2% bupivacaine will be initiated at 2ml/hr for 5 days. Acute pain service will discontinue infusion and remove the catheter after 5 days.
