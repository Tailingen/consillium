First-in-human Study of OT-A201 in Patients With Selected Hematological Malignancies and Solid Tumors
This phase 1 study is aimed at establishing the safety basis of OT-A201 in the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In the dose of escalation part it is to characterize the overall safety and tolerability profile and determine the recommended dose(s) of OT-A201 as monotherapy, and in various combination regimens. Preliminary information about anti-cancer activity will be further explored in the expansion part of the study.
