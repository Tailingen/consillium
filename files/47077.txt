A Correlative Study of Biomarkers of Resistance in Patients With Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Abiraterone
Adrenal androgens are serum biomarkers of interest that may help guide abiraterone acetate treatment, particularly at the time of progression. Biomarkers may also help identify pathways to resistance of abiraterone acetate treatment. The most practical way of approaching this question is to explore surrogate biomarkers of prostate cancer including quantification of pharmacodynamic endocrine biomarkers.
Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)
PSA, PSA nadir samples will be assessed and compared to pre-Abiraterone treatment samples post completion of study, Patients will be followed from Day 1 (date of initiation of Abiraterone treatment) until the date of first documented progression (estimated to be 1 year). PSA will be assessed every 30 days (approximately) until the time of PSA/clinical progression
Goals of this study include:

* Explore which circulating endocrine markers or endocrine related markers have the best potential to predict clinical response to abiraterone acetate in CRPC patients
* Explore the utility of microRNA, circulating DNA and exosome analyses in complementing the previous objective
