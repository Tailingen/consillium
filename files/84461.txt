68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI and 68Ga RM2 PET/MRI for Biopsy Guidance in Patients With Suspected Prostate Cancer
The objective of the study is to evaluate 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI and 68Ga RM2 PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients with suspected prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 68Ga RM2|DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11|DEVICE: Investigational PET scanner coils and software
Number of Participants With Biopsy Results Correlated With PET Based Imaging Findings, Measure of PET based Biopsy Guidance (ie, prostate uptake on 68Ga PSMA 11 and 68Ga RM2 scans)., Up to approximately 2 hours to complete each scan
Primary Objective: To evaluate 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI and 68Ga RM2 PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients with suspected prostate cancer.

Exploratory Objective:

* Correlation of 68Ga PSMA 11 uptake and Gleason score at biopsy
* Correlation of 68Ga RM2 and Gleason score at biopsy
