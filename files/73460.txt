Enzalutamide Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer
This pilot phase 0 trial studies how well enzalutamide works before surgery in treating patients with kidney cancer. Androgens are a type of hormone produced by the body that may cause kidney tumors to grow. Anti-hormone therapy, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens produced by the body and keep kidney tumors from growing.
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma|Stage I Renal Cell Cancer
DRUG: Enzalutamide|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|PROCEDURE: Nephrectomy
Cell proliferation, Up to 36 months|Tumor apoptosis as measured by annexin, Up to 36 months
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4, Post-operative complications will be documented according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification System., Up to 36 months|Tumor size as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 36 months
AR expression measured in pre- and post-treatment tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Pre- and post-treatment ccRCC samples will be used to purify mRNA, construct cDNA, and perform qPCR to quantify expression of mRNA. IHC staining will be performed on ccRCC pre- and post-treatment., Up to 36 months|Genome-wide analysis of post-treatment tissue samples assessed by whole exome and RNA sequencing, Up to 36 months|Intracrine androgen signaling levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone assessed in tissue, Pre- and post-treatment tissue levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone will be compared to their respective serum levels to assess intracrine androgen signaling in ccRCC following enzalutamide treatment., Up to 36 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the effects of neoadjuvant enzalutamide on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) daily for 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo partial or radical nephrectomy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
