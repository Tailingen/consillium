Multiparametric MRI for Assessing Breast Cancer Response to Anti-HER2 Therapy
This is a single institution, observational research study in which patients are observed using DWI/DCE MRI imaging before and after receiving neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DEVICE: MRI|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Determine whether early changes on MRI reflect the level of immune response (based on TILs) in the tumor as measured by histologic assessment after 1 cycle of anti-HER2 treatment, 10 years
This is not a treatment trial. Patients will be treated according to the plan developed by their medical oncologists. Only patients planning to receive anti-HER2 therapy as part of planned systemic therapy will be eligible for this imaging study. Patients and their referring oncologist will be asked to start the anti-HER2 therapy 2-3 weeks prior to surgery and after the pre-therapy MRI.
