Efficacy and Safety of Apalutamide in Combination With 89Sr as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Prostate Cancer With ≤10 Bone Metastases
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apalutamide in combination with 89Sr as neoadjuvant therapy in prostate cancer with ≤10 bone metastases. The primary endpoint is PFS and the second endpoints are pCR, rPFS, PSA response, pain score, number and extent of bone metastases.
Prostate Cancer With ≤10 Bone Metastases
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: 89Sr|DRUG: Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Analog
PFS, progression-free survival, Up to 2 years after radical prostatectomy
pCR, pathological complete response, Up to 1 year|rPFS, radiographic progression-free survival, Up to 3 years|PSA response rate, more than 50% decrease from baseline, Up to 3 years|pain score, Measurement of pain assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The analogous visual scale used for this study measures from 0 to 10 the intensity of pain with a series of "faces" that show the intensity in the pain experimentation with categories such as "No pain" in number 0, mild in number 1-3, moderate in number 4-6, intense in number 7-9 and worst in number 10., Measured at baseline and follow up visits throughout the study, an average of 3 years|number and extent of bone metastases, Bone Scan, Up to 3 years
