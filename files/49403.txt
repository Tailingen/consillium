A Phase I, Autologous ex Vivo Expanded and Activated NK Cell, Magicell-NK, Infusion for Colon Cancer Post Resection Study
This is a Phase I, open-label study to explore the safety profile and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum feasible dose (MFD) of Magicell-NK in subjects diagnosed with stage I or stage IIa colon cancer post resection from a single site in Taiwan.

During this study, 3 dose levels of Magicell-NK will be tested with a 3+3 design to determine the MTD/MFD: Cohort 1, low dose (2×10\^8 cells), Cohort 2, middle dose (6×10\^8 cells), and Cohort 3, high dose (12\~18 ×10\^8 cells).
Colon Cancer Stage I
BIOLOGICAL: Magicell-NK contains NK cells suspended in 100 mL normal saline
Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Number of participants with serious adverse events and treatment emergent adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) to assess tolerability of Magicell-NK treatment. Evaluation of side effects conducted during the study period. A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Up to 60 weeks|Number of Participants With at Least One Dose Limiting Toxicity, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as treatment-related any greater or equal to Grade 4 adverse event of hematologic toxicity, or any greater or equal to Grade 3 adverse event of non-hematologic toxicity during Visit 3\~ visit 10. With the exception of (1) fever grade 3 or grade 4 which is controllable by antihistamine and resolves to grade 2 or less within 48 hours, (2) hypersensitivity reactions occurring within 2 hours of infusion finished (related to cell infusion) that are reversible to a grade 2 or less within 48 hours with standard therapy, (3) grade 3 electrolyte imbalance or dehydration that resolves to grade 1 or less within 48 hours, (4) grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea which is controllable by standard medication that resolves to grade 1 or less within 48 hours, (5) fatigue which resolves to grade 1 or less within 7 days., Within 14-day observation of the first treatment. up to 60 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1/6 of subjects experiences DLT during Visit 3\~10, when at least 6 patients are treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. Dose escalations proceeded according to a standard 3+3 design. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of therapy was determined by monitoring dose-limiting toxicity and adverse events in the dosing cohorts, 3 weeks from start of treatment, up to 60 weeks
Disease free survival (DFS), The time from the date of the first Magicell-NK infusion to the date of the first disease-free survival event (recurrence, second primary colon cancer or death from any cause)., Up to 60 weeks|Changes in Frequency and Duration of ctDNA, Number of participants experiencing ctDNA seroconversion (i.e. ctDNA+ that become ctDNA-) after any Magicell-NK regimen remaining disease free. Change in values will be tabulated descriptively by visit with 95% two-sided confidence interval., Up to 60 weeks|Changes in Frequency and Duration of Circulating Tumor Count (CTC) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Circulating Tumor Count (PD-L1+ CTC) counts, Determine the effect of Magicell-NK on reducing CTC and PD-L1+ CTC of whole blood in colon cancer with elevated baseline CTC count and PD-L1+ CTC to identify the least effective dose that clears CTCs and PD-L1+ CTC. Baseline count of CTC and PD-L1+ CTC will be recorded prior to before Magicell-NK therapy in a whole blood sample. Count of CTC and PD-L1+ CTC will be measured at 1 week (post treatment evaluation visit), and 10-12 weeks (follow up visits) after Magicell-NK therapy in a whole blood sample. These values will be compared., Up to 60 weeks|Changes in Biomarkers (CEA and CA19-9), Determine the effect of Magicell-NK on CEA and CA 19-9 in colon cancer with elevated baseline CEA and CA 19-9 to identify the least effective dose that clears CEA and CA 19-9. Baseline count of CEA and CA 19-9 will be recorded prior to before Magicell-NK therapy. Count of CEA and CA 19-9 will be measured at 1 week (post treatment evaluation visit), and 10-12 weeks (follow up visits) after Magicell-NK therapy. These values will be compared., Up to 60 weeks
