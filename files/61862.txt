Study of CRLX101 (NLG207) in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
CRLX101 is a nanopharmaceutical comprised of the chemotherapeutic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to a linear, cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to increase the exposure of tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects.

OBJECTIVES:

• Determine the safety, toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CRLX101 when administered intravenously to subjects with advanced solid tumors.
