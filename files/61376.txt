Markers of Prognosis and Response to Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Brain Tumors Undergoing Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)
This registry study will evaluate patients with metastatic brain tumors undergoing, or having undergone, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) at Swedish Medical Center. Clinical outcomes will be evaluated at the 3, 6 and 12-month time points. Clinical data, SRS treatment data, and imaging data (including anatomic and advanced imaging sequences obtained prior to and serially following SRS) will be archived in an online informatics platform, specifically a metastatic brain tumor registry known as the Comprehensive Neuro-oncology Data Repository for Metastatic Tumors (CONDR - Mets).
Metastatic Brain Tumor
Quantitative measures of overall tumor volume will be performed for each subject at the time of SRS, At the time of SRS|Quantitative measures of tumor number will be performed for each subject at the time of SRS, At the time of SRS|Overall survival will be measured for each subject (in weeks from SRS to death), Post-SRS
Measures of ADC, rCBV, MTT and ktrans will be performed for each treated tumor at treatment and at 6 months following SRS, 6 months post SRS|Time to progression (in weeks) will be measured for each treated tumor, Post-SRS|Diagnosis of progression or radiation necrosis (made on clinical reflection at study's end) will be determined for tumors where diagnosis is in question at 6 and 12 months after SRS, 12 months post-SRS
