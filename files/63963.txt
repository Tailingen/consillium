A Clinical Study of SHR-A1811 Combined With Chemotherapy for Platinum Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The objective is to evaluate the tolerance, safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of SHR-A1811 combined with carboplatin and bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, and to determine the RP2D of the combination, and preliminarily to evaluate the effectiveness of SHR-A1811 combined regimen in the treatment of platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
