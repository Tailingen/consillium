Study of Sorafenib and Palliative Radiotherapy in Kidney Cancer That Spreads to the Bone
The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a new anti-angiogenic drug called sorafenib, in combination with radiotherapy, for renal cell cancer that has spread to the bone and is causing significant pain. The study will find a safe dose of sorafenib for this combination study treatment, look at side effects, and test if the study treatment is effective in controlling the pain experienced from this type of renal cell cancer. . There will be two parts or phases to this study

The purpose of the first phase is to find the highest dose of sorafenib that can be given safely to patients, when combined with radiotherapy. We will also see what kind of effects the study treatment has on you and your cancer. Participants in this phase will receive a dose of sorafenib that has shown to be well-tolerated in humans. If the side effects are tolerable for this dose of sorafenib when combined with radiotherapy, new patients will be asked to join the study and will receive a dose of sorafenib higher than the last study participant.

In the second phase, new study participants will receive the dose of sorafenib that was determined to be safe in the first phase. Side effects will continue to be looked at and the effectiveness on controlling pain symptoms from this type of cancer, will also be looked at.
