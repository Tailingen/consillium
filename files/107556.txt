Indication to Transplant Patients With High Risk B Cells Lymphoma in Metabolic Complete Remission?
The autograft of patients with prognostically unfavourable B-cells lymphoma cells in first remission remains controversial, in particular since the association of Rituximab with chemotherapy. Even though many randomized and non-randomized studies have been conducted, their is still no standard procedure . Recently, the use of early TEP (positron emission topography) answer, after 2 in 3 cures of chemotherapy allowed to select the poor-responder patients who remain candidate to autograft in front-line. Nevertheless, in good-responder patients, the benefits of an intensification therapy ins term of long-lasting disease control remains discussion.

This institutional retrospective study aims at comparing the outcome of early metabolic responder patients who received an intensification treatment to those who received a standard chemotherapy.
