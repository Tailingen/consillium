Prostate Cancer Survey
There have been calls from patients, payers, healthcare providers, and policy makers for an evaluation of newer, high-cost radiation technologies compared to conventional forms of radiation therapy. National attention has focused on the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) into routine daily clinical practice for prostate cancer. The goal of the present study is to determine whether the type of radiation treatment received by the patients can result in a reduction in patient-relevant side effects following prostate irradiation. The analysis will be performed by obtaining patient answered surveys looking at side effects.
Prostate Cancer
To determine patient preference weights for side effect reduction in radiation treatment of prostate cancer, Investigators will use an anonymous survey and results from multiple focus groups to quantify the relative importance/significance of commonly encountered side effects experienced by patients following external beam radiation therapy. We will complete descriptive statistics as a means of understanding the data obtained by survey responses. Additionally, comparative analyses may be undertaken to evaluate differences between different side effects experienced., 3 years
