Pyridoxine in Preventing Hand-Foot Syndrome Caused by Capecitabine in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: Pyridoxine may help prevent hand-foot syndrome caused by capecitabine in patients with cancer. It is not yet known whether pyridoxine is more effective than a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome in patients with cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying pyridoxine to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome caused by capecitabine in patients with cancer.
Dermatologic Complications|Palmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: pyridoxine hydrochloride|OTHER: Placebo
First incidence of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) ≥ grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE vs 3.0, up to 8 cycles
Time to the onset of HFS ≥ grade 2, days to weeks|Quality of life as measured by EuroQOL (EQ-5D) questionnaire, QOL assessment at baseline, at beginning of cycles 2, 4, 6, 8 and at the end of the study.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the incidence of capecitabine-induced palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome \[HFS\]) ≥ grade 2 in patients with cancer treated with pyridoxine hydrochloride vs placebo.

Secondary

* Compare the time to onset of HFS ≥ grade 2 in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the quality of life changes in patients treated with these regimens.
* Identify factors predicting toxicity from capecitabine chemotherapy.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to gender and treatment setting (adjuvant/neoadjuvant vs palliative setting). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Beginning concurrently with planned capecitabine treatment, patients receive oral pyridoxine hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21.
* Arm II: Beginning concurrently with planned capecitabine treatment, patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-21.

In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses (until discontinuation of capecitabine treatment).

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of courses 2, 4, 6, and 8, and at the end of the study.
