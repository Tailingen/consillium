Primary Chemoradiation VS. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed By Surgery As Treatment Strategy For LAVC
A phase 2 randomised controlled trial will be performed in which the efficacy and safety of standard treatment (primary chemoradiation; consisting of 64.5 Gy in 30 fractions of external beam radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin for six weeks) and experimental treatment (NACT; consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel in a 3-weekly scheme) will be compared in 98 patients with LAVC, registered from eight national medical centres.

Loco-regional control after 24 months per completed treatment including salvage treatment, Proportion of patients free from local-regional progression, 24 months after completed treatment
Disease-related treatment failure, Patients without an event will be censored at their last date of contact. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate freedom from disease-related failure. Difference between the two main treatment arms, NACT vs. chemotherapy, will be tested using a log-rank test. Incidences of disease-related failure will be reported based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, together with confidence intervals for the hazard ratio using both 90 and 95% confidence levels., 24 months after completed treatment|Disease free survival, 24 months after completed treatment|Patterns of recurrence of disease, Type of recurrence after treatment: local, regional or distant recurrence, 24 months after completed treatment|Overall survival, 24 months after completed treatment|Treatment related death, 24 months after completed treatment|Prevention of trimodal treatment, Proportion of patients that don't need adjuvant surgery (arm 1) and number of patients that don't need adjuvant radiotherapy (arm 2), 24 months after completed treatment|Functional organ preservation, Proportion of patients for who an organ-sparing surgery is possible, 24 months after completed treatment|Short term and long term complications, According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, 24 months after completed treatment
