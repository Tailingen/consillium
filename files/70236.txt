Breast Cancer Biomarker Sample Collection for the dtectDx v2 Assay Proof of Concept Protocol
The major purpose of this study is to evaluate a laboratory developed test that measures multiple breast cancer-specific biomarker proteins and multiple antibodies in your blood samples. The biomarker and antibody results along with your personal medical profile will be evaluated to determine your risk for the presence of a malignancy in the breast as compared to your breast evaluation assessment conducted by your physician.
Breast Cancer
Quantitative Protein Algorithmic Score (QPAS), Part I: Establish an acceptable algorithm for the generation of a single numerical score from the combination of the 10 cancer biomarkers that comprise the dtectDx Breast v2.0 Assay Part II: Define a numerical score cutoff that differentiates malignant from nonmalignant breast cancer in this population of woman, Baseline|Modified Quantitative Protein Algorithmic Score (QPAS), Demonstrate proof-of-concept for use of the dtectDx-Breast Assay to assess likelihood of breast cancer malignancy in conjunction with the physicians clinical and radiological evaluations., 6 Months
QPAS relative to BI-RADS, Demonstrate the numerical score, collaborated via proprietary algorithm , for the dtectDx-Breast Assay v2.0 increases the likelihood of malignant breast cancer detection when used adjunctively with the assessment of BI-RADS Categories 3 and 4 compared to the assessment of BI-RADS Categories 3 and 4 alone., Baseline
