Evaluation of a MRI-based Prostate Cancer Screening Program
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effort and resources (incl. costs) required to detect 20 clinically relevant prostate cancer (PCA) in a screening program based on bpMRI of the prostate.

Informed men at risk for prostate cancer will be included into the study to undergo prostate cancer screening. According to European guidelines we will include men \> 50 years of age and men \>45 years of age and a family history of PCA as well as African-Americans \>45 years of age. In this study, bpMRI will be used for opportunistic prostate cancer screening.

The indication for prostate biopsy is based solely on the results of bpMRI. In case of detection of lesions suspicious for prostate cancer ( PIRADS 3), targeted MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy with 3 biopsies per lesion will be performed. In case no lesions suspicious for PCA ( PIRADS 3) are detected, SB will performed if PSA exceeds 10ng/ml and/or DRE is suspicious for PCA.
