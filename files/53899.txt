Intravenous Ascorbic Acid Supplementation in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
Forty years ago clinical studies conducted by Ewan Cameron and Linus Pauling suggested that intravenous (IV) and oral ascorbic acid (AA) may diminish symptoms and could improve survival in terminal cancer patients. Previous phase I and II clinical trials have found that high dose (1.5g/kg ) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients. This is a phase I/II, randomized study of parenteral administration of Ascorbic Acid (AA) as a supplement to the conventional neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.

Number of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Assessments are made through analysis of reported incidence of treatment-emergent Adverse Events. Toxicities (AEs) in both groups will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, during the six months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Quality of life, The symptom checklist and the symptom related measures as defined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (Questionnaire C30 and BR23) will be compared between arms using frequency tables, At baseline and each 28 days during the six months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy|Therapeutic efficacy, Therapeutic efficacy assessed by Pathological response. Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) According to the Residual Cancer Burden score., Approximately 6 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 Guidelines, every 8 weeks, up to 6 months|Effect of AA supplementation on serum inflammatory cytokine, Assessment of laboratory parameters including interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)., At baseline and every 8 weeks during the six months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
