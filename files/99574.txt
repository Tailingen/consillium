Study of DP303c Administered Intravenously to Subjects With HER2-Positive in Advanced Solid Tumors
A phase Ia, multicenter, open and dose-increasing study of DP303c to evaluate the safety , pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and antitumor activity of subjects with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors.
Neoplasms
DRUG: an antibody drug conjugate
Maximal Tolerance Dose (MTD) of Dp303c, The dose level in which \>= 2 out of 6 patients have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the previous dose level., The first treatment cycle 21 days
Maximum concentration (Cmax) of DP303c, The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of DP303c, approximately 2 years|Time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax), The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of DP303c, approximately 2 years|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of DP303c, The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of DP303c, approximately 2 years|Overall response rate (ORR), To preliminarily evaluate ORR in patients with advanced solid tumors., approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), To preliminarily evaluate DoR in patients with advanced solid tumors., approximately 2 years|Immunogenicity (anti-drug antibody ADA), Percentage of subjects producing detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA), approximately 2 years
Dose escalation study: Primary purpose: To investigate the safety and tolerability of DP303c in subjects with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors . Secondary purpose:1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of DP303c;2. To assess the preliminary anti tumor activity of DP303c; 3. To characterize immunogenicity of DP303c.
