Molecular Imaging-based Dose Escalation in HPV Negative Patients With Locally Advanced SCC of the Oropharynx
Phase I study to assess the feasibility (i.e. early toxicity) of Molecular Imaging-based Dose Escalation in HPV Negative Patients With Locally Advanced SCC of the Oropharynx.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: dose escalation
Acute toxicity, up to 3 months following the completion of radiotherapy
Primary tumor control probability, at 1 and 2 years|Late toxicity, at 1 and 2 years|Progression-free survival, at 1 and 2 years|Overall survival, at 1 and 2 years
The objective is to assess the feasibility (i.e. early toxicity) of an adaptive dose escalation through 18F-FDG-PET-based dose painting by numbers in 10 HPV negative patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. Treatment will be delivered with Helical TomotherapyÂ® or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Dose adaptation will be performed at 2 time-points with per-treatment 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans.
