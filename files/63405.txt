The Development and Validation of MRI-AI-based Predictive Models for CsPCa
This study retrospectively included patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy at Peking University First Hospital from January 2019 to December 2023, and prospectively enrolls patients from January 2024 to December 2029. Clinical information such as age, PSA levels, PI-RADS scores, and digital rectal examination findings are collected. A well-performing artificial intelligence model is employed to measure prostate volume, transitional zone volume, and lesion volume using MRI images. Furthermore, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) and transitional zone-based prostate-specific antigen density (TZ-PSAD) are calculated using prostate volume and transitional zone volume. Utilizing the aforementioned data, machine learning predictive models for clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa) are developed and validated.
Prostate Cancer
Biopsy pathology results, The pathology report will include the ISUP grade; if it is greater than or equal to 2, it is considered csPCa (clinically significant prostate cancer), otherwise, it is classified as non-csPCa., 1week after biopsy
