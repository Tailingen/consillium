Hypomemylating Agents Combination With eDC Therapy for Elderly Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to optimize the traditional treatment scheme and explore the cure scheme for the elderly by combining the existing mature treatment technology. The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapy using WT1/hTERT/Survivin-loaded DCs is to determine whether this novel DC vaccination is safe and can significantly prevent clinical relapse and increase survival of MDS patients.

Objective Myelodysplastic syndrome (Myelodysplasticsyndromes,MDS) is a highly age-related malignant clonal disease of the hematological system, which is characterized by pancytopenia and transformation to leukemia. In China, the median age of onset of MDS is 70 years old, and the incidence increases with age. It is the most common malignant tumor in the elderly, which seriously threatens the health and survival of the elderly. The 3-year survival rate of traditional combination chemotherapy or demethylation therapy is less than 20%.
