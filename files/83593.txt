A Study of BIND-014 in Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Cervical Cancer and Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
BIND-014 (docetaxel nanoparticles for injectable suspension) is being studied in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, cervical cancer, cholangiocarcinoma or carcinomas of the biliary tree and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Ferumoxytol imaging will also be investigated at US sites as an exploratory endpoint.
Urothelial Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma|Cervical Cancer|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: BIND-014 (docetaxel nanoparticles for injectable suspension)
To determine the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma), cervical cancer, cholangiocarcinoma or carcinomas of the biliary tree and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck., Patients will be followed for ORR for an expected average of 18 weeks, 18 weeks
Progression Free Survival, Change in tumor size will be assessed using RECIST measurements. RECIST assessments will be carried out at baseline, week 6, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter relative to first dose of study drug, an expected average of 18 weeks.|Overall Survival, Participants will be followed for survival, an expected average 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation|Best Response, Change in tumor size will be assessed using RECIST measurements. RECIST assessments to be carried out at baseline, week 6, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter relative to first dose of study drug, an expected average 18 weeks|Duration of Response, Change in tumor size will be assessed using RECIST measurements. RECIST assessments to be carried out at baseline, week 6, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter relative to first dose of study drug, an expected average 18 weeks|Time to Response, change in tumor size will be assessed using RECIST measurements. RECIST assessments to be carried out at baseline, week 6, week 12 relative to first dose of study drug|Disease Control Rate, Change in tumor size will be assessed using RECIST measurements. RECIST assessments to be carried out at baseline, week 6, week 12 and every 6 weeks thereafter relative to first dose of study drug, an expected average 18 weeks|Safety and Tolerability, as measured by number of participants with adverse events, Measured from first dose of study drug until 30 days after study discontinuation
