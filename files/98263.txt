Tumor Absorbed Dose-Response Relationship in Patients Treated With 177Lu-DOTATATE for Meningioma
The hypothesis for this study is that there is a dose-response relationship in patients treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE for meningiomas.

Dosimetry is essential for Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) of meningiomas, to predict efficacy and dose-effect relationships at the individual level, and to move towards personalized medicine. Due to the increasing therapeutic applications of Lutathera, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) recently issued recommendations on the dosimetry of 177Lu-labeled somatostatin analogues. Nevertheless, despite these recommendations, the evaluation of meningioma tumor dosimetry in Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy studies is not systematic, which has not enabled us to clearly determine the dose delivered to the meningioma lesion in these treatments and the possible dose-response relationship in this type of treatment.
