Immune Inflammation-Related Protein Pomplexes, The change of immune inflammation-related protein complexes, 2 years
100 cases in normal ovarian control group, 100 cases in benign ovarian disease group and 100 cases in malignant ovarian epithelial carcinoma group will be studied. Change regularity of ovarian cancer specific immune inflammation-related protein complexes in blood will be studied.
