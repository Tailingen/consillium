Nab-Paclitaxel Treatment in Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lung
This trial is to study the efficacy of nab-PC vs. GC and evaluate toxicity of nab-PC in advanced squamous cell cancer of lung. The correlation between the efficacy of nab-PC and some biomarkers is also to be evaluated.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Albumin paclitaxel plus carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine plus carboplatin
Overall response rate(ORR), ORR is evaluated after at most 6 cycles of chemotherapy, which may cost 18 weeks., 18weeks
Response duration, progression free survival, overall survival, safety profile, 2 years
Albumin-bound paclitaxel(nab-P) utilizes the albumin binding proteins,such as (gp60)/caveolin-1 (CAV1) and SPARC(secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), achieving high intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation. It is reported that CAV1 is overexpressed in squamous cell cancer(SQC), so it is possible that nab-PC is more highly active than GC in SQC of lung.
