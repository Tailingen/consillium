This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of intermittent hypoxia intervention on patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: Intermittent hypoxia intervention
Incidence of adverse reactions, Adverse reactions included headache, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness and insomnia., During the 7-day treatment
Tumor Markers, Blood tumor markers will be detected by the immunochemiluminescence method., The day before the 7-day treatment ; the day of surgery (1-7days post the treatment)|Tumor Change, Tumor Change will be detected by tumor cell HIF-1α and HIF-2α through immunohistochemistry., The day before the 7-day treatment ; the day of surgery (1-7days post the treatment)|Cytokines, Cytokines will be detected by immune-related cytokines in peripheral blood., The day before the 7-day treatment ; the day of surgery (1-7days post the treatment)|Immune Cell Infiltration, Immune Cell Infiltration will be detected by observation of immune cell infiltration in tumor tissue., The day before the 7-day treatment ; the day of surgery (1-7days post the treatment)|Symptoms, It is evaluated by completing the follow-up form., The day before the 7-day treatment ; the day of surgery after the treatment;7 days after surgery
The hypoxic adaptive response is a form of acquired tolerance that occurs by activating internal cellular protective mechanisms and enhancing immune function.This technology was initially utilized in sports training and high-altitude medicine to enhance strength, endurance, and overall athletic performance, as well as to enhance the body's adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia.

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) refers to periodic hypoxic-normoxic training performed with brief exposure to hypoxia. Previous studies have found that short-term intermittent hypoxia can increase the sensitivity of hypoxia and reduce the severity of acute hypoxia injury, and alleviate acute hypoxia injury by reducing the inflammatory response caused by hypoxia. Intermittent hypoxia has been shown in our team's work to effectively inhibit colorectal cancer tumor progression in mice by enhancing immune cell function. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of IH in patients with colorectal cancer using a non-randomized self-controlled trial.
