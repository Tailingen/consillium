HKT288 in Solid Tumors, Including Epithelial Ovarian Cancer and Renal Cell Carcinoma
A first-in-human study using HKT288 in solid tumors, including epithelial ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: HKT288
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the DLT evaluation period, evaluation period is 21 days|Safety assessed by overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Until 105 days after last dose of study treatment (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|Tolerability as assessed by numbers of dose changes or interruptions, Until last dose of study treatment (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|Safety assessed by severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Until 105 days after last dose of study treatment (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)
Concentration vs. time profiles of total antibody (tAb), On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose). 1 cycle is 21 days, increases to 28 days if there is a dose delay of 7 days for the start of next dose|Objective response rate, every 2 cycles up to Cycle 17 and every 3 cycles thereafter until study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose). Then every 9 weeks until end of disease progression follow-up (up to 12 months)|Duration of response, every 2 cycles up to Cycle 17 and every 3 cycles thereafter until study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose). Then every 9 weeks until end of disease progression follow-up (up to 12 months)|Progression-free survival, every 2 cycles up to Cycle 17 and every 3 cycles thereafter until study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose). Then every 9 weeks until end of disease progression follow-up (up to 12 months)|Disease Control Rate, At 6 months on treatment|Best overall response, every 2 cycles up to Cycle 17 and every 3 cycles thereafter until study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose). Then every 9 weeks until end of disease progression follow-up (up to 12 months)|Presence of anti-HKT288 antibodies., On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|CDH6 expression level, 3 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter (AUC) for HKT288, On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|PK parameter (Cmax) for HKT288, On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|PK parameter (Tmax) for HKT288, On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)|PK parameters (half-life) for HKT288, On treatment up to Cycle 6 Day 1 and at the time of study treatment discontinuation (=average of approximately 6 months after first dose)
