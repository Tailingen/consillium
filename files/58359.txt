Uterine Tourniquet at Open Myomectomy
The aim of study is to compare triple tourniquet vs. single tourniquet to reduce blood loss at open myomectomy.
Myomectomy|Uterine Leiomyoma
PROCEDURE: triple tourniquet|PROCEDURE: Single tourniquet
Estimating blood loss at the end of myomectomy, Surgical blood loss will be estimated by sum of the volume of suction fluid and blood loss quantitated by gravimetric method.

During surgery, if it is possible, irrigation will not be done, surgical sponge and compress will not be used.

* Suction fluid will be measured at the end of operation and volume of irrigation fluid will be subtracted from total suction volume.
* Surgical drapes, sponges and towels will be weighted before and just after surgery. The blood loss will be estimated as differences in gram by weighing when 1ml blood supposed as 1 gr., 15 minutes postoperatifly
The amount of transfusions, Erythrocyte transfusions transfusion will be allowed when haemoglobin dropped below 8 g/dL., 7 Days|A change in hemoglobin, At baseline and 48 hours after surgery|Volume in drains, Drain will be removed when discharge drops below 50 ml/day, 7 days|Anti-Mullerian Hormone levels variation, Anti-Mullerian Hormone levels before and 6 months after surgery, 6 weeks
Peri-operative complications, Including but not limited to fever, pelvic infections, wound infections., 6 weeks postoperatively|Total operation time, 5 minutes post operatively|Tourniquet time, 5 minutes after tourniquet removed
Single tourniquet is applied to uterine isthmus to occlude uterine arteries. Triple tourniquet is applied to both infundibulopelvic ligaments and uterine isthmus.
