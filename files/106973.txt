Evaluation of Late Effects and Natural History of Disease in Patients Treated With Radiotherapy
BACKGROUND

* This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our participants, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB and are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols.
* It also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparate data for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation modifiers,

intraoperative radiotherapy, etc.

OBJECTIVE

-The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the late effects of treatment and the natural history of disease through collection of data from any standard procedures performed as part of follow up care on participants previously treated with radiotherapy.

ELIGIBILITY

-Participants who received radiation therapy.

DESIGN

* This is a natural history protocol in which long-term follow up data will be collected from participants who received radiation therapy.
* It will be made clear to participants in the consent form, that data collected during their follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history of disease processes and long-term effects of treatment.
