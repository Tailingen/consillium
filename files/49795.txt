Identification of Psychosocial Factors Associated With Diagnostic Delay in Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma
The aim of this study was to identify psycho-social factors associated with diagnostic delay in advanced basal cell carcinomas. Thus, the objective is to develop recommendations to better identify CBCa populations at risk, improve earlier their diagnosis and thus their care with an adequate and targeted information.

Skin cancers incidence is constantly increasing as a result of ageing of the population, and is then a critical issue of concern. Among skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma is the most common. Its treatment is mainly based on surgery that has to be done early. Indeed, CBC can lead to progressive destruction of tissues and significant morbidity in advanced stages. In these advanced stages (CBCa), they are no longer accessible to surgery or radiation therapy. The recently developed targeted therapies represent a significant therapeutic progress. To date, there are few data -none in France- concerning the cause of diagnostic delay .

Thus, the main goal of this study will be to evidence the brakes and facilitators who chair the decision-making to consult in patients with a CBCa, by investigating:

* the perception of the target subjects (patients);
* the perception of the healthcare team; We will also conduct a critical meta-synthesis (qualitative meta-analysis) of the literature concerning the diagnostic delay and decision-making in onco-dermatology.

It is a prospective non-Interventional exploratory qualitative study without direct individual benefit
