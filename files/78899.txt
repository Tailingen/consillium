Utility of Intra-operative Image Guidance System for Missing Metastases
Intraoperatively, the surgeon will interrogate the liver with ultrasound. The time spent by the surgeon using the ultrasound is recorded. If all lesions seen on pre-op imaging were found, the patient does not have the Pathfinder Explorer system applied. If one or more lesions cannot be found, then the Pathfinder Explorer system is calibrated and a tracking device is attached to the ultrasound probe, which the surgeon will use to reattempt localization of the missing tumor. The Pathfinder Explorer system operates in real-time in conjunction with the ultrasound.
