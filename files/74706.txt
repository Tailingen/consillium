A Phase I, Open-label Study of Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion (ADME) of \[14C\]IMP4297 Following a Single Oral Dose to China Healthy Male Subjects
Solid Tumor
DRUG: 14C-IMP4297
Cmax (Maximum concentration), peak concentration, 3 months|Tmax, Time to peak, 3 months|AUC0-inf (Area under the curve from time 0 to infinity), area under the curve from time zero to infinity, 3 months|AUC0-last (Area under the curve from time 0 to the last time with quantifiable concentration), AUC0-last area under the curve from time zero to the time with the last quantifiable concentration, 3 months|t½ (Elimination half-life), elimination half-life, 3 months|CL/F (Apparent clearance), apparent clearance, 3 months|Vz/F (apparent volume of distribution ), apparent volume of distribution, 3 months|urine and fecal samples for quantification analysis, Assessment of recovery percent in urine and feces by liquid chromatography-radiochemical-detection。 Get Percent (%) of each radiolabeled drug-related material will be determined in urine and feces, 3 months|After oral administration of [14C] IMP4297 in healthy volunteers, radioactive metabolite spectrogram are obtained to identify the main metabolites and clarify the main biotransformation pathways., Proportion of different metabolites，Assessment of metabolites (metabolites identification and main metabolites) in plasma/urine/faeces by liquid chromatography-radiochemical-detection, 3 months
Study design A Phase I, single-center, open-label, single arm study is designed to evaluate Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion (ADME) of \[14C\]IMP4297 Following a Single Oral Dose to China Healthy Male Subjects.

6-8 subjects are planned to be enrolled (at least 6 subjects complete the study)
