A Study of Multiple Therapies in Biomarker-Selected Patients With Resectable Stages IB-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of various therapies in patients with Stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, or selected IIIB resectable and untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors that meet protocol-specified biomarker criteria
