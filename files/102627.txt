TIL Cells for the Treatment of the Advanced Solid Tumors Patients
This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) therapy in patients with Advanced malignant solid tumors. TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies, and after ex vivo stimulation, activation and extensive expansion, are reinfused to patients after non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen.

Dose Limiting Toxicity, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as patients with the adverse event (AE) or laboratory abnormality recognized by Investigators, and should be possibly related to TILs therapy., up to Day 28|Adverse Event, The severity and incidence of various adverse events and serious adverse events, up to 24 months
Overall response rate(ORR), up to 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), up to 24 months
This is a single-center, open-label, Phase I clinical study of TILs for the treatment of the recurrent/metastatic solid tumors patients who had failed standard therapy.

TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies, and after ex vivo stimulation, activation and extensive expansion, are reinfused to patients after non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TILs in patients with recurrent/metastatic solid tumors.

The second purpose of this study is to preliminarily explore the effectiveness of TILs in patients with recurrent/metastatic solid tumors.

Eligibility:

Adults aging 18-75 who were failed to standard treatment or have no standard treatment with recurrent/metastatic solid tumors.
