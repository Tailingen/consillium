Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Refractory Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors
An open-label, non-comparative study conducted to investigate the activity and safety of imatinib mesylate in refractory desmoplastic small round cell tumors expressing PDGF-R. Patients will be treated up to 12 months, or to disease progression. Tumor will be evaluated according to Recist criteria
Refractory Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors
DRUG: Imatinib mesilate
Overall tumor response rates, An imaging technique (CT scan or MRI) determined tumor response according to RECIST criteria., Assessed every 3 months
Explore how Imatinib cooperated with other treatment modatilities, Recorded survival after treatment and other associated treatment modalities., Survival data was collected until death|Safety and tolerability, Safety data collected until patients were no longer in study|Conversion rate to surgical resectability, Assessed actual resectability rate after therapy compared to resectability before therapy., After best tumor response.|Mutational analysis of molecular targets of imatinib (at any time during the study), At any time during the study
