Side Effects Screening and Early Intervention to Impact in Quality of Life of Gynaecological Cancer Patients
The goal of this randomized study is to assess the impact on self-perceived quality of life (QoL) of systematic screening and early treatment of aftereffects in patients with gynaecological cancers. The main question it aims to answer is if systematic screening with validated questionaries (see in detailed description), diagnosis and early treatment of lower-limb lymphoedema, anxiety-depression, sexual dysfunction and sarcopenia-malnutrition all have a positive impact on the self-perceived QoL by gynaecological cancer patients. Participants will access the screening questionnaires and QoL questionaries on a free online app on their mobile devices. In the experimental group, in case of positive screening, patients will be referred to specialised care to early treatment of the aftereffects. Researchers will compare this group with standard usual care (opportunistic treatment) to see if systematic screening and early treatment lead to a better QoL.
