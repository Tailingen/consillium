Cohort Evaluation of Body Fluids Early Detection of Cancer in High-risk Individuals
LEAH is a prospective, observational, single-centre, non-randomised, open-label study of people at increased risk of cancer or malignant disease.

The main objective of LEAH is to evaluate and compare the sensitivity of different tests on body fluids to detect cancers that will occur within 3 years of inclusion in the study, in a cohort of individuals identified as being at increased risk of cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: biological samples
sensitivity of techniques derived from body fluids in the detection of any invasive cancer, The primary endpoint is the sensitivity of body fluid-derived techniques in the detection of any invasive cancer (except for non-melanoma skin cancers) in the 36 months period following body fluid collection among individuals at increased risk of cancer., baseline and In case of cancer within 3 years
Evaluation of the 3-year early detection performance of techniques derived from body fluids, for different evaluation criteria: \< stage 2 cancer, any invasive cancer (SO.1, SO.2 and SO.3). These performances will be evaluated in individuals at increased risk of cancer and in subgroups of individuals with several cancer-specific risk situations, using standard performance indices (sensitivity, specificity, precision, negative/positive predictive value, accuracy, etc.) corrected for censoring., baseline and In case of cancer within 3 years|Evaluation in terms of predicting the risk of developing invasive cancer of the added value at 3 years of body fluid-derived techniques and their various combinations compared with standard baseline factors, baseline and In case of cancer within 3 years|Assessment of the ability of body fluid-derived techniques to identify the tissue of origin by agreement between the location predicted by the body fluid-derived techniques and the tissue of origin., baseline and In case of cancer within 3 years
