Clomiphene Citrate (CC) Co-treatment With HP Urinary FSH vs HP Urinary FSH in CC-resistant PCOS
To test whether adding small doses of HP urinary FSH to standard regimen of clomiphene citrate in clomiphene resistant PCOS well yield better results in terms of better ovulation rate,lower follicle number, less consumption of HP urinary FSH,lower treatment cost , better pregnancy rate, lower multiple pregnancy rates compared with the exclusive use of HP urinary FSH in these cases.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Step-up HP u FSH|DRUG: Clomiphine citrate plus low dose uFSH
ovulation rate, IF CC Co-treatment with low dose step-up HP urinary(u)FSH results in similar or higher ovulation rate compared with step-up low dose HP uFSH, 6 months
Live birth rate, % of of cases that result in live birth \> 20 weeks pregnancy, 6 months|number of follicles sized 16 mm or more mean diameter in both ovaries at the time of hCG, To test if CC-co treatment with low dose HP uFSH results in lower number of follicles 16 mm mean diameter or more at time of triggerring ovulation compared with low dose HP uFSH, 3 months|Endometrial thickness, Measuring endometrial thickness in mm in both study arms at the time of ovulation trigerring to see if there is difference, 3 months|serum Estradiol(E2), serum level of E2 is measured in both groups at the time of ovulation triggerring to test for differences, 3 months|incidence of multiple pregnancy, To test if CC-co treatment with low dose HP uFSH results in lower or higher incidence of multiple pregnancies compared with low dose HP uFSH, 3 months|costs per cycle, costs of drugs used to induce ovulation in each arm of the study in Egyptian pounds The cost of HP uFSH per cycle was calculated by multiplying the cost of a single IU with the mean number of FSH IU used per cycle. Add to this the cost of clomiphene citrate in the relevant arm, 3 months|cost effectiveness ratio, The cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated multiplying the cost per cycle by the total number of cycles performed in each arm then dividing the result for the number of clinical pregnancies obtained in the arm during the trial., 6 months|clinical and biochemical predictors of response to treatment, 6 weeks
To test whether CC co- treatment with chronic low dose HP uFSH vs chronic low dose HP uFSH in CC resistant PCOS will yield better results in terms of ,ovulation rate, lower follicle number,lower HP uFSH dose ,better outcome in terms of pregnancy rates, better cost-effectiveness ratio, lower multiple pregnancy rates,lower cycle cancellation.
