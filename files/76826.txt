A Study To Assess The Safety Of Administering CP-675,206 As A One Hour Infusion In Patients With Surgically Incurable Advanced Melanoma
This will show if CP-675,206 can be administered safely as an intravenous infusion lasting one hour. CP 675,206 already has been administered to 835 subjects over 1.0 - 7.5 hours.
Melanoma
DRUG: CP-675,206
To assess safety and tolerability during and for 1 hour following a 15 mg/kg dose of CP 675,206 administered as a one hour infusion., Last patient dosed = 31Dec2009
To monitor for human anti human (HAHA) response to CP 675,206, Last HAHA time point obtain =estimated 31Dec2009|To assess evidence of anti tumor activity as measured by best overall response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, duration of response, progression free survival, Last RECIST obtained = estimated 31Dec2009|To identify potential relationships between polymorphisms in the Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), Fcgamma receptor IIa (FcgRIIa), IgG2a genes with safety and/or immune response of subjects treated with CP 675,206, Last PG obtained = estimated 31Dec2009|To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of CP 675,206 in this population, Last patient dosed = estimated 31Dec2009|To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CP 675,206 following a one hour infusion, Last PK timepoint obtained =estiamted 31Dec2009
This study was prematurely discontinued on April 28, 2008 because a concomitant Phase 3 study met pre-specified futility criteria. The decision to close enrollment early was not based on any safety concerns.
