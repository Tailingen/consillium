High-Dose 3F8/GM-CSF Immunotherapy Plus 13-Cis-Retinoic Acid for Consolidation of First Remission After Myeloablative Therapy and Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to see if high-dose 3F8 combined with GM-CSF is better than standard dose 3F8 in treating neuroblastoma. Another purpose of the study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, 3F8 has on cancer. The investigators also want to see if the antibody works against a very small amount of neuroblastoma (minimal residual disease) that is left in the bone marrow.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: 3F8 monoclonal antibody and 13-cis-Retinoic Acid
Assess the Impact of High-dose 3F8/GM-CSF on Relapse-free Survival, in patients who are post-stem-cell transplantation and in first complete or very good partial remission, but at high risk of relapse., 2 years
Apply Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR to Test the Hypothesis That the Minimal Residual Disease Content of Bone Marrow, after the first treatments with 3F8/GMCSF has significant prognostic impact on relapse-free survival., 2 years|Monitor Safety of the High-dose Antibody Treatment, to assure no side-effects or noxious sequelae develop or emerge that were not seen in the prior phase I study., 2 years
