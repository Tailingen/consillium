Feasibility of Cryobiopsy from the Bile Duct - CRYLEO
This is a multi-center, prospective, feasibility study using a 1.1 mm flexible cryoprobe SU via percutaneous access in the bile duct. The device has a CE-approval. First feasibility and safety for application assessed in the bile duct performed ex vivo and in a patient case report study. The study will take place at 5 different sites in Germany. Recruitment is competitive. In total, 15 patients will be enrolled. Patients are screened for study inclusion at the participating hospitals.

Primary objective:

• Feasibility of percutaneous cryobiopsy in the bile duct

Secondary objectives:

* Size of biopsy (mean area (in mm2) of each biopsy technique)
* Percentage of successful retrievals of biopsies by each biopsy technique
* Representativeness of each biopsy sample
* Quality of each biopsy sample
* Grade of crash artifacts occurrence defined as crush artifact area per biopsy
* Rate of safety-relevant aspects, like for example bleeding, post-bleeding, perforation, infection and abscess
