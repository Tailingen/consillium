Neoadjuvant Study Chemotherapy vs Letrozole + Abemaciclib in HR+/HER2- High/Intermediate Risk Breast Cancer Patients
Phase II, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter study to compare efficacy of standard chemotherapy vs. letrozole plus abemaciclib as neoadjuvant therapy in HR-positive/HER2-negative high/intermediate risk breast cancer patients
Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Taxane|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: LHRH Analogue
Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 0-I rate, Evaluation of the number of patients with a Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 0-I index as a measure of efficacy. RCB is a continuous variable derived from the primary tumor dimensions, cellularity of the tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. It is estimated from routine pathological sections of the primary breast tumor site and the regional lymph nodes after the completion of Neoadjuvant therapy. The pathological variables include bidimensional diameters of the primary tumor bed, the proportion of primary tumor area containing invasive carcinoma, the number of positive lymph nodes, and the diameter of the largest nodal metastasis, 24 weeks
Changes in Ki67 index value, The percentage of decrease in the geometric mean of Ki67 index value after 2 weeks of treatment in both treatments arms.

Number of patients with cell cycle arrest (Ki67 \< 2.7%) after 2 weeks of treatment in both treatment arms., 2 weeks|RCB 0+I versus RCB-II versus RCB-III, RCB is classified in four classes based on the residual disease (RD):

* RCB-0 defined as pathological complete response.
* RCB-I defined as minimal RD.
* RCB-II defined as moderate RD.
* RCB-III defined as extensive RD., 24 weeks|Rate of Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score 0 at surgery in both treatment arms, PEPI requires pathological stage (tumor size and nodal status), level of Ki67 protein, and Allred ER score measured on the surgical specimen. PEPI score 0 includes pT1 or pT2, pN0, Ki67 ≤ 2.7%, Allred score \> 2, 24 weeks|Clinical response measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), According to RECIST v1.1 in both treatment arms. Clinical Response Rate (CRR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete or partial radiographic response. Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) definitions are assessed by MRI at baseline and prior to breast surgery, with or without regional lymph nodes surgery, and categorized according to percent reduction in tumor size., 24 weeks|Rate of breast conservative surgery (BCS) in both treatment arms., Rate of breast conservative surgery (BCS): defined as the proportion of patients who achieved breast-conserving surgery between both treatment arms., 24 weeks|iEFS (invasive Event Free Survival) in both treatment arms., Invasive event free survival (iEFS): defined as time from randomization to progressive disease or invasive disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, or contralateral), or death from any cause. Invasive disease recurrence is defined as:

* Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (including second primary invasive breast cancer): an invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion.
* Ipsilateral regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer in the axilla, other regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast).
* Distant recurrence (i.e., evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site outside local and/or regional location and that has been either histologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer)
* Contralateral invasive breast cancer
* Second primary invasive cancer of non-breast origin., Up to 10 years|Number of patients with adverse events, Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry). Adverse Events (AEs) grade will be defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. AEs terms will be coded according to MedDRA dictionary., 24 weeks|To assess molecular downstaging for high risk genomic groups defined by a multigene expression panel., Gene expression data provided by a multigene expression panel in sequential tumor biopsies., 24 weeks
This is an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study in the neoadjuvant setting.

Approximately 200 premenopausal and postmenopausal women with Hormone Receptor (HR)-positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative Breast Cancer (BC) of intermediate/high risk determined by Ki67 index ≥ 20% on untreated breast tissue and centrally assessed, with indication of neoadjuvant treatment, will be included. Patients with Early Breast Cancer (EBC) on stages II-III (tumor size (T) \> 2cm - T3, T4b, and lymph node involvement (N) N0-2) according to the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification. The subgroup with tumors T2 N0 will include high risk patients based on Ki67 index \> 30% or Ki67 index between 20% and 30% and Progesterone Receptor (PgR) negative and/or histological grade 3.

Patients will be stratified according to the disease stage (II vs. III), menopausal status (premenopausal vs. postmenopausal) and Ki67 index (Ki67 \< 30% vs. Ki67 ≥ 30%).

Once the screening process (locally at site and at the central laboratory) is completed, fully eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the control arm with standard Chemotherapy (CT) based on anthracyclines and taxanes or to the experimental arm with letrozole + abemaciclib.

All patients will be treated according to the stipulations below, unless any of the following occur: unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, or withdrawal of informed consent, whatever occurs first.

After the last dose of any of the drugs in the neoadjuvant combinations, in both treatment arms definitive surgery will be performed. For Arm A not earlier than 21 days and not later than 42 days after the last dose of chemotherapy, and for Arm B within 7 days from the last dose of abemaciclib and/or letrozole, unless toxicities are not recovered completely in any treatment arm.
