Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression and Identification of Progenitor Cells in Lung Carcinoma
This study will help us understand the gene expression profiles of lung cancer. We will identify genes related to lung cancer development, their growth and metastasis to the lung. In addition, we will examine the role nicotine in the development and progression of lung tumors of smokers, ex-smokers, non-smokers on supplemental nicotine and non smokers with no exposure to nicotine.
