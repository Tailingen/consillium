Phase 1 Safety Study of ACT-PFK-158, 2HCl in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
ACT-PFK-158 is a novel anti-cancer agent that inhibits glucose uptake in cancer cells. The primary objective of the study will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to describe any dose limiting toxicity. The secondary objectives of the study will be to determine the safety profile of the drug, to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, to identify any anti-tumor activity, and to determine the pharmacodynamic profile of ACT-PFK-158.
