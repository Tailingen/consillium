Internal Radiation Therapy With or Without External-Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of internal radiation therapy when given with or without external-beam radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with localized prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: brachytherapy|RADIATION: hypofractionated radiation therapy|RADIATION: image-guided radiation therapy|RADIATION: intensity-modulated radiation therapy
Treatment Tolerance (Genitourinary [GU] or Gastrointestinal [GI] Adverse Events), Separately evaluate the tolerance of 2 radiotherapeutic regimens (HDR alone and HDR followed by hypofractionated EBRT) using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). The specific adverse events (AEs) are early (i.e., within 270 days of treatment completion) grade \>3 genitourinary (GU) and/or gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, late grade 2 GU and GI AEs, and late grade ≥3 GU and GI AEs., From baseline to 3 years after registration
Association Between Dose-volume Limitations for Organs at Risk and Rate and Severity of GU or GI Adverse Events, Dose-volume limitations for organs at risk will be analyzed byassociating GU or GI AEs (both rate and severity) with dosimetric parameters using simple correlational methods. These parameters will include (1) bladder V80, V60, V50, and Dmax; (2) penile bulb median dose; (3) rectum V80, V60, V50 and Dmax; and (4) urethra V120, V110, V100, and Dmax., From baseline to 5 years after registration|Patient Preference for a Second Treatment (a Second High Dose-rate Brachytherapy Session or an External Beam Radiotherapy Session), Patient preference for second treatment (group 1 or group 2) will be assessed using a Treatment Preference Questionnaire (Appendix IX) developed specifically for this study. Qualitative and quantitative analyses will be performed on patient responses to the questions posed after choosing their second treatment in an exploratory fashion., From baseline until the end of the first treatment|Changes in Health-related Quality of Life Scores, A pretest-posttest design will be employed to detect changes in HRQOL scores over time. The HRQOL scores will be calculated per assessment, as appropriate. Each construct will be standardized to a range of 0-100 so that comparison across constructs is facilitated. Sets of difference scores will be computed: 1) differences between baseline and treatment completion (at 1 month post treatment follow up), and 2) differences between treatment completion and all post-treatment follow-up examinations for up to five years after finishing the protocol treatment (see Section 4.1 for specific HRQOL instruments to be completed at follow-up visits). The first analysis will allow for determination of the short-term impact of treatment on HRQOL, while the second will investigate the long-term treatment effect. Student's t-test methodology will be applied to the differences at end of treatment (1 month post treatment follow up) and at each follow-up., From baseline to 5 years after registration|Freedom From Biochemical and Clinical Failure, Freedom from biochemical and clinical failure, will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier procedures. Estimates will be drawn from the Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of freedom from biochemical and clinical failure., From baseline to 5 years after registration|Freedom From Salvage Androgen Suppression Treatment, Estimates will be drawn from the Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of freedom from salvage androgen suppression therapy., From baseline to 5 years after registration
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the tolerability of 2 radiotherapeutic regimens (high dose-rate brachytherapy \[HDR\] with or without image-guided intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy \[EBRT\]), as measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0), in patients with localized prostate cancer.

Secondary

* Identify any associations between dose-volume parameters for organs at risk and the rate and severity of genitourinary or gastrointestinal adverse events.
* Evaluate patient preference with regard to selection of a second treatment (a second HDR brachytherapy session or an EBRT session).
* Evaluate patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by validated HRQOL instruments for 5 years.
* Describe the probability of freedom from biochemical and clinical failure.
* Describe the probability of freedom from salvage androgen suppression.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart). Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of the first HDR brachytherapy session, patients undergo either a second session of HDR brachytherapy (2 fractions ≥ 5 hours apart) OR image-guided intensity-modulated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to the second treatment session, at 1 and 6 months after completion of treatment, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2 years.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 6 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2 years.
