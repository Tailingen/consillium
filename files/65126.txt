Erlotinib or Placebo Following Chemoradiotherapy (Chemo/RT) in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a national, randomized, web-based, double-blind study to determine whether erlotinib (Tarceva) compared to placebo improves progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with inoperable, stage III NSCLC following concurrent docetaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy. We hypothesize that the introduction of this orally active, well-tolerated agent following concurrent chemoradiation and prior to the emergence of drug resistance will prolong the progression-free survival by 40% (10 months â†’ 14 months).

Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as time from randomization until documented disease progression or death from any cause. The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.0) was used to determine disease progression. Irradiated target lesions were considered non-measurable disease. Symptomatic radiographic changes of irradiated non-measurable disease required pathologically confirmation or positive FDG-PET scan 6 months following completion of concurrent chemoradiation to be considered locoregional disease progression. Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression was considered distant disease progression., 5 years

The promising activity of erlotinib as a single agent in advanced refractory NSCLC along with its oral administration and favorable adverse event profile makes this agent an excellent candidate to incorporate into combined modality therapy in the early stages of lung cancer. Based on these data, erlotinib is an attractive novel approach to maintenance therapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC following completion of concomitant chemoradiation. Although, a subset of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC will be long-term survivors following chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy, the vast majority relapse within the first year following therapy and eventually die from chemotherapy refractory disease. We hypothesize that the introduction of an potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the epidermal growth factor receptor following effective concomitant chemoradiotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin will prolong the progression-free survival time for these patients.
