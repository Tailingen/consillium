A Study to Evaluate Inetetamab + Pyrotinib + Chemotherapy in Previously Untreated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Studies H0648g and M77001 confirmed that the combination of trastuzumab with taxanes significantly improved TTP and OS, establishing the status of trastuzumab combined with taxanes as first-line standard therapy.The CLEOPATRA and PUFFIN studies confirmed that trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab achieved PFS of 18.7 and 16.5 months, respectively, and became today 's first-line standard regimen for advanced HER2 + breast cancer. Pyrotinib acts on the intracellular segment of HER2 receptor and can inhibit tumor cell growth by covalently binding to the ATP binding site in the intracellular tyrosine kinase region and blocking the activation of downstream signaling pathways. The mechanism of action of the macromolecular drug trastuzumab combined with the small molecular drug pyrotinib dual-target in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer is complementary and has a synergistic anti-tumor effect. In 2022, the ESMO conference reported the results of a phase III trial of pyrotinib combined with trastuzumab combined with docetaxel in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer with an LBA, with the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS.The results showed a significant 59% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with 10.4 months in the trastuzumab plus docetaxel arm and 24.3 months in the pyrotinib arm.

Inetetamab is a monoclonal antibody against the IV domain of the HER2 receptor with the same Fab segment as trastuzumab and different amino acid sequences from trastuzumab at positions 359 and 361 of the Fc segment heavy chain constant region, Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) was 1.11-fold higher than trastuzumab. PFS reached 11.1 months in the first-line subgroup analysis of the Phase III registration study of Inetetamab (HOPES study), which was similar to historical data from trastuzumab first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with comparable safety. The results of this study contribute to further understanding the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment with Inetetamab Combined with Pyrotinib and Chemotherapy in HER2-positive recurrent/metastatic breast cancer patients.
HER2-positive Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Inetetamab, pyrotinib, chemotherapy
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from first dose to first documented radiographical progressive disease (PD) using RECIST version 1.1, or death from any cause , whichever occurred first., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks from randomization to radiographical PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first，up to the primary completion date (up to 2 years)
Overall response rate (ORR), An objective response was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined by investigator using RECIST v1.1 on two consecutive occasions ≥4 weeks apart, Tumor assessments every 6 weeks from Baseline until radiographical progressive disease (PD), death (whichever occurred first), up to the primary completion date (up to 2 years)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease（SD）\>6 months determined by investigator using RECIST v1.1 on two consecutive occasions ≥4 weeks apart., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks from Baseline until radiographical progressive disease (PD), death (whichever occurred first), up to the primary completion date (up to 2 years)|Number of Adverse Events using NCI CTCAE 5.0 [Safety and Tolerability], Number of Adverse Events using NCI CTCAE 5.0, From signing the informed consent to 30 days after last dose
This Prospective, multicenter study will include 63 patients with first-line patients with HER2-positive recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. After providing written informed consent, patients receiving Inetetamab in combination with pyrotinib and investigator 's choice chemotherapy. The effectiveness of the combined treatment will be evaluated by MRI every two treatment cycles. If the disease progresses, the participant will withdraw from the trial.
