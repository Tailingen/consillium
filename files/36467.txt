An Open, Uncontrolled Study of GK567 in the Deodorization of Malodorous Fungating Neoplastic Tumours
This clinical trial objective is to investigate the safety and efficacy of GK567 to alleviate malodour of foul smelling, anaerobically infected fungating neoplastic tumours, over 14 days of treatment.

The clinical hypothesis is that the success rate is no worse than 70% in the population of interest, where success for a patient is defined as a smell score of 0 or 1 at Day 14/end of treatment, as assessed by the Study Investigator.
Malodorous Infected Cutaneous Ulcer
DRUG: GK567
The Success Rate, The success rate, where success for a patient is defined as a smell score of 0 or 1 (0: No smell, 1: Smell present but not offensive) as assessed by the Study Investigator, at Day 14 (end of treatment)
Smell Score by Investigator, Tumour smell score was evaluated by the Study Investigator using the following scale; 0: No smell, 1: Smell present but not offensive, 2: Mildly offensive smell, 3: Moderately offensive smell, 4: Extremely offensive smell, on Days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14|Smell Score by Nurse, Tumour smell score was evaluated by the Nurse using the following scale; 0: No smell, 1: Smell present but not offensive, 2: Mildly offensive smell,3: Moderately offensive smell, 4: Extremely offensive smell, on Days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14|Smell Score by Patient, Tumour smell score was evaluated by the Patient using the following scale; 0: No smell, 1: Smell present but not offensive, 2: Mildly offensive smell,3: Moderately offensive smell, 4: Extremely offensive smell, on Days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14|Appearance (Volume and Nature of Discharge at Cutaneous Ulcer), Appearance score was evaluated by the Study Investigator using the following scale; 0: None (No discharge, e.g. frequency of dressing change: once daily), 1: Mild (Dressing need to be Changed twice daily), 2: Moderate (Dressing need to be Changed 3 times daily), 3: Marked (Dressing need to be Changed \>3 times daily / Bloody)., on Days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14|Pain (Visual Analogue Scale), The pain linked to the fungating tumour over the last 24 hours was evaluated by the patient. The pain was graded using a 100 mm linear visual analogical scale (graded from 0 mm = no pain to 100 mm = severe pain)., on Days 0 (baseline), 7, and 14
