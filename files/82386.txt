Vinblastine +/- Bevacizumab in Children With Unresectable or Progressive Low Grade Glioma (LGG)
This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, comparator Phase II trial looking at the addition of Bevacizumab to Vinblastine in chemotherapy na誰ve pediatric patients with progressive Low Grade Glioma aged 6 months to less than18 years of age at the time of initiation of therapy. Participants will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Arm A includes 68 weeks of single agent Vinblastine administered once weekly IV. Arm B includes 68 weeks of Vinblastine administered weekly IV with the addition of 12 doses of Bevacizumab administered every two weeks IV for the initial 24 weeks. Randomization will take place at the time of registration taking into account NF1 and BRAF-KIAA1549-fusion status.
