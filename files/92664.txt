First in Human Study of EMB-07 in Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors or Relapse/Refractory Lymphoma
For solid tumors and lymphoma, respectively: This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EMB-07 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and the anti-multiple myeloma activity of EMB-07 will also be assessed.
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors|Relapse/Refractory Lymphoma
DRUG: EMB07
Incidence and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE V5.0., Incidence and severity of AE., Screening up to 30 days after the last dose.|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAE)., Incidence of SAE., Screening up to 30 days after the last dose, or beyond 30 days if SAE is confirmed to be treatment related.|Incidence of dose interruptions., Incidence of dose interruptions of EMB-07 during treatment as a measure of tolerability., Screening up to 30 days after the last dose.|Dose intensity., Actual amount of drug taken by patients divided by the planned amount., Screening up to 30 days after the last dose.|The incidence of DLTs during the first cycle of treatment., The dose limiting toxicities are based on drug related adverse events and are specifically defined in study protocol., First infusion to the end of cycle 1. (each cycle is 28 days).

This is a phase I, multicenter, open label, dose escalation, first in human study, designed to assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose for EMB-07 in patient with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors or relapse/refractory Lymphoma . Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and response will also be assessed.
