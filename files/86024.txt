Study of BEBT-607 Tablets in The Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors With KRAS G12C Mutation
This is a two-phase, multicenter, open phase I clinical study, with phase Ia as dose escalation phase and phase Ib as dose expansion phase, to evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of BEBT-607 tablets in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors associated with KRAS G12C mutation. To evaluate the efficacy of BEBT-607 tablets in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation, and to determine the recommended dose (RP2D) for Phase II clinical trials of BEBT-607 tablets in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation.

Phase Ⅰa:

The dose escalation plan is to carry out about 6 dose levels. The initial dose of BEBT-607 tablets is set at 100mg/ day, and the subsequent dose groups are first increased by 100%. If a case of drug-related grade 2 non-hematological toxicity or grade 3 hematological toxicity is found and does not reach DLT, the subsequent dose groups are increased by 50%. If one case of dose limiting toxicity(DLT) is found and does not reach maximum tolerated dose(MTD ), the subsequent dose group is increased by 33%（Doses are rounded to multiples of 100mg）.The single dose is 1/2 of the total daily dose, and the single administration phase is administered once a day, and the continuous administration phase is administered twice a day (only once on the 28th day of the first cycle).

Phase Ⅰb:

According to the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary efficacy results of phase Ⅰa dose escalation phase, one to three cohorts with target dose or tumor species are selected for dose extension trial, and a maximum of 30 subjects are enrolled in each cohort. The subjects receive BEBT-607 tablets twice a day, orally before breakfast and before dinner, respectively. There is a treatment cycle every 28 days (On days 1 and 28 of the first cycle, the drug is administered only once before breakfast). The study process for each subject consisted of three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. During treatment, participants are required to undergo safety checks every four weeks from the first dose, tumor assessments every eight weeks, safety follow-up at the end of treatment 28 days after the last dose, efficacy follow-up every eight weeks, and survival follow-up every three months.

Participants will need to understand the requirements and risks of the trial, sign an informed consent form, accept the dosing regimen required by the trial protocol, and follow the investigator's guidance.
