The number of days from the date of the stem cell infusion to engraftment of absolute neutrophils (ANC) and platelets (PLT) will be determined based on daily CBC and differential counts., The date of engraftment of ANC is the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC of 500 or higher. The date of engraftment of platelets is the first of 3 consecutive days of platelet counts of 20,000 or higher in the absence of platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior., 42 days following the infusion of stem cells for ANC. [If engraftment of ANC does not occur within 42 days, a subsequent transplant will be performed if a donor is available.|Rate of non-engraftment and secondary graft failure, The percentage of patients who fail to engraft ANC will be tabulated as well as the percentage of patients who have primary engraftment of ANC but whose graft then fails as evidenced by pancytopenia and failure of bone marrow function., At 100 days, 6 months, and yearly after transplant from the date of transplant until the date of documented graft failure or the subject's date of death up to 120 months.
Percentage of subjects who develop acute graft-versus-host disease., Assess the presence and date of onset of acute GvHD based on the criteria published by Przepiorka et al., Bone Marrow Transplant 1995; 15(6):825-8 as used by the Center for International Blood \& Marrow Transplant Research., 100 days following the infusion of stem cells|Assess the Maximum Overall Grades 0- IV of acute GvHD and Maximum Severity (0-4) by involved organ system in patients who develop acute graft-versus-host disease., Assess the severity of acute GvHD based on the criteria published by Przepiorka et al., Bone Marrow Transplant 1995; 15(6):825-8 as used by the Center for International Blood \& Marrow Transplant Research., 100 days following the infusion of stem cells|Percentage of subjects who develop chronic graft-versus-host disease., Calculate the percentage of patients who develop chronic graft-versus-host disease based on Sullivan KM, Blood 1981; 57:267 as used by the Center for International Blood \& Marrow Transplant Research., Minimally at intervals of 100 days, 6 months and then yearly following the infusion of stem cells until the subject's date of death.or up to 120 months.|Assess the Maximum Grade: Limited versus Extensive; Maximum Severity: Mild, Moderate or Severe) of chronic GvHD in patients who develop chronic graft-versus-, Assess the severity of chronic GvHD in patients who develop chronic graft-versus-host disease based on Sullivan KM, Blood 1981; 57:267 as used by the Center for International Blood \& Marrow Transplant Research., Minimally at intervals of 100 days, 6 months and then yearly following the infusion of stem cells until the subject's date of death or up to 120 months.|Disease-free survival, Document and update the length of time a subject survives without recurrence of the disease for which they were transplanted minimally at 100 days. 6 months, and yearly following the infusion of stem cells for as long as the patient survives and remains disease-free., Disease assessments are performed and reported at time points that include 100 days, 6 months, and yearly until documented progression of disease or the date of death or up to 120 months.|Time to relapsed disease, Document the time to relapse of the disease for which the patient was Minimally assessments will be performed at 100 days. 6 months, and yearly following the infusion of stem cells for as long as the patient survives and remains disease-free., Disease assessments are performed and reported at time points that include 100 days, 6 months, and yearly until the date of documented progression or the subject's date of death or up to 120 months.|Immune reconstitution, Evaluate immune reconstitution by measurement of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), assessment of infections, and lymphocyte analysis, At 100 day, 6 month and one year intervals following the infusion of stem cells until the subject's date of death or up to 120 months.
This study will be a single-center treatment protocol with five possible preparative regimens, designed to validate the process of related donor haploidentical-SCT at the Wilmot Cancer Institute Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit. Enrolled patients will receive chemotherapy +/- radiation as a pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then receive haploidentical stem cells, either bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood, followed by GvHD prophylaxis that will include cyclophosphamide. Multiple data points will be collected prior to, during, and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and to evaluate the stated objectives.
