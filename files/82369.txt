Endostar Plus EGFR-TKI（Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor） as a Treatment of EGFR Mutation-positive NSCLC
EGFR Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor monotherapy is widely used in treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive Non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), In despite of the benefit of PFS （progression-free survival） , the OS （ overall survival） is limited extended. This study is aim to observe the safety and efficacy of the combination of an anti-angiogenic drug recombinant human-endostatin with EGFR TKI ,to find out a new strategy which may further extend the PFS and OS with a tolerated toxicity.
