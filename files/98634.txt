Stereotactic Radiosurgery Combination With Anlotinib for Limited Brain Metastases With Perilesional Edema in NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic radiosurgery combination with Anlotinib is safe, effective in the treatment of limited brain metastases with Perilesional edema in non-small cell lung cancer.
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
DRUG: Anlotinib|RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery
EI, Edema Index. The "Edema index (EI)" is calculated per the equation of "edema index= (peri-tumoral edema volume+ tumor volume)/tumor volume., 1 month
PFS, Progression-free Survival, 1 year|OS, Overall Survival, 1 year|ORR, Objective Response Rate, 3 months|DCR, Disease Control Rate, 3 months|iORR, intracranial objective response rate, 3 months|iPFS, intracranial progression-free survival, 3 months|SRS rate, the rate of SRS after anlotinib treatment, 1 month
The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic radiosurgery combination with Anlotinib is safe, effective in the treatment of limited brain metastases with perilesional edema in non-small cell lung cancer. The sample size is 50. Patients start to take Anlotinib 1 week before the MRI-based simulation，12mg/d QD，day1\~14, day22\~36.Edema index will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of Anlotinib. The "Edema index (EI)" is calculated per the equation of "edema index= (peri-tumoral edema volume+ tumor volume)/tumor volume.
