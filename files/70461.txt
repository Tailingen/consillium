The Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Toripalimab Combined With Temozolomide in Resectable Stage III Melanoma
This study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant toripalimab combined with temozolomide in resectable stage III melanoma.
Melanoma Stage III
DRUG: Toripalimab combined with Temozolomide
Pathologic response rate (pRR), After 2 cycles of neoadjuvant toripalimab combined with temozolomide, patients receive radical surgery., Within one week after operation
This trial is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical research. Unlike seen in Caucasians, checkpoint inhibitors have not obtained satisfactory results in Chinese patients. Exploring the curative effects of combination therapies in melanoma and their potential synergetic mechanism will improve the prognosis of patients. Recent retrospective data in our center showed that the objective response rate (ORR) of immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in advanced melanoma reached 40%, which was higher than immunotherapy (12.5%) and chemotherapy (4%) alone as front-line therapies. This study is aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab combined with temozolomide in patients with resectable stage III melanoma. The safety and efficacy of this study will be assessed through ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, and adverse effects as graded by CTCAE 5.0.
