Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of FLT3 CAR-T AMG 553 in FLT3-positive Relapsed/Refractory AML
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 553 in adult and adolescent subjects with FLT3-positive R/R AML.

Determine the maximum tolerated cell dose (MTCD) or recommended phase 2 cell dose (RP2CD) of AMG 553.
