Risk Factors and Long-term Impact of ICIs
This study plans to conduct a multicenter, observable and controlled cohort study to solid-tumor patients with receiving immunotherapy and to collect information about their treatment related efficacy, adverse events and health status to build a disease cohort database based on patient reports, and then analyze the risk factors affecting the efficacy, prognosis and adverse events of immunotherapy and the impact of immunotherapy on health status. It is expected to provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence for the selection of immunotherapy schemes for these patients, the precise prevention and health management of adverse events after immunotherapy, and the further improvement of survival prognosis of patients
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: Solid tumor patients receiving immunotherapy for the first time were included in the study
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), It refers to the time from randomization to disease progression, Two years
This study is intended to conduct a multicenter, observable and controlled cohort study in multiple clinical centers including the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University to solid-tumor patients who received immunotherapy for the first time. The baseline information before treatment was collected (mainly including three collection methods, namely, patients' self filling information, physician assisted filling information, and medical record system import information. The information collected was mainly in the following aspects: demographic characteristics, tumor and anti-tumor information, gene testing information, blood sample collection information, and questionnaire evaluation information) and follow-up information after treatment (The collection method and content are the same as the baseline information.) Collect the relevant factors that may affect the treatment efficacy and prognosis of patients, build a prospective disease cohort database based on patient reports, and then analyze the risk factors that affect the efficacy, prognosis and adverse events of immunotherapy and the impact of immunotherapy on health status. We also retrospectively collected some data from medicine records for validation. The outcome indicators are mainly disease free progression survival (PFS), The secondary indicators were the total survival period (OS), objective response rate (ORR), immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and the scoring results of various questionnaires (PHQ-9, etc). It is expected to provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence for the selection of immunotherapy schemes for these patients, the precise prevention and health management of adverse events after immunotherapy, and the further improvement of survival prognosis of patients.
