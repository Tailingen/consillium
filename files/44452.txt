Randomized Phase II Study of Epirubicin vs Caelyx in Pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer
DOXORUBICIN is recognized as one of the most active drugs for breast cancer, but its clinical utility is limited because of a cumulative dose-dependent cardiac myopathy that can lead to potentially fatal congestive heart failure. Caelyx (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) was designed to reduce the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin while preserving its antitumor efficacy
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx)|DRUG: Epirubicin
Assessment of antitumor efficacy by objective tumor response rates, Objective responses confirmed by CT or MRI (on 3rd and 6th cy)
Toxicity profile and tolerance between the two treatment arms, Toxicity assessment of each chemotherapy cycle|Time to progression, 1 year|Overall survival, 1 year
To compare the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus epirubicin as second line chemotherapy in patient with advanced breast cancer
