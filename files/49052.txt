Nivolumab for Pediatric and Adult Relapsing/Refractory ALK+, for Evaluation of Response in Patients With Progressive Disease (Cohort 1) or as Consolidative Immunotherapy in Patients in Complete Remission After Relapse (Cohort 2)
Prospective, non-randomized, single arm phase II trial with 2 cohorts of ALK+ ALCL treated with nivolumab
Relapsing/Refractory ALK+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Nivolumab cohort 1|DRUG: Nivolumab cohort 2
Cohort 1 - Best objective response rate (Complete Response + Partial Response), In case of PET-positive residual masses after 24 weeks of induction treatment, a resection/biopsy must be performed by week 24. A residual mass proven to be pathologically negative for disease after resection or limited biopsy is considered as CR after discussion with the Coordinating investigator., within the first 24 weeks|Cohort 2 - Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time since the inclusion in the trial to the first event among relapse and death (whatever the cause of death)., up to 12 months
Prospective, non-randomized, single arm phase II trial with 2 cohorts of ALK+ ALCL treated with nivolumab

Cohort 1:

Population: relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL with progressive disease after treatment (including chemotherapy and ALK inhibitor and/or brentuximab vedotin).

Primary endpoint: ORR = best objective response rate (CR+PR) within the first 24 weeks, assessed according to adapted Lugano 2014 response criteria for Lymphoma.

Design: A one-stage phase II trial with unacceptable ORR = 40% and promising ORR = 70%. 12 eligible and evaluable patients are required.

Cohort 2 Population: patients with a relapsed/refractory ALCL, having achieved CR with a treatment including ALK-inhibitor or Brentuximab vedotin of at least 2 months and for whom HSCT is considered for their consolidation therapy. In this case, nivolumab for 24 months would be considered as consolidative immunotherapy instead as HSCT.

Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) A PFS rate â‰¤ 50% will be considered as unacceptable. Design: A four-stage phase II trial with unacceptable PFS rate = 50% and promising PFS rate = 75%. A maximum of twenty-six patients will be included: 4 at the 1st and 2nd stages, 8 at the 3rd stage and 10 at the 4th stage.

No more than one third of the included patients must have received more than 12 months of ALK inhibitor or brentuximab. Thus, the inclusion of these patients will be closed after 8 patients.
