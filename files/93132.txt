Impact of a European Training Program for Robotic Liver Surgery (LIVEROBOT)
LIVEROBOT is a collaboration of high-volume liver surgical centers in Europe (≥60 liver resections per year), supported by the European-African Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Education Committee (E-AHPBA), and the European Registry of Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery (E-MILS) aiming to support the step-up implementation and safety of advanced surgical expertise of robotic liver surgery (RLS) on a European basis. The LIVEROBOT training program aims to promote the safe implementation of RLS throughout Europe. The data from all patients operated on during a surgeons' participation in the training program will be prospectively gathered allowing for learning curve and outcome analyses.

Textbook Outcome in Liver Surgery (TOLS), TOLS is a novel composite measure that captures the most desirable surgical outcomes into a single indicator and is defined as the absence of intraoperative incidents of grade ≥ 2 (defined according to the Oslo classification), postoperative bile leakage of grade B or C (according to the severity grading of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery), Clavien-Dindo ≥ Grade 3 complications, 30-day readmission, in-hospital mortality and the presence of R0 resection margin., 30 days
