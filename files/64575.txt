Neugranin in Breast Cancer Participants Receiving Doxorubicin/Docetaxel
Determination of the effect of neugranin on the duration and severity of severe neutropenia in participants receiving doxorubicin in combination with docetaxel.
Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia
BIOLOGICAL: Neugranin|BIOLOGICAL: Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Double-Blind Phase: Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycle 1, Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<0.5 x 10\^9/liter \[L\]). The duration of severe neutropenia was calculated by cycle as the number of days from the first day in which the ANC fell below 0.5 x 10\^9/L after beginning a chemotherapy cycle until the participant had an ANC ≥0.5 x 10\^9/L within the cycle., Cycle 1 (cycle length = 21 days)|Open-Label Phase: Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycle 1, Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \<0.5 x 10\^9/L). The duration of severe neutropenia was calculated by cycle as the number of days from the first day in which the ANC fell below 0.5 x 10\^9/L after beginning a chemotherapy cycle until the participant had an ANC ≥0.5 x 10\^9/L within the cycle. There was no planned statistical analysis for the open-label phase arm., Cycle 1 (cycle length = 21 days)
Double-Blind Phase: Number of Participants With Febrile Neutropenia, Febrile neutropenia was defined as an imputed or observed ANC \<0.5 x 10\^9/L and body temperature \>38.5 degrees celsius (°C) occurring on the same day and for more than one hour (axillary measurement). Number of participants with febrile neutropenia over all cycles (Cycles 1 to 4) has been reported., Cycles 1-4 (each cycle = 21 days)|Open-Label Phase: Number of Participants With Febrile Neutropenia, Febrile neutropenia was defined as an imputed or observed ANC \<0.5 x 10\^9/L and body temperature \>38.5 °C occurring on the same day and for more than one hour (axillary measurement). Number of participants with febrile neutropenia over all cycles (Cycles 1 to 4) has been reported., Cycles 1-4 (each cycle = 21 days)
