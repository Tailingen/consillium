Biospecimen Collection in Identifying Genetic Changes in Patients With Breast, Prostate, Colorectal, Liver, or Kidney Cancer or Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Surgery
This research trial studies how well biospecimen collection works in identifying genetic changes in patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, liver, or kidney cancer or multiple myeloma undergoing surgery. Studying samples collected during surgery may add to the understanding of cancer by looking for the genetic changes that cause early cancer onset in people of certain racial and ethnic groups.
Breast Carcinoma|Colon Carcinoma|Invasive Carcinoma|Kidney Carcinoma|Liver Carcinoma|Malignant Solid Neoplasm|Multiple Myeloma|Prostate Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Acquisition of tissue, blood, and other biospecimens for research purposes, Will be performed., Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To acquire tissue and blood, and other biospecimens for research purposes during procedures for clinical care to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of early onset cancers occurring in racial and/or ethnic minority populations through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large- scale genome sequencing and clinical data analysis.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue during surgery. Patients also undergo blood samples. Samples collected may undergo genetic analysis including whole exome sequencing.

After completion of study, patients are followed for up at 6 and 12 months.
