Bioequivalence Study of Paclitaxel for Injection (Albumin Bound) in Subjects With Breast Cancer
This study was a multicenter, randomized, open, single-dose, two-cycle, two-cross-dosing human bioequivalence trial designed to evaluate the bioequivalence of tested and reference preparations in breast cancer subjects.
