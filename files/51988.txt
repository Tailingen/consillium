Follow-up Yttrium-90 Internal Pair Production PET/CT vs Brehmsstrahlung Imaging in Patients With Primary/Metastatic Liver Tumors
This is a prospective non-blinded case series involving the acquisition of a pair production PET/CT as soon as possible after an already performed Y-90 Sirspheres treatment of hepatic malignancy. It will be performed in addition to the standard Brehmsstrahlung SPECT scan. The sequence of the two scans in each case (PET/CT vs SPECT) will be determined by availability of the scanners at the time. However, it is intended that both be acquired on the day of the Y-90 treatment.

The length of subject participation will be one year.

The measures used will be mostly qualitative in nature, and will include:

* Correlation with expected vs. achieved tumor coverage by the treatment
* Correlation between treatment distribution depicted by Brehmsstrahlung scans vs. the Internal Pair Production PET/CT scans, to.
* Detection of non-target embolization, where applicable, and qualitative comparison between the two modalities as to the conspicuity of the abnormality

Qualitative methods will be used by the analysis of the obtained PET/CT images and comparing them to the Brehmsstrahlung SPECT images as previously described.
Liver Cancer|Hepatic Tumors
DEVICE: PET/CT Scan
Number of Subjects Whose Y-90 Based PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography)Scans Detected Extrahepatic Non-target Embolization., Number of participants with detected extrahepatic non-target embolization. A qualitative comparison between the two modalities (Y-90 PET/CT and Brehmsstrahlung SPECT) as to the conspicuity of the abnormality would have been conducted had any participant had that result., 12 months
Comparison Between Treatment Distribution Depicted by Tc99mMAA (Technetium-99m Macroaggregated Albumin) Brehmsstrahlung Scans vs. the Internal Pair Production PET/CT Scans., Number of participants demonstrating a similar treatment distribution depicted by Tc99mMAA(Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin) Brehmsstrahlung scans vs. achieved Y-90 distribution on the Internal Pair Production PET/CT scans., 12 months|Comparison of Y-90 PET/CT to Y90 SPECT, Number of participants with a similar Y90 distribution depicted on Post Y90 delivery PET/CT and SPECT modalities, specifically comparing Y90 distribution within the treated tumors., 12 Months
