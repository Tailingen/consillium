[18F]ISO-1 Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) in Primary Breast Cancer
In this study, positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate sigma-2 (Ïƒ2) receptor activity in sites of primary breast cancer using the investigational radiotracer \[18F\]ISO-1.

This study will evaluate the feasibility of using \[18F\]ISO-1 PET/CT to image sigma-2 receptor binding in primary breast tumors and continue to evaluate the safety of the tracer in this patient population. \[18F\]ISO-1 uptake measures will be correlated with qualitative immunohistochemical staining for cell proliferation (Ki67). This is an observational study in that \[18F\]ISO-1 PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions.
