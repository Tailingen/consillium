Dose-escalation Study of BIBH 1 in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Scheduled for Surgical Resection
Study to assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and imaging characteristics associated with increasing doses of 131I-BIBH 1, to compare the uptake of 131I-BIBH 1 in tumour to that of normal tissue in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and to measure human anti-human antibody (HAHA) concentrations.
