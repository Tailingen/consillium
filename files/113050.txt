A Study of Ramucirumab (LY3009806) in Combination With Paclitaxel in Participants With Gastric Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative dose of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in participants with second-line metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJ).
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Ramucirumab 12mg/kg Arm I4T-MC-JVCZ, PFS was defined as time from the date of randomization(RD) to date of radiographic documentation of progression(RDP) or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier as defined by RECIST v.1.1. Participants with no tumor progression and no death were censored at date of last adequate radiological assessment (AST) or date of RD(whichever is later).PD is at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference the smallest sum on study.In addition to the relative increase of 20%,the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.Non-Target PD is unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.A participant with incomplete baseline disease had PFS time censored at the enrollment date.A participant not known to have died or have RDP as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis had PFS time censored at date of the last complete RDP-free disease AST., Randomization to Objective Progressive Disease or Death (Up To 21 Months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Ramucirumab 12mg/kg Arm and 8mg/kg Arm in I4T-MC-JVCZ, PFS was defined as time from the date of randomization(RD) to date of radiographic documentation of progression(RDP) or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier as defined by RECIST v.1.1. Participants with no tumor progression and no death were censored at date of last adequate radiological assessment(AST) or date of RD(whichever is later).PD is at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference the smallest sum on study.In addition to the relative increase of 20%,the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.Non-Target PD is unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.A participant with incomplete baseline disease had PFS time censored at the enrollment date.A participant not known to have died or have RDP as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis had PFS time censored at date of the last complete RDP-free disease AST., Randomization to Objective Progressive Disease or Death (Up To 21 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Ramucirumab in Combination with Paclitaxel, Cycle(C) 1 Day(D) 1: Prior to Infusion(PTI),1 to 1.5 hours(hrs) after end of Infusion(EOI); C1 D15: 3 days PTI; C2 D1: 3 days PTI; C2 D15: 3 days PTI,1 to 1.5 hrs after EOI; C3 D1 and 15: 3 days PTI; C4 D1: 3 days PTI and 1 to 1.5 hrs after EOI|Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rates [ORR]), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a PR or CR per RECIST v.1.1.CR is the disappearance of all target lesions.Any pathological lymph nodes(whether target or non-target)must have reduction in short axis to\<10mm.Tumor marker results must have normalized.PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions,taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100., Baseline to Objective Progressive Disease (Up To 21 Months)|Percentage of Participants Who Exhibit Stable Disease (SD) or Confirmed Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Disease Control Rate (DCR)], DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CR, PR, or SD per RECIST v.1.1. CR is the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.Tumor marker results must have normalized. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression. Non-Target PD is unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. DCR=CR+PR+SD/total number of participants\*100., Baseline to Objective Progressive Disease (Up To 21 Months)|Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Participants who had anti-ramucirumab antibodies at postbaseline., Cycle 1 Predose through Follow-up (Up To 24 Months)
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative dose of ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel in participants with second-line metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJ).
