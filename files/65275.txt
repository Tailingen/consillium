Prostate Cancer
To define effect of prostate brachytherapy on male fertility., measure by sequential sperm counts, 12 months
Brachytherapy is a commonly employed technique in the treatment of all prostate cancer risk groups. It delivers a high radiation localised to the prostate gland. The effects of this on fertility have not been systematically studied. An increasing number of younger men for whom fertility is an issue are being diagnosed with prostate cancer and may be offered brachytherapy amongst their treatment choices. This study therefore addresses this issue with a systematic evaluation of sperm count and quality before and after both high dose rate and low dose rate brachytherapy.
