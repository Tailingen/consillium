Post Market TRUST - U.S.A. Study
This Post Market study is being conducted to compare the direct and indirect cost of three approaches (GFA, myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization) for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. In addition, data from this study is being used to satisfy the requirements of the United States Food and Drug Administration's 522 (post market surveillance) order.
Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids
PROCEDURE: Global Fibroid Ablation (GFA)|PROCEDURE: Abdominal or Laparoscopic Myomectomy|PROCEDURE: Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)
Compare direct cost of GFA compared to those of myomectomy and UAE, To compare medical, surgical, and hospitalization costs (including procedural complication costs) of Global Fibroid Ablation (GFA) compared to those of Myomectomy and Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)at 3 months post procedure., 3 months post procedure|Compare rates of acute and near-term serious complications to the acute and near-term treatment-related serious adverse events of pivotal study., Overall rates of acute (within 48 hours post procedure) and near-term (between 2 and 30 days post procedure) serious complications in all GFA subjects compared to the acute and near-term treatment-related serious adverse event rates in the pivotal study., 30 days post procedure
Assess the incidence and cost of post discharge procedure-related complications and reinterventions, Safety measures will be assessed by comparing the complication and reintervention rate for all three alternatives (GFA, Myomectomy, UAE)., 60 months|Assess factors that influence indirect costs of the three treatment alternatives, Compare incidence costs of post discharge procedure-related complications and re-interventions we well as indirect cost factors defined as days to return-to-work, return to normal activities of daily living, and cost of care up to 60 months post discharge., 60 months|Assess Uterine Fibroid Symptom Severity and Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) pre-treatment to post treatment in all treatment groups, To compare fibroid symptom severity and quality of life scores at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post procedure as compared to baseline using the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) assessment tool., 60 months|Assess subjects menstrual bleeding using the MIQ, Compare subjects menstrual bleeding pre-treatment and up to 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post treatment using the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ)., 60 months|Assess subject's satisfaction with her treatment, Assess the subject's satisfaction with her assigned procedure at 12 months post procedure using the Overall Treatment Effect questionnaire, 12 months|Assess the subject's general health outcome, General health outcome evaluation at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post procedure as compared to baseline using the EuroQol (EQ-5D), a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, 60 months post procedure|Assess the incidence of serious complications per investigator-surgeon during training and post training., The incidence of acute and near-term serious complications following the GFA cases will also be analyzed by investigator-surgeon during the training and post training periods.., 60 months
The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the economic burden, safety and outcomes of three uterine-conserving treatment alternatives for symptomatic uterine fibroids: myomectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), and global fibroid ablation (GFA) using the Acessaâ„¢ System, and 2) meet the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 522 Order for post market surveillance In this study, subjects who have symptomatic uterine fibroids will be randomized to one of three uterine-conserving treatments based on the local standard of care.
