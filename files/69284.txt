Safety and Efficacy of GX-188E DNA Therapeutic Vaccine Administered by Electroporation After Observation
This study is to follow up on the change of immune response by measuring HPV type 16/18 E6 and E7 specific T cell response and lesion condition in subjects who have administered in DNA-based therapeutic vaccine.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3
BIOLOGICAL: GX-188E
Safety assessment examined by physical examination, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory test etc, long term safety assessment of GX-188E DNA vaccine of subjects participated in GX-188E_ CIN3_P2 clinical trial

- Safety profile would be examined by physical examination, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory test etc, at week -18 and 130|lesion recurrence, The change of the CIN lesion (included cervical cancer) would be compared to that of the last visit in phase II study, at week -18 and 130
The change of HPV infection status, The change of HPV infection status would be compared to that of the last visit in phase II study., at week -18 and 130|The change of cytology test result, The change of cytology status would be compared to that of the last visit in phase II study., at week -18 and 130|The change of the immune response, It would be determined by evaluating HPV type 16/18 E6 and E7 specific T cell response (IFN-Î³ ELISPOT: enzyme-linked immunospot assay) using PBMC(peripheral blood monocyte)., at week -18 and 130|Flt-3L(fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand) concentration (Flt-3L ELISA) using plasma., Pharmacodynamics evaluation of GX-188E, at week -18 and 130|Survey of pregnancy and delivery, The matters relevant to the subject of pregnancy and delivery would be collected by survey to identify occurence, frequency and characteristic., at week -18 and 130
This is a follow-up study to investigate the change of immunogenicity and lesion condition in subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 who have enrolled and participated GX-188E phase II trial(GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

Subjects will make visits 7 times for about three years from the last visit of GX-188E phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).

The endpoints are to evaluate the change of immune response, involved lesion and infection status compared to that of the final visit in phase 2 trial (GX-188E_CIN3_P2).
