A Study of PARP1 Selective Inhibitor, EIK1004 (IMP1707) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors.
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of EIK1004 (IMP1707) in participants with recurrent advanced/metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and pancreatic cancer with deleterious/suspected deleterious mutations of select homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes.

Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Phase Advanced Solid Tumors Drug: EIK1004 (IMP1707) Phase 1/Phase 2
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: EIK1004-001 (IMP1707-001)
Number of Participants who experience a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is defined as an event with toxicity including the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with study treatment that are not due to pre-existing conditions as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). The number of participants who experience a DLT will be reported., (Timeframe: up to 28 days)|Number of participants with adverse events, treatment emergent adverse events or serious adverse events, Number of participants reporting adverse events or serious adverse events which include any abnormal clinical events, laboratory assessments outside of normal clinical range, abnormal vital signs observed, and any abnormal ECG parameters, (Time Frame: 1 month post last dose of EIK1004 (IMP1707)
Pharmacokinetic parameters of EIK1004 (IMP1707), Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Through study completion, up to 3 years|Pharmacokinetic parameters of EIK1004 (IMP1707), Area under the curve (AUC) will be defined, Time Frame: Through study completion, up to 3 years|Objective Response (OR), Defined as participants who have a complete response \[CR\] or Participants who have a partial response \[PR\] by RECIST 1.1 (Solid tumor) and RANO-BM (brain metastasis), or CA-125 response per GCIG criteria (ovarian cancer), or PSA response per PCWG3 criteria., Through study completion, up to 3 years
Pharmacodynamic changes due to EIK1004 (IMP1707), Cytokines will be measured using an ELISA assay. The concentration of cytokines in plasma samples collected from patients is being measured and will be reported as a quantified value (e.g ng/mL).

The fold change in plasma cytokines over baseline will be measured and the relative change compared to pre-dose/baseline numbers., Through study completion, up to 3 years
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of EIK1004 (IMP1707) as monotherapy in patients with recurrent, advanced/metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts: Dose escalation and dose optimization.

In dose escalation (Part1), the study will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum achievable dose (MAD) in solid tumor.

In dose optimization (Part 2), the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of select doses of EIK1004 (IMP1707)
