Clinical Evaluation of the APTIMA® HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay on the PANTHER® System
The objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System in cervical cancer screening.

This objective will be accomplished in the ASC-US Study by evaluating the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System in a sample population of women with ASC-US Pap test results who were 21 years of age or older ("≥21 years of age") at the time of their Pap visit. For the Adjunct Study, this objective will be accomplished by evaluating the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay using the PANTHER System to identify women at increased risk of cervical disease in a sample population of women with negative (NILM)cytology results who were ≥30 years of age at the time of their Pap visit.
