Hepatocellular Carcinoma on Cirrhosis With Child A/B7 and Hepatic Intra Arterial Injection of Idarubicin/Lipiodol Emulsion
The investigators propose in this trial to test a hepatic chemotherapy, consisting of the hepatic intra-arterial injection Idarubicin, emulsified with Lipiodol, lipid vector, without embolization in the treatment of non-metastatic, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis with Child-Pugh A/B7.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Idarubicin and Lipiodol
Percentage of participants presenting a disease control at 4 months, The primary outcome is to evaluate the disease control rate (partial, complete or stable response) 4 months after the first cycle of chemo-lipiodol using mRECIST criteria., 4 months
Safety of chemo-lipiodol defined by NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, Safety defined by NCI-CTCAE version 4.03 published 14 june 2010, 12 months|Objective response rate of chemo-lipiodol, Objective response rate according to mRECIST at 6 months after the first cycle, 6 months|best response at 6 months after the first cycle of chemo-lipiodol according to mRECIST, The best response according to mRECIST at 6 months after the first cycle of chemo-lipiodol, 6 months|Overall survival, Overall survival at 12 months after the first cycle of chemo-lipiodol, 12 months|Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) QLQ-C30, Quality of life questionnaire at 12 months after the first cycle of chemo-lipiodol (QLQ-C30). Subscale minimum score is egal to 1 (not at all) and maximum score is egal to 4 (very much). The maximal score correspond to a better quality of life. Subscales are summed to compute a total score., 12 months
