Phase 1a/1b First-in-Human Study of BG-C9074 Alone and in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, dose finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-C9074 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: BG-C9074|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Phase 1a: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory assessments, and that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria., Approximately 3 years|Phase 1a: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) of BG-C9074, Defined as the highest dose evaluated for which the estimated toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate of 28% or the highest dose administered, respectively, Approximately 18 months|Phase 1a: Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDFE) of BG-C9074., The potential RDFE(s) of BG-C9074 alone and in combination with tislelizumab will be determined based on the MTD or MAD, taking into consideration the long-term tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, preliminary antitumor activity, and any other relevant data, as available, Approximately 18 months|Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Approximately 3 years|Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BG-C9074 as monotherapy and in combination with tislelizumab, The RP2D of BG-C9074 will be determined based on safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, preliminary antitumor activity, and other relevant data, as available., Approximately 30 months
Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first as assessed by the investigator., Approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease., Approximately 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting â‰¥ 24 weeks as assessed by investigator., Approximately 3 years|Phase 1b: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug(s) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Approximately 3 years|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, including findings from physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory assessments, and that meet protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria., Approximately 3 years|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin) for BG-C9074, Approximately 3 years|Time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Half-life (t1/2) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Apparent clearance (CL/F) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Accumulation ratio for BG-C9074, Twice in the first four months|Plasma concentrations for BG-C9074, Approximately 3 years|Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to BG-C9074, Approximately 3 years|Serum concentration of BG-C0974, Approximately 3 years|Serum concentration of Tislelizumab, Approximately 3 years
