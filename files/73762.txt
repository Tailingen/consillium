A Study of RC48-ADC in Advanced Melanoma Subjects With HER2 Variant (Mutation, Amplification, Overexpression)
This is a Phase IIa, single-arm, multicentre, open-label clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RC48-ADC in the treatment of HER2 Variant (Mutation, Amplification, Overexpression) advanced melanoma.
Melanoma, Stage II|HER2-positive|Advanced Melanoma
DRUG: RC48-ADC
Objective remission rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be analyzed according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation., within approximately 3 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., within approximately 3 years|Duration of relief (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death., within approximately 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study., within approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of randomization to the date of death of the subject., within approximately 3 years
This study is a phase IIa multicentre,single-arm, open-label, clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate for the treatment of HER2- positive advanced melanoma. HER2 mutation is defined as the presence of HER2 gene mutations in primary or metastatic tumour tissue as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2 gene mutation.
