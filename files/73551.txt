CAR20.19.22 T-cells in Relapsed, Refractory B-cell Malignancies
In this phase I study, the investigators will first evaluate the safety of CAR20.19.22 T-cells in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) / chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Number of Non-hematologic Adverse Events after Infusion, Occurrence of adverse events will be defined as non-hematologic Grade 3/4 toxicity grade per NCI CTCAE version 5.0., 28 days after infusion|Number of grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS)., Grade 3-4 CRS as graded per the recent Transplant and Cell Therapy (TCT) consensus criteria., 28 days after infusion|Number of grade 3-4 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), Grade 3-4 ICANS as graded per the recent Transplant and Cell Therapy (TCT) consensus criteria., 28 days after infusion
This is a phase I, interventional, open label, dose-finding treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy CAR20.19.22 T-cells in adult patients with B-cell malignancies that have failed prior therapies.
