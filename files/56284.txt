SGM-101 in Locally Advanced and Recurrent Rectal Cancer
Near-infrared fluorescence-guided oncologic surgery (EGOS) with the use of a tumor specific tracer (SGM-101) developed by Surgimab can provide valuable intra-operative information about tumor location and extensiveness, which can be difficult to detect with conventional visual and tactile feedback. Hence, this information could aid in intra-operative decision making and therewith foster complete resection margins and less extensive surgery. Subsequently, this may drastically improve patient care by improving oncologic outcome.
