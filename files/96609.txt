A Study of Penpulimab (AK105) in the First-line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of penpulimab combined with chemotherapy and placebo combined with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
