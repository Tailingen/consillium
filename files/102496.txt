ThOracoscopic Wedge Resection Treated With Chest Tube Removal Intraoperatively
Chest tubes are used routinely although preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and safety of intraoperative chest drain removal. Previous studies are however either retrospective or mainly concerning benign disease.

Hypothesis: Participants treated without post-operative chest tube after thoracoscopic wedge resection have less pain, better pulmonary function and similar complication profile than participants treated with standard post-operative chest tube, and could possibly be discharged earlier.
Pain|Decreased Lung Function|Delayed Discharge
PROCEDURE: Intraoperative sealing test|PROCEDURE: Standard post-operative chest tube|PROCEDURE: Intraoperative chest tube removal
Pain, Average pain expressed as area under the curve from a numeric rank score at 1, 3, 6 and 9 hours after surgery as well as daily at 8 am and 8 pm from post-operative day 1 until discharge., Through post-operative admission, an average of 1 day.
Reasons for post-operative admission, Daily evaluation of reasons for admission., Through post-operative admission, an average of 1 day.|Lung function, FEV1 measured preoperatively and on post-operative day 1 at 8 am., Up to post-operative day 1.|Reinsertion of chest tubes, Frequency of chest tube reinsertion., Up to post-operative day 30.|Pneumothorax, Size and frequency of pneumothorax on x-ray after removal of chest tube, Up to post-operative day 1.|Complications, Surgical complications including mortality., Up to post-operative day 30.
