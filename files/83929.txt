Reolysin in Previously Treated Advanced/Metastatic, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Standard Salvage Therapy
The purpose of this study is to find out if giving reolysin in combination with docetaxel or pemetrexed can offer better results than standard therapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed alone.

Progression free survival, Evaluation of the effect of reolysin in combination with standard salvage chemotherapy on the progression free survival of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria (1.1) proposed by the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) committee, 30 months
Number of patients with adverse events, To determine the tolerability and toxicity of reolysin and standard salvage chemotherapy when given in combination., 30 months|Response rates, To investigate additional potential measures of efficacy including:

* Progression rates at 3 months
* Objective response rate
* Overall survival (OS), 30 months|Explore potential molecular factors predictive of response, Exploration of potential molecular factors predictive of response by assessment of archival tumour tissue and serial blood samples., 30 months
Reolysin is a virus which has been shown to target and destroy cancer cells in laboratory tests. Reolysin has been studied in over 360 cancer patients to find safe doses that can be given and has also undergone testing in combination with docetaxel.

Docetaxel and pemetrexed have anticancer activity in certain cancers including lung and they have been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given together with docetaxel or pemetrexed.
