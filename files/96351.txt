Evaluation of Lymphodepletion With ALLO-647 in Adults With R/R Large B Cell Lymphoma Receiving ALLO-501A Allogeneic CAR T Cell Therapy
The purpose of the EXPAND study is to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of ALLO-647 combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone in a lymphodepletion regimen prior to ALLO-501A CAR T therapy in adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma
Relapsed/Refractory Large B Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: ALLO-647|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|GENETIC: ALLO-501A
To assess the clinical efficacy of ALLO-647 (in a lymphodepletion regimen before ALLO-501A) compared to FC alone as measured by PFS and assessed by IRC in subjects with R/R (Relapsed / Refractory) LBCL (Large B Cell Lymphoma), Up to 60 months
