A Dose Escalating Study of CD19/CD22/BCMA CAR-T Therapy in Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologouschimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells targeting CD19/CD22/BCMA in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation investigator initiated (IIT) study, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD19/ CD22/BCMA CAR-T therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For the secondary objectives,pharmacokinetics(PK), survival of CAR-T cells in vivo,pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy in R/R MM will be evaluated.

This study flow comprises of a screening phase( 30 to10 days prior to infusion), apheresis phase (9 to 8 days prior to infusion), lymphodepletion phase (5 to 3 days prior to infusion) , infusion of CD19/CD22/BCMA CAR-T cells on Day0, DLT assessments phase (from Day1 to Day 28) and post- treatment follow-up phase (Day 29 and up to end of the study).
