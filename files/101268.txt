TCR-α/β and CD19 Depleted Stem Cell Grafts From Haplo Donors for HSCT in Relapsed Lymphoma
To determine engraftment of neutrophils and platelets at 28 days following alpha/beta T-cell and CD19 cell depletion using Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical donors for peripheral blood stem cell transplant in relapsed lymphoma.

Assess incidence of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, graft failure rate, treatment related mortality rate, progression free survival and overall survival of patients.

The stem cell product will be processed using an investigational Miltenyi cell selection device/system that removes the alpha/beta T-cells and CD19+ cells, immune system cells that are more likely to cause GVHD.
