mRNA-2736 for Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mRNA-2736 in participants with RRMM.
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: mRNA-2736
Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Up to 1 year
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 0 (predose) to 96 hours postdose|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC), 0 (predose) to 96 hours postdose|Maximum Effect/Concentration of the Expressed Protein (Emax), 0 (predose) to 96 hours postdose|Area Under the Effect Concentration (AUEC), 0 (predose) to 96 hours postdose|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 2 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Up to 3 years
This open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study of mRNA-2736 in participants with RRMM is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of mRNA-2736, administered intravenously (IV), to determine maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 dose, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of mRNA-2736.
