Immunotherapy Platform Study in Platinum Resistant High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
This study is being done to answer the following question: What are the effects of a new drug or drugs on ovarian cancer? The pre-study screening may be done to test a sample of tissue for biomarkers to determine participation in the study.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: BA3011|DRUG: BA3021|DRUG: ENB003|DRUG: Toripalimab
To efficiently identify based on objective response rate (ORR), by investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1, promising immunotherapy combinations for the treatment of high grade serous ovarian cancer for later validation in randomized trials, 36 months
Evaluate ORR by investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1, 36 months|Determine progression-free survival of immunotherapy regimens (RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST), 36 months|Determine overall-survival of immunotherapy regimens (RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST), 36 months|Number and severity of adverse events, 36 months
This study is being conducted to determine if this approach is better or worse than the standard of care for ovarian cancer. The standard of care is defined as care most people get for ovarian cancer.
