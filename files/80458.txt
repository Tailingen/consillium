Intravenous and Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel, Intraperitoneal Cisplatin, and Intravenous Bevacizumab for the Initial Treatment of Optimal Stage II or III Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, and Fallopian Tube Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test whether it is safe to treat your cancer with 3 drugs instead of 2 drugs. After surgery, your cancer is typically treated with 2 drugs called cisplatin and paclitaxel (also known as Taxol). Cisplatin is given through a port in your belly, and Taxol is given both through the belly port and through the vein (IV). Large clinical studies have shown that this treatment gives the best results for women with your cancer. This treatment, however, also causes many side effects, especially belly pain, nerve injury, lowering of the immune system, and infection risk. In the study you are being asked to join, the dose of Cisplatin will be lower in order to try to lessen these problems. This study will also test the safety of adding a 3rd drug called bevacizumab (also known as Avastin). This drug has been shown to shrink ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer in some patients who have advanced disease, despite having received prior treatment for their cancer. Therefore, it may also be effective in patients, like you, who have a new diagnosis.

Unfortunately, Avastin can cause some dangerous side effects in women with advanced cancer. For instance, it can cause a hole in the intestines, and can increase the risk of blood clots and strokes. Avastin has not been given at the same time as IP therapy, so it is not known if this is a safe or effective combination. In this study, IV Avastin will be given in addition to IP cisplatin, IP Taxol, and IV Taxol, to patients like you who have not had any chemotherapy before. This study aims to find out what effects, good and/or bad, that this combination of drugs has on your body and on your type of cancer.
