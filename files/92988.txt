Value of Additional Upfront Systematic Lung Ultrasound in the Workup of Patients With Unilateral Pleural Effusion
The value of lung ultrasound in the work up of pleural effusion (fluid in between the thin doublet layered film surrounding the lungs) is unknown. The researchers will perform a systematic lung ultrasound scan including a scan for extra thoracic metastasis (spread of cancer to other organs) in the lymphnodes of the neck and metastasis lever in 56 patients one-sided pleural effusion. The researchers will measure if the interventions change the diagnostic plan for the patient and leads to faster diagnostics of the underlying course.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Systematic lung ultrasound
Proportion of cases where systematic lung ultrasound (LUS) change the planned diagnostic process for patients with unilateral pleural effusion., Information found in electronic patient files. Comparison of diagnostics planned before systematic ultrasound and diagnostics planned after systematic ultrasound. Measured in proportion of included patients, 26 weeks post procedure
Characteristics of ultrasonic findings with additional systematic LUS., Characteristics is recorded in the ultrasound protocol, Day 1, within 30 minutes after the end of procedure|Proportion of cases where findings of clinical importance on systematic LUS were not identified at the initial contrast-enhanced CT thorax or PET-CT, CT thorax and PET-CT (as assessed by radiologist or clinician at the initial planning of diagnostic work-up), Day 1 within 30 minutes after the end of procedure|Proportion of cases where the change in the diagnostic process after LUS provide a diagnose, Information found in electronic patient files., 26 weeks post procedure|The patient experienced pain during procedure score, Measured by a VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scale 0-10, 0 being no pain, 10 being the worse pain, Day 1 within 30 minutes after the end of procedure|Patient experienced time consumption, Measured by a 3-point Likert scale , scale1-3, 1 being not time consuming at all, 3 being very time consuming, Day 1 within 30 minutes after the end of procedure|The patients willingness to have the same examination again in the future if necessary, Measured by a 5-point Likert scale, scale 1-5, 1 being definitely willing to have the examination again, 5 being definitely not willing to have the examination again, Day 1within 30 minutes after the end of procedure|Mean extra time spend on systematic LUS compared to conventional US for guidance of thoracentesis, Measured in minutes., Day 1 within 30 minutes after the end of procedure
