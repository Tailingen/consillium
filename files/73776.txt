A Study of JNJ-87562761 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D\[s\]) of JNJ-87562761 in Part 1 (dose escalation), and to determine the safety and tolerability at RP2D in Part 2 (dose expansion) in participants with multiple myeloma (MM) whose disease has come back after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to treatment (refractory).
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: JNJ-87562761
Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity., up to approximately 3 years|Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with AEs will be reported. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., up to approximately 3 years|Part 2: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormal Laboratory Values, Number of participants with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (hematology or chemistry) will be reported., up to approximately 3 years
