Combination Chemotherapy After Surgery in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus or Stomach
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug, and giving them after surgery, may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, consisting of paclitaxel and cisplatin, given after surgery in treating patients with cancer of the esophagus or stomach.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: surgical procedure
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the disease free survival and overall survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or cardia receiving post-operative adjuvant paclitaxel plus cisplatin.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo esophagogastrectomies within 4-12 weeks prior to the study. Patients receive intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours on day 1, followed by intravenous cisplatin. Treatment is repeated every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients exhibiting disease recurrence or unacceptable toxic effects are removed from the study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then every 12 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued within 16 months.
