Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of partial response (PR) or better according to international myeloma working group (IMWG) response criteria., Up to 6 years 5 months|Complete Response (CR) or Better Rate, CR or better is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR or better according to IMWG response criteria., Up to 6 years 5 months|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Rate, VGPR or better is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of VGPR or better rate according to IMWG response criteria., Up to 6 years 5 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative CR Rate, MRD-negative CR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve both CR or better and MRD negativity at a threshold of 10\^-5 at any timepoint after the date of randomization and before disease progression or start of subsequent antimyeloma therapy (SST)., Up to 6 years 5 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of participant's death., Up to 6 years 5 months|Progression Free Survival on Next-line Therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as time from randomization to progression on the next line of therapy or death, whichever comes first., Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from randomization to the start of SST., Up to 6 years 5 months|Serum Concentration of Talquetamab and Teclistamab, Serum concentration of talquetamab and teclistamab will be reported., Up to 6 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Talquetamab and Teclistamab, Number of participants with ADAs to talquetamab and teclistamab will be reported., Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Sustained Worsening in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by Multiple Myeloma Symptom and Impact Questionnaire (MySIm-Q), Time to sustained worsening in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of meaningful change. The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment complementary to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 item (EORTC-QLQ-C30). It includes 17 items resulting in a symptom subscale and an impact subscale., Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Sustained Worsening in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30, Time to sustained worsening in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of meaningful change. EORTC-QLQ-C30 Version 3 includes 30 items that make up 5 functional scales (physical role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (pain, fatigue, and nausea or vomiting), and 5 single symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea) and a single impact item (financial difficulties). The recall period is 7 days ("past week"), and responses are reported using a verbal and numeric rating scales. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A high scale score represents a higher response level., Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Sustained Worsening in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by EuroQol Five Dimension Questionnaire 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), Time to sustained worsening in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of meaningful change. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Sustained Worsening in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by Patient Global Impression -Severity (PGI-S), Time to sustained worsening in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of meaningful change. The PGI-S will be used as an anchor, external criterion, to determine meaningful change in scores for the MySIm-Q and EORTC-QLQ-C30 in this population. The response options are presented as a 5-point verbal rating scale from "none" to "very severe.", Up to 6 years 5 months|Time to Sustained Worsening in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by Epstein Taste Survey, Time to sustained worsening in symptoms, functioning and HRQoL is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the start date of meaningful change. The epstein taste survey consists of 17 items from the full 71 item PRO instrument, specific to taste changes developed for use in patients with head and neck cancer as a composite of the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey., Up to 6 years 5 months|Change from Baseline in Symptoms, Functioning, and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by MySIm-Q, Change from baseline in symptoms, functioning, and HRQoL as assessed by MySIm-Q will be reported.
