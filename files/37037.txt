RO4929097 Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This phase I trial is studying the side effects of RO4929097 before surgery in treating patients with pancreatic cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving RO4929097 before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

Notch activity (expression of Hes-1), Summarized as a binary endpoint for both the RO4929097 population and the stage-matched controls by the proportion and 95% exact binomial confidence interval., Up to day 3 (of course 1)|Frequency and severity of adverse events as measured by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Toxicity will be determined with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval., Up to 1 year
Proportion of cancer stem cells (CD44+, CD24+, ESA+ population of cells) self-renewal and tumorigenesis as measured by FACS, Up to day 3 (of course 1)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on Notch inhibition via interrogation of Hes-1 expression in patients with pancreatic cancer.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effects of this regimen on pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis as compared to pancreatic stem cells from controls (patients who do not receive treatment).

II. To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on days 1-3 and 8-10 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 7 days after completion of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, patients undergo complete resection comprising pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy based on the anatomic location of the cancer. Tumor tissue from biopsy and surgery and blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacodynamic studies.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.
