Postoperative complications, The number of postoperative complications, either infectious or non-infectious. Postoperative complications will be assessed and classified according to modified Clavien-Dindo classification.

Surgical wounds are acute wounds that closure expected timeframe is about 4 weeks., 30 days|infectious complications, infection rate will be assessed by need for intervention or prescription of non-prophylactic antibiotics or presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)., 30 days
Length of hospital stay, will be measured by number of days of hospital stay., 30 days|Length of ICU stay, will be measured by number of days of ICU stay., 30 days
