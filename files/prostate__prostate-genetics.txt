Executive Summary
This executive summary reviews the topics covered in Genetics of Prostate Cancer and provides hyperlinks to detailed sections that describe available evidence on each topic.
Introduction
Prostate cancer is highly heritable. Up to 60% of prostate cancer risk is caused by inherited factors. This inherited risk is comprised of risk from common genetic variants and risk from pathogenic variants in moderate-risk and high-risk genes.
Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer
Risk factors for prostate cancer include age, a family history of prostate cancer and other cancers, genetics, and ancestry  (such as West African ancestry).
Risk Assessment for Prostate Cancer
Risk assessment for prostate cancer primarily includes intake of an individual's personal cancer history, family cancer history, and ancestry. These factors are then incorporated into recommendations for prostate cancer screening.
Indications for Prostate Cancer Germline Genetic Testing
Hereditary prostate cancer genetic testing criteria are based on one or more of the following: an individual's family history and/or genetic test results, personal/disease characteristics, and tumor sequencing results. Criteria for  prostate cancer genetic testing vary based on current guidelines and expert opinion.
Genetic Testing Approach for Prostate Cancer
Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become readily available and patent restrictions have been eliminated, several clinical laboratories offer multigene panel testing at a cost that is comparable to that of single-gene testing.
Germline Genetics for Prostate Cancer
The bulk of inherited prostate cancer risk is conferred by hundreds of genetic polymorphisms, which are common in the general population. Each of these polymorphisms provides a slight increase in prostate cancer risk. For a subset of individuals, prostate cancer risk is caused by rare, deleterious variants located in specific genes.
Prostate Cancer Genetics: Screening, Surveillance, and Treatment
This section focuses on the impacts of genetics on prostate cancer screening, surveillance, and treatment. Genetic test results are increasingly driving targeted therapy options and strategies for treatment in oncology.
Introduction
Prostate cancer is highly
heritable
. Up to 60% of prostate cancer risk is caused by inherited factors.[
1
,
2
] The inherited risk is comprised of risk from common genetic variants and risk from pathogenic variants in moderate-risk and high-risk genes. As with breast and colon cancers,
familial
clustering of prostate cancer has been reported frequently.[
3
]
Prostate cancer clusters with particular intensity in some families. Highly to moderately
penetrant
genetic variants
are thought to be associated with prostate cancer risk in these families. Members of these families may benefit from
genetic counseling
. Additionally, polygenic risk scores derived from combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms, in addition to other risk factors like family history, race, and age/stage of prostate cancer diagnosis, have also been developed.[
4
,
5
] Recommendations and guidelines for genetic counseling referrals are based on an individual's age at prostate cancer diagnosis,   prostate cancer stage at diagnosis, and specific patterns of cancer in the family  history.[
6
,
7
] However, uptake of genetic testing based on an individual's family history of prostate cancer and/or a diagnosis of prostate cancer is variably implemented across practice settings and geographical regions.[

Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer
In This Section
Age
Ancestry
Family History of Prostate Cancer and Other Cancers
Genetics
Age
Prostate cancer risk correlates with age.  Prostate cancer is rarely seen in men younger than 40 years. The incidence rises rapidly with each decade thereafter.  For example, the probability of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is 1 in 468 for men aged 49 years or younger, 1 in 26 for men aged 50 through 64 years, 1 in 9 for men aged 65 through 84 years, and 1 in 31 for men aged 85 years and older. Lifetime  risk of developing prostate cancer is 1 in 8.[
1
] Approximately 10% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed in men younger than 56 years and represent early-onset prostate cancer. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program show that early-onset prostate cancer diagnosis rates are  increasing, and there is evidence that cases may be more aggressive in this subpopulation.[
2
]
Ancestry
The risk of developing prostate cancer is dramatically higher in Black American individuals, who predominantly have West African ancestry (191.5 cases/100,000 men) when compared with other racial and ethnic groups in the United States:
White: 114.5 cases/100,000 men.
Asian American or Pacific Islander: 63.1 cases/100,000 men.
American Indian or Alaska Native: 99.1 cases/100,000 men.
Hispanic or Latino: 92.9 cases/100,000 men.[
1
]
Prostate cancer mortality rates in Black individuals (37.2 deaths/100,000 men) are higher than those in other racial and ethnic groups in the United States:
White: 18.1 deaths/100,000 men.
Asian American or Pacific Islander: 8.8 deaths/100,000 men.
American Indian or Alaska Native: 21.2 deaths/100,000 men.
Hispanic or Latino: 15.4 deaths/100,000 men.[
1
]
Globally, prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates also vary widely from country to country.[
3
]   The etiology of this variation in prostate cancer risk is likely multifactorial and may be due to  biological factors, access to health care, and other social determinants of health.[
4
,
5
]
Family History of Prostate Cancer and Other Cancers
Results from several large case-control studies and cohort studies representing various populations suggest that family history is a major risk factor in prostate cancer.[
6
-
10
]  A family history of a brother or father with prostate cancer increases the risk of prostate cancer, and the risk is inversely related to the age of the
affected
relative.[
7
,
8
,
11
-
13
]    Risk is increased when a first-degree relative (FDR) was diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years.
A meta-analysis of 33 epidemiological case-control and cohort-based studies has provided detailed information regarding risk ratios related to family history of prostate cancer (for more information, see
Table 1
).[
14
]

Adapted from Kiciński et al.[
14
]
Brother(s) with prostate cancer diagnosed at any age
3.14 (2.37–4.15)
Father with prostate cancer diagnosed at any age
2.35 (2.02–2.72)
One affected FDR diagnosed at any age
2.48 (2.25–2.74)
Affected  FDRs diagnosed  <65 y
2.87 (2.21–3.74)
Affected  FDRs diagnosed  ≥65 y
1.92 (1.49–2.47)
Second-degree relatives
diagnosed at any age
2.52 (0.99–6.46)
Two or more affected  FDRs diagnosed at any age
4.39 (2.61–7.39)
A family history of breast cancer is also associated with increased prostate cancer risk. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), comprising over 40,000 men, those with a family history of breast cancer had a 21% higher risk of developing prostate cancer overall and a 34% increased risk of developing a lethal form of prostate cancer.[
10
] This is consistent with findings from previous cohorts,[
15
] though, notably, not all series have detected this association.[
16
,
17
] The HPFS and other studies have also shown that men with a family history of both prostate and breast/ovarian cancers were at an even higher risk of prostate cancer compared with men with a family history of either prostate or breast/ovarian cancer alone.[
10
,
16
] A proportion of the increased prostate cancer risk associated with family history of breast cancer is likely due to
pathogenic variants
in the
DNA
damage repair pathway, most commonly
BRCA2
.[
18
-
21
] For more information, see the
BRCA1 and BRCA2
section. The association between prostate and breast cancers in families appears bidirectional. Among women, a family history of prostate cancer is likewise associated with increased risk of breast cancer.[
22
,
23
]
An association also exists between prostate cancer risk and colon cancer. Men with germline variants in DNA mismatch repair genes are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer.[
24
]
One study reported an approximately twofold increased risk of prostate cancer among first- and second-degree relatives of
probands
with colorectal cancer meeting Amsterdam I or Amsterdam II criteria for Lynch syndrome.[
25
] For more information on Amsterdam criteria, see the
Defining Lynch syndrome families
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.
Family history has been shown to be a risk factor for men of different races and ethnicities.  In a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer among African American, White, and Asian American individuals in the United States  (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Hawaii) and Canada (Vancouver and Toronto),[
26
]   5% of controls and 13% of all cases reported a father, brother, or son with prostate cancer.  These prevalence estimates were somewhat lower among Asian American individuals than among African American or White individuals.  A positive family history was associated with a twofold to threefold increase in relative risk (RR) in each of the three ethnic groups.  The overall odds ratio (OR) associated with a family history of prostate cancer was 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–3.3) with adjustment for age and ethnicity.[
26
]
Evidence shows that a family history of prostate cancer can be associated with inferior clinical outcomes. When  patients were referred for prostate biopsy (typically due to elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), men with a family history of the disease were at increased risk for high-grade prostate cancer when compared with patients without a family history.[
27
] A large population-based study from Utah reported that men with either of the following were at an increased risk for early-onset prostate cancer: 1) three or more  FDRs diagnosed with prostate cancer, or 2) two or more FDRs  or second-degree relatives with prostate cancer.[
28
]
Genetics
There are multiple germline pathogenic variants and single nucleotide variants  that are associated with prostate cancer risk. For more information about these genetic variants, see the National Human Genome Research Institute's
GWAS catalog
. Germline genetic testing may be indicated to assess prostate cancer risk and/or inform therapeutic decision-making in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer risks vary depending on  the specific gene and pathogenic variant involved.[
29
] Prostate cancer heritability  (when considering low, moderate, and high-penetrant genetic factors) can be as high 57% (95% CI, 51%–63%).[
30
] Genetic variants that contribute to this risk are continuously being identified.[
28
] Prostate cancer heritability rates may also vary in different racial and ethnic populations.[

Germline Genetics for Prostate Cancer
section.

Risk Assessment for Prostate Cancer
Risk assessment for prostate cancer primarily involves the intake of a patient's family cancer history. Family history intake includes the following:
Information about cancers
*
in male and female blood relatives on maternal and paternal sides of the family.
Ages at cancer diagnoses.
Ages of death from cancer.
The number of relatives with metastatic prostate cancer.
The number of relatives who died of prostate cancer.
Information on relatives who are undergoing cancer screening, if known.
*Cancers include, but are not limited to, the following: prostate, breast, pancreas, colorectal, uterine, ovarian, upper gastrointestinal (GI), and skin cancers.
Ancestry is also an important component of the family history. Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry on either side of the family may prompt greater suspicion for
founder pathogenic variants
in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
, which could lead to  increased cancer risk in a family. Men of African descent (Black men) also have a higher risk for prostate cancer. Within the United States, Black men (191.5 cases/100,000 men) have approximately a 67% higher incidence rate of prostate cancer  than White  men (114.5 cases/100,000 men).[
1
]  Black men also have more than twice the rate of prostate cancer–specific death (37.2 deaths/100,000 men) than White men (18.1 deaths/100,000 men).[
1
] This increased prostate cancer risk may be due to  challenges, including the following: 1) access to care,  2) limited awareness of prostate cancer screening programs, 3) limited engagement in prostate cancer screening/genetic testing, and 4)  the presence of specific genetic markers that can increase prostate cancer risk.[
2
-
6
]
These familial risk factors are then incorporated into recommendations for prostate cancer screening. National guidelines recommend discussing prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam between the ages of 45 and 75 years  for individuals at average risk for prostate cancer.
In contrast, prostate cancer screening is recommended to start at age 40 years for  individuals in these high-risk groups:
Men of Black/African descent.
Men with germline pathogenic variants that increase prostate cancer risk.
Men who have family histories with features suggestive of hereditary cancer syndromes like the following:
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome:
Family members with ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, metastatic/high-risk prostate cancer, male breast cancer, and/or  breast cancer diagnosed at or before age 50 years.
Lynch syndrome:
Family members with colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed at or before age 50 years, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, urothelial cancer, and/or upper GI cancer.
Hereditary prostate cancer:
Multiple generations with prostate cancer, deaths from prostate cancer, and/or family members with metastatic prostate cancer.[
4
-
6
]
The role of additional markers, such as polygenic risk scores, in prostate cancer risk assessment is evolving. Additional screening strategies,   like multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), are also being studied.

Indications for Prostate Cancer Germline Genetic Testing
The criteria for consideration of genetic testing for prostate cancer varies depending on the current guidelines and expert opinion consensus, as summarized in
Table 2
.[
1
-
5
]  Hereditary prostate cancer genetic testing criteria are  based on an individual's family history, personal/disease characteristics, and
tumor sequencing
results.  The
genes
recommended for genetic testing vary based on national  guidelines and consensus conference recommendations. Precision therapy has emerged as a major driver for germline genetic testing and may be a separate reason to pursue testing beyond the criteria stated in
Table 2
. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Prostate Cancer guidelines recommend testing  for at least
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
ATM
,
CHEK2,
PALB2
,
HOXB13,
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
, and
PMS2
for men meeting specific testing indications.[
4
] A consensus conference in 2019 addressed the role of genetic testing for inherited prostate cancer.[
6
]  Family history–based indications for genetic testing included testing for
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
,
HOXB13
,
DNA
mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and
ATM
. Tumor sequencing that identifies variants that may be germline in origin, like variants  in
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, DNA MMR genes, or
ATM
and other genes, warrants confirmatory
germline
testing.
Somatic
findings for which germline testing is considered include the following:
Somatic variants
that are associated with germline susceptibility.
Hypermutated tumors, which are indicative of DNA MMR.
Chromosome
rearrangements in specific tumors.
High-variant
allele
frequency (percent of sequence reads that have the identified variant). Variant allele frequency can be altered for reasons not associated with germline variants such as
loss of heterozygosity
, ploidy (copy number variants), tumor heterogeneity, and tumor sample purity.[
7
]
It is recommended that  germline genetic testing candidates undergo genetic education and counseling before participating in testing. Genetic counseling provides information about genetic testing and possible testing outcomes (including risks, benefits, limitations, and familial, psychological, and health care–based implications that vary depending on results). Genetic education and counseling help individuals make informed decisions about whether they should undergo germline genetic testing.

Genetic Testing Approach for Prostate Cancer
Since
next-generation sequencing
(NGS) has become readily available and patent restrictions have been eliminated, several clinical laboratories offer
multigene panel
testing at a cost that is comparable to that of single-gene testing. Three types of genetic test results can be reported: 1) pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, 2)  variants of uncertain significance (VUS), or 3) negative results. Patients need pretest genetic counseling or informed consent to understand germline genetic testing results. For example, patients should understand that VUS can be reported, that VUS do not immediately impact care/inform cancer risk, and that VUS may be reclassified  as either pathogenic/likely pathogenic or benign/likely benign when more data are acquired. For more information on genetic counseling considerations and research associated with multigene testing, see the
Multigene (panel) testing
section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling.

Common Risk Variants and Polygenic Risk Scores for Prostate Cancer
GWAS and SNPs
Germline SNPs associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness
Prostate cancer is highly heritable. More than half of an individual's prostate cancer risk is inherited from one's parents.[
1
] Considerable work has been performed to identify and characterize inherited germline  variants that contribute to the genetic portion of prostate cancer risk. For most patients, the bulk of inherited risk is conferred by hundreds of genetic polymorphisms, which are common in the general population. Each of these polymorphisms  slightly increases prostate cancer risk. For a small subset of patients, prostate cancer risk is generated by rare, deleterious variants located in specific genes. In this section, we will describe the specific genes implicated in inherited prostate cancer risk and the many common polymorphisms (which are typically located in the genomic space between genes) that create a risk profile for most patients.

Genetic architecture of cancer risk. This graph depicts the general finding of a low relative risk associated with common, low-penetrance genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies, and a higher relative risk associated with rare, high-penetrance genetic variants, such as mutations in the
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and the mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome.

Prevalence of
BRCA
founder pathogenic variants in men with prostate cancer
Ashkenazi Jewish population
Several studies in Israel and in North America have analyzed the frequency of
BRCA
founder pathogenic variants
among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) men with prostate cancer.[
5
-
7
] Two specific
BRCA1
pathogenic variants (185delAG and 5382insC) and one
BRCA2
pathogenic variant (6174delT) are common in individuals of AJ ancestry. Carrier frequencies for these pathogenic variants in the general Jewish population are 0.9% (95% CI, 0.7%–1.1%) for the 185delAG pathogenic variant, 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%–0.4%) for the 5382insC pathogenic variant, and 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%–1.5%) for the
BRCA2
6174delT pathogenic variant.[
8
-
11
] In these studies, the relative risks (RRs) were commonly greater than 1, but only a few were statistically significant. Many of these studies were not sufficiently powered to rule out a lower, but clinically significant, risk of prostate cancer in carriers of Ashkenazi
BRCA
founder pathogenic variants.
Table 4
summarizes the findings from a systemic review and meta-analysis, which help clarify the relationship between
BRCA
pathogenic variants and prostate cancer risk in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide further evidence that prostate cancer occurs more often in Ashkenazi Jewish
BRCA

BRCA1
85delAG or

Prostate cancer aggressiveness in carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants
A systematic review and meta-analysis  found that
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
showed differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness.[
3
] The pooled, random-effects RRs of aggressive prostate cancer (using any definition of aggressiveness) were the following for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
:
BRCA1
: RR, 1.98 (1.35–2.90; I² = 0%).
BRCA2
: RR, 6.08 (3.44–10.8; I² = 82%).
Men harboring pathogenic variants in the United Kingdom and Ireland were prospectively followed for prostate cancer diagnoses (
BRCA1
[n = 16/376] and
BRCA2
[n = 26/447]; median follow-up, 5.9 y and 5.3 y, respectively).[
12
] The prostate cancers identified covered the spectrum of Gleason scores from less than 6 to greater than 8; however, they  differed by gene:
BRCA1
Gleason score less than 6; standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 3.50 (95% CI, 1.67–7.35) and Gleason score greater than 7; SIR, 1.80 (95% CI, 0.89–3.65).
BRCA2
Gleason score less than 6; SIR, 3.03 (95% CI, 1.24–7.44) and Gleason score greater than 7; SIR, 5.07 (95% CI, 3.20–8.02).
This study was followed by a large, retrospective, international study of men diagnosed with prostate cancer who had pathogenic variants in
BRCA1
(n = 3,453) and
BRCA2
(n = 3,051).[
13
] In
BRCA1
, there were no statistically significant associations between overall prostate cancer risk/prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8 or higher
and
pathogenic sequence variant types, pathogenic variant function, or the region of the gene in which a pathogenic variant occurred, such as RING or
BRCA1
C-terminal (BRCT) domains. In contrast,  two prostate cancer cluster regions were identified in
BRCA2
: 1) 3’ of
BRCA2
c.7914 (hazard ratio [HR],1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25–2.52;
P
= .001),  and 2)
BRCA2
c.756–c.1000 (HR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.71–4.68;
P
= 4.0 x 10
-5
).
These studies suggest that prostate cancer in
BRCA
carriers is associated with aggressive disease features including a high Gleason score, and a high tumor stage and/or grade at diagnosis. This is a finding that warrants consideration when patients undergo cancer risk assessment and genetic counseling.[
14
] Research is under way to gain insight into the biological basis of aggressive prostate cancer in carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants. One study of 14
BRCA2
germline pathogenic variant carriers reported that
BRCA2
-associated prostate cancers  harbor increased genomic instability and a mutational profile that more closely resembles metastatic prostate cancer than localized disease, with genomic and epigenomic dysregulation of the
MED12L
/
MED12
axis similar to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.[
15
]
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
and survival outcomes
Analyses of prostate cancer cases in families with known
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants have been examined for survival. A meta-analysis that examined
BRCA1/BRCA2
prostate cancer risk,
BRCA1/BRCA2
frequency in patients with prostate cancer, and prostate cancer mortality found that
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
carriers who were diagnosed with prostate cancer had decreased cancer-specific survival (HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.98–3.22;
P
< .0001) when compared with noncarriers.[
16
] Similarly, prostate cancer overall survival (OS) was lower in men with
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.55–2.79;
P
< .0001).
BRCA2
carriers had decreased  cancer-specific survival (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.00–3.47;
P
< .0001) and OS (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.64–2.99;
P
< .0001) values when compared with noncarriers.
BRCA2
carriers (
BRCA2
, 71.1%; 95% CI, 31.4%–93.0%) were also more likely to have prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7 or greater than
BRCA1
carriers (
BRCA1
, 36.3%; 95% CI, 20.0%–56.5%).
HOXB13
Key points
HOXB13
was the first gene found to be associated with hereditary prostate cancer. The
HOXB13
G84E variant has been extensively studied because of its association with prostate cancer risk.
Overall risk of prostate cancer with the G84E variant ranges from 3- to 5-fold, with a higher risk of early-onset prostate cancer with the G84E variant of up to 10-fold.
Penetrance
for carriers of the G84E variant is an approximate 60% lifetime risk of prostate cancer by age 80 years.
There is no clear association of the G84E variant with aggressive prostate cancer or other cancers.
Preliminary studies suggest additional variants in
HOXB13
may be relevant for prostate cancer risk in diverse populations.
Background
Linkage to 17q21-22 was initially reported by the UM-PCGP from 175 pedigrees of families with hereditary prostate cancer.[
17
] Fine-mapping of this region provided strong evidence of linkage (LOD score, 5.49) and a narrow candidate interval (15.5 Mb) for a putative susceptibility gene among 147 families with four or more affected men and average age at diagnosis of 65 years or younger.[
18
]  The exons of 200 genes  in the 17q21-22 region were sequenced in DNA from 94 unrelated patients from hereditary prostate cancer families (from the UM-PCGP and Johns Hopkins University).[
19
]
Probands
from four families were discovered to have a recurrent pathogenic variant (G84E) in
HOXB13
, and 18 men with prostate cancer from these four families carried the pathogenic variant.  The pathogenic variant status was determined in 5,083 additional cases and 2,662 controls. Carrier frequencies and ORs for prostate cancer risk were as follows:
Men with a positive family history of prostate cancer,  2.2% versus negative, 0.8% (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6–5.1;
P
= 1.2 × 10
-4
).
Men younger than 55 years at diagnosis, 2.2% versus older than 55 years, 0.8% (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6–4.7;
P
= 1.1 × 10
-4
).
Men with a positive family history of prostate cancer and younger than 55 years at diagnosis, 3.1% versus   a negative  family history of prostate cancer and age at diagnosis older than 55 years, 0.6% (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.4–12.2;
P
= 2.0 × 10
-6
).
Men with a positive family history of prostate cancer and older than 55 years at diagnosis, 1.2%.
Controls,  0.1% to 0.2%.[
19
]
The
clinical  utility
of genetic testing for the
HOXB13
G84E variant is evolving.[
20
,
21
]
Validation and confirmatory studies
A validation study from the International Consortium of Prostate Cancer Genetics confirmed
HOXB13
as a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer risk.[
22
]  Within carrier families, the G84E pathogenic variant was more common among men with prostate cancer than among
unaffected
men (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 2.56–7.64).  The G84E pathogenic variant was also significantly overtransmitted from parents to affected offspring (
P
= 6.5 × 10
-6
).
Additional studies have emerged that better define the carrier frequency and prostate cancer risk associated with the
HOXB13
G84E pathogenic variant.[
19
,
23
-
28
] This pathogenic variant appears to be restricted to White men, primarily of European descent.[
19
,
23
-
25
] The highest carrier frequency of 6.25% was reported in Finnish early-onset cases.[
26
] A pooled analysis of European Americans that included 9,016 cases and 9,678 controls found an overall G84E pathogenic variant frequency of 1.34% among cases and 0.28% among controls.[
27
]
Risk of prostate cancer by
HOXB13
G84E pathogenic variant status has been reported to vary by age of onset, family history, and geographical region.  A validation study in an independent cohort of 9,988 cases and 61,994 controls from six studies of men of European ancestry, including 4,537 cases and 54,444 controls from Iceland whose genotypes were largely imputed, reported an OR of 7.06 (95% CI, 4.62–10.78;
P
= 1.5 × 10
−19
) for prostate cancer risk by G84E carrier status.[
29
]  A pooled analysis reported a prostate cancer OR of 4.86 (95% CI, 3.18–7.69;
P
= 3.48  × 10
-17
) in men with
HOXB13
pathogenic variants compared with noncarriers; this increased to an OR of 8.41 (95% CI, 5.27–13.76;
P
= 2.72 ×10
-22
) among men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 55 years or younger.  The OR was 7.19 (95% CI, 4.55–11.67;
P
= 9.3 × 10
-21
) among men with a
positive family history of prostate cancer and  3.09 (95% CI, 1.83–5.23;
P
= 6.26 × 10
-6
) among men with a negative family history of prostate cancer.[
27
]  A meta-analysis that included 24,213 cases and 73,631 controls of European descent revealed an overall OR for prostate cancer by carrier status of  4.07 (95% CI, 3.05–5.45;
P
< .00001).  Risk of prostate cancer varied by geographical region:  United States (OR, 5.10; 95% CI, 3.21–8.10;
P
< .00001), Canada (OR, 5.80; 95% CI, 1.27–26.51;
P
= .02), Northern Europe (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.81–4.64;
P
< .00001), and Western Europe (OR, 8.47; 95% CI, 3.68–19.48;
P
< .00001).[
24
] In addition, the association between the G84E pathogenic variant and prostate cancer risk was higher for early-onset cases (OR, 10.11; 95% CI, 5.97–17.12).  There was no significant association with aggressive disease in the meta-analysis.
Another meta-analysis that included 11 case-control studies also reported higher risk estimates for prostate cancer in
HOXB13
G84E carriers (OR, 4.51; 95% CI, 3.28–6.20;
P
< .00001) and found a stronger association between
HOXB13
G84E  and early-onset disease (OR, 9.73; 95% CI, 6.57–14.39;
P
< .00001).[
30
] An additional meta-analysis of 25 studies that included 51,390 cases and 93,867 controls revealed an OR for prostate cancer of 3.248 (95% CI, 2.121–3.888). The association was most significant in White individuals (OR, 2.673; 95% CI, 1.920–3.720), especially those of European descent. No association was found for breast or colorectal cancer.[
31
] One population-based, case-control study from the United States confirmed the association of the G84E pathogenic variant with prostate cancer (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.21–8.96) and reported a suggestive association with  aggressive disease.[
32
]  In addition, one study identified no men of AJ ancestry who carried the G84E pathogenic variant.[
33
] A case-control study from the United Kingdom that included 8,652 cases and 5,252 controls also confirmed the association of
HOXB13
G84E with  prostate cancer (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.94–4.59;
P
= 6.27 × 10
-8
).[
34
] The risk was higher among men with a family history  of the disease (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 2.86–7.34;
P
= 3.1 × 10
−8
) and in early-onset prostate cancer (diagnosed at age 55 y or younger) (OR,  3.11; 95% CI, 1.98–5.00;
P
= 6.1 × 10
−7
).  No association was found between carrier status and Gleason score, cancer stage, OS, or cancer-specific survival.
However, a 2018 publication of a study combining multiple prostate cancer cases and controls of Nordic origin along with functional analysis reported that simultaneous presence of
HOXB13
(G84E) and
CIP2A
(R229Q) predisposes men to an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR, 21.1;
P
= .000024).[
35
] Furthermore, dual carriers had elevated risk for high Gleason score (OR, 2.3;
P
= .025) and worse prostate cancer–specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9;
P
= .048). Clinical validation is needed.
HOXB13
pathogenic variants in diverse populations
A study of Chinese men with and without prostate cancer failed to identify the
HOXB13
G84E pathogenic variant; however, there was an excess of a novel variant, G135E, in cases compared with controls.[
36
] A large study of approximately 20,000 Japanese men with and without prostate cancer identified another novel
HOXB13
variant, G132E, which was associated with prostate cancer with an OR of 6.08 (95% CI, 3.39–11.59).[
37
]
Two studies confirmed the association between the
HOXB13
X285K variant and increased prostate cancer risk in African American men after this variant was identified in Martinique.[
38
] One of these was a  single-institution study, which sequenced
HOXB13
in a clinical patient population of 1,048 African American men undergoing prostatectomy for prostate cancer.[
39
] The
HOXB13
X285K variant was identified in eight patients.  In a case–case analysis, X285K variant carriers were at increased risk of developing clinically significant prostate cancer (1.2% X285K carrier rate in  prostate cancers with a Gleason score ≥7  vs. 0% X285K carrier rate in prostate cancers with Gleason score <7;
P
= .028). Similarly, X285K variant carriers also had an increased chance of developing prostate cancer at an early age (2.4% X285K carrier rate in patients <50 years vs. 0.5% X285K carrier rate in patients ≥50 years; OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 1.00–28.52;
P
= .03). A second study included  11,688 prostate cancer cases and 10,673 controls from multiple large consortia.[
40
] The
HOXB13
X285K variant was only present in men of West African ancestry and was associated with a 2.4-fold increased chance of developing prostate cancer (95% CI, 1.5–3.9;
P
= 2 x 10
-4
). Individuals with the  X285K variant were also more likely to have aggressive and advanced prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥8: OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.3–9.5;
P
= 2 x 10
-5
; stage T3/T4: OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.0–10.0;
P
= 2 x 10
-4
; metastatic disease: OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.9–13.7;
P
= .001). This information is important to consider when developing genetic tests for
HOXB13
pathogenic variants in broader populations.
Penetrance
Penetrance estimates for prostate cancer development in carriers of the
HOXB13
G84E pathogenic variant are also being reported.  One study from Sweden estimated a 33% lifetime risk of prostate cancer among G84E carriers.[
41
]  Another study from Australia reported an age-specific cumulative risk of prostate cancer of up to 60% by age 80 years.[
42
] A study in the United Kingdom that included
HOXB13
genotype data from nearly 12,000 men with prostate cancer enrolled between 1993 and 2014 reported that the average predicted risk of prostate cancer by age 85 years is 62% (95% CI, 47%–76%) for carriers of the G84E pathogenic variant.  The risk of developing prostate cancer in variant carriers increased if the men had affected family members, especially those diagnosed at an early age.[
43
]
Biology
HOXB13
plays a role in prostate cancer development  and interacts with the androgen receptor; however, the mechanism by which it contributes to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer remains unknown. This is the first gene identified to account for a fraction of hereditary prostate cancer, particularly early-onset prostate cancer. The clinical utility and implications for genetic counseling regarding
HOXB13
G84E or other pathogenic variants have yet to be defined.
DNA mismatch repair genes (Lynch syndrome)
Five genes are implicated in mismatch repair (MMR), namely
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
,
PMS2
, and
EPCAM
.  Germline pathogenic variants in these five  genes have been associated with Lynch syndrome, which manifests by cases of nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and a constellation of other cancers in families, including endometrial, ovarian, duodenal cancers, and transitional cell cancers of the ureter and renal pelvis. For more information about other cancers that are associated with Lynch syndrome,  see the
Lynch syndrome
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer. Reports have suggested that prostate cancer may be observed in men harboring an MMR gene pathogenic variant.[
44
,
45
] The first quantitative study described nine cases of prostate cancer occurring in a population-based cohort of 106 Norwegian male carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants or obligate carriers.[
46
] The expected number of cases among these 106 men was 1.52 (
P
< .01); the men were younger at the time of diagnosis (60.4 y vs. 66.6 y;
P
= .006) and had more evidence of Gleason score of 8 to 10 (
P
< .00001) than the cases from the Norwegian Cancer Registry.  Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the cumulative risk of prostate cancer diagnosis by age 70 years was 30% in carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants and 8% in the general population.  This finding awaits confirmation in additional populations. A population-based case-control study examined haplotype-tagging SNVs in three MMR genes (
MLH1
,
MSH2
, and
PMS2
). This study provided some evidence supporting the contribution of genetic variation in
MLH1
and overall risk of prostate cancer.[
47
]  To assess the contribution of prostate cancer as a feature of Lynch syndrome, one study performed
microsatellite instability
(MSI) testing on prostate cancer tissue blocks from families enrolled in a prostate cancer family registry who also reported a history of colon cancer.  Among 35 tissue blocks from 31 distinct families, two tumors from families with MMR gene pathogenic variants were found to be MSI-high. The authors conclude that MSI is rare in hereditary prostate cancer.[
48
] Other studies are attempting to characterize rates of prostate cancer in Lynch syndrome families and correlate molecular features with prostate cancer risk.[
49
]
One study that included two familial cancer registries found an increased cumulative incidence and risk of prostate cancer among  198 independent families with MMR gene pathogenic variants and Lynch syndrome.[
50
] The cumulative lifetime risk of prostate cancer (to age 80 y) was 30.0% (95% CI, 16.54%–41.30%;
P
= .07) in carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants, whereas it was 17.84% in the general population, according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program estimates. There was a trend of increased  prostate cancer risk  in carriers of pathogenic variants by age 50 years, where the risk was 0.64% (95% CI, 0.24%–1.01%;
P
= .06),  compared with a risk of 0.26% in the general population. Overall, the HR (to age 80 y) for prostate cancer in carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants in the combined data set was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.31–3.03;
P
= .0013). Among men aged 20 to 59 years, the HR  was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.34–4.59;
P
= .0038).
A systematic review and meta-analysis that included 23 studies (6 studies with molecular characterization and 18 risk studies, of which 12 studies quantified risk for prostate cancer) reported an association of prostate cancer with Lynch syndrome.[
51
] In the six molecular studies included in the analysis, 73% (95% CI, 57%–85%) of prostate cancers in carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants were MMR deficient. The RR of prostate cancer in carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants was estimated to be 3.67 (95% CI, 2.32–6.67). Of the twelve risk studies, the RR of prostate cancer ranged from 2.11 to 2.28, compared with  that seen in the general population depending on carrier status, prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, or unknown male carrier status from families with a known pathogenic variant.
A study from three sites participating in the Colon Cancer Family Registry examined 32 cases of prostate cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 62 y; standard deviation,  8 y) in men with a documented MMR gene pathogenic variant (23
MSH2
carriers, 5
MLH1
carriers, and 4
MSH6
carriers).[
52
] Seventy-two percent (n = 23) had a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess MMR protein loss, which was observed in 22 tumors (69%);   the pattern of loss of protein expression was 100% concordant with the germline pathogenic variant. The RR of prostate cancer was highest in carriers of
MSH2
pathogenic variants (RR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.6–20.9); the RRs in carriers of
MLH1
and
MSH6
pathogenic variants were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–6.7) and 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–5.3), respectively.  Gleason scores ranged from 5 to 10; two tumors had a Gleason score of 5; 22 tumors had a Gleason score of  6 or 7; and eight tumors had a Gleason score higher than 8.  Sixty-seven percent (12 of 18) of the tumors were found to have perineural invasion, and 47% (9 of 19) had extracapsular invasion. A large observational cohort study, which included more than 6,000 MMR-variant carriers, reported an increased cumulative incidence of prostate cancer by age 70 years for specific MMR genes, as follows:
MLH1
(7.0; 95% CI, 4.2–11.9),
MSH2
(15.9; 95% CI, 11.2–22.5), and
PMS2
(4.6; 95% CI, 0.8–67.5). No significant increase in prostate cancer incidence was reported for
MSH6
.[
53
]
Although the risk of prostate cancer appears to be elevated in families with Lynch syndrome, strategies for germline testing for MMR gene pathogenic variants in index prostate cancer patients remain to be determined.
A study of 1,133 primary prostate adenocarcinomas and 43 neuroendocrine prostate cancers (NEPC) conducted screening by MSH2 immunohistochemistry with conﬁrmation by NGS.[
54
]  MSI was assessed by
polymerase chain reaction
and NGS. Of primary adenocarcinomas and NEPC, 1.2% (14/1,176) had MSH2 loss. Overall, 8% (7/91) of adenocarcinomas with primary Gleason pattern 5 (Gleason score 9–10) had MSH2 loss compared with 0.4% (5/1,042) of tumors with any other Gleason scores (
P
< .05). Three patients had germline variants in
MSH2
, of whom two had a primary Gleason score of 5.  Pending further confirmation, these findings may support universal MMR screening of prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9 to 10 to identify men who may be eligible for immunotherapy and germline testing.
EPCAM
testing has been included in some multigene panels likely due to
EPCAM
variants silencing
MSH2
.  Specific large genomic rearrangement variants at the 3’ end of
EPCAM
(which lies near the
MSH2
gene) induce methylation of the
MSH2
promoter, resulting in MSH2 protein loss.[
55
]  Pathogenic variants in
MSH2
are associated with Lynch syndrome and an  increase in prostate cancer risk.[
52
]  For more information on
EPCAM
and
MSH2
, see the
Gene-specific considerations and associated CRC risk
section or the
Lynch Syndrome
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer.  Thus far, studies have not found an association between increased prostate cancer  risk and
EPCAM
pathogenic variants.[
56
]
ATM
Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an
autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by
neurological deterioration, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency states, and
hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.  It is estimated that 1%
of the general population may be
heterozygous
carriers of
ATM
pathogenic variants.[
57
] In the presence of DNA damage, the ATM protein is involved in mediating cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis.[
58
] Given evidence of other cancer risks in heterozygous
ATM
carriers, evidence of an association with prostate cancer susceptibility continues to emerge. A prospective case series of 10,317 Danish individuals who had a  36-year follow-up period, during which 2,056 individuals developed cancer, found that the
ATM
Ser49Cys  variant was associated with increased prostate cancer risk (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–5.0).[
58
] A retrospective case series of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer, who were not selected  based on a family history of cancer or the patient's age at cancer diagnosis, found that 1.6% of participants (11 of 692) had an
ATM
pathogenic variant.[
56
] Multiple independent reports have shown that the
ATM
P1054R variant, which is found in 2% of Europeans, is associated with increased prostate cancer risk.[
37
,
59
,
60
] For example, the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome  (PRACTICAL) consortium found  an OR of 1.16  (95% CI, 1.10–1.22)  for the
ATM
P1054 variant's association with prostate cancer risk.[
61
] A subsequent PRACTICAL consortium study had  14 groups (five from North America, six from Europe, and two from Australia) and 8,913 participants (5,560 cases and 3,353 controls). Next-generation
ATM
sequencing data were standardized and ClinVar classifications were used to categorize the variants as Tier 1 (likely pathogenic) or Tier 2 (potentially deleterious). Prostate cancer risk in Tier 1 variants had an OR of 4.4 (95% CI, 2.0–9.5).[
62
]
CHEK2
CHEK2
has also been investigated for a potential association with prostate cancer risk. For more information on other cancers associated with
CHEK2
pathogenic variants, see the
CHEK2
section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers and the
CHEK2
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer. A retrospective case series of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer unselected for cancer family history or age at diagnosis found 1.9%  (10 of 534 [men with data]) were found to have a
CHEK2
pathogenic variant.[
56
] A systematic review and meta-analysis from eight retrospective cohort studies examining the relationship between
CHEK2
variants (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, I157T) and prostate cancer confirmed the association of the 1100delC  (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.85–5.85;
P
= .00) and I157T (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.51–2.14;
P
= .00)  variants with prostate cancer susceptibility.[
63
] A genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on African American cases and controls identified a
missense variant
, I448S, which is associated with prostate cancer (risk allele frequency, 1.5%; OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.39–1.89,
P
= 7.50 × 10
-10
).[
64
] Further studies of
CHEK2
in large diverse populations are warranted.
TP53
TP53
has also been investigated for a potential association with prostate cancer risk. For more information about other cancers associated with
TP53
pathogenic variants, see the
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers. In a case series of 286 individuals from 107 families with a deleterious
TP53
variant, 403 cancer diagnoses were reported, of which 211 were the first primary cancer including two prostate cancers diagnosed after age 45 years. Prostate cancer was also reported in 4 of 61 men with a second primary cancer.[
65
] In a Dutch case series of 180 families meeting either classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni–like (LFL) family history criteria, a deleterious
TP53
variant was identified in 24 families with one case of prostate cancer found in each group (LFS or LFL). Prostate cancer risks varied on the basis of the family history criteria with LFS (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.01–3.00) and LFL (RR, 4.90; 95% CI, 0.10–27.00).[
66
]  In a French case series of 415 families with a deleterious
TP53
variant, four prostate cancers were reported, with a mean age at diagnosis of 63 years (range, 57–71 y).[
67
]
Germline
TP53
pathogenic variants have also been identified in men with prostate cancer who have undergone tumor testing. A prospective case series of 42 men with either localized, biochemically recurrent, or metastatic prostate cancer unselected for cancer family history or age at diagnosis undergoing tumor-only somatic testing found  that 2 of 42 men (5%) were found to have a suspected
TP53
germline pathogenic variant.[
68
]
Further evidence supports an association between prostate cancer and germline
TP53
pathogenic variants.[
69
-
71
] A retrospective study of 163 men (>18 y) with
TP53
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants from 132 known
TP53
families found that 19% (n = 31/163) of participants had diagnoses of prostate cancer.[
72
] Of these participants, 48% (n = 31) were older than age 50 years. The median age of prostate cancer diagnosis was 56 years (range, 50–64 y).  Locally advanced prostate cancer or de novo metastatic disease was found in 19% (n = 4) of men. Additionally, 40% (n = 8/20) of participants had high-grade  prostate cancer (Gleason score, >8) at the time of diagnosis. This study also combined the existing cohort with a prostate cancer cohort that had documented germline
TP53
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants.  This combined cohort had a prostate cancer relative risk of 9.1 (95% CI, 6.2–14;
P
< .0001).
NBN
NBN
, which is also known as
NBS1
, has been investigated due to a potential association with prostate cancer risk, with the literature constantly evolving. Studies mostly from Polish populations reported that the
NBN
657del5 variant is associated with  prostate cancer risk (OR, 2.5;
P
< .001), mortality (HR, 1.6;
P
= .001),  and familial prostate cancer (OR, 4.6;
P
< .0001).[
73
,
74
] One of these studies (from Poland) reported adverse survival when individuals with the
NBN
657del5 variant  also carried the
NBN
E185Q GG genotype (HR,1.9;
P
= .0004).[
73
] In the metastatic setting, a retrospective case series of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer (unselected for cancer family history or age at diagnosis) found that 0.3% (2 of 692 men) had an
NBN
pathogenic variant.[
56
] Some clinical genetic testing laboratories do not include
NBN
on their prostate cancer panels, since
NBN
's association with prostate cancer is based on preliminary evidence. Further data will be required to fully understand the role and generalizability of
NBN
and its association with prostate cancer.
Multigene testing studies in prostate cancer
Prevalence of pathogenic variants with prostate cancer risk on multigene panel testing
The following section gives information about additional genes that may be on hereditary prostate cancer
panel
tests.
One retrospective case series of 692 men with metastatic prostate cancer unselected for cancer family history or age at diagnosis assessed the incidence of germline pathogenic variants in 16 DNA repair genes.  Pathogenic variants were identified in 11.8% (82 of 692), a rate higher than in men with localized prostate cancer (4.6%,
P
< .001), suggesting that genetic aberrations are more commonly observed in men with aggressive forms of disease.[
56
] Two studies were published using data from a clinical testing laboratory database. The first study evaluated 1,328 men with prostate cancer and reported an overall pathogenic variant rate of 15.6%, including 10.9% in DNA repair genes.[
75
] A second study involved a larger cohort of 3,607 men with prostate cancer, some of whom had been included in the prior publication.[
76
] The reported pathogenic variant rate was 17.2%. Overall, pathogenic variant rates by gene were consistently reported between the two studies and were as follows:
BRCA2
, 4.74%;
CHEK2
, 2.88%;
ATM
, 2.03%; and
BRCA1
, 1.25%.[
76
] The most commonly aberrant gene in this cohort was
BRCA2
. The first publication reported associations between family history of breast cancer and high Gleason score (≥8).[
75
] The second publication focused on the percentage of men with pathogenic variants who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network national guidelines for genetic testing and found that 229 individuals (37%) with pathogenic variants in this cohort did not meet guidelines for genetic testing.[
76
]  A systematic evidence review examined the median prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in the DNA damage-response pathway, including
ATM
,
ATR
,
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
CHEK2
,
FANCA
,
MLH1
,
MRE11A
,
NBN
,
PALB2
, and
RAD51C
. The overall prevalence was 18.6% (range, 17.2%–19%; n = 1,712) for general prostate cancer, 11.6% (range, 11.4%–11.8%; n = 1,261) for metastatic prostate cancer, 8.3% (range, 7.5%–9.1%; n = 738) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and 29.3% (range, 7.3%–92.67%; n = 327) for
familial
prostate cancer.[
77
]
A case-control study in a Japanese population of 7,636 men with prostate cancer and 12,366 men without prostate cancer evaluated pathogenic variants in eight genes (
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
CHEK2
,
ATM
,
NBN
,
PALB2
,
HOXB13
, and
BRIP1
) for an association with prostate cancer.[
37
]  The study found strong associations for
BRCA2
(OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 3.55–9.32),
HOXB13
(OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 2.84–8.19), and
ATM
(OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.63–5.15). The study supports a population-specific assessment of the genetic contribution to prostate cancer risk.
Germline pathogenic variants associated with metastatic prostate cancer
The metastatic prostate cancer setting is also contributing insights into the germline pathogenic variant spectrum of prostate cancer. Clinical sequencing of 150 metastatic tumors from men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer identified alterations in genes involved in DNA repair in 23% of men.[
78
] Interestingly, 8% of these variants were pathogenic and present in the germline. Another study focused on tumor-normal sequencing of advanced and metastatic cancers identified germline pathogenic variants in 19.6% of men (71 of 362) with prostate cancer.[
79
] Germline pathogenic variants were found in
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
,
PALB2
,
PMS2
,
ATM
,
BRIP1
,
NBN
, as well as other genes. These and other studies are summarized in
Table 6
. The contribution of germline variants identified from large sequencing efforts to inherited prostate cancer predisposition requires molecular confirmation of genes not classically linked to prostate cancer risk.

Common Risk Variants and Polygenic Risk Scores for Prostate Cancer
The most prevalent prostate cancer risk variants in the human genome were discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS evaluate the millions of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human population (typically >5% prevalence) and ask if each variant is enriched in individuals with a given disease. With great statistical rigor, GWAS have revealed over 250 prostate cancer risk variants. Each single SNP confers a very modest prostate cancer risk. However, when compounded, these SNPs comprise a substantial portion of inherited prostate cancer risk.  Research continues to translate these discoveries into clinical practice,  with use in tools like polygenic risk scores (PRS).
GWAS and SNPs
GWAS can identify inherited genetic variants that influence a specific phenotype, such as risk of a particular disease.
For complex diseases, such as prostate cancer, risk of developing the disease is the product of multiple genetic and environmental factors; each individual factor contributes relatively little to overall risk.
To date, GWAS have discovered more than 250 common genetic variants associated with prostate cancer risk.
Individuals can be genotyped for all known prostate cancer risk markers relatively easily; but, to date, studies have not demonstrated that this information substantially refines risk estimates from commonly used variables, such as family history.
The clinical relevance of variants identified from GWAS remains unclear.
Although the statistical evidence for an association between genetic variation at these loci and prostate cancer risk is overwhelming, the clinical relevance of the variants and the mechanism(s) by which they lead to increased risk are unclear and will require further characterization. Additionally, these loci are associated with very modest risk estimates and explain only a fraction of overall inherited risk. However, when combined into a PRS, these confirmed genetic risk variants may prove to be useful for prostate cancer risk stratification and to identify men for targeted screening and early detection. Further work will include genome-wide analysis of rarer alleles catalogued via sequencing efforts. Disease-associated alleles with frequencies of less than 1% in the population may prove to be more highly penetrant and clinically useful. In addition, further work is needed to describe the landscape of genetic risk in non-European populations. Finally, until the individual and collective influences of genetic risk alleles are evaluated prospectively, their clinical utility will remain difficult to fully assess.
Beginning in 2006, multiple genome-wide studies seeking associations with prostate cancer risk converged on the same chromosomal locus, 8q24.[
81
-
94
] Since that time, more than ten genetic polymorphisms, all independently associated with disease, reside within five distinct 8q24 risk regions. The population-attributable risk of prostate cancer from the 8q24 risk alleles reported to date is 9.4%.[
95
]
Since prostate cancer risk loci have been discovered at 8q24, more than 250 variants have been identified at other chromosomal risk loci. These chromosomal risk loci were detected by multistage GWAS, which were comprised of thousands of cases and controls and were validated in independent cohorts.[
96
] The most convincing associations reported to date for men of European ancestry are annotated in the
National Human Genome Research Institute GWAS catalog
.
Most prostate cancer GWAS data generated to date have been derived from populations of European descent. This shortcoming is profound, considering that linkage disequilibrium structure, SNV frequencies, and incidence of disease differ across ancestral groups. To provide meaningful genetic data to all patients, well-designed, adequately powered GWAS must be aimed at specific ethnic groups.[
97
] Most work in this regard has focused on African American, Chinese, and Japanese men. The most convincing associations reported to date for men of non-European ancestry are annotated in the
National Human Genome Research Institute GWAS catalog
.
The African American population is of particular interest because American men with West African ancestry are at higher risk of prostate cancer than any other group.  A handful of studies have sought to determine whether GWAS findings in men of European ancestry are applicable to men of African ancestry.[
64
,
98
,
99
] The majority of risk alleles (approximately 83%) are shared across African American and European American populations.  Three independent associations were subsequently replicated. All three variants were within or near long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) previously associated with prostate cancer, and two of the variants were unique to men of African ancestry.[
100
]
Statistically well-powered GWAS have also been launched to examine inherited cancer risk in Japanese and Chinese populations.  Investigators discovered that these populations share many risk regions observed in African American men.[

] Additionally, risk regions that are unique to these ancestral groups were identified (for more information, see the
National Human Genome Research Institute GWAS catalog
). Ongoing work in larger cohorts will validate and expand upon these findings.
Polygenic risk scores for prostate cancer
Current GWAS findings account for an estimated 58% of heritable prostate cancer risk. Another 6% of
familial
prostate cancer risk is attributed to rare genetic variants.[
105
] Efforts have been made to translate these discoveries into clinically useful metrics for risk stratification and early detection. PRS were devised to measure prostate cancer risk based on the burden of genetic risk variants that an individual inherits. Associations between PRS and disease risk clearly exist. However, it remains unclear whether screening PRS can appreciably influence long-term outcomes.
In a 2023 study, PRS were created for a multi-ethnic cohort of over 150,000 prostate cancer cases and over 750,000 controls.[
106
] A PRS was based on 451 prostate cancer risk variants validated via GWAS. The study accounted for genetic dose (i.e., homozygosity vs. heterozygosity). When focusing on men in the top quintile of PRS scores and comparing them to men in the middle of the distribution, men of European ancestry had an OR of  greater than 2-fold  for developing prostate cancer when compared with men who had average PRS scores. In men of African ancestry, those who belonged to the upper 16% of the PRS had a greater than 2-fold increased risk to develop prostate cancer before age 66 years when compared with those who had average PRS scores. Men in the upper quintile of the PRS represented over 50% of prostate cancer cases, including clinically aggressive cases. In contrast, those in the lowest quintile of the PRS represented fewer than 5% of prostate cancer cases.  These data suggest that PRS could inform prostate cancer screening.[
107
,
108
] Studies that were conducted prior to this 2023 study analyzed multi-ethnic cohorts and began validating models.[
109
-
120
] Further research is needed to determine whether a PRS devised using prostate cancer  risk SNPs can help identify clinically aggressive disease.[
121
]
As GWAS elucidate these networks, it is hoped that new therapies and chemopreventive strategies will follow.[

Germline SNPs associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness
Prostate cancer is biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Many tumors are indolent and are successfully managed with observation alone. Other tumors are quite aggressive and prove deadly. Several variables are used to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis, such as Gleason score and PSA, but these are imperfect. Additional markers are needed because sound treatment decisions depend on accurate prognostic information. Germline genetic variants are attractive markers because they are present, easily detectable, and static throughout life.
Findings regarding inherited risk of aggressive disease are considered preliminary. Further work is needed to validate findings and assess these associations prospectively.

Prostate Cancer Screening
Background
Decisions about risk-reducing interventions for patients with an inherited predisposition to prostate cancer, as with any disease, are best guided by randomized controlled clinical trials and knowledge of the underlying natural history of the process. However, existing studies of
screening
for prostate cancer in high-risk men (men with a positive family history of prostate cancer and African American men) are predominantly based on retrospective case series or retrospective cohort analyses. Because awareness of a positive family history can lead to more frequent work-ups for cancer and result in apparently earlier prostate cancer detection, assessments of disease progression rates and survival after diagnosis are subject to selection, lead time, and length biases. This section focuses on screening and risk reduction of prostate cancer among men predisposed to the disease; data relevant to screening in high-risk men are primarily extracted from studies performed in the general population.
Screening
Information is limited about the efficacy of commonly available screening tests such as the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men
genetically predisposed
to developing prostate cancer. Furthermore, comparing the results of studies that have examined the efficacy of screening for prostate cancer is difficult because studies vary with regard to the cutoff values chosen for an elevated PSA test. For a given
sensitivity
and
specificity
of a screening test, the
positive predictive value
(PPV) increases as the underlying prevalence of disease rises. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the PPV and diagnostic yield will be higher for the DRE and for PSA in men with a genetic predisposition than in average-risk populations.[
1
,
2
]
Most retrospective analyses of prostate cancer screening cohorts have reported PPV for PSA, with or without DRE, among high-risk men in the range of 23% to 75%.[
2
-
6
] Screening strategies (frequency of PSA measurements or inclusion of DRE) and PSA cutoff for biopsy varied among these studies, which may have influenced this range of PPV.  Cancer detection rates among high-risk men have been reported to be in the range of 4.75% to 22%.[
2
,
5
,
6
]  Most cancers detected were of intermediate Gleason score (5–7), with Gleason scores of 8 or higher being detected in some high-risk men. Overall, there is limited information about the net benefits and harms of screening men at higher risk of prostate cancer. In addition, there is little evidence to support specific screening approaches in prostate cancer families at high risk. Risks and benefits of routine screening in the general population are discussed in
Prostate Cancer Screening
.  On the basis of the available data, most professional societies and organizations recommend that high-risk men engage in shared decision-making with their health care providers and develop individualized plans for prostate cancer screening based on their risk factors.  A summary of prostate cancer screening recommendations for high-risk men by professional organizations is shown in

carriers
of
BRCA1

BRCA2
pathogenic variants versus

.[
12

  The study recruited 2,481 men (791
BRCA1
carriers, 531
BRCA1
noncarriers; 731
BRCA2
carriers, 428
BRCA2
noncarriers). A total of 199 men (8%) presented with PSA levels higher than 3.0 ng/mL, which was the study PSA cutoff for recommending a biopsy.  The overall cancer detection rate was 36.4% (59 prostate cancers diagnosed among 162 biopsies).   Prostate cancer by
BRCA
pathogenic variant status was as follows:
BRCA1
carriers (n = 18),
BRCA1
noncarriers (n = 10);
BRCA2
carriers (n = 24),
BRCA2
noncarriers (n = 7). Using published stage and grade criteria for risk classification,[
13
] intermediate- or high-risk tumors were diagnosed in 11 of 18
BRCA1
carriers (61%), 8 of 10
BRCA1
noncarriers (80%), 17 of 24
BRCA2
carriers (71%), and 3 of 7
BRCA2
noncarriers (43%).   The PPV of PSA with a biopsy threshold of 3.0 ng/mL was 48% in carriers of
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, 33.3% in
BRCA2
noncarriers, 37.5% in
BRCA1
carriers, and 23.3% in
BRCA1
noncarriers.   Ninety-five percent of the men were White; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to all ethnic groups.
Interim results from the IMPACT study (now comprising 2,932 participants including 919
BRCA1
carriers and 902
BRCA2
carriers) demonstrated a cancer incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) that was higher in
BRCA2
carriers compared with noncarriers (19 vs. 12;
P
= .03).  There was no statistical difference in the cancer incidence rates between
BRCA1
carriers and noncarriers. Cancer in
BRCA2
carriers, but not in
BRCA1
carriers, was diagnosed at an earlier age and was more likely to be clinically significant.[

Impact of Germline Genetics on Management and Treatment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Targeted therapies on the basis of genetic results are increasingly driving options and strategies for treatment in oncology. These therapeutic approaches include candidacy for targeted therapy (such as poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase [PARP] inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors), use of platinum-based chemotherapy, and sequencing of androgen-signaling therapy versus chemotherapy. Multiple genetically informed  clinical trials are under way for men with prostate cancer.[

Psychosocial Issues in Familial Prostate Cancer
In This Section
Introduction
Prostate Cancer Risk Perception
Psychological Distress
Screening for Prostate Cancer
Introduction
The psychological impact of a family history of prostate cancer and/or a positive genetic test for hereditary prostate cancer may influence well-being and screening/prevention behaviors. Important psychosocial issues that have been investigated include perceived risk of prostate cancer, distress, and prostate cancer screening behaviors. Most of this evidence is based on hereditary risk from family history, rather than the results of genetic testing. If known, this section  includes data from studies of men who tested positive for hereditary prostate cancer genes. The presence of a prostate cancer family history  is important, since most cases of hereditary prostate cancer  have unknown etiologies, are polygenic, or cannot  be explained by  clinical multigene panel tests.[
1
] For more information about polygenic risk, see the
Polygenic risk scores for prostate cancer
section.
Prostate Cancer Risk Perception
Understanding drivers of prostate cancer risk perception is important because it can influence other psychological characteristics and is widely regarded as a predictor of health behaviors. Studies  that have analyzed the influence of a family history of prostate cancer on perceived cancer risk have had mixed results.
Although family histories of prostate cancer can increase perceived prostate cancer risk in some men,[
2
] other studies found that men with family histories of prostate cancer considered their risk to be the same as, or less than, that of the average man.[
3
,
4
]  Other factors, including being married, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk perception.[
5
] Perceived risk may  be positively correlated with levels of concern about developing prostate cancer,[
3
] depression,[
6
] and/or the number of relatives who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in a family.[
2
,
3
] Confusion regarding the differences between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are confounders in prostate cancer risk perception.[
6
]
An international study of men with personal and/or family histories of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants found that risk perception was associated with intrusive thoughts, avoidance coping, prostate cancer–related anxiety, and worry about prostate cancer.[
7
]
Psychological Distress
Although up to 50% of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of prostate cancer patients expressed concern about developing prostate cancer in some studies,[
3
] the level of anxiety reported by these individuals was relatively low and was related to lifetime risk, rather than short-term risk.[
3
,
6
] This concern was higher in men who were younger than their FDRs   when their prostate cancers were diagnosed.[
3
]  Unmarried FDRs may have worried more about developing prostate cancer than married men did.[
3
] In a Swedish study, only 3% of participants (n = 110) said that worry about prostate cancer affected their daily lives fairly much, and 28% said that it affected their daily lives slightly.[
6
]
In men who self-referred for free prostate cancer screening, general– and prostate cancer–related distress did not differ significantly between men who were  FDRs of prostate cancer patients and men who were not.[
2
] In a Swedish study, male  FDRs  who reported higher levels of worry about developing prostate cancer had higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores than men with lower levels of worry. In FDRs, the average HADS score was in the 75
th
percentile.[
6
]
A study measured anxiety and general quality-of-life in 220 men with family histories of prostate cancer who were undergoing prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests.[
8
] In this group, 20% of participants experienced a moderate deterioration in their anxiety scores, and 20% experienced a minimal deterioration in health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) scores. The average period between assessments was 35 days, which encompassed PSA testing and a wait for results that averaged 15.6 days. Only men with normal PSA values (4 ng/mL or less) were assessed.  Factors associated with HRQOL deterioration included being  50 to  60 years old, having more than two relatives with prostate cancer, having an anxious personality, being well-educated, and not having children living at home. The authors stressed that analysis of prostate cancer screening impact on  FDRs should not rely solely on mean changes in HRQOL scores.  Since a subset of  men who received normal results experienced screening-associated distress, interventions  may be needed to encourage men with increased hereditary risk to comply with repeated screening requests.
Screening for Prostate Cancer
For more information about prostate cancer screening in the general population, see
Prostate Cancer Screening
, and for more information about screening individuals with hereditary prostate cancer syndromes, see the
Prostate Cancer Screening
section.
For most cancer types, knowing that an individual has hereditary risk leads to recommendations for approved (if not proven) screening. This complicates prostate cancer screening, because there is a lack of clear recommendations for many high-risk men and men in the general population.  This creates uncertainty about the clinical and  psychosocial factors related to prostate cancer screening.
Several small studies have examined the behavioral correlates of prostate cancer screening at average and increased prostate cancer risk, based on family history.[

] In general, results differed regarding whether men with a family histories of prostate cancer were  more likely to be screened than those  without  hereditary prostate cancer risk. It is unclear if the prostate cancer  screening implemented in each group was appropriate for its risk status.  Most studies had a relatively small numbers of subjects, and the prostate cancer screening criteria were not uniform across studies, making generalizations difficult. Notably, all of these studies predate the  era of hereditary cancer testing, and there is a paucity   of research about prostate cancer screening behaviors in males who have undergone  hereditary prostate cancer genetic testing.
