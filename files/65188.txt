Observational Triveneto Study on the Use of Adjuvant Hormonal Therapies in the Treatment of Hormone-responsive Breast Cancer
There are different types of hormonal therapy medicines for the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the evolution of two types of hormonal treatment (the drug called "tamoxifen" and a group of medicines called "aromatase inhibitors") during two time periods of 12 months each, in years 2006 and 2008, in the northeast Italian regions. The study will include post-menopausal women who have initiated hormonal therapy medicines in 2006. The study will also verify the rate of implementation of the updated national and international recommendations for the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
