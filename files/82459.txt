Phase II Trial of BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) in Genetically Pre-screened Cancers With EGFR and/or HER2 Gene Amplification.
This is a Phase II open-label exploratory trial of BIBW 2992 administered to patients with tumors of various histologies found to possess EGFR and/or HER2 gene amplification, or EGFR activating mutations.

Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0 (RECIST 1.0)., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 6, week 12, and every 8 weeks thereafter
Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit (CB), CB was defined as CR, PR or stable disease (SD) and was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 criteria., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 6, week 12, and every 8 weeks till database lock|Time to Objective Response (OR), The time to OR was the duration from the first treatment to the time when the measurement criteria for CR and/or PR were met according to RECIST 1.0 criteria., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 6, week 12, and every 8 weeks till database lock|Duration of OR, Duration of OR was measured from the time the criteria for CR or PR (whichever was documented first) were first met until the first date that progressive disease or death was objectively documented., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 6, week 12, and every 8 weeks till database lock.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of disease progression or death, whichever came first.
