Statins for Reduction of Cardiac Toxicity in Patients Receiving HER2 Targeted
This study proposes that the addition of statins reduces the treatment delays or early discontinuations secondary to cardiotoxicity in patients with Stage I-III HER2 positive breast being treated with anti-HER2 therapy.

A single arm open-label phase 2 study to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of statins in patients with Stage I-III HER2 positive breast cancer receiving HER2 targeted therapy. This study will evaluate the hypothesis that addition of statins will reduce treatment delays/discontinuations related to symptomatic/asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction in patients being treated with anti-HER2 therapy. The long-term goal of this study is to improve disease related outcomes and quality of life measures in patients being treated with anti-HER2 therapy.
