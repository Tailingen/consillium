Clinical Outcomes of Indocyanine Green Tracer Using in Laparoscopic Gastrectomy With Extended Lymphadenectomy Beyond D2 for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer (FUGES-30)
Taking patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (cT2-4a, N-/+, M0) as the research subjects, to evaluate whether the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic beyond D2 regional lymph node dissection for gastric cancer with indocyanine green tracer is better or not.
Gastric Cancer|Surgery
PROCEDURE: beyond D2 regional lymph node dissection
3-year disease free survival rate, Disease-free survival is calculated from the day of surgery to the day of recurrence or death, 3 years
Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, Total number of retrieved lymph nodes, 30 days|Noncompliance rate of lymph node dissection, The LN dissection rate was determined by the number of patients in whom a LN station was harvested divided by the total number of patients who required retrieval at the corresponding LN station. Within the scope of D2 dissection, LN noncompliance was defined as the absence of LNs that should have been resected from \> 1 LN station., 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in group A and total number of lymph nodes in group A, Relationship between the number of fluorescent lymph nodes in group A and total number of lymph nodes in group A, 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A and positive lymph nodes in Group A (positive rate), The number of positive lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A (True positive rate)., 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A and negative lymph nodes in Group A (false positive rate), The number of negative lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A (false positive rate)., 30 days|Relationship between non-fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A and negative lymph nodes in group A (negative rate), The number of negative lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in group A (True negative rate)., 30 days|Relationship between nonfluorescent lymph nodes in Group A and positive lymph nodes in Group A (false negative rate), The number of positive lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A (false negative rate)., 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in group B and total number of lymph nodes in group B, Relationship between the number of fluorescent lymph nodes in group B and total number of lymph nodes in group B, 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in Group B and positive lymph nodes in Group B (positive rate), The number of positive lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in Group B (True positive rate)., 30 days|Relationship between fluorescent lymph nodes in Group B and negative lymph nodes in Group B (false positive rate), The number of negative lymph nodes in fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total fluorescent lymph nodes in Group A (false positive rate)., 30 days|Relationship between non-fluorescent lymph nodes in Group B and negative lymph nodes in group B (negative rate), The number of negative lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in group B (True negative rate)., 30 days|Relationship between nonfluorescent lymph nodes in Group B and positive lymph nodes in Group B (false negative rate), The number of positive lymph nodes in not fluorescent lymph nodes is divided by the number of total not fluorescent lymph nodes in Group B (false negative rate)., 30 days|Number of metastatic lymph nodes, Number of metastatic lymph nodes, 30 days|Metastasis rate of lymph nodes, Metastasis rate of lymph nodes, 30 days|Postoperative complications, Postoperative complications were evaluated within 30 days following surgery. These postoperative complications include gastrointestinal-related complications, incision-related complications, respiratory complications, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, urinary system complications, infection complications, embolism complications, and other complications. The grading of postoperative complications adopts the Clavien-Dindo classification., 30 days|Mortality rates, Patient died during hospitalization., 30 days|3-year overall survival rate, 3-year overall survival rate, 3 years|3-year recurrence pattern, 3-year recurrence pattern, 3 years|Postoperative recovery course, Time to first flatus after surgery, time to first ambulation after surgery, time to first liquid diet after surgery, time to first semi-liquid diet after surgery, length of hospital stay after surgery., 30 days|The incidence of intraoperative complications, Intraoperative complications were defined as bleeding due to named vessel injury, injury to visceral organs, mechanical factor-related problems, cardiopulmonary dysfunction due to hypercapnia, and other complications, 30 days|Inflammatory and immune response, the values of hemoglobin, prealbumin, albumin, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count from peripheral blood before the operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded., 7 days
