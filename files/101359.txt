Study of Palifosfamide-tris in Combination With Carboplatin and Etoposide in Chemotherapy Na√Øve Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (The MATISSE Study)
This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label, adaptive study to evaluate the efficacy of PaCE chemotherapy in chemotherapy naive subjects with extensive-stage SCLC. Eligible subjects will be stratified according to age, gender, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PaCE or CE chemotherapy.

The study design uses an adaptive group sequential approach with sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis.

Secondary efficacy endpoints include ORR, PFS, duration of response and changes in QOL and disease-related symptoms. Tumor-related endpoints will be assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 guidelines.

The safety of study treatments will be assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events as determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. To provide an initial confirmation of safety, an early interim analysis of safety data only will be performed.

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be convened to assess the safety and efficacy of the study interventions and to monitor the overall conduct of the clinical trial.
Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Palifosfamide-tris|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Carboplatin
Overall Survival (OS), Assessed every 12 weeks for survival until 1 year following completion of enrollment
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Assessed every 6 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until progressive disease, initiation of alternate anticancer therapy, or 1 year following the last patient enrolled (whichever is soonest)|Quality of Life (QOL) as assessed by EQ-5D-3L and QLQ-LC13, Assessed every 3 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until 1 year following the last patient enrolled|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed every 6 weeks for 22 weeks, then every 12 weeks until a partial or complete response is confirmed|Response Duration, Time from the date of first objective response (partial or complete response), with subsequent confirmation, until the date of disease progression or the occurrence of death|Safety parameters (number of adverse events as well as number of findings from physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results)using NCI CTCAE v. 4.03, 22 weeks
