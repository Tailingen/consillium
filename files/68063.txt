Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors
This phase II trial studies nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with rare tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 overall response rate (ORR) in subsets of patients with advanced rare cancers treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.

II. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.

III. To evaluate the RECIST v1.1 overall response rate (ORR) in patients PD-L1 amplified cancers treated with nivolumab immunotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate toxicities in each cohort. II. To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate; and to estimate immune related (i)RECIST ORR (iORR), and iRECIST PFS (iPFS) across cohorts and within each cohort.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I (ALL COHORTS EXCEPT THE PD-L1 AMPLIFIED COHORT): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 17 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete 17 cycles (2 years) of therapy, may continue receiving the same treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab, or receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) per physician discretion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who stop treatment prior to the completion of 17 cycles of therapy may receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) during screening and on study. Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) throughout the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.

ARM II (PD-L1 AMPLIFIED COHORT): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 15 and 29. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 17 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 17 cycles (2 years) of therapy, patients may receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo ECHO during screening and on study. Patients also undergo MRI or CT throughout the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 years from registration.
