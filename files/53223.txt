Effects of Carboplatin and Gemcitabine on Stage IIIB Pleural Effusion and Stage IV Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find better treatment for lung cancer and to find out what effects the combined treatment of carboplatin and gemcitabine when given with or without dexamethasone have on cancer.

This study will determine if dexamethasone, when given before standard chemotherapy will increase the cancer fighting effects and reduce the side effects of chemotherapy.
Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants With Reduction in Grade 3/4 Neutropenia, Reduction grade 3/4 neutropenia, continuous throughout treatment, up to 25 weeks
Effect of Dexamethasone Pre-treatment on Response Rate., Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Pre-treatment, pre-cycles 3 & 5, and up to 4 weeks after last treatment|Effect of Dexamethasone Pre-treatment on Overall Survival., Overall survival, Pre-treatment, pre-cycles 3 & 5,4 weeks after last treatment, every 3 months, an average of 471 days|Progression-free Survival, progression-free survival, Pre-treatment, pre-cycles 3 & 5,4 weeks after last treatment, and every 3 months, an average of 471 days
Subjects enrolled in the study will be placed in one of two treatment arms. All subjects have a 50-50 chance of being placed into either treatment arm. Treatment Arm 1 will receive chemotherapy alone, Treatment Arm 2 will receive chemotherapy with dexamethasone given pre-treatment.
