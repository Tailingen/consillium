Rectal Reconstruction in Treating Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Rectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Rectal reconstruction after surgery to treat rectal cancer may help patients keep some of their bowel function. It is not yet known which method of rectal reconstruction is most effective after surgery.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying three different methods of rectal reconstruction to compare how well they work in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for rectal cancer.

This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, gender, distance of the distal tumor margin from the dentate line (\> 5 cm vs ≤ 5 cm), age (\< 70 vs ≥ 70), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (yes vs no), and distant metastasis (M0 vs M1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.
