* To evaluate the Duration of Response (DOR) in each arm.
* To evaluate the safety in both treatment arms.
* To determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.
* To assess disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease and treatment-related symptoms, health state utility, and health status.

The duration of the study for the participants included a period for screening of up to 21 days (or up to 28 days for women who can become pregnant). Participants continued study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, participants' wish or other reason of discontinuation.

During follow-up, participants who discontinued the study treatment due to progression of the disease were followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date), and participants who discontinued the study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression were followed-up every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3 months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date).
