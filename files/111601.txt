Pharmacokinetics in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma Receiving Temozolomide and Radiation Therapy
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving temozolomide may help doctors learn how temozolomide works in the body. It may also help doctors learn more about how a patient's genes may affect the risk of developing thrombocytopenia.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the pharmacokinetics in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma receiving temozolomide and radiation therapy.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors|Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: temozolomide|GENETIC: comparative genomic hybridization|GENETIC: polymorphism analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with severe thrombocytopenia after standard first-line therapy as measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC), AUC (mg\*h/L)in patients who develop severe thrombocytopenia after receiving standard first-line therapy of temozolomide (TMZ) for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas., Day 1, Day 22, Day 43|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with severe thrombocytopenia after standard first-line therapy as measured by maximum drug concentration (Cmax), Cmax in patients who develop severe thrombocytopenia after receiving standard first-line therapy of temozolomide (TMZ) for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas., Day 1, Day 22, Day 43|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients without severe thrombocytopenia after standard first-line therapy as measured by AUC, AUC in patients in patients who do not develop severe thrombocytopenia after receiving standard first-line therapy of TMZ for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas., Day 1, Day 22, Day 43|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients without severe thrombocytopenia after standard first-line therapy as measured by Cmax, Cmax in patients in patients who do not develop severe thrombocytopenia after receiving standard first-line therapy of TMZ for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas., Day 1, Day 22, Day 43
Presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene., Presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene of patients who develop thrombocytopenia after receiving standard first-line therapy for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas., Day 1
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients who develop severe thrombocytopenia vs PK profiles in patients who do not develop severe thrombocytopenia while receiving standard first-line therapy for management of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas.
* Determine if patients who develop thrombocytopenia have any single nucleotide polymorphisms in the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot, prospective, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42. Patients also undergo cranial radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic analysis, genotype analysis, plasma temozolomide levels, and MGMT repair gene polymorphism analysis.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
