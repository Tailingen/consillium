Clinical Study of Apatinib and 5-Fu Combination Regimen to Treat Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients
This study makes an observation over the objective response rate of Apatinib and 5-Fu combination regimen in the three-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. All the participants will randomly receive the treatment of Apatinib and 5-Fu combination regimen or 5-Fu.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil
ORR, The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR), From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.
DCR, DCR is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was not Progressive Disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (= total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR) + total number of Stable Disease (SD), From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.|PFS, PFS was defined as the time from assignment to disease progression radiological/clinical or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.|OS, OS is defined as the time from date of assignment to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From assignment of the first subject until 30 death events observed, up to 2 years.|QoL, The general well-being of participants, outlining negative and positive features of life., From assignment of the first subject to 3 months later after the last participant is recruited.
5-Fu chemotherapy is an effective therapy for colorectal cancer. Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular density. A phase II trail of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat the metastatic colorectal cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.
