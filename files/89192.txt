HAIC Combined With Lenvatinib and PD-1 Inhibitor in Infiltrative Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) plus lenvatinib and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor have shown promising results for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the evidence for infiltrative is limited. In this study, we aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor with HAIC plus lenvatinib for infiltrative HCC.

PROCEDURE: Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Camrelizumab
Overall survival, OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 24 months
Progression-Free-Survival, Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review, 12 months
Objective response rate, ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the proportion of all included patients whose best overall response (BOR) is either a complete response or partial response., 6 months
This study is a multicenter, observational real-world study to explore the efficacy, safety of lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor with HAIC in advanced infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma. This study focused on the management of locoregional therapy combined with lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor. This study will create a database that will provide clinical parameters and outcomes of patients undergoing HIAC combined lenvatinib and PD-1 inhibitor as standard of care in hopes of answering key clinical questions.
