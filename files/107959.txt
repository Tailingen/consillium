30000 IU Per Week Vitamin D Treatment in PCOS Patients
This is a human, II/b phase, multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and the efficacy of a weekly administered dose of 30,000 IU vitamin D (colecalciferol) in deficient patients diagnosed with PCOS.

Investigational products: 30.000 IU vitamin D or placebo administered once a week for 12-weeks-long period, followed by a 12-week-long open label treatment 30.000 IU vitamin D in a follow-up period.

Each participant should be checked for regular dietary Ca intake and to assure the optimal calcium level the supplementation is provided with a commercially available Citrocalcium 200 mg tablets.

Setting:

I. Baseline and screening period:

Baseline period considered as when the exogenous Vitamin D intake should not exceed the level of 1000 IU intake per day or a total 5000 NE per week dosages applied (in forms of any Vitamin D3 medication or multivitamin products) at least for 30 days prior the assessment made.

II. Double-blind treatment period:

Once a week per os applied Vitamin D or placebo treatment for 12 weeks according to randomisation of trial subjects in a 1:1 assignment. By the end of this period an interim assessment will be performed based on the analysis of primary efficacy parameters, stratification to responder and non-responder groups.

III. Open label and follow-up phase:

An open-label 30000 IU of Vitamin D treatment on weekly basis. (Vitamin D3 Pharma Patent 30000 IU tablets) for additional 12 weeks and continue with the follow-up assessments. A compassionate use of patient diary for additional 26 weeks.

Objectives:

Primary objectives: to assess the efficacy as a recovery of ovarian function based on progesterone levels and menses diary in at least 20% of trial subjects, compared to placebo treated group Secondary Objectives: assess the efficacy and safety of orally administered vitamin D treatment by the changes in 25(OH) D levels in PCOS patients.

Explore the changes in Ovarian-morphology based on the results of standard TVUS Imaging: detection of adverse drug reactions during treatment periods, by frequency and distribution compared to follow-up periods and placebo group.
