Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Bortezomib in Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or Stage II-IV T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
This randomized phase III trial compares how well combination chemotherapy works when given with or without bortezomib in treating patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or stage II-IV T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bortezomib may help reduce the number of leukemia or lymphoma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also help chemotherapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs. It is not yet known if giving standard chemotherapy with or without bortezomib is more effective in treating newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) who are randomized to a modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ABFM) backbone versus bortezomib plus the modified ABFM backbone.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety and feasibility of modifying standard therapy for T-ALL and T-LLy based on the results of UKALL 2003, which includes a dexamethasone-based induction, additional doses of pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) during induction and delayed intensification (DI), and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance therapy.

II. To determine if prophylactic (presymptomatic) cranial radiation therapy (CRT) can be safely and effectively eliminated in the 85-90% of T-ALL patients classified as standard or intermediate risk.

III. To determine the proportion of end of consolidation (EOC) minimal residual disease (MRD) \>= 0.1% T-ALL patients who become MRD negative (undetectable by flow cytometry) after intensification of chemotherapy, using three high risk (HR) BFM blocks, and to compare EFS between the patients who become MRD negative after the three HR BFM blocks and continue on chemotherapy with those who continue to have detectable MRD and are eligible for other treatment strategies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

IV. To compare the EFS between very high risk (induction failure) T-LLy patients treated with HR BFM intensification blocks who have partial or complete response (PR or CR) with those who do not respond (NR).

CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the prognostic significance of day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD in T-LLy patients.

II. To determine if protein expression patterns can predict bortezomib response and drug resistance in T-ALL.

III. To analyze and target relevant signaling pathways in T-ALL blasts, focusing on early T cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients are risk assigned based on data from end of induction and/or consolidation therapy; this then modifies the subsequent therapy received.
