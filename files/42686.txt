Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in Tumors With High Expression of Somatostatin Receptors (Phase 2)
The rationale behind the purpose of this study lays on:

* the evidence that PRRT could represent a valuable treatment for the majority of patients with neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in disease progression, operated or inoperable, presenting lesions expressing somatostatin receptors and for which standard treatments are not already available;
* the current impossibility of acquiring on the market radiolabelled analogues of somatostatin used for PRRT with marketing authorisation;
* the need to collect a larger case history than in previous studies;
* the need to stratify the various histotypes based on the response obtained;
* the need to define new treatment schemes that guarantee the maximum efficacy and the lowest possible toxicity - with low cumulative (and per cycle) activities radiopharmaceutical and according to the concept of dose hyperfractionation - with a view to an optimal balance between risk and benefit.

RADIATION: Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATOC|RADIATION: Yttrium-90 (90Y)-DOTATOC|RADIATION: 177Lu-DOTATOC + 90Y-DOTATOC|RADIATION: Re-treatment 177Lu-DOTATOC|RADIATION: Re-treatment 90Y-DOTATOC
Disease Control Rate, Post-treatment evaluation will be performed with:

* a clinical examination;
* a comparative morphological re-evaluation, using version 1.1 of Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST criteria) on Computed Tomography (CT);
* a comparative functional re-evaluation, performed both on 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) and Gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTATOC PET/CT using visual and semi-quantitative parameters (such as SUVmax).

Based on all these parameters, Disease Control Rate will be labelled as: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progression Disease (PD)., 12 months
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time intercurrent from treatment start to the date of first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause., 6 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time intercurrent from treatment start to the date of death due to any cause, or the date of last contact., 6 months|Evaluation of PRRT Safety, The evaluation of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, defined as any G3/G4 toxicity. The evaluation will be performed during every treatment cycle and after 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 42 months after the last treatment cycle and will be based on version 4.0 of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE) toxicity criteria., 6 months|Evaluation of Quality of Life, Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated with quality of life questionnaire, version 3 (QLQ-C30) by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The questionnaire includes five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., 6 months
