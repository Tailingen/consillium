STUDY THAT COMPARE 3 ARM: MLN9708 DEXAMETHASONE, MLN9708 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND DEXAMETHASONE, MLN9708 THALIDOMIDE AND DEXAMETHASONE FOLLOWED BY MAINTENANCE WITH MLN9708 IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED ELDERLY MULTIPLE MYELOMA PATIENTS
This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the MLN-DEXAMETHASONE, MLN-DEXAMETHASONE-CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, or MLN- THALIDOMIDE-DEXAMETHASONE induction combinations, followed by MLN maintenance in newly diagnosed elderly Multiple Myeloma patients.

183 patients, males and females, older than 65 years old or younger but considered not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation, enrolled in different sites, will take part in this study.

The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: MLN9708|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Thalidomide
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Number of patients that will experience a progression disease after 2 years from diagnosis in 3 induction treatments, followed by maintenance with MLN9708, including:

* MLN9708 plus dexamethasone (MLN-DEX)
* MLN9708 plus dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide (MLN-CYCLO-DEX)
* MLN9708 plus dexamethasone and thalidomide (MLN-THAL-DEX) A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 2 years
Response rate, Response rate will evaluate efficacy in terms of Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR) of the 3 induction treatments, followed by maintenance with MLN9708. Rate of VGPR will be evaluated after cycle 4. Responses will be evaluated after each cycle.

A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years|Toxicity in terms of rate of hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events, Safety of combination will be evaluated in terms of rate of hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events of the 3 induction treatments, followed by maintenance with MLN9708. Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03.

A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years|Progression Free Survival-2 (PFS-2), Time from randomization to the date of first observation of second disease progression or death to any cause in each induction treatments A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years|Time To Progression (TTP), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first observation of progression, or deaths related to progression of the 3 induction treatments, followed by maintenance with MLN9708 A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years|Time to Next Therapy (TNT), Time from the date of randomization to the date of next anti-myeloma therapy of the 3 induction treatments, followed by maintenance with MLN9708 A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years|Explorative comparative analyses, Explorative comparative analyses will be performed between the three arms and by in subgroups of patients, defined according to known prognostic factors A maximum of 61 patients per arm will be evaluated., 5 years
This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the MLN-DEXAMETHASONE, MLN-DEXAMETHASONE-CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, or MLN- THALIDOMIDE-DEXAMETHASONE induction combinations, followed by MLN maintenance in newly diagnosed elderly Multiple Myeloma patients.
