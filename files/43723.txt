Adjuvant Concurrent Immunotherapy and Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Bladder Cancer
The primary objective of this Phase I study is to establish the safety of adjuvant concurrent immunotherapy and radiation therapy for urothelial bladder cancer.
Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder|Bladder Cancer
RADIATION: Concurrent Immunotherapy and Radiation Therapy
Safety of concurrent adjuvant immunotherapy and radiation therapy, The primary study endpoint is acute grade 3 or higher pelvic radiation related toxicity. A toxicity will be classified as related to pelvic radiation if the toxicity involves or is the result of effects on tissues that are within the 50% isodose bath of the radiation treatment as defined on the radiation treatment planning simulation scan. Toxicities will be graded by CTCAE Version 5.0.

Concurrent adjuvant immunotherapy and radiation will be deemed safe if it is likely (i.e. a posterior probability of 50% or greater) that the acute grade 3 or higher pelvic radiation related toxicity rate is \<20%., Within 18 weeks from start of radiation therapy
Patients in this study will receive the standard of care procedures and follow-up for immunotherapy and radiation therapy. The part of this study that is research is receiving both of these treatments at the same time. Safety will be based on acute toxicity.
