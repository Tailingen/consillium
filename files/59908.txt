Prospective Construction and Validation of a Prognostic Score to Identify Among Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Those Who Benefit From a Third Line Chemotherapy in Terms of Overall Survival
This is a biomedical study of interventional type. The trial will include 270 patients (180 patients in the first cohort and 90 patients in a second cohort) over a period of 3 years + 2 years of follow up.

This prospective study will be conduct in patients who will receive a third line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

The main objective of the study (first cohort) is to identify patients who benefit from a third line treatment in terms of overall survival with a score established from clinical, histological, but also biological "classic" and "innovative" (account of circulating tumor cells) criteria, all of these criteria must be measurable before the introduction of the 3rd line.

This score will then be validated on the 2nd cohort.

There will be no interruption of inclusions between first and second cohort of patients

Overall survival defined as the time from patient inclusion to the date of death or date of last follow-up news (censured data), 11 years
The time to progression, defined as the time from patient inclusion to the date of the first documented tumor progression, 11 years|Quality of life using the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL Questionnaire, 11 years|Patient satisfaction regarding therapeutic decisions at inclusion using a specific questionnaire developed by Llewellyn-Thomas, 11 years|Oncologists satisfaction regarding the management and communication with the patient will be studied at baseline and at the time or progression using the Likert ordinal scale, 7 years|Regret or not of the patient to have followed a 3rd line of chemotherapy will be recorded at the end of the treatment using the "Decision regret scale" Questionnaire, established by A. O'Connor, 11 years|Safety evaluated according to the classification of NCI CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) V4.0, 11 years
