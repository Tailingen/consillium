Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the administration and dosage of bupivacaine for sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) nerve block. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Does a high dose (3ml) give more relief than a low dose (1ml)?
* Does bilateral administration give more relief than unilateral? Participants with headaches will be asked to lie down and have SPG block performed.

Researchers will compare dosage and administration to see how symptoms are reduced.
Sphenopalatine Ganglion Nerve Block
DRUG: Bupivacaine|DEVICE: angiocatheter
Number of participants demonstrating sustained headache relief, A standard ordinal headache intensity scale will be used for participants to describe their headache as either "severe", "moderate", "mild", or "none". The number of participants who are able to achieve a headache level of "mild" or "none" in the ED within 30 minutes of procedure/medication administration and without requiring additional analgesic medication, and not relapsing to a headache level worse than "mild" during the 48 hours after medication administration, will be determined, 48 hours
Number of participants demonstrating satisfaction with the procedure/medication, Satisfaction with the procedure/medication as evidenced by the number of participants who provide an affirmative response to the question "Do you want to receive the same procedure/medication the next time you come to the ER with migraine?", 48 hours
Number of participants demonstrating improvement in 0-10 pain scale, Pain will be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) as recommended for use in migraine research by the International Headache Society. The NRS scale asks subjects to assign their pain a number between 0 and 10, with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable. Pain scores will be ascertained prior to procedure and at one hour, 60 minutes
