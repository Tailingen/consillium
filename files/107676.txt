A Real World Study of Ensartinib in Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ensartinib in advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, and the mechanisms of population pharmacokinetics and resistance to Ensartinib.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase I1171N|Ensartinib
DRUG: Ensartinib
Progression free survival (PFS), Defined as time from first dose of Ensartinib to disease progression or death due to any causes, 36 months
The objective response rate (ORR), ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as time from first dose of Ensartinib to death due to any cause, 48 months|12 month/24 month/36 month/48 month-overall survival (OS) rate OS, Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. The OS rate was estimated based on the landmark analysis., 12 months，24 months，36 months，48 months|Incidence of patients experiencing adverse events (AE), Adverse events are graded according to CTCAE 5.0, 36 months
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Ensartinib., Evaluation of Ensartinib population Cmax pharmacokinetics., Three hours after Ensartinib treatment
Participants will receive Ensartinib at 225 mg orally once a day (QD). Treatments will continue until disease progression, meeting one of treatment discontinuation criteria (eg, patient decision, adverse event, pregnancy). At the time of disease progression, participants will enter a survival follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs earlier. Collection of venous blood sample from participants included 3 times: before treatment, 8 weeks of treatment, and disease progression. Blood specimens of 8 ml were collected each time for ctDNA NGS testing, and evaluation of Ensartinib population pharmacokinetics with blood sampling after 8 weeks.
