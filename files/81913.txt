Comparative Effectiveness of Acupuncture and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs for the Management of Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Arthralgia Among Breast Cancer Survivors
Hormone therapy is used to treat women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor (AI) is administered after menopause. AI therapy has been proven to be effective in improving the disease-free survival rate, decreasing the recurrence rates and a lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer. However, arthralgia frequently reported as an important adverse event of AI therapy and sometimes resulted in noncompliance with AI therapy. The prevalence of AI induced arthralgia rates ranged from 20 to 74%. Inadequately managed AI induced arthralgia remains a major unmet need in oncology practice in breast cancer survivors.

The goal of this project is to conduct a crossover designed pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture versus NSAID (Diclofenac) for the management of aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia.

The third group was set to use non-steroidal analgesics plus acupuncture to evaluate the effectiveness of joint pain.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Diclofenac
Acupuncture can improve joint symptoms resulting from aromatase inhibitor and quality of life, Patients will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire covering demographic information and reproductive history. At baseline and at 4, 6 and 10 weeks, self-administered questionnaires including the 10mm visual analogue scales. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at the 4 weeks after the end of intervention.

According to statistically estimation, we compare the changes between three subgroups and hypothesize 20% difference as significant effect after intervention. We use ANOVA to calculate the sample size with an alpha of 0.05 as significance level, approximately 80% power and 20% drop-out rate. The trial will enroll 145 participants., one year
