A Clinical Study of SCTC21C in Participants With CD38+ Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SCTC21C in patients with CD38+ hematologic malignancies
Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: SCTC21C
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse event (SAE), To identify the incidence of TEAEs and SAE, From the initiation of the first dose to the 45 days after the last dose|The incidence of dose limiting toxicities （dose-finding stage）, To identify the DLTs, Cycle 1 (28 days)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have an objective remission, Throughout the study treatment,an average of 1 year
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics（PK）, Pharmacodynamics（PD）, preliminary anti-tumor activity and immunogenicity of SCTC21C in patients with relapsed or refractory CD38+ hematologic malignancies.The study includes Dose-finding stage and Dose-expansion stage. In Dose-finding stage, participants will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of SCTC21C ranging from 0.01 to 960mg. In Dose-expansion stage, total of at least 20 participants will be randomly assigned to receive two different doses of SCTC21C at a ratio of 1:1.All participants will receive the treatment until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events.
