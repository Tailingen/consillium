Temozolomide as Maintenance Therapy in Small Cell Lung Cancer
Temozolomide, a nonclassic oral alkylating agent, may delay progression in sequence with chemotherapy. This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the role of Temozolomide following 4 or 6 cycles of first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed SCLC.
Carcinoma, Small Cell
DRUG: Temozolomide
One-year progress free survival, The Percentage of Patients Who Are Progress Free One Year After Completing Protocol Treatment, 18 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, 18 months|Safety, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 18 months|time to progression, the interval between the start date of treatment and the date of occurrence of progressive disease, from the start date of treatment until the date of occurrence of progressive disease
Subjects will receive standard of care treatment for SCLC with added treatment of maintenance temozolomide. Efficacy and safety of temozolomide and one year survival and time to progression of patients will be recorded.
