AZD0486 as Monotherapy in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) B-cell NHL
This is a Phase 2 global, multi-center, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AZD0486 monotherapy in adult participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapies. The study has 2 Modules: Module 1 for FL and Module 2 for DLBCL.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma (FL)|Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DRUG: AZD0486

This is a modular, Phase II, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZD0486 monotherapy administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion in participants with relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of AZD0486 administered at the RP2D in adults 18 to 80 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-NHL.
