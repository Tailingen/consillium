An Observational Cohort Study to Describe and Compare the Use of Darolutamide, Enzalutamide and Apalutamide and How Well These Work in Men With Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC) in Real World Settings
This is an observational cohort study in men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received their usual treatment, which is 'Androgen receptor inhibitors' (ARIs) including darolutamide, enzalutamide, and apalutamide.

The main purpose of this study is to collect data on the length of time men with nmCRPC continued treatment with darolutamide, enzalutamide, or apalutamide as prescribed by their doctors. Researchers will only include men who had not been treated with any new type of medication that blocks the action of hormones.

The data will come from an electronic health record database called Precision Point Specialty (PPS) Prostate Cancer Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for men in the United States of America. EMR data will be verified and supplemented via patient chart review. Data collected will be from January 2019 to September 2023. .
