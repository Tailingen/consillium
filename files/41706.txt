Early Changes in Positron Emissions Tomography (PET/CT) Scan as Predictors of Clinical Outcome in NSCLC Treated With EGFR Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitors (TKI)
Erlotinib, an anti-cancer agent targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is an active treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Effect of treatment is primary seen in patients harboring a mutation in the EGFR. However, 10-15% of patients does not harbor a mutation but respond as well. Identifying these patients is a problem and methods are lacking.

Studies have shown that an early 18F FDG-PET might can predict response and outcome in these patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
PROCEDURE: 18F-FDG-PET scan
18F-FDG-PET evaluation, Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) will be used as measurement of 18F-FDG uptake, Time to progression and latest april 2015 (up to 2 years)
