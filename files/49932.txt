PemVin vs Vin in Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer
Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-folate, that is used for non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. There are several clinical studies of pemetrexed in breast cancer, but these are largely done before the wide use of premedication (steroid and vitamin B12) for pemetrexed. Moreover, it has not been studied in combination with vinorelbine, which is a commonly used drug for anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer.

This is a randomized phase II study of pemetrexed plus vinorelbine versus vinorelbine in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to an anthracycline and taxane.
