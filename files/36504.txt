Study in Plerixafor and Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor Patients With Relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 1, dose escalation study of Plerixafor in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , Daunorubicin and Cytarabine in adults patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia .
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Plerixafor granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
maximal tolerated dose, 4 steps of plerixafor doses from 240 to 480 microgram per kilogram per day concomitant with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and chemotherapy Three to 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled at each dose level in a modified 3 + 3 design., 40 days
safety and tolerability of plerixafor in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and chemotherapy, Number of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events :examined at each dose level by the Independent Data safety Monitoring Board, 9 months|Efficacy of plerixafor on leukemic blasts, study of the drop of leukemic blasts blood rate, 10 Days|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, -Minimal Residual Disease level after first consolidation, 2 months|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, - Time to remission, 5 weeks|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, -Rate of patients able to proceed to hematopoietic stel cell transplantation, 3 months|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, -disease free survival, 9 months|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, -event free survival, 9 months|Efficacy of combination plerixafor with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, overal survival, 9 months
The Primary objective is to determine the maximal tolerated dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose of plerixafor when used in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, Daunorubicin and Cytarabine during induction therapy Then determine the tolerability of plerixafor administered in combination with G-CSF and cytarabine during consolidation therapy.
