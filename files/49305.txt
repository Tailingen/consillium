Cetuximab, Cisplatin, and Radiotherapy in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma
The anti-tumor activity of cetuximab prior to chemoradiotherapy and the safety and tolerability of cetuximab with concurrent chemoradiation will be determined in women with locally advanced or metastatic cervical carcinoma.
Cancer of the Cervix
DRUG: Cetuximab

* Women with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Clinical Stage IB2-IVB carcinoma of the cervix
* Baseline cervical biopsy, blood samples, and FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) scan
* Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 on day 1 followed by cetuximab 250 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15
* Repeat cervical biopsy and FDG-PET/CT scan following cetuximab monotherapy
* Radiation and weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and cetuximab 250 mg/2 for 6 weeks
* Cetuximab 250 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks
* Repeat cervical biopsy (if tumor present) and FDG-PET/CT scan after completion of therapy
* Follow for tumor recurrence and survival
