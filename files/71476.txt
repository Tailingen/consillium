Safety and Efficacy of Aumolertinib Combined With Anlotinib as 1st Line Treatment in Advanced Lung Cancer EGFR Mutation With TP53 Co-Mutation
The goal of this open, single-arm, exploratory phase II clinical study is to exploratory safety and efficacy in 1st line treatment in advanced lung cancer EGFR mutation with TP53 co-mutation. 47 patients are scheduled to be enrolled. Treatment regimen is aumolertinib 110mg p.o QD and Anlotinib 12mg oral for 2 weeks, three weeks a cycle, until disease progression or intolerable adverse reactions or death.

DRUG: Aumolertinib,Anlotinib
PFS (Progression-Free-Survival), The time from randomization to tumor progression or death.The efficacy of this study was determined according to Recist version 1.1 criteria., 24months
ORR（Objective Response Rate）, The rate of participants that achieve either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR)., 24months|DCR（Disease control rate）, The percentage of cases with remission (PR + CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment was assessable., 24months|DOR（Duration of response）, DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The time of the initial response was defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit response of CR or PR. If a patient did not progress following a response, then their DoR was censored at the PFS censoring time., 24months|OS (Overall survival time), The time of death from all causes for all patients from the date of randomization., 24months|The Adverse Events, AEs are any adverse medical events that occur in a subject or clinical subject and is not necessarily causally related to the treatment. Safety assessment in this study was conducted by the investigator in accordance with the definition of CTCAE 5.0., 24months
The primary objective of this study was to explore the median PFS of aumolertinib Combined With anlotinib as first-line treatment in advanced lung cancer EGFR mutation with TP53 co-mutation.The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the ORR, DCR, DOR, OS and safety of aumolertinib Combined With anlotinib as first-line treatment in advanced lung cancer EGFR mutation with TP53 co-mutation. In addition, we also try to explore predictive or prognostic biomarkers (tissue and/or plasma) related to disease treatment response or drug resistance. Analyze the potential biomarkers in the biopsy tissue samples and blood samples after the disease progresses, and explore the possible mechanism of treating drug resistance.
