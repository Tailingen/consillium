Safety and Efficacy Study of An Anti-CD38 Antibody Drug Conjugate in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase Ib/IIa, open-label, dose-escalation, and extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an anti-CD38 antibody drug conjugate (STI-6129) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

This is a phase Ib/IIa, open-label, dose-escalation, and extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an anti-CD38 antibody drug conjugate (STI-6129) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

The study is designed to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of STI-6129 by assessing the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics using a accelerated titration design and a conventional 3+3 study design for dose escalation in stage one and then the second stage will be an expansion study to assess preliminary efficacy.
