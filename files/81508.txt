Apatinib as Second Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Refractory Biliary Tract Cancers
This study is designed to see whether Apatinib is effective in treating patients with advanced refractory biliary tract cancers.
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), the time from randomize to progression or death; RECIST guidelines were used to define all responses after patients had received every 4 weeks of therapy, Approximately 1 year
Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomize to death, Approximately 2 years|Disease control rate(DCR), Defined as the rate of complete response , partial response and stable disease according to RECIST guidelines, Approximately 1 year|Quality of life(QoL), As measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30), Approximately 1 year|Safety (incidence of adverse events), Incidence of adverse events, Approximately 1 year
Biliary tract cancers (BTC) includes cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). The systematic treatment based on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended as the current standard chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic BTC. There is no standard recommendation for second line therapy.

Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR-2).

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced refractory BTC who had received first-line chemotherapy.
