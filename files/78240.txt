Multi-institutional Study on the Assessment of Robotic Surgery for Gastric Cancer
Minimally invasive surgery revolutionized the field of gastric cancer surgery. The surgical robot was introduced to alleviate the difficulty of laparoscopic surgery. Although many studies have reported successful outcomes for robotic surgery, there is no multicenter prospective analysis regarding the advantage of the robotic gastrectomy. The aim of this study is to analyze the surgical outcomes of the robotic gastrectomy focusing on the learning curve, cost-effectiveness, quality of life, and acute-inflammatory reaction in comparison with laparoscopic gastrectomy.
Gastric Cancer
Registration of all robotic gastrectomies performed in South Korea, at the end of the study|Learning curve (operation time and surgical outcome) of robotic gastrectomy, from the start of the operation to discharge of the patient (usually two weeks after the operation)|Cost-effectiveness comparison between robotic and laparoscopic gastrectomy, from admission to discharge of the patient (usually from two days before the operation until two weeks after the operation)|Quality of life after robotic and laparoscopic gastrectomy, One day before operation, first OPD visit after the operation (two weeks after the operation), 3M, 12M, 36M, and 60M after the operation|Acute-inflammatory response after undergoing robotic and laparoscopic gastrectomy, preop, 2hr, 24hr, 4days and 30 days after the operation
