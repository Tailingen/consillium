Tamoxifen to Treat Barrett's Metaplasia
Treat Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients with tamoxifen to Barrett's metaplasia as measured by changes in Barrett's esophagus appearance by endoscopy and histology as well as changes in SOX2 and CDX2.
Barrett Metaplasia
DRUG: Tamoxifen|PROCEDURE: Endoscopy
Extent of Barrett's involvement and changes in histology, The biopsy procedures with 4 quadrant biopsies/2 cm for histology and additional biopsies for freezing for macromolecular analysis to assess the preliminary diagnostic value of this marker pair in identifying levels of metaplasia in BE and as an indicator of response to tamoxifen treatment. The tissue from the two endoscopic procedures will be assessed for changes in the following related to tamoxifen therapy., End of 12 weeks (at the time of second endoscopy)
Changes in SOX2 and CDX2 expression, The main outcome measurements are SOX2 and CDX2, analyzed as a ratio. We will use a one sample paired non-parametric Wilcoxon test to test the significant difference if the ratio difference is not normally distributed. Normality assumption can be examined by visual Q-Q plot and formal Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. In addition, we will explore the patient level characteristics on treatment effect using a linear regression model. Specifically, we will use the difference ratio as the response variable and patient characteristics of interest as explanatory variables. Regression coefficients associated with the explanatory variables quantify the effect of these variables on the difference ratio, with t or F statistic testing for the statistical significance., End of 12 weeks (at the time of second endoscopy)|Tolerance of tamoxifen, As measured by toxicities using CTCAE version 4.0, 4 months (30 days after cessation of tamoxifen or after second endoscopy - whichever occurs later)|Changes in the length of Barrett's esophagus involvement, End of 12 weeks (at the time of second endoscopy)
Treat Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients with tamoxifen to determine the effects on Barrett's metaplasia as measured by changes in Barrett's esophagus appearance by endoscopy and histology. Tamoxifen treatment may induce SOX2 expression, decrease CDX2 and promote esophageal stem cell activity, leading to regression of Barrett's metaplasia. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective, pilot study where patients with BE, without high grade dysplasia, are treated with tamoxifen and assessed for changes in the appearance of their BE by endoscopy and histology as well as changes in the SOX2/CDX2 ratio indicative of an improvement in BE metaplasia
