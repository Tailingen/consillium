Surgical Management of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations Within Hybrid Operation Room
To evaluate the clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.
Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations
PROCEDURE: hybrid operating techniques
Instant residual rate of AVMs, The instant post-operative residual rate of AVMs, up to 1 week after operation|3 months' residual rate of AVMs, 3 months' residual rate after AVM operation, the date of 3rd month after operation, ±1 week|6 months' residual rate of AVMs, 6 months' residual rate after AVM operation, the date of the 6th month after operation, ±1 week|1 year's residual rate of AVMs, 1 year's residual rate after AVM operation, the date of the 12th month after operation, ±1 week
Morbidity rate of post-operative complications, Include intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, infection of central neural system, infection of respiratory system, cranial nerve deficits, and other symptomatic complications, 7 days after operation|Post-operative mortality rate, operation related mortality, 48 hours after operation|Morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration-48 hours after operation, The score of modified Rankin Scale increases ≥2, the assessing time points is 48 hours after operation|Morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration-1 week after operation, The score of modified Rankin Scale increases ≥2, 1 week after operation|Morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration-3 months after operation, The score of modified Rankin Scale increases ≥2, the 3rd month after operation, ±1 week|Morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration-6 months after operation, The score of modified Rankin Scale increases ≥2, the 6th month after operation, ±1 week|Morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration-12 months after operation, The score of modified Rankin Scale increases ≥2, the 12th month after operation, ±1 week
Purpose: Have an evaluation of clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations(AVMs). Meanwhile, as a new cooperative interventional modality, optimized workflows, technical key knots and operation routines will be explored in the study.

Objects: Patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, coincident with inclusion and exclusion criterion and admitted in participating organizations.

Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management correspondingly. Residual rate of AVM is considered to be the primary observing indicator, and morbidity rate of post-operative complications, post-operative mortality rate, and morbidity rate of neural functional deterioration are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be recorded in detail as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.
