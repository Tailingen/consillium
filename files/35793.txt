This is a multicenter, open-label study. The study is designed to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of luveltamab tazevibulin, an anti-FOLR1 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in previously treated subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that expresses FOLR1.

Subjects will receive luveltamab tazevibulin administered intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, elective withdrawal from the study, or study termination.
