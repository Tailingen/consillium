Cancer Patients|Central Venous Catheter Thrombosis|Upper Extremity Thrombosis
DRUG: Apixaban
Central Line Failure, Infusion failure that does not respond to 2 milligram (mg) tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), within 3 months of study follow-up
Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), recurrence of blood clot either in leg or lung or both, within 3 months of study follow-up|Bleeding, Major bleeding, clinically relevant minor bleed, death, time to central line failure, within 3 months of study follow-up
Cancer patients who have developed blood clot in the arm that has the central venous catheter will be treated with standard of care blood thinning injection of low molecular weight heparin for 1 week and then for apixaban 5 mg twice daily for the rest of 11 weeks. Data will be collected to see if the central venous catheter "survived" or remained in place and did not have to be taken out because of the clot.
