Explore the Efficiency of Fiberscope-guided Nasogastric Tube Insertion
For Head and neck cancer and uncooperative patients, blind nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion may sometimes be very difficult because of the anatomical obstructions in the pharynx and uncoordinated swallowing motion. To solve the problem, flexible endoscope has been used widely to assist the NGT insertion via direct visual assistance, working channels/guide wires, or suture fixation. Unfortunately, these tools are not easily assessed in the outpatient department. Here, we try to use a simpler method for the flexible endoscope to guide the NGT insertion.
