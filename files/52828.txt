A Study of ION537 in Patients With Molecularly Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ION537 when administered by intravenous infusion in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is a single center, open label, non-randomized, Phase 1, two-part study of ION537 in up to 102 participants. Part 1 of the study consists of sequential cohort, dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors. Part 2 is dose expansion in patients with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors. In total, the study includes up to 102 participants. The study will consist of a 30-day screening period, a treatment period consisting of sequential consecutive treatment cycles (each cycle will be of 28 days) and a post-treatment follow-up period of at least 28 days following the last dose of study drug.
