Biliary Drainage Plus HAIC in Locally Advanced PCCA
Biliary drainage and stent placement remains to be the main palliative treatment choice for advanced perihiliar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA), and the life expectancy is only 4-6 months. Previous single center prospective phase 2 trial showed that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil was an encouraging treatment choice for advanced pCCA due to its high tumor control, survival benefit, and low toxicity. Thus, the multicenter prospective controlled trial was designed to explore and confirm the survival benefit of biliary drainage plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil compared with biliary drainage plus best support care treatment in locally advanced pCCA patients.
Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil|PROCEDURE: Biliary Drainage|OTHER: Best Supportive Care|PROCEDURE: External biliary drainage
Overall survival, Overall survival is measured from the date of first biliary drainage to death, 1 year
Duration of jaundice remission, The time between remission of total bilirubin to less than 2 times of the upper limit of the normal value and time of rising again of bilirubin above more than 2 times of upper limit of the normal level., 1 year
Adverse effects, Toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, 6 months
When a patient is not eligible for surgery, chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin can be considered for advanced biliary tract cancer. However, in the Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer, or ABC-02 trial in patients with pCCA, the efficacy of this regimen was not significantly higher than that of gemcitabine alone. Therefore, an optimal chemotherapeutic regimen has not been established for this subtype of cholangiocarcinoma. Currently, biliary drainage and stent placement remains to be the main palliative treatment choice, and the life expectancy is only 4-6 months. Previous single center prospective phase 2 trial showed that HAI with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil was an encouraging treatment choice for advanced PCC due to its high tumor control, survival benefit, and low toxicity. So the multicenter prospective controlled trial was designed to explore and confirm the survival benefit of biliary drainage plus hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil compared with biliary drainage plus best support care treatment in locally advanced pCCA patients.
