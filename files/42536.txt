This is a multi-site prospective parallel randomized controlled trial using an educational DVD from the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, "Gynecology: Beginners Only"Â®, compared to routine education. All participants completed a pretest on transvaginal ultrasound images and principles. The intervention group repeated the test after viewing the DVD. During the trial, performing and logging transvaginal ultrasounds were encouraged. All enrolled residents repeated the test at 6-10 months after intervention.
