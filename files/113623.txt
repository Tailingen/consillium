Lactate and Complications in Cytoreduction Surgery for Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
Serum lactate is a risk factor for postoperative complications in patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery in peritoneal carcinomatosis
Lactacidemia and Complications
Postoperative complications, complications in patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery during the immediate postoperative period in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the General Hospital of Castellón (HGCS) between 2014 and 2016., 2014-2016
Background. Cytoreduction surgery has been developed as a treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, this surgery is associated with important complications. The present study attempts to assess the relationship between lactacidemia levels and the rate of associated complications in patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery during the immediate postoperative period in a critical unit.

Methods. Retrospective observational study. 57 patients underwent cytoreduction surgery during the years 2014 and 2015 at the General University Hospital of Castellón. All patients were admitted to the critical unit immediately after surgery. Lactacidemia levels at the time of admission and discharge from the critical unit were collected. Post-surgical complications that appeared during the stay in the critical unit were recorded and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.

Lactacidemia levels were still significantly higher in this group at the time of discharge.
