Impact of a Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Program Framework Among High Cardiovascular Risk Cancer Survivors
Many cancer survivors are at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD); it is therefore important to identify patients at increased risk for cardiotoxicity, especially in the setting of CVRF or pre-existing CVD, and to design personalized interventions to prevent cardiovascular morbidity. In this background, cardio-oncology rehabilitation frameworks for specific cancer patients have been proposed. Given potential beneficial effects of exercise among cancer patients (including those at higher risk of CVD), data pertaining to optimal program designs are of paramount contemporary importance.

Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the impact of a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program (CRP) model versus a community-based exercise intervention plus usual care on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), physical function domains and CVRF control in adult cancer survivors who have been exposed to cardiotoxic cancer treatment and/or with cardiovascular medical background. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline (M0) and after an 8 weeks-intervention (M1), comprising maximal aerobic capacity (peak oxygen uptake), muscular strength, neuromuscular function, single CVRF control including physical activity measurements and psychosocial parameters, health-related quality of life, fatigue, health literacy, inflammatory response and feasibility metrics; an economic evaluation will provide quantitative comparison, for a cost-effectiveness analysis

Scores 0-14. A sub-scale score \> 8 denotes anxiety or depression symptoms, Change from baseline to 2 months|Health Related Quality of Life, Evaluated using the EuroQuol Five- Dimensional questionnaire ( EQ-5D-5L). It consists in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ - Visual Analog Scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'., Change from baseline to 2 months|Fatigue, Fatigue score evaluated by the specific item on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (high score representing high level of symptomatology), Change from baseline to 2 months|Health Literacy, Assessed by the Newest Vital Sign questionnaire; range score 0-6 (high score corresponding to high health literacy), Change from baseline to 2 months|Inflammatory markers- Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Blood samples collected to access plasma levels of IL-6, Change from baseline to 2 months|Inflammatory markers - High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Blood samples collected to access plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, Change from baseline to 2 months|Feasibility - Consent rate, number of patients who met inclusion criteria divided by the number who consented in writing to participate. Reasons for not participating in the study will be registered., Through study recruitment, up to 2 years|Testing and Intervention Adverse events, all the events will be recorded and registered as "related" or "unrelated" to the intervention itself, as well as the impact for exercise concerns or other health intervention required, Change from baseline to 2 months|Feasibility - Retention rate, number of participants who remained in the study (without formally drop out during intervention)., Change from baseline to 2 months|Feasibility - Intervention adherence, total number of exercise sessions attended by participants allocated to this intervention group. Reasons for dropping out will be registered., Change from baseline to 2 months|Feasibility - Completion rate, number of patients that completed all the evaluations during the defined timeline., Change from baseline to 2 months|Cost-effectiveness analysis, Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life. Costs will be calculated from the provider perspective, which includes the costs incurred by the health institution providing health services; and from the societal perspective, From baseline assessment up to 2 years
