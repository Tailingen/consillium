Green Tea and Quercetin in Combination With Docetaxel Chemotherapy in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to find out if taking natural products green tea and quercetin along with docetaxel chemotherapy improves the therapy of advanced prostate cancer, i.e., metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It will also learn about the safety of this combination.

Researchers will compare green tea plus quercetin to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) in combination with docetaxel to see if green tea and quercetin works to improve the therapeutic effect of docetaxel.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
DRUG: green tea and quercetin + docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo + docetaxel
Efficacy evaluated with blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, Blood PSA will be measured at baseline, 1st day of each cycle of docetaxel treatment (21 days per cycle, for 3 cycles), and at the end of the intervention., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 11 weeks
circulating tumor DNA level (ctDNA) analyzed by next generation sequencing, CtDNA will be measured at the 1st day of each cycle of docetaxel treatment, and at the end of the intervention., From the start of intervention at 3 weeks to the end of treatment at 11 weeks.|tumor burden by CT detection, Tumor burden, including tumor number and size, will be assessed in both primary and metastatic sites using computed tomography (CT), to assist in the evaluation of complete response vs. stable disease vs. progressive disease using the RECIST criteria., From the start of intervention at 3 weeks to the end of treatment at 11 weeks.|Adverse events graded by using NCI CTCAE criteria, The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, will be followed for a comprehensive evaluation of adverse events in multiple systems including blood, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and neural system., From the start of intervention at 3 weeks to the end of treatment at 11 weeks.|Area under curve (AUC) of blood green tea, quercetin, and docetaxel, The AUC of blood green tea, quercetin, and docetaxel will be analyzed in cycle 1 of different dose levels in the dose escalation study., On the 1st day of cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days, 3 cycles total) of the dose escalation study.|Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of blood green tea, quercetin, and docetaxel, The Cmax of blood green tea, quercetin, and docetaxel will be analyzed in cycle 1 of different dose levels in the dose escalation study., On the 1st day of cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days, 3 cycles total) of the dose escalation study.|Time taken to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), The Tmax of blood green tea, quercetin, and docetaxel will be analyzed in cycle 1 of different dose levels in the dose escalation study., On the 1st day of cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days, 3 cycles total) of the dose escalation study.
