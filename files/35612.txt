Background:

Tumors of the kidney, bladder, prostate, testis, and adrenal represent a large part of the adult urologic practice, but are relatively infrequent in children.

Genitourinary tumors contribute to pediatric solid tumors. Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and germ cell tumors are the most common malignant genitourinary tumors in children.

The natural history and management of these tumors in the pediatric age is different from that of the adults. As result of the successful work of several clinical trial groups in recent decades, there has been a significant improvement in their cure rates.

Patients \& Methods:

From January 2001 till December 2015, retrieval \& analysis of the medical records of pediatric patients with genitourinary tumors will be made at the pediatric oncology department, South Egypt Cancer Institute which represents the largest referral center in Upper Egypt. These data will be categorized according to demographic characteristics, clinico-pathologic features, treatment modalities received, and outcomes of treatments in these patients.
