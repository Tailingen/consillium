A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Ceralasertib in Combination With Durvalumab in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a Phase 1, open-label study of ceralasertib given in combination with durvalumab in Chinese participants with advanced solid tumours. In each cohort, a monotherapy lead-in period (Cycle 0, duration of 7 or 14 days), prior to dosing with durvalumab, is added to investigate the PK profile and safety/tolerability of ceralasertib in Chinese participants.

This study is designed to investigate and characterise preliminary safety, tolerability, and PK of ceralasertib in DLT-evaluable Chinese participants

\<Objectives\>

Primary Objective:

To assess the safety and tolerability of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumours refractory/resistant to prior SoC therapy or for which no appropriate SoC therapy exists.

Secondary Objective:

To characterise the PK profile of ceralasertib after single- and multiple-doses administration. To characterise the anti-tumour activity and efficacy of ceralasertib in combination with durvalumab in Chinese patients .

\<Overall design\> This is a Phase 1, open-label study of ceralasertib given in combination with durvalumab in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumours.Results from this study will provide dose rationale for future investigations.
