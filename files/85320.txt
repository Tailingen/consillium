Assessing the Accuracy of Seismofit® as an Estimate of VO2 Peak in Patients With Hepato-pancreato-biliary, Colorectal, and Gastro-oesophageal Cancer
Our study aims to assess the relationship between the Seismofit® derived VO2 peak estimate and CPET-measured VO2 peak in patients who are having CPET as part of their preoperative workup. Our aim is to establish whether Seismofit® can be considered a cheaper, less resource intensive and better tolerated alternative to the CPET, or whether it might be useful as a screening tool to efficiently identify patients with exercise intolerance who may benefit from further characterisation by CPET.

Assess the relationship between Seismofit®-estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak in HPB, gastro-oesophageal or colorectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative assessment for major surgery., Strength and direction of relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient) between Seismofit® -estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak., End of Trial (9 months)
Assess limits of agreement and bias between Seismofit®-estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak, Limits of agreement and bias between Seismofit®-estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak (Bland-Alman analysis), End of Trial (9 months)|Assess the relationship between Seismofit®-estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak in each surgical subgroup: HPB, gastro-oesophageal and colorectal cancer patients., Strength and direction of relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient) between Seismofit® -estimated VO2 peak and CPET-measured VO2 peak, as well as limits of agreement and bias (Bland-Altman analysis) in each surgical subgroup: HPB, gastro-oesophageal and colorectal cancer patients., End of Trial (9 months)|Assess the relationship between Seismofit® -estimated VO2 peak and other CPET derived variables: o Anaerobic Threshold (AT) o Peak Power Output (PPO) o Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2), Strength and direction of relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient) between Seismofit® -estimated VO2 peak and the CPET-measured variables of AT, PPO and VE/VCO2, End of Trial (9 months)|Assess patient experience of the Seismofit® test using a brief measure that has been used previously in CPET research, Patient concern, comfort, and overall satisfaction of Seismofit® measurement compared with CPET., End of Trial (9 months)
