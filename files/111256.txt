S-1 Plus Gefitinib Versus Gefitinib Monotherapy in Patients With EGFR-sensitive Mutation Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
To investigate the survival benefit of first-line therapy for patients with EGFR-sensitive mutation-positive advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer treated with S-1plus gefitinib versus gefitinib monotherapy
Advanced NSCLC With EGFR Mutation
DRUG: S-1 plus Gefitinib|DRUG: Gefitinib
Progression free survival(PFS), From start of anti-cancer therapy until progression or death.To evaluate the disease free survival of gefitinib combined with S-1 and gefitinib in patients with Pathological stage IIIc-IV NSCLC harbouring sensitive mutations of EGFR. Progression free survival (PFS)- defined as the time from initial medication to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 2 years
Overall survival(OS), To evaluate the overall survivalof gefitinib combined with S-1 and gefitinib in patients with Pathological stage IIIc-IV NSCLC harbouring sensitive mutations of EGFR in the 3 years since treatment begain, 3 years|Disease control rate, To compare disease control rate of the two arms from start of anti-cancer therapy until progression, 2 years|Objective response rate(ORR), To compare objective response rate of the two arms from start of anti-cancer therapy until progression, 2 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability profile of gefitinib at a 250 mg daily dose relative to that of radiotherapy., 3 years
Assessment of Health-related quality of life, Quality of Life Questionnaire(such as QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13) evaluated since treatment began.At the end of the trial, the differences between the two indicators were compared with Mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), where the baseline was scored as a covariant and the treatment group as a fixed variable. In addition, the baseline values of the two scores, the value of each visit, and the change value of the baseline were statistically described., 3 years
This is a randomized, controlled, open-plan, prospective clinical study. According to the available evidence, we selected patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with stage Ⅲ-C-Ⅳ confirmed by cytology or histology and positive EGFR-sensitive mutation, then patients accept first-line treatment with S-1 plus gefitinib or gefitinib. This study will collect FFS during treatment until the patient dies and will follow the survival of the subject after the disease progresses.
