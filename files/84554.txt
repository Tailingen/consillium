Biomarkers in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
In order to allow Tunisian patients with breast cancer to access immunotherapies, and innovative treatments to extend life expectancy of patients with breast cancer with a poor prognosis, it is important to study the epidemiological profile of Tunisian cancers breast, in terms of PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability status (MSI) and rate of TILs, in metastatic and locally advanced cases, in Tunis, over a one-year follow-up period.

It is also important to study other inflammatory and tumor biomarkers which would have a prognostic or even therapeutic value:

* serum dosage of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase)
* IL-6 (interleukin 6)
* CRP (C-reactive protein)
* absolute count of lymphocytes (CLA) and eosinophils
* quantification of circulating tumor DNA before treatment and under treatment. The primary objective id to identify the epidemiological profile of the biological signature (PD-L1 / TMB / MSI/HRD/ TILs) of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast carcinoma before and during the systemic treatment.
