Comparison of 20-core Versus 12-core Prostate Biopsy Diagnostic Performance in the Detection of Prostate Cancer
The optimal number of prostate cores extracted during a prostate biopsy performed because of a suspected prostate cancer is still debated. The present consensus is to sample 12 cores. However, recent data published in the literature brought arguments in favour of a higher number, probably 20. This would have the advantages of decreasing the false negatives and the re-biopsy rate.
