Proposal for Intraoperative Administration of Intravenous Indocyanine Green to Evaluate Position of the Optic Canal, Position of the Internal Carotid Arteries, Tumor Vascularization, and Vessel Encasement in Endoscopic Endonasal Cranial Base Surgery
This study is being done to demonstrate the feasibility of using a nasal endoscope to perform intraoperative angiography of surgical field, with the goals to evaluate anatomical landmarks and tumor characteristics during skull base surgery and publish a technical note.

DEVICE: near-infrared light nasal endoscope used with ICG
ICG Fluorescence Ratio, We aim to show that ICG fluorescence of the tumor intraoperatively is directly proportional to the contrast enhancement of the tumor from preoperative MRI. Enhancement is shown in ratio form on a scale of 0.01-1.00 showing enhancement ratios of 1. gland to internal carotid artery compared to blood fluorescence and 2. tumor tissue to blood fluorescence. Video recordings of intra-operative ICG fluorescence was compared to pre-operative imaging enhancements and compared in ratio format with a possible score of 0.01-1.00 The higher the ratio, the more closely the intra-operative fluorescence was related to the pre-operative imaging enhancements. 1.00 is considered to have the same enhancing brightness on pre-operative imaging as intra-operative video surveillance., Before intradural dissection and during tumor dissection.
