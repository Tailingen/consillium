Infusional Fluorouracil and Weekly Docetaxel for Gastric Cancer With Bone Marrow Involvement and DIC
A distinctive subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma with extensive bone marrow metastasis and DIC has been described. Few patients have been treated properly due to the lack of standard care. We designed this phase II study to evaluate a dose-dense regimen for this kind of highly aggressive gastric cancer (HAGC).
