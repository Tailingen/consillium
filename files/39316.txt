The Clinical Outcomes and Prediction of Thermal Ablation for Low-risk Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
1. To evaluate the clinical outcomes of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation and thyroid surgery for the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma;
2. To develop and validate a artificial intelligence model to predict the outcomes of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation in the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma;
