Diarrhea Prevention and Prophylaxis With Crofelemer in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Patients
Chemotherapy induced diarrhea is seen in up to 40-80% of patients receiving this treatment for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This diarrhea can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to tolerate chemo/anti-HER2 therapy. This study will look at the efficacy of the drug crofelemer in preventing diarrhea in breast cancer patients.

Diarrhea for >= 2 Consecutive Days, Percentage of participants with any grade (based on CTCAE 4.0) diarrhea lasting 2 or more consecutive days during cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
Diarrhea Any Grade, Incidence of diarrhea of any grade, as measured by CTCAE v4.0, by cycle, Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Grade 3-4 Diarrhea, number of patients with diarrhea of grade 3 or grade 4, as measured by CTCAE v4.0, by cycle and by stratum, Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Diarrhea Onset, Time to onset of first episode of diarrhea of any grade, overall, from baseline through Cycle 3 (21 day cycles)|Diarrhea Duration, Duration (days) of any grade diarrhea, defined from day 1 to day 21, by cycle in which the episode started, Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Duration Grade 3-4 Diarrhea, Duration (days) of grade 3-4 diarrhea during cycle 1 through the end of cycle 2, defined from cycle day 1 to cycle 2 day 21, End of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Anti-diarrheal Medications, Use of anti-diarrheal medications (other than study drug), by cycle and arm, Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|FACIT-D Total Score, Quantitative FACIT-D (FACIT-D Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients With Diarrhea) total score, collected day 1 of each cycle and at the time of study completion, cycles 1 and 2 reported; The higher the score the better the QOL; Score range 0-152., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|FACIT-D Diarrhea Score, Quantitative FACIT-D (FACIT-D Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients With Diarrhea) diarrhea subscale (DS) score, by cycle; Score Range 0-44; the higher the score, the better the QOL., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Stool Frequency Based on Consistency (Bristol Stool Scale), Frequency of stool consistency of 6-7, as measured by the Bristol Stool scale (minimum 1-separate hard lumps, maximum 7-watery, no solid pieces), by cycle; Median in watery bowel movements (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6-7)., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
Various anti-diarrheal agents, such as loperamide, codeine, octreotide, are available for diarrhea management, but few are used in the prophylactic setting and none provide a targeted approach for treating chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID).

Pre-clinical studies have suggested that blocking EGFR results in excess chloride secretion and thus diarrhea. Crofelemer is an extract from the blood red bark of Croton lechleri that inhibits luminal chloride efflux by blocking the calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride channels. Due to its size and polarity, it acts only luminally and is not systemically absorbed. It is currently FDA approved for use in preventing diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy.
