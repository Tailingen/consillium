Study to Assess the Use of Lanreotide AutogelÂ® 120 mg in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours (GEP-NETs) in Routine Clinical Practice
The main aim of this study is to assess the Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 12 months of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg use when administered as part of routine GEP-NET treatment and to follow patient treatment pathways, identify prognostic factors of PFS, evaluate patient's QoL, and patient's and clinician's satisfaction with treatment in routine long-term care setting. The study will provide real-world evidence on the use of Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg and will provide information on topics such as optimization of product usage and identification of best practices and will provide evidence on product effectiveness in a realistic setting.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To estimate the rate according to investigator assessment (radiological progression; based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours version 1.0 \[RECIST 1.0\]), 12 months
Median PFS, 24 months|Tumour origin, 24 months|Tumour grade, 24 months|Quality of Life (QoL), To describe the change in Quality of Life (QoL) as assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL questionnaire for gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (QLQ-GINET21 questionnaires). Where the patient assess experienced symptoms or problems using the scale from 1 to 4. Where 1 represents "not at all" and 4 "very much"., 24 months|Disease Control Rate, To estimate the Disease Control Rate (DCR), as assessed by investigator (proportion of subjects with a best overall response of Partial Response \[PR\], Complete Response \[CR\] or Stable Disease \[SD\])., 24 months|Chromogranin A (CgA) level, 24 months|Patients' satisfaction, To evaluate patients' satisfaction using abbreviated 9-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9). It assesses key dimensions of treatment satisfaction: Effectiveness, Convenience and Global Satisfaction. The effectiveness scored as: 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 7 (extremely satisfied). For the convenience scored as 1 (extremely difficult) to 7 (extremely easy)., 24 months|Urine 5-hydroxyindoleaceticacid (5-HIAA) levels, 24 months
