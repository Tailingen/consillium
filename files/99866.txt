A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of Cevostamab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This Phase Ib, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of cevostamab monotherapy, cevostamab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) or cevostamab plus daratumumab and dexamethasone (Dd) which will be administered to participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) via intravenous (IV) infusion.
