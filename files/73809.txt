Association Between Body Composition and Digestive System Cancer Survival
Investigators intend to utilize clinical data from the Department of Oncology at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital to analyze changes in body composition in digestive system tumor patients before and after receiving anti-tumor drug treatment. Investigators aim to uncover the association between baseline body composition and overall/progression-free survival in patients with digestive system tumors. Additionally, Investigators plan to investigate the relationship between changes in body composition during anti-tumor drug treatment (chemotherapy and immunotherapy) and the prognosis of tumor patients.
