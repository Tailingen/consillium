The primary endpoints of the study will be a set of inter-related biomarkers for hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and inflammation, potential biomarkers for cancer risk., two 4-week feeding periods (56 days total)
Questionnaires will generate data on how these diets may influence mood or depression, sleep habits, and measures of appetite and satiety., two 4-week feeding periods (56 days)
This is a randomized, crossover feeding study conducted in normal weight and overweight individuals. Participants will be given all their food to eat and drink (except water) for two 28-day feeding periods (a total of 56 days). The diets will be carefully controlled and energy intake will be regulated to maintain weight stability for each participant. The two feeding periods will be separated by a 28 day "washout" period when participants will eat their own food. Dinner will be eaten at the Hutchinson Center Monday through Friday. Each evening, breakfast, lunch and snacks will be brought home for the next day. On Friday evenings all the food will be taken home for the weekend.

Samples of blood will be collected after an overnight fast at the beginning and the end of each feeding period. All urine will be collected for 24 hours at the end of each feeding period. A number of questionnaires will also be completed during each diet period. A small stool sample will be collected in your own home, before the first feeding period, and once during each feeding period. The stool sample collection is optional. One can decide not to provide a stool sample and still participate in the study.
