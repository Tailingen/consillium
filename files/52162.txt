Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan Versus Standard of Care in Participants With Previously Treated Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about the study drug sacituzumab govitecan (SG; Trodelvy®; GS-0132; IMMU 132), versus standard of care (SOC) in participants with previously treated extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

The primary objectives of this study are to compare the effect of SG to SOC on objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and to compare the effect of SG to SOC on overall survival (OS).
Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG)|DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Amrubicin (Japan only)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, Up to 4.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as length of time from randomization until the date of death from any cause., Up to 4.5 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization until disease progression as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 4.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as is measured from the time of first response (CR or PR) as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, until the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever comes first, Up to 4.5 years|Time to First Deterioration in Shortness of Breath Domain, Time to first deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first time a participant experienced change from baseline equal to or greater than the prespecified threshold value for deterioration or death., Up to 4.5 years|Time to First Deterioration in Physical Functioning Domain, Time to first deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first time a participant experienced change from baseline equal to or greater than the prespecified threshold value for deterioration or death., Up to 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAE is defined as any AEs occurred during the treatment-emergent period. The treatment-emergent period is defined as the time period from the first dose of study treatment to the earlier of 30 days following the last dose of study treatment or the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy., First dose date up to 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinical Laboratory abnormalities, Laboratory abnormality is defined as any value that increases at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline., First dose date up to 4.5 years
