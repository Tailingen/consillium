Retrospective Analysis of 2nd-line Nab-Paclitaxel + Gemcitabine After 1st-line FOLFIRINOX in Pancreatic Cancer
In this study, clinical data of patients who received 2nd-line Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (nab-P+GEM) after progression on 1st-line FOLFIRINOX will be reviewed retrospectively.

FOLFIRINOX is one of standard 1 st-line regimens for patients with advanced PDAC. However, there is no globally established 2 nd-line regimen after the failure of FOLFIRINOX. Although gemcitabine-based regimens are recommended by multiple guidelines and widely used in daily practice, further analysis is needed to reveal the magnitude of clinical benefit with these regimens. Nab-paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (Nab-P+Gem) is another standard 1 st-line regimen for PDAC, but there are limited data as 2 nd-line therapy in PDAC. Therefore, the investigators are conducting a multicenter retrospective analysis of 2 nd-line nab-P+Gem after progression on FOLFIRINOX in patients with advanced PDAC.
