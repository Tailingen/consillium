Community Health Workers and Precision Medicine
The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether a trained community health worker (CHW) who engages with newly diagnosed patients after a diagnosis of cancer can effectively improve knowledge and receipt of evidence-based precision medicine cancer care services among low-income and minority patients.

Change in knowledge of precision medicine for cancer care from time of enrollment to 3 months post-enrollment, Using 7 multiple choice items adapted from an 8-item survey tool, Knowledge and Purpose of Molecular Profiling, by Davies et. al., 2020, we will assess knowledge of precision medicine (molecular profiling and tumor testing) for cancer care. All questions are multiple choice. For example one question asks 'tumor testing is helpful for making decisions about future cancer risks,' with answer choices: always, frequently, sometimes, rarely, never, or I don't know. Answers will be scored as number or percent correct.

Patient activation using the "Patient Activation Measure" survey, Each patient will receive a validated patient activation survey using the "Patient Activation Measure" at enrollment and 3 months after study enrollment. This is a validated measure from Insignia Health. Responses are: disagree strongly, disagree, agree, agree strongly with higher activation correlated with responses of agree and agree strongly. Each item is rated on 4-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 4 strongly agree, with additional "not applicable" option). Higher scores indicate greater patient activation. For the PAM-10, minimum score is 0 (if all not-applicable) and maximum is 40. Raw scores are converted into activation levels per the scoring guidelines by Insignia Health for: level 1 Disengaged and Overwhelmed, level 2 Becoming Aware but Still Struggling, level 3 Taking Action and Gaining Control, level 4 Maintaining "Behaviors and Pushing Further.

These items are not part of a named tool. They are adapted from the prognosis and treatment preference items developed by Weeks et al. (1998).

1. Is your cancer curable? Response options (ROs): Yes, No, I don't know
2. How long do most patients with your disease live on average? ROs: Less than 6 months, 6 months - 2 years, More than 2 years, I don't know
3. The goal of my cancer treatment is to: (select all that apply) ROs: Cure my disease, help me feel better, extend my life, I don't know
4. Would you prefer a course of treatment that focuses on extending life as much as possible, even if it means having more pain and discomfort, or would you want a plan of care that focuses on relieving pain and discomfort, even if that means not living as long?

The goal of this study is to reduce cancer disparities by improving the knowledge and delivery of evidence-based precision medicine for cancer care. We plan to randomize newly diagnosed patients and those currently under cancer care to either a control arm (usual cancer care alone) versus an intervention arm (layered on top of usual cancer care alone) where patients are assigned to a community health worker who will assist patients in ensuring the following discussions with their care team: 1) precision cancer care 2) cancer diagnosis and treatment plan 2) adherence to treatments and 3) goals of care and symptom burden. A total of 55 participants per study group (total 110) will be recruited in Monterey County from Pacific Cancer Care.
