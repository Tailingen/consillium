Nurse-led Mind-body Intervention on Sexual Health for Breast Cancer Survivors
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy of a nurse-led psychoeducational sexual health intervention for young women breast cancer survivors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What is the feasibility of this intervention in an online, private setting?
2. What is the effect of this intervention on reducing menopausal symptoms, improving sexual functioning, and enhancing body image?

Participants will participate in a nurse-led psychoeducational intervention for 8 sessions lasting approximately an hour each over the course of 16 weeks. Each participant will complete survey items at the beginning, end, and six-weeks after the last session. Participants will be compensated up to $150 in gift cards as a thank-you for their time.
