Patients with SNF2 subtype of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer confirmed by the Department of Pathology and Key Laboratory of Breast Cancer of Fudan University Affiliated Cancer Hospital are planned to be enrolled. Five treatment arms were set up based on the whether they have exposed to CDK4/6 inhibitors before. The main purpose is to evaluate immune therapy in SNF2 subtype of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer and prepare for subsequent randomized controlled phase III clinical studies with larger sample size.
