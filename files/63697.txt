HOT: HIPEC in Ovarian Cancer as Initial Treatment
Community hospital based phase II (prospective randomized) study to evaluate the toxicity of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in newly diagnosed, otherwise untreated, advanced stage (stage III/IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.
Stage III Ovarian Cancer|Stage IV Ovarian Cancer|Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma|Ovarian Carcinoma|Fallopian Tube Carcinoma

Post-operative complication rates, Compare post-operative complication rates between study arms, 30 days post-operative
Assessment of quality of life, FACT-O questionnaire to assess quality of life in both study arms, Baseline, 4 weeks post-operative, upon completion of systemic chemotherapy, and years 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5|Evaluate the rate of progression free survival, Time from intervention to disease recurrence, at 24 months|Evaluate overall survival, Time from intervention to death, at 1, 3, and 5 years
Risk factors for morbidity and mortality, Determine percent of patients wtih Grade I-V adverse events according to NCI criteria, Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE)., During & at study completion
Primary endpoints:

* To assess the feasibility of recruitment
* Compare complication rates between the two study arms: CRS with HIPEC and CRS alone.

Secondary endpoints:

* To determine risk factors for morbidity and mortality
* Assess completion rate of 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy
* To determine progression free survival at 24 months
* To determine overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years
* Evaluate health related quality of life

Patients who meet study criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: 1) cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with carboplatin-based hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) followed by IV combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel or 2) cytoreductive surgery (CRS) alone followed by adjuvant intraperitoneal (IP) and IV chemotherapy with combination cisplatin and paclitaxel for newly diagnosed advanced stage (stage III/IV) ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Both study arms will receive 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Twenty-four patients will undergo CRS with HIPEC performed by surgical and gynecologic oncologic surgeons at Mercy Medical Center, followed by systemic IV chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC=6) and paclitaxel (175mg/m2) for 6 cycles postoperatively.

Twenty-four patients will undergo CRS only performed by surgical and gynecologic oncologic surgeons at Mercy Medical Center, followed by IV/IP chemotherapy with Day 1: IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m2), Day 2: IP cisplatin (75 mg/m2), and Day 8: IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) for 6 cycles postoperatively.
