A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study Study of CLAG Regimen in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With First-induction Failure
Most of patients with acute myeloid leukemia achieved complete remission (CR) after primary induction chemotherapy, there were 20-30% patients without CR after first-induction. It was uncertain how to treat these patients. It was investigated in our study that these patients were re-induced with CLAG Regimen. The CR ratio, overall survival (OS) and relapsed-free survival (RFS) was statistically analysed in these patients.
