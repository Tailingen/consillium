Feasibility Study: Comparison of Performance Status With Objective Physical Activity Monitors
The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between performance status rating and the actual amount of physical activity a subject does when it is measured by an activity monitor.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Observation
To determine the feasibility of examining physical activity (through objective measurement devices) and performance status in a 14-day study of lung cancer patients., 14 days
To determine the number of days of monitoring necessary to reliably estimate energy expenditure (steps/day, and % of time spent sedentary) in lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy., 14 days
