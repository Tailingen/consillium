Study of Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab or Standard of Care Chemotherapy Compared to the Standard of Care Chemotherapy Alone in Treatment of Participants With Untreated Inoperable or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether an investigational immunotherapy nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with standard of care chemotherapy is more effective than standard of care chemotherapy alone in treating participants with previously untreated inoperable or metastatic urothelial cancer.
