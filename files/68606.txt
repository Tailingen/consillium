Concurrent Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Resectable Stage III NSCLC
Combination treatment of Durvalumab with chemoradiotherapy is ongoing for head/neck cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02318771) and pancreatic cancer (NCT02305186).Combining Durvalumab with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a promising strategy to improve clinical outcome in stage III lung cancer. Using serial biopsied and surgically resected fresh tissue through the novel/high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, we want to identify the change immune signature in tumor microenvironment of NSCLC patients after Durvalumab treatment. With hypothesis that PD-1 inhibitor as a component of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery could increase complete pathologic response rate and disease free survival, and overall survival, we suggest adding Durvalumab to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in stage II/III resectable NSCLC. And with immune marker study using FACS, whole exome sequencing, or RNAsequencing, we can find the potential predictive biomarker for anti-PD-L1 blockade. And in this study, we can get "whole" surgical specimen not biopsy sample after Durvalumab treatment so the analysis for immune marker, tumor microenvironment, and various tumor infiltrating immune cells and their changes will be available.
