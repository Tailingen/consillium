Studying Genes Associated With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Young Patients
This research studies genes associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young patients. Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer
Childhood Burkitt Lymphoma|Childhood Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Potential deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), Baseline
OBJECTIVES:

I. To conduct a preliminary investigation of the effects of loci strongly and consistently associated in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and validation studies of childhood/adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases on the risk of NHL (lymphoblastic and Burkitt lymphomas) in children and adolescents.

OUTLINE:

DNA samples are analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism and genotyped by fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allelic discrimination (Taqman) assays using the ABI Prism 7900HT reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system.
