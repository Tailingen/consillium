DNA Repair and Genetic Susceptibility to Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people with a second primary lung cancer with those who have only a first primary lung cancer. We hope to use the information obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will not regard the results from this study as final.

We will analyze your blood cells and DNA to measure the changes in several genes that we believe may be involved in lung cancer. We also want to evaluate the capacity for your DNA to repair itself.

To conduct a pilot study of the role of DNA repair in lung cancer subjects with high genetic risk - those with a second primary lung cancer - compared to subjects with only one lung cancer., conclusion of the study
To determine the association between cellular DNA repair and genetic alterations in DNA repair and associated pathways., conclusion of the study
