IC Plus Low-dose Radiation Plus Cadonilimab in LANPC
This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial in primary diagnosed loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of induction chemotherapy (IC) combined with low-dose radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) versus IC+CCRT, and compare the treatment-related adverse events and quality of life in two groups.
