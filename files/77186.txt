Safety and Efficacy of ProHema Modulated Umbilical Cord Blood Units in Subjects With Hematologic Malignancies.
The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen during a double umbilical cord blood unit transplant with one of the cord blood units modulated with ProHema.

The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen during a double umbilical cord blood unit transplant with one of the cord blood units modulated with ProHema.

-As part of this research study cord units will be modulated in the laboratory with ProHema before it is given to the participant. Two different treatment groups will be tested. Group 1: will have the second cord blood unit modulated with ProHema; Group 2: will have the first cord blood unit modulated with ProHema.
