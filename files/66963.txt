Investigating the Optimal Remifentanil and Dexmedetomidine Concentration for Uterine Fibroid Ablation
This clinical trial aims to find a better drug concentration of Remifentanil in Uterine Fibroid Ablation. The main question it seeks to answer is:

\[primary hypothesis 1\] Remifentanil concentration of 2.0 ng/mL provides better pain control in Uterine Fibroid Ablation.

There is a comparison group in this study: Researchers will compare Remifentanil concentration of 1.0 ng/mL to see if provides similar pain control with fewer side effects.

Participants will be separated into two groups, one group with a Remifentanil concentration of 2.0 ng/mL and the other 1.0 ng/mL. During uterine fibroid ablation, the patient\&#39;s pain index will be recorded (using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 0\~10 points). We will also record vital signs during the procedure.
Uterine Fibroids (UF)
DRUG: arm 2|DRUG: arm 1
Pain scores during uterine fibroid ablation, Participants will be separated into 2 groups, one with remifentanil 1.0 ng/mL, and the other with remifentanil 2.0 ng/mL. Pain scores will be recorded during uterine fibroid ablation., From the start of uterine fibroid ablation till 30 minutes after the ablation.
Vital signs during uterine fibroid ablation, Participants will be separated into 2 groups, one with remifentanil 1.0 ng/mL, and the other with remifentanil 2.0 ng/mL. Vital signs (including blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rates) will be recorded during uterine fibroid ablation., From the start of uterine fibroid ablation till 30 minutes after the ablation.
