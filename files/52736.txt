FT522 With Rituximab in Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma (FT522-101)
This is a phase 1 study of FT522 administered with rituximab in participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma (R/R BCL). The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FT522 in combination with rituximab, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FT522 in combination with rituximab; each objective will be assessed with or without conditioning chemotherapy.

DRUG: FT522|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Bendamustine
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The number of participants experiencing â‰¥1 DLT will be reported., From Day 1 through Day 29 of Cycle 1|Severity of DLTs, The severity of DLTs will be determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, v5.0)., From Day 1 through Day 29 of Cycle 1
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Participants will be classified into the following tumor response categories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or not evaluable (NE) according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. The best overall response (BOR) will be summarized for the efficacy evaluable population. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a PR or better during the study prior to any subsequent off-protocol anti-cancer therapy., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR is defined as the time from first objective response to disease progression or death from any cause., Up to approximately 18 months|Duration of Complete Response (DOCR), The DOCR is defined as the time from first CR to disease progression or death from any cause., Up to approximately 18 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first study intervention to progressive disease or death from any cause., Up to approximately 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose of study intervention to death from any cause., Up to approximately 18 months|Area Under the Plasma-Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of FT522, The plasma AUC of FT522 will be reported., Cycle 1, Up to Day 29|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of FT522, The plasma Cmax of FT522 will be reported., Cycle 1, Up to Day 29
