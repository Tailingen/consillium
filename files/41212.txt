Evaluation of the Impact of Pancreatectomy on Systemic Immunity
The study aims at establishing the profile of the immune reaction that occurs in the early surgical suites after pancreatectomy. Blood samples will be collected before surgery, (Day-1), at day0, and after surgery at Day 1, Day 3, Day 7 at 1 year after pancreatectomy. Mass cytometry, genomic and transcriptomic approaches will be used to evaluate the immune systemic modulation after surgery.
