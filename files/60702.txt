Study of SRF617 With AB928 (Etrumadenant) and AB122 (Zimberelimab) in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This trial will look at the safety and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 in combination with etrumadenant and zimberelimab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer|Prostate Cancer
DRUG: SRF617|DRUG: etrumadenant|DRUG: zimberelimab
Number of Participants With Response, Response was defined as Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) decline of ≥ 50% (PSA50) and/or radiographic objective response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) Criteria. The number of participants with response shows participants with any one or combination of these response types.

* CR: Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \< 10 millimeters (mm) in short axis
* PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum of diameters, From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were defined as death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section., From date of first dose until 90 days after the last dose of treatment (maximum treatment exposure: 168 days)
Number of Participants With Response Per PCWG3 Criteria, The number of participants achieving CR or PR by PCWG3 criteria is reported:

* CR: Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \< 10 millimeters (mm) in short axis
* PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum of diameters
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions from the smallest value on trial (including Baseline, if that is the smallest). The sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Or, the appearance of one or more lesions
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from first documented response (PSA50 and/or CR/PR) to documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria, or documented death due to any cause, whichever occured first., From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR, or SD lasting a minimum of 12 weeks by PCWG3 or PSA50 criteria., From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Number of Participants With PSA50 Response, PSA50 response is defined as a confirmed PSA decrease from Baseline of 50% or more based on 2 consecutive assessments measured 3 to 4 weeks apart., From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Number of Participants With PSA Decline of ≥ 30% (PSA30) Response, PSA30 response is defined as a confirmed PSA decrease from Baseline of 30% or more based on 2 consecutive assessments measured 3 to 4 weeks apart., From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Time to PSA Progression, From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (PFS), From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Landmark PFS Rate, Landmark PFS was defined as the percentage of participants who have not developed PFS events of death or documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria., Months 6 and 12|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration of SRF617 (Cmax), From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration of SRF617 Prior to Administration of Subsequent Dose (Cmin), From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Number of Participants With Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs), From the date of first dose administration to the end of treatment (maximum exposure: 168 days)|Number of Participants With Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSEs), Number of participants with SSEs per PCWG3 criteria, defined as symptomatic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression, is reported., From date of first dose until 90 days after the last dose of treatment (maximum treatment exposure: 168 days)
This is a phase 2, open-label, safety and preliminary efficacy trial in patients with mCRPC using the combination of SRF617, etrumadenant (AB928), and zimberelimab (AB122).
