Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK) of AKT and MEK Combination
This study is a Phase 1 dose-escalation open-label study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and regimen for the combination of the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 and the orally administered AKT kinase inhibitor GSK2141795. The study consists of two parts. Part 1A will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a Zone-Based, modified 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure. The starting dose (Zone 1, Cohort 1) will be 0.5mg GSK1120212 combined with 25mg GSK2141795. Dose escalation will continue based on predefined parameters until a MTD is established. The initial regimen for dose escalation in Part 1A will be continuous oral daily dosing. Once the continuous daily dosing MTD or RP2D has been established in Part 1A, Part 1B will explore alternate dosing schedule(s) in which the dosing schedule may be adjusted for either GSK1120212 or GSK2141795. Dose escalation will proceed using a 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure until an MTD or RP2D of that alternate schedule is defined. Part 2 will explore further in specific tumor types the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the combination of GSK1120212 and GSK2141795 at the recommended dose(s) and regimen(s) identified in Part 1.
