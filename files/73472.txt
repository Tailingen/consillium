Dose Escalation Study of Safety and Tolerability of AT-406 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and the maximum dose of Debio 1143 (AT-406) that can be given to humans. This study is also designed to measure how much Debio 1143 (AT-406) gets into the blood stream (pharmacokinetics), and how Debio 1143 (AT-406) interacts with proteins related to cancer that the drug is targeted to affect (pharmacodynamics).

DRUG: Debio 1143 (AT-406)
Maximally Tolerated Dose, The primary endpoint of this study is to characterize the safety, and determine the maximum tolerated dose and schedule of Debio 1143 (AT-406) when administered to patients with advanced cancer. Patients will receive Debio 1143 (AT-406) on days 1-5, and 15-19 of a 28 day cycle, days 1-5 of a 21 day cycle, or days 1-14 of a 21 day cycle. For the purpose of determining the MTD, dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated at any time. For the purpose of dose escalation, dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the end of 1 cycle., 1 cycle, or any time during treatment
Pharmacokinetic, A secondary endpoint of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of Debio 1143 (AT-406) in plasma and urine, and preliminary metabolism profile of Debio 1143 (AT-406)., Days 1-5 of Cycle 1|Pharmacodynamic, A secondary endpoint of this study, provided that adequate amounts of tissue are available, is to evaluate the interaction of Debio 1143 (AT-406) with IAP family members (e.g., xIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, etc.). Patient participation in this aspect of the study is optional., Cycle 1|Efficacy, A secondary endpoint to this study is to identify any anti-tumor activity of Debio 1143 (AT-406) that may be observed in the course of the trial. Applicable solid tumor or lymphoma response criteria will be used, accordingly., After a minimum of 2 cycles.|Correlation of Efficacy to Pharmacokinetic and/or Pharmacodynamic Effects of Debio 1143 (AT-406), A secondary endpoint of this study is to correlate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of Debio 1143 (AT-406) with any observed antitumor activity of Debio 1143 (AT-406)., Anytime during Debio 1143 (AT-406) treatment
Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a clinical trial of the compound Debio 1143 (AT-406), a small molecule second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase C (Smac) mimetic. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that Debio 1143 (AT-406) induces cell death in several tumor models by inhibiting XIAP (X linked IAP), cIAP-1 (cellular IAP-1) and cIAP-2 (cellular IAP-2), thus releasing initiator and effector caspases to promote apoptosis. This protocol is a Phase I, dose-escalation, open-label, multi-center study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacology of Debio 1143 (AT-406) in humans when administered orally.
