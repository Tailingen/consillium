Efficacy of HIPEC as NACT and Postoperative Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Advanced-Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This project is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical observation the safety and efficacy of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NACT) and postoperative chemotherapy after interval debulking surgery (IDS) for advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer . PR/SD rate, percentage of optimal debulking surgery and 3-year disease-free survival is the primary end points of this project.

PR/SD rate, calculate the percent of partial remission (PR) plus stable disease (SD) of patients received HIPEC+NACT or NACT alone in both two arms, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Percentage of optimal debulking surgery, evaluate the percentage of optimal debulk (residual disease \< 1cm) after interval debulking surgery between study arms, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease-free survival rate, assess disease free survival rate during 3 years in both study arms, 3 years
Overall survival rate, assess overall survival rate during 3 years in both study arms, 3 years|Risk factors for morbidity and mortality, determine percent of patients wtih Grade I-IV adverse events according to NCI criteria, Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE 4.0)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Quality of life, Evaluated according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30), 3 years|Quality of life for ovarian cancer, Evaluated according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Ovarian Cancer Module (QLQ-OV28), 3 years
The current standard treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, tubal cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer is maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy with or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP). Recently, the organizations of SGO and ASCO recommended that women with a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to \< 1 cm of residual disease (ideally to novisible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Hyperthermia promotes chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue. Therefore, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy after interval debulking surgery in the treatment of ovarian cancer could lead to higher response rate and better survival outcomes.
