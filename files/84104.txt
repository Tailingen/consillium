This is an observation pilot trial aimed to study to the association between mindfulness and other psychological factors, including both protective and risk factors, with recovery of functional ability following colorectal cancer surgery.

Preliminary evidence suggests that there are multiple variables that may influence the functional recovery following colorectal cancer surgery, some of which deal with the psychological domain. Distress and depression can negatively affect the perceptions of functional ability, while resilience and effective coping styles promote a better psychological adaptation to challenging situations. Furthermore, psychosocial prehabilitation and interventions have been proposed as a feasible and cost-effective way to positively influence the recovery after surgery in association with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol.

In particular, mindfulness is proved to be associated with higher quality of life in different medical conditions, including oncological patients and has been also associated with improved clinical outcomes.

The aim of the study is to investigate the association of mindfulness and other psychological predictors with functional and quality of life outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal surgery for oncological condition.
