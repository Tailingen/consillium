Imatinib in Patients With Mucosal or Acral/Lentiginous Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective imatinib (Gleevec) is in treating acral/lentiginous and mucosal melanoma which has spread to other parts of the body in patients who's disease carries a c-kit mutation. Imatinib is a protein-kinase inhibitor. It is believed that imatinib may be effective in blocking signals on certain cancer cells which allow the malignant cells to multiply and spread.

Best Overall Response, Best overall response (BOR) on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. CR or PR confirmation required within 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum LD of target lesions from smallest sum LD as reference or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither meeting PR or PD. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. CR is disappearance of all non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, after 6-weeks, and at 2-month intervals on treatment. Mean treatment duration was 4 months (range 1-11; amplified/mutated 3m/ 6m).
Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline, after 6-weeks, and at 2-month intervals on treatment and every 3 months long-term. Mean treatment duration was 4 months (range 1-11; amplified/mutated 3m/ 6m).|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive., Patients were followed long-term every 3 months until first progression, death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 10.6 months (range 3.7-27.1).
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the response rate of patients with metastatic mucosal, acral/lentiginous, or chronically sun damaged melanomas to treatment with of imatinib.
* To determine the time to progression.

Secondary

* To correlate c-kit mutational status with response to therapy.
* To evaluate the use of FDG-PET scanning in determining early biologic response to therapy.
* Tolerability of imatinib.
* To assess amplification of c-kit status through quantitative PCR and/or FISH and other related molecular pathway targets.
* To correlate c-kit amplification status with response to therapy.
