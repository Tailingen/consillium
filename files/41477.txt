Safety and Efficacy of Actamax™Adhesion Barrier in Women Undergoing Laparoscopic Abdominopelvic Surgery/Myomectomy
Women undergoing laparoscopic abdominopelvic surgery with a planned, second look laparoscopy within 8-12 (+4) weeks will be enrolled. All subjects must undergo myomectomy with/without treatment of co-existing pathology e.g. (+/-) adhesions and/or (+/-) endometriosis, and/or (+/-) adenomyosis, and/or (+/-) ovarian cyst(s). The value of the second look laparoscopy (SLL) must be confirmed by the investigator to be of clinical benefit to the subject. The subject must be desirous of future fertility and willing to undergo the SLL to assess whether pathology (e.g. adnexal adhesions or endometriosis) exists which could be treated with a goal of improving their likelihood of conceiving and progressing to full term.
