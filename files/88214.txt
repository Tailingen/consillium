A Study in Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula
The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) issued the definition and classification system of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), and received widespread recognition. Currently, it has become an important reference for clinical treatment of POPF.
Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic fistula, The determine of pancreatic fistula follows the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistulas (ISGPF) criteria, From date of operation until the date of in-hospital death or death within 30 days after operation, whichever came first, assessed up to 200 days
Hospital stays, Post-operation hospital stay is assessed, From date of operation until the date of in-hospital death or death within 30 days after operation, whichever came first, assessed up to 200 days|Number of hospitalizations, Number of hospitalizations during the observational period, From date of operation until the date of in-hospital death or death within 30 days after operation, whichever came first, assessed up to 200 days|Mortality, Postoperative death in 30 days are considered concerned with pancreatic fistula, From date of operation until the date of in-hospital death or death within 30 days after operation, whichever came first, assessed up to 200 days
The definition of POPF released by ISGPS in 2016 still seems to have certain deficiency. For example, in both definitions in 2005 and 2016, the re-operation is used as an important judgment index of "Grade C POPF". But a unified standard or consensus is still lacked for the indication of POPF re-operation, which may finally impact the diagnosis of "Grade C POPF". Therefore, we performed this study, so as to better improve the relevant definition and provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment.
