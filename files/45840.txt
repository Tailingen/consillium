Phase 1/2a Study of DTA-H19 in Advanced Stage Ovarian Cancer
This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of DTA-H19 administered intraperitoneally (IP) in subjects with advanced stage ovarian cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinoma
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: BC-819
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities, A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 3 or greater non-hematologic AE by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). If one subject in a cohort experienced a DLT, then three additional subjects had to be enrolled to that cohort unless a second subject in that cohort experiences a DLT. The next lower dose was to be considered the MTD., 8 weeks
Overall Survival in ITT Population, Overall survival, defined as the time from the start of treatment until the subject died, was estimated by Kaplan Meier curves., 17.5 months|Solid Tumor Response, If measurable disease was present, then the response of each marker lesion was evaluated separately and rated for response according to RECIST criteria for solid tumors.

Complete Response: Disappearance of the target lesion. Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the longest diameter of the target lesion.

Stable Disease: No sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response, or sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.

Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the longest diameter of the target lesion., 6 weeks|Systemic BC-819 Pharmacokinetics (PK) by Treatment - T1/2 (Hours), Blood was collected at the indicated time points, then analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) method to quantitate the amount of plasmid present., Before the start of the infusion of BC-819 and 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours after the start of the infusion|Systemic BC-819 Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Blood was collected at the indicated time points, then analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) method to quantitate the amount of plasmid present., Before the start of the infusion of BC-819 and 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours after the start of the infusion|Systemic BC-819 Pharmacokinetics (PK) by Treatment - Tmax (Hours), Blood was collected at the indicated time points, then analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) method to quantitate the amount of plasmid present., Before the start of the infusion of BC-819 and 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours after the start of the infusion|Systemic BC-819 Pharmacokinetics (PK) by Treatment - AUClast, Blood was collected at the indicated time points, then analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) method to quantitate the amount of plasmid present., Before the start of the infusion of BC-819 and 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours after the start of the infusion|Systemic BC-819 Pharmacokinetics (PK) by Treatment - AUCinf, Blood was collected at the indicated time points, then analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) method to quantitate the amount of plasmid present., Before the start of the infusion of BC-819 and 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 hours after the start of the infusion|Overall Survival in PP, Overall survival, defined as the time from the start of treatment until the subject died, was estimated by Kaplan Meier curves., 17.5 months
This is a Phase 1/2a, open label, dose escalation, repeat dose study in 11 subjects with recurrent, platinum resistant advanced stage ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma designed to determine the tolerability, safety, quality of life, PK, and preliminary efficacy of DTA-H19 administered intraperitoneally(IP).

Primary Objective: The primary objectives of this study are:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IP DTA-H19; and,
* To identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study are:

* To determine quality of life of subjects with advanced ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with IP DTA-H19;
* To determine the the reduction in malignant ascites as measured by Ultrasound and change in frequency of parecenteses necessary.
* To determine the overall survival distribution.
