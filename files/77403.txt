Anlotinib Combined With Dose-reduced Olaparib in Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
PARP inhibitors have changed the treatment paradigm of ovarian cancer. Most patients using PARP(poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors will suffer different grades of adverse events(AEs), followed by dose reduction. It has not been reported whether the dose-reduced olaparib as maintenance treatment have an impact on efficacy. Both PAOLA-1 and AVANOVA 2 studies showed that combined PARP inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs have synergistic anti-tumor effect. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can inhibit VEGFR(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), FGFR(fibroblast growth factor receptor), PDGFR(platelet-derived growth factor receptor) α/β, c-Kit, and Ret. And anlotinib has been approved as orphan drug designations for treatment of ovarian cancer by FDA in 2015. Previous studies showed that anlotinib had manageable toxicity and promising antitumor effect. Our study is expected to investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with dose-reduced olaparib as maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 5.0 to further describe safety and assess toxicities encountered with the use of the proposed treatment regimen in participants., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomisation to the first occurrence of death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Time from enrollment to first subsequent treatment (TFST), TFST is defined as time from enrollment to first subsequent treatment., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Quality of Life(QoL), EORTC QLQ-C30(European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30) is used to evaluate the quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, an average of 1 year
This study is a single-arm, single-center, exploratory phase II study to observe the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with dose-reduced olaparib in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. We will enroll the subjects who are treated with olaparib as maintenance treatment followed by dose reduction due to adverse events. The primary end points are progression free survival and adverse events. The secondary end points include objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, time from enrollment to first subsequent treatment, quality of life.
