About This PDQ Summary
Incidence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Presentation
Testicular tumors are very rare in young boys and account for 1% to 2% of all childhood tumors.[
1
,
2
] The most common testicular tumors are benign teratomas, followed by malignant nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. For more information, see
Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment
.
Non–germ cell tumors such as sex cord–stromal tumors are exceedingly rare in prepubertal boys.[
3
] In a small series, gonadal stromal tumors accounted for 8% to 13% of pediatric testicular tumors.[
4
,
5
] Most gonadal stromal tumors present as painless testicular masses, while 10% to 20% of patients may have endocrine manifestations, such as precocious puberty.[
6
]
In newborns and infants, juvenile granulosa cell and Sertoli cell tumors are the most common stromal cell tumors. Sertoli cell tumors present later in infancy (median age, 7 months). Juvenile granulosa cell tumors usually present early in infancy (median age, 6 days).[
6
] These tumors account for less than 5% of all neoplasms in the prepubertal testis. Testicular juvenile granulosa cell tumors harbor recurrent loss of chromosome 10 and lack the
GNAS
and
AKT1
variants described in their ovarian tumor counterparts.[
7
]
In older males, Leydig cell tumors are more common.[
8
] In a report of 12 patients with Leydig cell tumors (aged 4.2–14.7 years), precocious puberty was the presenting symptom in 7 of 12 patients.[
9
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Testicular Sertoli cell tumors and, possibly, Leydig cell tumors are associated with
DICER1
syndrome. Patients with these tumors should undergo genetic testing for
DICER1
germline pathogenic variants.[
10
]
Large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors are rare testicular sex cord–stromal tumors that primarily affects young males. These tumors are usually benign, may occur in both testes, and often have slow and indolent courses.[
11
] One study included 18 patients with large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors. Eight  tumors were clinically benign (≥18 months of follow-up without metastasis), eight were clinically ambiguous (lacking sufficient follow-up to determine tumor behavior; <18 months of follow-up without metastasis), and two were clinically malignant (documented metastasis). For the patients with clinically benign tumors, median age at diagnosis was 15.5 years, and median tumor size was 1.9 cm. For the patients with clinically ambiguous tumors, median age at diagnosis was 19 years, and median tumor size was 1.6 cm. For the patients with clinically malignant tumors, median age at diagnosis was 28.5 years, and median tumor size was 2.3 cm. All patients survived except for one with a metastatic tumor (median follow-up, 33 months).[
12
] Large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors may be indicative of an underlying genetic predisposition, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or Carney complex.[
13
] Carney complex is an autosomal dominant, multisystem tumor disorder [
14
] that is most frequently caused by germline pathogenic variants in the
PRKAR1A
gene.[
15
] A retrospective multi-institutional analysis of 15 patients with large-cell calcifying Sertoli tumor (median age, 16 years) included 4 patients with Carney complex.[
16
] Loss of cytoplasmic PRKAR1A expression (evaluated by immunohistochemistry) was observed in all but one patient (14 of 15; 93%). PRKAR1A expression was retained in all other sex cord–stromal tumors, indicating that this testing may aid in diagnosis of this rare tumor.

Treatment of Childhood Testicular Cancer
The European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors within the PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network - European Registry) has published comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of sex cord–stromal tumors in children and adolescents.[
1
]
Treatment options for childhood testicular cancer (non–germ cell tumors) include the following:
Surgery.
There are conflicting data about malignant potential in older males. Most case reports suggest that in pediatric patients, these tumors can be treated with surgery alone.[
2
,
3
][
Level of evidence C1
]; [
4
][
Level of evidence C2
]  It is prudent to check alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels before surgery.  Elevated AFP levels usually indicate a malignant germ cell tumor. However, AFP levels and decay in levels are often difficult to interpret in infants younger than 1 year.[
5
]
Evidence (surgery):
In a study of patients prospectively reported to the German Maligne Keimzelltumoren (MAKEI) registry, 42 patients with sex cord–stromal tumors were identified. All tumors were confined to the testes. Patients were treated with surgery alone, according to specific germ cell tumor guidelines.[
6
][
Level of evidence C1
]
There were no tumor recurrences.
A French registry identified 11 boys with localized sex cord–stromal testicular tumors.  All 11 boys were treated with surgery alone.[
7
][
Level of evidence C1
]
There were no tumor recurrences.
The benign behavior of pediatric non–germ cell testicular tumors has led to reports of testis-sparing surgery.[
8
-
12
]  In one series of 12 patients with Leydig cell tumors (aged 4.2–14.7 years), 3 were treated with enucleation alone, and  9 were treated with orchiectomy.[
13
][
Level of evidence C1
]
All patients were alive at the last follow-up.
Given the rarity of this tumor, the best surgical approach in pediatrics has not yet been defined.

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Childhood Testicular Cancer
Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the
NCI website
. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the
ClinicalTrials.gov website
.
Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
