Lapatinib and Temozolomide for the Treatment of Progressive Brain Disease in HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
Objectives:

Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combining lapatinib and temozolomideSecondary - Obtain preliminary information on the clinical anti-tumor activity of lapatinib plus temozolomide on brain metastases secondary to HER-2 positive breast cancer including Objective Response Rate (ORR), Clinical Benefit (CB) and Duration of Response (DR)

Methodology:

Phase I, single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation study of combining lapatinib and temozolomide in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with progressive brain metastases after surgery or radiotherapy or radiosurgery

Treatment:

Temozolomide will be given orally for 5 days of every 28 days, at doses of either 100mg/m2/day or 150mg/m2/day or 200mg/m2/day AND Lapatinib will be given orally every day at either 1000mg/day or 1250mg/day or 1500mg/day.Sequential cohorts will be escalated in increments according to the dose escalation scheme, and determined by dose limiting toxicities.
