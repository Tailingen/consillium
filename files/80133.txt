Image-Based, In-Vivo Assessment of Tumor Hypoxia to Guide Hypoxia-Driven Adaptive Radiation Therapy
This study will apply novel MRI approaches with established sensitivity to tissue oxygen consumption and perfusion to predict hypoxia-associated radiation resistance, manifested as tumor recurrence and progression post-treatment.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Brain Metastases
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|DRUG: 18F-fluoromisonidazole
Validate non-invasive, MRI-based markers of tumor hypoxia in patients with brain metastases or head and neck cancer with and without evidence of tumor hypoxia identified by 18F-FMISO-PET-CT, MRI assessed oxygen extraction fraction (OEF, %), 1.5 years
Assess treatment-related changes in tumor and peritumoral tissue oxygen consumption and perfusion via non-invasive MRI, MRI assessed oxygen extraction fraction (OEF, %), 4 years
Evaluate the effect of pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor hypoxia on outcome, Tumor recurrence, 4 years|Evaluate the effect of pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor hypoxia on outcome, Radiation necrosis, 4 years
Primary Objective:

- To validate non-invasive, MRI-based markers of tumor hypoxia in patients with brain metastases or head and neck cancer with and without evidence of tumor hypoxia identified by 18F-FMISO-PET-CT.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess treatment-related changes in tumor and peritumoral tissue oxygen consumption and perfusion via non-invasive MRI.
* To evaluate the effect of pre-treatment and post-treatment (3 months) tumor hypoxia on tumor recurrence, progression, and radiation necrosis in patients with central nervous system metastases treated with standard of care stereotactic radiosurgery.
