Apatinib Mesylate Versus Standard Second-line TKI in the Treatment of Advanced GIST
The goal of this Mesylate apatinib versus standard second-line TKI in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a randomized, open, controlled, single-center clinical study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib compared with second-line treatment in advanced GIST patients with first-line TKI failure. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* To explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib compared with standard second-line treatment for GIST with advanced first-line TKI failure.
* To explore the expression level and MVD value of VEGFR2 in GIST, and to explore the relationship between the expression level and the location, size, mitotic image and recurrence risk grading of GIST.

Patients with advanced GIST were randomly included in the trial group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate|DRUG: Sunitinib, Imatinib dosage, Dasatinib, Reveratinib
Progression-Free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is the time from treatment to observed disease progression or death from any cause., 12 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is the time from randomization to death from any cause.For subjects who had been lost to follow-up prior to death, the last follow-up time was usually calculated as the time of death., 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume has decreased to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) cases., 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink or stabilize for a certain period of time, including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) cases., 24 months
The objectives of this study were as follows:

1. To explore the efficacy and safety of Apatinib compared with standard second-line treatment of advanced GIST with first-line TKI failure, and to provide high-level clinical evidence for the treatment of late-stage plasmatoma;
2. Explore the expression level and MVD value of VEGFR2 in GIST, and explore the relationship between the expression level and the location, size, mitotic image and recurrence risk grading of GIST.
