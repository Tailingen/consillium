Study of Pralatrexate & Gemcitabine With B12 & Folic Acid to Treat Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoproliferative Malignancies
This study is for patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies that have progressed after receiving a previous treatment (relapsed) or are no longer responding to treatment (refractory). To be in this study, patients must have certain types of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), or B-cell lymphoma, including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

This study is being done to find doses of the combination of pralatrexate and gemcitabine with vitamin B12 and folic acid that can be safely given to patients with these types of lymphoma and explore the effectiveness of the treatment.

Objective Responses Assessed by International Workshop Criteria (IWC), Number of participants who achieved an objective response. Objective response was defined as a tumor response assessment of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and was determined only for patients with measurable disease at baseline. A tumor response assessment reported by IWC without PET was used for any analyses in cases where an IWC+PET evaluation was not done., Assessed every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) for Phase II and no less than every 3 cycles for Phase I
Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the number of days between the date of first tumor response assessment of objective response to the time of the first tumor response assessment of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause (date of first PD assessment or death - date of first objective response assessment + 1), Response assessments were performed no less than every 3 cycles in the Phase 1 part of the study and every 8 weeks (± 1 week) in the Phase 2a part of the study|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS time was calculated as the number of days from study day 1 to the date of PD or death, regardless of cause (date of PD or death - study day 1 + 1)., Response assessments were performed no less than every 3 cycles in the Phase 1 part of the study and every 8 weeks (± 1 week) in the Phase 2a part of the study
