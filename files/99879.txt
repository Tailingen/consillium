Evaluating Lapatinib + Capecitabine in Patients Aged 70 and Over With HER2 Metastatic Breast Cancer.
GERICO 09/0907 is a Phase II multicentric trial evaluating the toxicity and activity of the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer over expressing HER2 for patients aged â‰¥ 70 who have failed after one line of chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab.

Due to the minimal participation of older people in clinical trials, there is a lack of data to make evidence-based decisions regarding chemotherapy in this indication.

The study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination lapatinib and capecitabine in term of clinical benefit, and with no adverse effects and no detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment).

The main objective is to assess clinical benefit (defined at 4 months as complete response, partial response or stable disease), safety and preserved geriatric independence (main objective is a "bi-criteria" or composite criteria).
Metastatic Breast Cancer|70 Years Old Patients and Over|After One Line of Chemotherapy With Trastuzumab
DRUG: lapatinib + capecitabine
Efficacy assessment, Benefit is defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to RECIST criteria (vers. 1.1).

Efficacy criteria is the number of patients meeting this definition. Patients having stopped before this 4-months time point will be considered as non responders without clinical benefit., at 4 months|Tolerance criteria and impact on functional status, The criteria is the number of patients for whom a toxicity event (according to the NCI-CTC AE vers.4)and/or an impact on functional status (defined by the 8 items IADL assessment scale) has been observed during the first 4 months of treatment., at 4 months
Duration of clinical benefit, from treatment start until disease progression|Time to progression, from inclusion to disease progression or death due to breast cancer|Overall response rate, from treatment start until end of treatment|Progression free survival, from inclusion to disease progression or death due to any cause|Overall survival, from inclusion until death due to any cause or last follow-up news (censored data)|Time to treatment failure endpoint, Treatment stop can be due to toxicity, death, refusal to continue study, or progressive disease., from inclusion to end of treatment|Determination of toxicity of the combination (NCI-CTC vers.4), from informed consent signature to one month after last study drug intake|Geriatric Evaluation, Activities of daily Living (ADL)/ Instrumental ADL(IADL), Geriatric depression scale (GDS), Mini Mental States (MMS), comorbidities (CIRGS), G8 (oncodage), Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES13), QLQC30 item 29-30., At baseline, at uneven cycles, at end of treatment and at follow-up visits (every 6 months)|Determination of the minimal and maximal concentration of lapatinib and capecitabine, The samples time points are the followings:

T0 : before administration of treatment (lapatinib is administered 1 hour before meal and capecitabine 30 min before meal)

T1 : time for Cmax (2 hrs post-dose lapatinib and 90 min post-dose of capecitabine), at Day1 Cycle1 and Day1 Cycle3|Number of patients treated with 3 and 6 cycles and % of dose administrated, From treatment start until 6 cycles of treament
More than half of patients who have breast cancer with Her2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab as a single agent develop resistance within one year of treatment initiation.

Recent studies on this population of patients show that the use of Capecitabine combined with Lapatinib demonstrates an improvement of TTP without an increase of serious toxic effects.

Our study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination lapatinib (1250mg/day) and capecitabine (1st cycle day 1 to day 14: 850mg/m2/day x2; next cycles day 1 to day 14: 1000 mg/m2/day x2) in term of clinical benefit, and with no adverse effects and no detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment). Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurence.

This is a phase II multicentric trial associated to a pharmacokinetic study which aims to assess the effect of age modifications (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) on the combination Lapatinib-Capecitabine by measuring the Cmin-Cmax of both components in elderly patients.
