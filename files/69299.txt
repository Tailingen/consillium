Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Background:

* The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with melanoma.
* In this trial, we are determining if there is a difference in the response between patients who have received prior anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) treatment to those who have not received this prior ant-PD1 treatment.

Objectives:

- To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have metastatic melanoma.

Design:

* Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.
* Surgery: Surgery or biopsy will be performed to obtain tumor from which to grow white blood cells. White blood cells will be grown from the tumor in the laboratory.
* Leukapheresis: Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)
* Treatment: Participants will receive standard dose chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the white blood cells. Participants will receive an infusion of their own white blood cells grown from tumor. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to five days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.
* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

Number of Participants With Treatment-related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events in Arm 1N and Arm 1P, Number of participants with Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were compared in Arm 1N and Arm 1P; and adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). Grade 3 is severe. Grade 4 is life-threatening, and Grade 5 is death related to adverse event., 30 days after end of treatment|Number of Participants Who Have a Clinical Response to Treatment (Objective Tumor Regression), Clinical response to treatment was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0). Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD., 4 weeks after cell infusion, then every 3 months x 3 and then every 6 months for 5 years, then per Principal Investigator (PI) discretion up to 5 years or disease progression|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.0). Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Date of cells until time of disease progression, up to approximately 67.2 months.
Number of Treatment-related Adverse Events for Participants Who Received Pembrolizumab, Number of treatment-related adverse events for participants who received pembrolizumab. Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., Date treatment consent signed until approximately 4 weeks following last dose of Pembrolizumab, up to 4 weeks|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time to disease progression following the start of treatment, and time to death following the start of treatment. Progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Date of cells until time of disease progression up to approximately 67.2 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start date until date of death, or date last known alive., Date of cells until time to death, up until 90.1 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start date until date of death, or date last known alive., An average of 25.6 months.|Overall Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time to disease progression following the start of treatment, and time to death following the start of treatment. Progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Time to progression and time to death, approximately up to 67.2 months.
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 102 months and 9 days, 92 months and 19 days, 86 months and 9 days, 99 months and 16 days, and 86 months and 26 days for each group respectively.
Background:

* Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.
* In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or with 2 Gray (Gy) or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Of the 20 complete regressions seen in this trial, 19 are on-going at 70 to 114 months.
* The chemotherapy alone preparative regimen required in-patient treatment and was associated with significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple transfusions and treatment for febrile neutropenia.

Objectives:

* With amendment D, to determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not; both groups will receive non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen followed by autologous young tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and administration of high dose aldesleukin.
* To determine the toxicity of the treatment.

Eligibility:

* Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years
* Evaluable metastatic melanoma
* Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL
* No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration
* No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

Design:

* Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is established, patients will receive ACT with TIL plus aldesleukin following high dose chemotherapy preparative regimen.
* Up to 64 patients may be enrolled over 4-5 years.
