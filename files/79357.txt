Collection of Biospecimen & Clinical Information in Patients w/ Gastrointestinal Cancers
We have an active research program in gastrointestinal cancers including clinical trials, epidemiologic, and translational studies. We would like to establish a biospecimen bank linked to useful clinical information in order to learn more about diagnostic, predictive and prognostic markers for gastrointestinal cancers.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

1. To collect and store tumor and normal tissue (previously collected paraffin embedded or frozen specimen) and blood in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

1. Collect detailed clinical information via a patient questionnaire that includes demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, family, past medical, medication and cancer histories
2. Collect details about the tumor specimen extracted from patient charts.
