Improving Surgeon Performance Measures for Robot-Assisted Surgery
The purpose of this study is to develop new tools to understand surgeon performance to improve surgical training and participant outcomes after surgery.
Surgery
PROCEDURE: Robotic Surgery
Correlation of Automated Performance Metrics to surgeon experience, For the primary objective, we will capture Automated Performance Metrics/APMs and will determine the association between these and other metrics and surgeon experience, which will be used to construct validation.

APMs that will be used in the study:

Time Metrics

Camera Metrics

Instrument Metrics

System Metrics

Articulation Metrics, Up to 2 years
The purpose of this study is to develop new tools to understand surgeon performance to improve surgical training and participant outcomes after surgery.
