* Post prostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPI) was common complication after radical prostatectomy among prostate cancer patients.
* The prevalence of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence was reported at 87%.
* The pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) using Kegel exercise was first methods to prevent PPI after prostatectomy.
* However, there was no standardized protocol of the PFMT and it was necessary of biofeedback to PFMT.
* Therefore, we hypothesis the efficacy of personalized device of PFMT with biofeedback among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy
* In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of postoperative pelvic floor muscle training using personalized extracorporeal biofeedback device among patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence.
