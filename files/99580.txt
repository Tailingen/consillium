Use of Multiphoton Microscopy in the Diagnosis of Cancer
Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has been shown to be able to image tissue at a cellular level. Our project will initially evaluated the ability of MPM imaging to distinguish normal bladder urothelium from atypical and malignant urothelium in the ex vivo setting. After development of sufficient criteria, we plan to develop an endoscopic bladder probe that will provide a non-invasive means to image the interior of the bladder at the cellular level, which would provide direct evidence of the presence of tumor without a biopsy. After exhibiting usefulness of MPM imaging for bladder cancer, we will look at other organs beginning with the colon.

After several delays, the multiphoton microscope has been delivered to Weill Cornell Medical College. We have been using this time to set-up and fine tune the multiphoton microscope. As of current, no negative events have occurred., 10/14/2007 to 2/15/2008
