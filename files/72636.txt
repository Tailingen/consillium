Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine, Docetaxel, and Capecitabine in Combination With Stereotactic Radiosurgery
The purpose of this study is to find out if a program of intensive chemotherapy with gemcitabine, docetaxel and capecitabine followed by an advanced form of focused radiation aimed at the patient's tumor followed by more chemotherapy can increase the chances that the patient's pancreatic tumor can be removed completely.
Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: GTX (gemcitabine, docetaxel and capecitabine)|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy
Number of Participants With Resectability, The intent was to have 33 Evaluable Participants and measure the number of surgical resections with negative margins, ie. R0 resection rate. The new treatment would be of interest if the resectability rate was at least 30%. R0 resections were to be scored as those resections in which the common bile duct margin, pancreatic resection margin, retroperitoneal margin were negative for tumor involvement., 6 months per patient
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., Investigators planned to review the occurrences of AEs and SAEs according severity by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, Acute GI toxicity by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity scale., 6 months per patient|Number of Participants With Objective Response, Investigators planned to prospectively evaluate the ability of serum CA19-9 response and positron-emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography(CT) response to predict pathologic treatment response to GTX-SBRT and to determine the correlation of standardized uptake value (SUV) uptake on PET to fiducial marker placement., 6 months per patient|Number of Participants With Overall Survival, We intended to track the number of participants with overall survival at the projected end of the study period. The study was terminated prematurely., 6 months per patient
