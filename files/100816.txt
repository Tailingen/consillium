Study of Tissue Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies tissue samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
GENETIC: DNA analysis|GENETIC: DNA methylation analysis|GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: polymorphism analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: medical chart review
Identification and characterization of SNVs in primary adenocarcinoma of the lung or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, up to 5 years|Identification and characterization of structural variations in the genomes of NSCLC, up to 5 years|Identification and characterization of other genomic alterations including, but not limited to, gene expression profiling and methylation, up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify and characterize single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens.
* To identify and characterize structural variations in the genomes of NSCLC specimens.
* To identify and characterize other genomic alterations including, but not limited to, expression profiling and methylation.

OUTLINE: DNA and RNA extracted from archived specimens are analyzed for single nucleotide variations, structural variations in the genomes, and other genomic alterations including, but not limited to, gene expression profiling and methylation. Clinical data related to disease, treatment, and recurrence from each patient sample is also collected.
