A Phase 2 Study of Trabectedin (Yondelis) in Adult Male Participants With Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of trabectedin (ET-743) in adult male participants with advanced metastatic (spread of cancer cells from one part of the body to another) prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Trabectedin
Percentage of Participants Achieving Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, The PSA response will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute PSA Working Group criterion, which is, greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in PSA from Baseline after the first dose of study drug, which would be subsequently confirmed by a measurement, that is, at least 4 or more weeks after initial documentation of PSA., Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years
Duration of Prostate-Specific Antigen Response, Duration of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response will be analyzed in all participants for whom a response will be observed. The Duration of a PSA response is the time from a PSA response to PSA progression., Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years|Time to disease progression, Time to disease progression is defined as the time period, from initiation of study treatment until documentation of disease progression. If participant will discontinue the study or lost to follow-up without progression or receive further anticancer therapy after study treatment discontinuation in absence of progression, time to progression will be censored at the time of the last PSA evaluation recorded., Day 1 of each cycle until first documented disease progression up to 4 years
This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized, multi-center and Phase 2 study in adult male participants with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (consists of 14 days before study commences on Day -1); Treatment (consists of 4-week dosing cycles wherein trabectedin will be administered as intravenously at a dose of either 0.58 milligram per square meter \[mg/m\^2\] weekly 3-hour infusion, or 1.5 mg/m\^2 or 1.2 mg/m\^2 every three weeks 24-hour infusion); and Follow-up (until survival after the first dose of trabectedin). Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression or unacceptable toxicity unless, in the Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit from trabectedin. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific antigen (substance in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 72 hours of therapy on Day 1. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
