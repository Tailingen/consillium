Prayer as a Possible Adjuvant Treatment for Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to help determine the biochemical mechanisms underlying previously demonstrated health benefits of prayer, and to track humoral changes in various prayer activities.
Breast Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Prayer
A. Evaluate the effect of prayer on humoral (including biochemical/physiological inflammatory/immune) parameters approximately every three months at the subjects routine oncology visit., 2 years|B. Monitor changes in cancer- related biomarkers, and evaluate these changes in relation to the participants' prayer activities as recorded since the previous oncology visit., 2 years|C. Evaluate the effect of prayer on blood pressure, quality of life, health and dietary habits in relation to prayer activities, using validated questionnaires., 2 years
The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate certain biological mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial effects seen among cancer patients who pray. It will evaluate the effect of prayer on humoral (including biochemical/physiological inflammatory/immune) parameters, monitor changes in cancer related biomarkers and evaluate the effect of prayer on blood pressure, quality of life, health and dietary habits in relation to prayer activities, using validated questionnaires.
