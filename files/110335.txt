Treatment of Locally Advanced VULvar CArcinoma in a Neoadjuvant Setting With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Chemotherapy (VULCANize)
Vulvar cancer is a rare malignancy. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but frequently causes invalidating and chronic postoperative morbidity, especially in patients with high stage disease. Theoretically, downstaging with neoadjuvant chemotherapy could shrink the tumour, making surgical treatment less extensive thereby diminishing the chance for morbidity.
