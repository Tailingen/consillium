SG301 Safety Study in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Other Hematological Malignancies
This is a Phase 1a/1b Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of SG301 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Other Hematological Malignancies
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: SG301
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Number and percentage of AE which is calculated by worst CTCAE grade by CTCAE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of one year|MTD/MAD/ RP2D, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for intravenous (IV) administration of SG301 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies; To preliminarily determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SG301 given intravenously in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies., Through study completion, an average of one year
Pharmacokinetics (PK): AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration, Through study completion, an average of one year|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Cmax, Maximum concentration(Cmax) of the drug after administration, Through study completion, an average of one year|Pharmacokinetics (PK): limination half-life (T 1/2), Descripition: limination half-life (T 1/2) of the drug after administration, Through study completion, an average of one year|receptor occupancy (RO), receptor occupancy (RO) of CD38 on the surface of peripheral blood cells, Through study completion, an average of one year|Immunogenicity endpoints, levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (tested in ADA-positive samples only)., Through study completion, an average of one year|Efficacy endpoints, objective response rate (ORR), Through study completion, an average of one year
After a screening period of up to 28 days for each study phase, qualified patients will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose of SG301, administered weekly for the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, starting of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up, death, or end of the study, whichever occurs first.

The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies.
