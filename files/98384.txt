Selinexor in Combination With MTX+Ritu to Treat R/R CNSL
This is a single-arm and open-label study to explore X+MTX+Ritu (ATG-010, Methotrexate, Rituximab) regimen in Relapse refractory PCNSL patients. Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in the study. In dose escalation phase, patients with Relapse refractory PCNSL will be treated with X+MTX+Ritu regimen and escalating doses of oral ATG-010 weekly in a 3+3 design. Then a phase 2 expansion at the recommended dose level based on phase 1b trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability.
Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Methotrexate
Dose Escalation: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Selinexor, The MTD will be determined by study definition as the highest dose level without significant safety and tolerability concern., Assessed from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first cycle ends (maximum 21days)|Dose Escalation: Recommended Phase 2 Does (RP2D) of Selinexor, The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for the dose expansion arms, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy data collected during the dose escalation portion of the study, Assessed from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first cycle ends (maximum 21days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of Complete remission (CR) or Unconfirmed(CRu), or PR during induction therapy, Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle consists of maximum 21 days) until a CR, CRu or PR (up to 18 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)).
Duration of Response (DOR), Duration from the first observation of at least PR to time of progressive disease(PD), or deaths due to disease progression,whichever occurs first, From first dose of study drug administration to end of treatment, up to 18 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Overall Survival (OS), Occurrence of death regardless of cause, up to 12 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Duration from start of study treatment to PD or death (regardless of cause), whichever comes first, up to 12 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), From first dose of study drug administration to end of treatment (up to 18 cycles(each cycle is 21 days))
Gene mutations and frequency of 475 gene and whole exon, The types of gene mutations and frequency of tumor are measured by whole exon sequencing via NGS(next-generation sequencing)., At baseline|The concentration of interleukin-10(IL-10)，interleukin-6(IL-6)，CXCL-13 cytokine in cerebrospinal fluid(CSF), The levels of cytokines will be analyzed by flow cytometry, At the baseline, day 1 at cycle 3, 5 (21 days/cycle), and every 3 months in the maintenance stage (up to 1 year))|Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the CSF, The levels of ctDNA will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing., At the baseline, day 1 at cycle 3, 5 (21days/cycle), and every 3 months in the maintenance stage (up to 1 year))
In dose escalation phase, patients with Relapse refractory PCNSL will be treated with X+MTX+Ritu regimen （Methotrexate 3.5 g/m2, d1; Rituximab 375 mg/m2, d0）and escalating doses of oral ATG-010 weekly in a 3+3 design. ATG-010 dose level (DL) 1, 2 and 3 are 60, 80 and 100mg respectively respectively on day 1,8,15,22 for 28-days cycle.

The phase 2 expansion at the recommended dose level based on phase 1b trial. The total 6 cycles, 28 days per cycle . And, Subjects participating in the study will undergo a screening period（up to 21days）, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. The screening period is a maximum of 21 days before treatment period, And will be followed by 6 cycles of combination treatment（28 days per cycle）.

partial remission(PR) patients after induction treatment will continue ATG-010 maintenance up to 1 year or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death.
