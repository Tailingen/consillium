The ECOG-ACRIN SUPPORT Trial: Multilevel Intervention to Improve Diverse Enrollment in Cancer Clinical Trials
The purpose of this study is to conduct a Hybrid Type 1 cluster-randomized, roll-out effectiveness-implementation trial in NCORP community oncology practice sites (N= 500 Black and Latino cancer patients) to evaluate the effectiveness of the EA SUPPORT intervention combining CT navigators and CT research literacy tools in improving Black and Latino patient referral and accrual to NCI-supported CTs (primary outcomes) and participant and provider awareness and knowledge of CTs (secondary outcomes) while assessing implementation factors. Also, with the CUSP2CT data, Evaluation, and Coordinating Center, conduct final site evaluation and disseminate the SUPPORT intervention to NCORP community oncology sites, research bases, and affiliated trial networks.
