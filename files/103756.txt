Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Scan in the Evaluation of High Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma
The purpose of the study is to assess in a prospective series of patients with high tumor burden follicular lymphoma treated with R-CHOP, the predictive value of \[18F\]-FDG PET performed over (after 4 treatments), and at the end of the first-line treatment on progression-free survival at 2 years.
