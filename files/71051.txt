Safety Study of Combined Chemotherapy and Endostar to Untreated Patients With Advanced Melanoma
Multicenter, double-blinding, randomized controlled, phase II clinical trial on combined chemotherapy of Endostar (Recombinant Human Endostatin) for untreated patients with advanced melanoma, To compare the efficacy and safety of Endostar combined with Dacarbazine and monotherapy of Dacarbazine for advanced melanoma
Advanced Melanoma|Untreated Patients
DRUG: dacarbazine plus Endostar (Experimental group)|DRUG: dacarbazine plus placebo (control group)
Progression-free survival time , Total survival time, 2010.8
Tumor response rate , Disease controlled rate and adverse effects, 2009.8
Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been approved for treating metastatic melanoma in the 1970s, and as a single agent gives a response rate of about 20%. There have been efforts to ameliorate this poor result by using DTIC in different combinations without a significant improvement. In addition, new studies with melanoma cells in vitro show that DTIC combination with Endostar, suggesting a potential clinical benefit from the concomitant treatment of DTIC and antiangiogenesis therapy. Endostar is a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human genome. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination therapy of endostar and DTIC is safe and can increase response rate and progression-free survival in patients (pts) with metastatic melanoma. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Endostar plus DTIC and hope provide a new hope for the advanced melanoma patients.
