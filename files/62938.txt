Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography in Planning Treatment for Patients Undergoing 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery. ICORG 06-35
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography and computed tomography, may help learn the extent of disease and allow doctors to plan 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of positron emission tomography and computed tomography and to see how well it works in planning treatment for patients undergoing 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

This is a clinical study, as the patient will be treated using the PET-CT-GTV: - The pilot study is investigating the technological feasibility - The Phase II study will be a 2-stage Phase II study
