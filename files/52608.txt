New Treatments for Actinic Keratoses of the Scalp
This blinded controlled 2-year study on 120 patients with 2 or more actinic keratoses, compare the efficacy and tolerability of pulsed dye-laser- mediated photodynamic therapy compared to conventional photodynamic therapy and fractional-laser assisted daylight photodynamic therapy compared to daylight photodynamic therapy.

Actinic keratoses are premalign skin lesions with increasing prevalence, causing a rising burden on the health care system. In this blinded controlled study we assess the efficacy of pulsed dye-laser- mediated photodynamic therapy compared to conventional photodynamic therapy and fractional-laser assisted daylight photodynamic therapy to daylight photodynamic therapy. It is a prospective, randomized and blinded split-head comparative study during the years 2016- 2024. 120 patients are recruited based on referral or from patients attending the clinic, with 2 or more actinic keratoses on the head, 60 to the pulsed dye-laser study and 60 to the fractional laser study. Follow-up appointments are 6 months, 1 year and 2 years post treatment. Patient reported maximal pain during treatment is documented.
