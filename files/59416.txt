A Study of LY3214996 Administered Alone or in Combination With Other Agents in Participants With Advanced/Metastatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of an extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor LY3214996 administered alone or in combination with other agents in participants with advanced cancer.
