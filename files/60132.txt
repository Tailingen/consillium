To Assess Immunogenicity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine in Cancer Patients Receiving Cancer Treatment
This is a trial of prospective collection of serial blood samples after administration of COVID-19 vaccine in patients with cancer who are receiving active cancer treatment, planned to start therapy with 14 days of consent, or have had stem cell transplant. Cancer treatments and administration of vaccine are not controlled by the study.
