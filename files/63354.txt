A Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of Oral HP518 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The overall objective of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety, PK, and anti-tumor activity of 12 weeks of daily oral dosing with HP518 after selecting the RP2D of HP518 based on assessments of multiple dose escalation in patients with progressive mCRPC.

This First in Human dose escalation and expansion study of HP518 in patients with mCRPC is being conducted not only to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered HP518, but also to provide necessary information for efficacy analysis in future studies.
