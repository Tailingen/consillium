Ablation of Renal Masses Outcomes Registry (ARMOR): Ablation Procedure and Quality of Life Assessment
The purpose of this study is to better understand how effective ablation is for destroying tumor cells in the kidney and whether quality of life is improved for patients. Participation in ARMOR may involve retrospective data collection only, combined retrospective and prospective data collection, or prospective data collection

assess renal ablation outcomes, To assess renal ablation outcomes using standard quality of life measures. Specifically, quality of life outcomes measures will be analyzed with respect to ablation procedure characteristics including ablation technique and anesthesia type as well as renal mass characteristics such as size, location and pathologic tumor type., 5 years
differences in imaging characteristics, between CT and MR related to renal ablation. We hypothesize that, after ablation, the observed relative change in contrast enhancement at the site of ablation for each follow-up time point will be similar for tumors imaged by CT compared with those imaged by MR. This objective will be met by observational and descriptive methods., 5 years|Assess the progression of imaging findings, in terms of size and contrast enhancement at the site of renal ablation, correlated with ablation technology and tumor histopathology. The objective is to determine whether the choice of imaging method, ablation technique, or histopathologic tumor subtype will be associated with similar relative change in contrast enhancement and size after ablation., 5 years|Radiation exposure, associated with CT imaging performed during an ablation procedure and subsequent imaging follow-up to 2 years. Radiation dose will be analyzed using multivariable linear regression, with ablation technique as the primary predictor., 5 years
