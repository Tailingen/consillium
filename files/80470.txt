A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Azacitidine Plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) Versus Placebo Plus BSC in Participants With International Prognostic Scoring System Revised (IPSS-R) Low- or Intermediate-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral azacitidine in participants with low to intermediate International Prognostic Scoring System Revised (IPSS-R) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
