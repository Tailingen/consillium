Comparison of Surgical Outcomes of Craniotomy and Craniectomy in Posterior Fossa Lesions
The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the surgical outcomes of craniotomy and craniectomy among patients with posterior fossa lesions. The study aims to determine differences in post-operative complications, hospital stay duration, and patient recovery between the two surgical techniques.
Posterior Fossa Lesion
PROCEDURE: Craniotomy|PROCEDURE: Craniectomy
Incidence of CSF leakage, Definition: CSF leakage is defined as the presence of clear fluid discharge from the surgical site, confirmed via clinical examination and biochemical analysis of Î²-2 transferrin.

Measurement: Evaluated by clinical assessment at routine follow-ups and imaging studies when indicated., Up to 6 months post-surgery|Occurrence of pseudomeningocele, Definition: Pseudomeningocele is defined as an abnormal collection of cerebrospinal fluid in the surgical site, detected through physical examination and confirmed by imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scan.

Measurement: Follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery., Up to 6 months post-surgery|Severity of post-operative headache, Definition: Post-operative headache will be assessed using the Catalano grading system, categorizing severity from 0 (no headache) to 4 (severe, refractory to medication).

Measurement: Self-reported patient evaluations at each follow-up visit., Immediately post-surgery, at 3 months, and at 6 months post-surgery|Length of hospital stay, Definition: The total number of days a patient remains hospitalized post-surgery, including any extended stay due to complications.

Measurement: Recorded from hospital admission to discharge., From immediate post-surgery until hospital discharge, assessed up to 4 weeks
Patients diagnosed with posterior fossa lesions will be randomly assigned into two groups. Group A will undergo craniotomy, where the bone flap is replaced after dural closure, while Group B will undergo craniectomy, where the bone is permanently removed. Outcomes will be assessed based on post-operative complications such as CSF leakage, pseudomeningocele formation, post-operative headache, and length of hospital stay. The study aims to provide evidence to determine the superior surgical approach in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare cost reduction.
