Prospective Genomics Initiative on Multiple Synchronous Lung Cancer (PGI-MSLC)
This prospective study is to characterize the genomic landscape and genetic heterogeneity of multiple synchronous lung cancer (MSLC) in correlation with comprehensive clinical, histopathological and medical imaging information, in order to improve disease diagnosis and tailored treatment for MSLC patients.
Multiple Synchronous Lung Cancers (MSLCs)
Genomic characters of synchronous lessions in each MSLC patient, Whole-genome sequencing reveals the mutation, copy number variation and structure variation of MSLCs. We will analysis the genomic characters of synchronous lesions in each MSLC patient., November 30, 2021
* To initiate a prospective registry of MSLC patients with high-quality clinical samples and detailed medical data.
* To define the clonal relationship, genomic landscape and potential driver alterations of MSLC using whole-genome sequencing.
* To determine the intrapatient and intratumor genetic heterogeneity of MSLC.
* To correlate molecular features with clinical parameters and patient outcome.
* To serve as a continuous infrastructure for a large variety of research purposes including: A. Diagnostic research B. Prognostic research C. Biological research D. Interventional trial design testing new therapies in MSLC.
