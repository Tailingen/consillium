At Day1 and Day15 of Cycle2 to 6 (each cycle is 28 days): Predose and 5 minutes after the end of infusion. At Day 30 and Day60 after the last dose of LIS1.|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of LIS: Vd, Volume of distribution (Vd) is defined as the total amount of LIS1 in the body divided by its concentration in plasma, At Cycle1Day 1 Predose and 5 minutes; 1; 2; 4; 8; 24 hours after the end of infusion. At Day1 and Day15 of Cycle2 to 6 (each cycle is 28 days): Predose and 5 minutes after the end of infusion. At Day 30 and Day60 after the last dose of LIS1.|Host immunogenicity to LIS1, Number of participants who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies, Before and after (up to 5 min after the infusion) LIS1 infusion at Cycle1Day 1, Cycle1Day8, Cycle1Day15, and Cycle1Day22, then before infusion at Day1 and Day15 of Cycle2 to Cycle6 (each cycle is 28 days), and at Day30 and Day60 after last dose of LIS1|Expansion part: treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), The severity of averse events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v5.0.
