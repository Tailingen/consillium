Incidence of seromas requiring an aspiration, Subjects will undergo an echography at the operated axilla at every scheduled visit till Day 28 or until seroma resolution, whichever occurs first. In case of seroma presence the investigator will decide if an aspiration is required; the decision will be based on the clinical investigator's evaluation.

In case of aspiration, the subject with seroma will be considered amenable for the statistical analysis of seroma incidence., Day 28 post surgery
The study will randomize between 24 and 72 subjects that received an ALND. A staged adaptive design is employed with two intermediate analyses and a final analysis. The first interim analysis at 24 treated subjects (at least 12 in each group) and the second at 48 treated subjects (at least 24 in each group).
