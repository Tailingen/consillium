Polycystic Ovary Syndrome - Improving Outcomes
Polycystic ovary syndrome affects a striking 9-18% of Australian reproductive aged women and has been associated with a number of metabolic abnormalities.

Given the strong correlation between metabolic abnormalities and increased sympathetic activity, we hypothesise that reducing this activity using medication (moxonidine) can help improve the metabolic abnormalities, and therefore improve outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Moxonidine|DRUG: Placebo
Microneurography, Microneurography is a technique developed to measure the sympathetic activitiy directly from the peroneal nerve. Microneurography will be performed at baseline visit and at 3 months follow up visit., 3 months
Blood biochemistry measurement, To assess the metabolic function of the participants we will be drawing fasting blood samples for biochemical analysis. These test will be performed at baseline and 3 months follow up visit, 3 months|Oral glucose tolerance test, A standard 75g glucose tolerance test will be performed. Venous blood will be taken before and 2 hours after the glucose drink was given., 3 months
