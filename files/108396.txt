Study of Tazemetostat as Single Agent in Solid Tumors or B-cell Lymphomas and in Combination With Prednisolone in DLBCL
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study of tazemetostat as a single agent in subjects with advanced solid tumors or with B-cell lymphomas and tazemetostat in combination with prednisolone in subjects with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
B-cell Lymphomas (Phase 1)|Advanced Solid Tumors (Phase 1)|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (Phase 2)|Follicular Lymphoma (Phase 2)|Transformed Follicular Lymphoma|Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Tazemetostat|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Tazemetostat
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Tazemetostat as a Single-Agent and in Combination With Prednisolone (Phase 1 Only), Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tazemetostat as administered orally twice daily (BID), continuously in 28-day cycles in subjects with advanced solid tumors or with relapsed and/or refractory B cell lymphomas as determined by incidence, seriousness, toxicity grade, and relatedness of treatment emergent dose limiting toxicities, The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Objective Response Rate (ORR; Complete Response + Partial Response [CR + PR]) (Phase 2), Number of patients achieving an objective response (CR or PR)/number of patients treated x 100%. ORR was calculated as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the total number of patients in the analysis population per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1. Complete Response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 millimeter (mm) in the short axis. Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters., Radiologic tumor assessments performed at baseline(within 28 days before start of study treatment)and every 8 weeks during Cycles 2 to 6,and then every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression (PD)/death,a maximum of approximately 82 months
Duration of Response for Tazemetostat as a Single Agent or in Combination With Prednisolone (Phase 2 Only), The time (in months) from the date of the initial response (CR or PR, whichever was first) until the date of the first documented disease progression per an Independent Review Committee (for Groups 1 and 2), per Investigator (Group 3), or death due to any cause. Patients who were alive and progression free at the time of the analysis were censored at the last date where the patient was known to be in response. Note: the DOR was censored, meaning data collection was stopped early for analysis, making the top limit of the 95% confidence interval not estimable (NE). Per RECIST v.1.0, CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters., Radiologic tumor assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment) and every 8 weeks during Cycles 2 to 6, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD/death, a maximum of approximately 82 months|Progression Free Survival for Tazemetostat as a Single Agent or in Combination With Prednisolone (Phase 2 Only), The time (in months) from the date of first dose of tazemetostat until the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause. Per RECIST v1.0, CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters., Radiologic tumor assessments performed at baseline (within 28 days before start of study treatment) and every 8 weeks during Cycles 2 to 6, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed PD/death, a maximum of approximately 82 months
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study conducted in two parts: The Phase 1 part comprised dose escalation and expansion to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) when tazemetostat was given twice daily (BID) orally on a continuous basis. Additionally, in separate cohorts in Phase 1, the effect of food on the bioavailability of tazemetostat as well as the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of tazemetostat were evaluated. The Phase 2 part was initiated once the RP2D was established. Phase 2 enrolled subjects with relapsed/ refectory (R/R) DLBCL (Cohorts 1-3 and 6) and subjects with R/R FL (Cohorts 4 and 5) for the determination of efficacy and safety of tazemetostat monotherapy (Cohorts 1-5) and of tazemetostat in combination with prednisolone (Cohort 6) with placement determined by centrally confirmed histology, cell of origin (COO), and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) mutation status.
