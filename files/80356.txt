Hydroxychloroquine + Vorinostat in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open label non randomized study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Vorinostat in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of this drug combination.
