BV-AVD-R Treatment Children Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to use modified Brentuximab Vedotin+doxorubicin+vinblastine+dacarbazine+Rituximab(BV-AVD-R) regimen in Chinese Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma(HL) children. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* \[Overall Response Rate(ORR) :Complete Response(CR)+Partial Response(PR)\]
* \[progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 months and 1 year.\] Participants will be given modified BV-AVD-R regimen according to rapid early responders (RER) or slow early responders (SER) after 2 cycles.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Dacarbazine
Overall Response Rate(ORR), disease evaluations will be performed by PET-CT at the end of randomized regimen, Baseline up to end of randomized regimen (approximately 1 year)
Progression-free survival(PFS), disease evaluations will be performed at at 6 months and 1 year after the end of treatment, 6 month and 1 year after the end of treatment
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Baseline up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 1 year)
This study is a prospective study with period from October 2022 to December 2024, and planned to enroll 44 children with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk classical HL. All patients will undergo Positron Emission Tomography(PET)/Computed Tomography(CT) at the time of initial diagnosis and after 2 cycles of modified BV+R+AVD regimen to determine early response. Rapid early responders (RER) deÔ¨Åned as CR after 2 cycles of therapy. Slow early responders (SER) defined as no CR (partial response (PR) or stable disease) after 2 cycles of therapy. Intermediate-risk patients were stage IA bulk/E, IB, IIA bulk/E, IIB, and IIIA. High-risk patients were stage IIB bulk/E, IIIA bulk/E, IIIB, and IVA/B.

The primary endpoints include ORR (CR+PR) and adverse events. The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 months and 1 year.
