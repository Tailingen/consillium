Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use immune-related response criteria (irRC) confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 36.1 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was determined for all participants and was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants were censored at the date of their last follow-up. The OS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 36.1 months
Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be evaluated during the safety run-in period. Any treatment emergent Grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) that occurs in the first 42 days after initiation of study treatment, that is deemed possibly, probably or definitely related to the combination of CMB305 and atezolizumab will be considered a DLT with the following exceptions:

* Alopecia or vomiting (unless not controlled by optimal anti-emetics)
* Hepatic enzyme elevations associated with the baseline Grade 2 abnormalities
* Grade 3 laboratory AEs that are asymptomatic and return to baseline or to Grade 1 within 3 days, unless identified specifically as DLT by the investigator or the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
* Grade 3 fatigue

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented., Up to approximately 36.1 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Month 3 Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use irRC confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by BICR. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. Participants were evaluated every 6 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess their response to treatment. The PFS rate was calculated as the percentage of participants with PFS at Month 3., Month 3|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Month 6 Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use irRC confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by BICR. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. Participants were evaluated every 6 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess their response to treatment. The PFS rate was calculated as the percentage of participants with PFS at Month 6., Month 6|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT was the time from date of randomization to the start date of subsequent treatment.
