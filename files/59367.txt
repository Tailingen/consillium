Change in health-related quality of life assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast plus Arm Morbidity (FACT-B+4) questionnaire, Score achieved in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast plus Arm Morbidity (FACT-B+4) questionnaire, a specific validated scale to assess quality of life of women with breast cancer. It comprises 27 items within 5 areas of assessment: physical well-being (7 items), social and family environment (7 items), emotional well-being (7 items), functional well-being (6 items) and worries related to the diagnosis and treatment of the disease (9 items). Each item is scored by means of a Likert scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores representing better results. The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each item, and ranges from a minimum of 0 (worst posible result) to a maximum of 146 (best possible result)., Baseline and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in tolerance to chemotherapy: number of participants with significant cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular adverse effects throughout the study, Significant cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular adverse effects during treatment, threatening life, requiring admission, prolonging hospitalization, being clinically relevant or causing chemotherapy interruptions, Every 3 months during study completion and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in global functional capacity assessed by conventional ergometry, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) or the 6-minute walking test (6MWT)., Change in functional capacity assessed by conventional ergometry, cardiopulmonary exercise test or the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) (metabolic equivalents: METs or peak oxygen consumption: VO2) \* .

\*Due to COVID-19 pandemic, participants' assessment with CPET had to be stopped for safety concerns. In such cases, functional capacity was estimated from the maximum work rate in the 6-minute walking test (6MWT). This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, which is well correlated with VO2. The 6MWT has been proved to be valid and reliable for functional capacity assessment in the study population., Baseline and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in localized lower limb functional capacity assessed by number of repetitions performed within 30 seconds in the sit-to-stand test, Number of repetitions in the sit-to-stand test within 30 seconds, Baseline and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in shoulder functional capacity assessed by range of degrees in shoulder movement by goniometry, Range of degrees in shoulder movement measured by goniometry, Baseline and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in upper limb strength measured by dynamometry (kg), Kilograms by dynamometry of right and left upper limbs, Baseline and at the end of the study at an average of 18 months|Change in shoulder pain and disability assessed by the SPADI (shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) questionnaire, Score achieved in the SPADI (shoulder pain and disability index) questionnaire.

Activities are classified into three subgroups: "strenuous," "moderate," and "light." The scores corresponding to the energy expenditure (metabolic equivalent (MET)) are obtained by multiplying activities performed for more than 15 min in a week with their coefficients. The numbers represent the MET intensity values (strenuous/ exhausting exercises: 9 METs, moderate exercises: 5 METs, and light exercises: 3 METs).The increasing scores are associated with the increasing number of exercise behaviors, providing references about the contribution of physical activity to health: the activity score of 24 units and more as active (substantial benefits); the activity score of 14-23 units as moderately active (some benefits); and the activity score of 13 units and less as inactive (less substantial or low benefits)., Baseline and at study completion at an average of 18 months|Change in lymphedema assessed by perimeter of the upper limb by cirtometry (cm), stage and grade, Perimeter of the upper limb by cirtometry (cm), stage and grade as defined by the Spanish Society of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Baseline after surgery and 2-4 weeks after the end of chemotherapy (at an average of 12 to 15 months)

Cardiovascular toxicity caused by chemotherapy is the leading cause of death in patients who survive cancer. Physical exercise during chemotherapy has shown to improve quality of life and decrease the risk of death. The objective of this project is to determine whether an intervention through a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program including supervised physical exercise is able to prevent anthracyclines and / or anti-HER-2 antibodies-induced cardiotoxicity in women with breast cancer.

For this purpose, the investigators intend to conduct a randomized controlled study including female patients managed under the same cardiotoxicity prevention protocol (clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic follow-up assessment). Patients will be randomized to a non-pharmacological intervention (participation in a multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program with supervised exercise training) or control (conventional management and physical activity recommendation)\*.

The investigators hypothesize that a cardiac rehabilitation program may limit chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in women with breast cancer, improve cardiac remodeling assessed by echocardiography and enhance their global cardiovascular risk profile to a greater extent, compared to control group.

\* OF NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 pandemics, several modifications to the original protocol were introduced for safety reasons or motivated by the health situation, namely:

1. Intervention: Change from centre-based to telematic supervised exercise training sessions provided within the cardiac rehabilitation program (intervention group)
2. Secondary outcome 4: Change in functional capacity assessed by conventional ergometry or cardiopulmonary exercise test OR the 6-minute walking test (metabolic equivalents: METs or peak oxygen consumption: VO2)
3. Recruiting centres: One centre (Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron) withdrew from the study due to the impossibility of assuming its execution.
