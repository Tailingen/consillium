Lactation Outcomes Among Survivors of Pediatric Cancer
While the majority of women in the general population can breastfeed successfully, the investigators have limited knowledge about the correlates and sequelae of lactation success among women treated for pediatric malignancies. Childhood cancer treatments are known to cause late effects that frequently involve the endocrine system. Because normal lactation is dependent upon interplay of multiple endocrine factors, the investigators anticipate more breastfeeding difficulties in survivors that have diabetes, growth hormone deficiencies, thyroid disorders and obesity. In order to more fully inform clinicians and female survivors, the study of the burden of lactation failure is needed to begin to address the impact of pediatric cancer therapy on lactation success/failure and to examine the association of specific endocrine disorders on lactation outcomes.

Number of survivors who experience successful breastfeeding outcome compared to healthy women, Breastfeeding outcomes (intention, initiation, and duration/weaning) will be determined by self-report, and dichotomized for analysis. Intention is defined as a mother's specific plan to breastfeed her infant prior to birth (yes/no); initiation is defined as ever having started breastfeeding (yes/no); duration is defined as at least 6 months of breastfeeding (yes/no); and weaning is defined as breastfeeding cessation after 1 year (yes/no).

Data from survivors will be compared with a national sample of healthy women (n=2,000) who responded to the Project First survey (2009). The Infant Feeding Practices Survey II (Project First) is a longitudinal study developed by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Once, at enrollment (Day 1)
Participants will complete a cross-sectional survey. Responses will be compared with a national sample of healthy women from Project First (Infant Feeding Practices Survey II).

Primary Objective:

* To describe breastfeeding outcomes (intention, initiation, duration, and weaning) among female SJLIFE protocol participants 18 years of age and older who reported a live birth.

Secondary Objective:

* To compare breastfeeding outcomes between childhood cancer survivors and healthy mothers.
