Aprepitant Plus Granisetron and Dexamethasone for the Prevention of Vomiting in Patients With HAIC Therapy for HCC
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aprepitant combined with granisetron and dexamethasone versus granisetron and dexamethasone in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Aprepitant in combination with granisetron and dexamethasone|DRUG: Granisetron and dexamethasone
Complete response rate, Complete response rate during the first cycle defined as no emetic episodes, no rescue medication use during the first cycle of HAIC therapy., 3 weeks
FOLFOX regimen include oxaliplatin and 5-Fu. Oxaliplatin has a moderate emetic potential and 5-Fu has a low emetic potential according to European guideline for the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The Guideline recommend that patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy receive a three-drug regimen of 5-HT3, dexamethasone, and NK1-RA (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant or rolapitant). However, HAIC treatment is not through peripheral or central venous infusion of chemotherapy drugs as in other cancers, but through hepatic artery infusion of chemotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy drugs are mainly concentrated in the liver and belong to local chemotherapy, rather than systemic chemotherapy through the venous system. Therefore, although the HAIC regimen includes oxaliplatin and 5-Fu, two chemotherapeutic drugs that may cause vomiting, the literature on whether three-drug regimen is also needed to prevent vomiting has been less publicly reported. In order to further determine whether three-drug regimen is necessary, this project intends to conduct a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aprepitant combined with granisetron and dexamethasone versus granisetron and dexamethasone in preventing nausea and vomiting in HCC patients receiving HAIC treatment. The results of this project will provide a reference for improving the quality of life of HCC patients during HAIC treatment, the compliance of follow-up treatment and saving medical resources.
