KL-A167 Injection in Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The study is to evaluate the efficacy of KL-A167 injection in subjects with recurrent/metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, as measured by Overall Response Rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST Version 1.1
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Recurrent or Metastatic
DRUG: KL-A167 Injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR) assess by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose
ORR assess by investigators, Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (irRECIST 1.1), from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS as measured in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive, from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose|Duration of Response (DOR), Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose|Time to Response(TTR), From the date of the first dose of KL-A167 to the time the response criteria are first met, from first patient first visit to 12 month after last patient first dose
KL167-Ⅱ-05-CTP (NCT03848286) is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study of KL-A167 in pts with R/M NPC. Eligible pts were diagnosed with histopathologically confirmed R/M nonkeratinizing NPC and had received ≥ two lines of chemotherapy. Pts received 900 mg KL-A167 every 2 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) evaluated by the independent review committee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1.
