European Low and Intermediate Risk Neuroblastoma Protocol
The European study, LINES 2009 (Low and Intermediate Risk Neuroblastoma European Study), groups together in a single protocol the treatment of all patients with "non high risk" neuroblastoma (NB), with stratification into two groups: low risk and intermediate risk. These two separate cohorts are included in one single protocol to enable patient data from these two groups to be entered into a common database, as the current prognostic classifications determining treatment may evolve further with subsequent more detailed molecular analysis of the tumours.

1. LOW RISK STUDY

The Low Risk Study is proposed in order to:

* minimise the amount of treatment (chemotherapy and surgery) for all appropriate low risk patients, who in previous studies have been shown to have an excellent long-term outcome (as in the SIOPEN 99.1-2 infant neuroblastoma studies where the overall survival was greater than 97%(H. Rubie, JCO).
* improve the EFS and maintain the OS (overall survival) in L2 and Ms patients with a SCA(Segmental Cromosomal Aberration) genomic profile tumour (presence of any segmental chromosomal change (SCA)) by electively treating these patients with chemotherapy despite the absence of symptoms.

  2) INTERMEDIATE RISK STUDY

The Intermediate Risk Study is proposed in order to:

* reduce the amount of chemotherapy for differentiating histology INRG (International Neuroblastoma Risk Group) stage L2 NB and ganglioneuroblastoma nodular patients who in previous SIOPEN study have been shown to have an excellent long-term outcome;
* increase the amount of treatment (radiotherapy and 13-cis-RA (13-cis-Retinoic Acid) for poorly differentiated or undifferentiated histology INRG stage L2 NB or ganglioneuroblastoma nodular patients in order to improve the EFS registered in the previous SIOPEN study;
* improve the EFS (Event Free Survival) of MYCN (V-Myc myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, NB derived ,avian )amplified INSS (International NB Staging System) stage 1 NB patients with the introduction of adjuvant treatment;
* maintain the very good results obtained in previous SIOPEN study for INRG stage M infants with a moderate treatment.

NEONATAL SUPRARENAL MASSES

The incidence of suprarenal tumours/masses has increased in the last decade due to the expanded use of prenatal ultrasonography in routine obstetric care and in the neonatal and early infancy care. The differential diagnosis of these masses ranges from benign (adrenal haemorrhage) to malignant processes (neuroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma). Knowledge on perinatal suprarenal masses, although based on a relatively large literature, is scattered amongst studies on very few cases with no methodical approach and often short follow up. Therefore, the optimal management of these masses has not been clearly defined. Neuroblastoma at this age is an intriguing entity with a very good prognosis in most cases. The SIOPEN Group, based on their results in the first multicenter European Trial for infants with neuroblastoma (INES) and the world-wide experience provided in the literature, is launching this European surveillance study (Multi-centre, non-blinded, one armed prospective trial) for these masses.

1. LOW RISK STUDY

The low risk group of patients includes NB patients without MYCN amplification with or without life threatening symptoms in the following clinical situations:

* Children aged ≤ 18 months with localised neuroblastoma associated with image defined risk factors precluding upfront surgery (stage INRG L2).
* Children aged ≤ 12 months with disseminated neuroblastoma without bone, pleura, lung or CNS (Central Nervous System) disease (stage INRG Ms)

  2) INTERMEDIATE RISK STUDY

The intermediate risk group of patients includes NB patients in the following clinical situations:

* Children aged \>18 months with localised neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification, associated with image defined risk factors precluding upfront surgery (stage INRG L2).
* Children aged ≤12 months with disseminated neuroblastoma involving bone, pleura, lung and/or CNS (stage INRG M), without MYCN amplification.
* Children with localised resected NB (stage INSS I) with MYCN amplification. NEONATAL SUPRARENAL MASSES
