Phase II Study of AK104 (Cadonilimab) for Recurrent Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinomas of the Cervix
This is a Phase 2, single center, open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of AK104 monotherapy in adult subjects with previously treated recurrent or metastatic high grade neuroendocrine cervical cancer.
Carcinomas|Cervix Cancer|Cervical Cancer
DRUG: AK104
To establish the progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in response to AK104 monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix, (up to 6 months) through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

-To estimate progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in response to AK104 monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.

Secondary Objective:

* To evaluate the efficacy of AK104 monotherapy in terms of DoR and DCR in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.
* To evaluate the efficacy of AK104 monotherapy in terms of ORR in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of AK104 monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix.
* To determine presence of HPV cell free DNA and if levels of HPV cell free DNA may serve as a surrogate for response to AK104 monotherapy in patients with progressive/relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix
