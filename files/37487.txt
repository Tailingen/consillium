Study of Rituximab and Bendamustine With or Without Brentuximab Vedotin for CD30 Positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin in combination with rituximab and bendamustine for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after failure of second-line salvage therapy or as second-line treatment in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Refractory|Follicular B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab Vedotin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve a Complete Response (CR) (including Complete Metabolic Response (CMR)) or Partial Response (PR) (including Partial Metabolic Response (PMR)) as best response to combination therapy on study, Approximately 1 year
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression/relapse, receipt of subsequent lymphoma chemotherapy other than the components of the study treatment regimen, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 11.8 months|Complete Remission (CR) Rate, CRR is the proportion of patients who achieve CR (including Complete Metabolic Response (CMR)) as best response to combination therapy on study., Approximately 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first observation of response to disease progression/relapse, receipt of subsequent lymphoma chemotherapy other than the components of the study treatment regimen, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 10.5 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time randomization to death from any cause, Up to 1.5 years|Number and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), All AEs are included in the summaries, unless treatment-emergent is specified., Approximately 1 year
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive rituximab plus bendamustine with or without brentuximab vedotin. Patients who respond to combination treatment containing brentuximab vedotin and do not experience excessive toxicity may receive additional single-agent brentuximab vedotin following combination treatment, for up to an additional 10 cycles (up to 16 total cycles of treatment).
