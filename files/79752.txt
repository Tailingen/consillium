PFS will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization up to approximately 48 months|Overall Survival (OS) in the ITT Population by Radiotherapy Timing (Concurrent vs. Sequential), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause or last follow-up., Randomization up to approximately 48 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in the ITT Population by Radiotherapy Timing (Concurrent vs. Sequential), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who attain complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization up to approximately 48 months|Percentage of Participants With All Adverse Events Related to Atezolizumab and Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab Treatment in the ITT Population, Baseline up to approximately 48 months|Percentage of Participants With Serious and Non-Serious Immune Mediated Adverse Events Related to Atezolizumab and Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab Treatment in the ITT Population, Baseline up to approximately 48 months|Percentage of Participants With All Adverse Events Related to Treatment in the ITT Population, Baseline up to approximately 48 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Patient-Rported Lung Cancer Symptoms, TTD is defined as the time from randomization to a patient's first ≥10-point score change from baseline in a scale maintained for at least two consecutive PRO assessments, or followed by death within 3 weeks of the first ≥10-point score change., Randomization up to approximately 48 months|EORTC QLQ-C30 Score, EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 Questionnaire, is a validated, reliable self-report measure. It consists of 30 questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. Scale scores can be obtained for the multi-item scales., Day 1 of first 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) then with tumor assessments & 3 months after radiographic disease progression or for patients who continue atezolizumab after radiographic disease progression loss of clinical benefit up to approx 48 months|EORTC QLQ-LC13 Score, The EORTC, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, QLQ-LC13 is a modular supplement to the EORTC quality-of-life questionnaire for use in lung cancer. This module incorporates one multiple-item scale to assess dyspnea and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis., Day 1 of first 3 cycles (cycle length=21 days), then with tumor assessments & 3 months after radiographic disease progression or for patients who continue atezolizumab after radiographic disease progression loss of clinical benefit up to approx 48 months|EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Index Based and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scores, The EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire, 5-level version (EQ-5D-5L), is a validated self-report health status questionnaire that is used to calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation of a single composite score of the patient's health status., Day 1 of first 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) then with tumor assessments & 3 months after radiographic disease progression or for patients who continue atezolizumab after radiographic disease progression loss of clinical benefit up to approx 48 months
Participants can receive concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as per local standard of care, but they must be randomized within 6 weeks from completion of chemoradiotherapy. Participants should receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy dose of 56-64 Gy (once daily) before randomization, and those participants who have not progressed during/after CRT will be stratified by response to CRT, radiotherapy timing, and be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Atezolizumab+Tiragolumab arm or Atezolizumab+placebo arm.
