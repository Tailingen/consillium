Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Neuroblastoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study studies biomarkers in samples from young patients with neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction|GENETIC: protein expression analysis|GENETIC: western blotting|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
ROR1 is expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells and constitutes a suitable target for mAb therapy
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To analyze the expression of ROR1 on the surface of primary neuroblastoma cells.
* To investigate the therapeutic potential of anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies, and immunotoxins in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroblastoma.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ROR1 expression by flow cytometry, western blotting, qPCR, and IHC.
