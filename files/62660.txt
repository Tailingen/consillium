TQB2223 Injection in Combination With Penpulimab in Patients With Advanced Cancers
TQB2223 is a recombinant, fully humanized antibody that binds lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) and blocks the LAG-3/ major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) interaction, thus allowing for increased T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and effectiveness of TQB2223 injection in combination with Penpulimab in subjects with advanced cancers.
