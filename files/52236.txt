MSEPT9 Biomarker for Predicting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Occurrence in Patients with Cirrhosis
This study aims to evaluate the role of the circulating epigenetic biomarker mSEPT9 in predicting the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. HCC is a primary liver cancer that frequently develops in individuals with cirrhosis, and early detection is critical for improving outcomes. This research involves 400 patients with cirrhosis who will be followed every six months for up to 60 months. During these visits, blood samples will be collected to analyze mSEPT9 levels. By identifying changes in this biomarker, the study seeks to improve early diagnosis and personalize surveillance strategies, potentially enhancing patient survival and quality of life.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Circulating mSEPT9 Biomarker Testing
Association Between mSEPT9 Test Switch and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Development, Evaluate the relationship between a 'switch' in the mSEPT9 test result-defined as a transition from triple-negative (no methylation detected across all triplicates) to at least one positive triplicate-and the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as diagnosed using international criteria established by the AASLD., Annually for up to 60 months or until the occurrence of HCC, whichever occurs first.
Association Between mSEPT9 Test Switch and HCC Development by Cirrhosis Etiology, Assess the association between a 'switch' in mSEPT9 test results and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as diagnosed using international criteria (AASLD), across subgroups categorized by cirrhosis etiology, including alcohol use, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A 'switch' in the mSEPT9 test result is defined as a transition from triple-negative (no methylation detected across all triplicates) to at least one positive triplicate., Annually for up to 60 months or until the occurrence of HCC, whichever occurs first.|Association Between mSEPT9 Test Results and HCC-Related Mortality, HCC-specific mortality, defined as death attributable to hepatocellular carcinoma based on international classification of diseases (ICD) coding and/or clinical determination, stratified by positive or negative mSEPT9 test results (performed in triplicate)., Annually for up to 60 months or until HCC-specific death occurs.|Establishment of a Biobank for Genomic and Epigenomic Analysis, Number of Plasma and DNA Samples Collected and Stored for Genomic and Epigenomic Analysis, Including Data on Sample Quality, Quantity., For each participant, samples will be collected at enrollment (baseline) and during follow-up visits every 6 months for up to 60 months.
This study is a prospective, multicenter cohort trial designed to assess the prognostic utility of the circulating epigenetic biomarker mSEPT9 in predicting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with cirrhosis. The trial involves 400 participants who are confirmed to have cirrhosis and no evidence of HCC at baseline.

The study's primary focus is to evaluate the association between a "switch" in the mSEPT9 test-from a triple-negative status (no methylation detected across triplicate assays) to at least one positive triplicate-and the subsequent occurrence of HCC. Secondary objectives include assessing this association across different etiologies of cirrhosis (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and its correlation with HCC-related mortality.

Participants will undergo standardized clinical, biological, and imaging assessments every six months over a follow-up period of 60 months, as per international guidelines for cirrhosis management. In addition to routine care, blood samples will be collected at each visit for mSEPT9 testing. These samples will be processed, stored at -80Â°C, and analyzed in batches to assess mSEPT9 levels.

The findings from this study are expected to address the unmet need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers for HCC risk prediction, potentially leading to personalized surveillance strategies and earlier intervention for patients with cirrhosis. Data will be managed using an electronic case report form (eCRF) to ensure secure, standardized documentation across all participating centers. Results from mSEPT9 testing will not influence clinical management during the study period but will be analyzed to determine their predictive value for HCC development and prognosis.
