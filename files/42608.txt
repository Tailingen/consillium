Study of ORIC-101 in Combination With Anticancer Therapy
The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel or other anticancer therapies when administered to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

ORIC-101 is a small molecule GR antagonist being developed for the treatment of patients with solid tumor malignancies. Mechanistically, ORIC-101 inhibits GR transcriptional activity and blocks the pro-survival signals mediated by the activated nuclear receptor.

This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, dose-finding study to assess the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel or other anticancer therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will begin with dose finding in combination initially with nab-paclitaxel in patients with various solid tumors (Part I); additional dose expansion cohorts in specific tumor types with nab-paclitaxel (Part II) or with other anticancer therapies may be evaluated through protocol amendment(s).

The study will first evaluate intermittent administration (5 days on, 2 days off for 21 days) of ORIC-101 followed by continuous administration (daily for 21 days) in combination with nab-paclitaxel using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.

In Part II, patients will be enrolled across four cohorts of advanced or metastatic disease:

* pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
* ovarian cancer
* triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
* other solid tumors
