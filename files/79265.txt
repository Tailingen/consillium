Enzastaurin Versus Lomustine in Glioblastoma
This protocol will test the activity of Enzastaurin vs. Lomustine in the treatment of recurrent brain cancer (specifically intracranial glioblastoma multiforme).
Glioblastoma
DRUG: enzastaurin|DRUG: lomustine
The primary objective is to compare Enzastaurin versus Lomustine in patients who for the second time have brain cancer (specifically intracranial glioblastoma) to see what effect the drugs have on keeping the disease from progressing (worsening)., baseline to measured progressive disease (PD)
To measure survival to see how the tumor responded to the therapy and how long the response lasted using MRI (a scanning technique)., time of response to progressive disease|To measure changes in patient's ability to care for themselves (this will be determined through a standard survey)., over entire study|To measure changes from baseline and a neurologic exam., baseline, each cycle|To review all bad reactions reported by the patient and detected in blood tests., each cycle|To review the effect of the cancer on the patient's ability to care for themselves and on their general health status., over entire study|To determine through blood tests how long the medication is in the patient's body., cycle 1, cycle 4|To review through testing of tumor and blood samples to see if there are reasons why some patients responded to the drugs better than other patients., baseline, cycle 2, end of study
This protocol will test the activity of Enzastaurin vs. Lomustine in the treatment of recurrent brain cancer (specifically intracranial glioblastoma multiforme).
