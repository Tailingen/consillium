A Safety and Efficacy Study of SHR3680 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients
This study evaluates the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SHR3680 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC). All participants will receive SHR3680.

Androgenic signaling plays a pivotal role in the development of prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay treatment for this cancer in the metastatic setting, but the disease eventually develops to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) mainly due to the overexpression of androgen receptors (AR) and continued AR activation.

SHR3680 is a novel strong AR antagonist. By competitively binding to AR, SHR3680 inhibits androgen-mediated translocation of AR to the nucleus, binding of AR to Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and finally the transcription of AR target genes, thus possibly resulting in a specific and strong anti-tumor effect on prostate cancer. Unlike first-generation AR antagonists (e.g. bicalutamide), which undergoes an antagonist-to-agonist switch to stimulate AR in the setting of AR overexpression in CRPC, SHR3680 is a full antagonist of AR and thus it is supposed to be more effective for the treatment of CRPC.
