Study of Irinotecan and Cetuximab Versus Irinotecan as Second-Line Treatment in Patients With Metastatic, EGFR-Positive Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether overall survival is prolonged in subjects with metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab in combination with irinotecan compared with irinotecan alone as second-line therapy following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin based, non-irinotecan-containing regimen.
