Effects of Etomidate on Postoperative Circadian Rhythm Changes of Salivary Cortisol in Children
Etomidate is an unique drug used for induction of general anesthesia and sedation. Adrenal cortical inhibition by etomidate has received much attention. However wether the circadian rhythm and pulse secretion pattern of cortisol in children are the same as that in adults is not known. Moreover, the effect of etomidate on circadian rhythm changes and clinical outcomes has never been carefully studied in children undergoing surgery. Our hypothesis is that etomidate can relieve the changes of circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in children for 24-48 hoursï¼Œand this does not make clinical outcomes worse postoperatively.

DRUG: etomidate|DRUG: midazolam|DRUG: propofol
Change from baseline in salivary cortisol at the operative day, At the time of 8am(baseline) and at the time of 8pm in the operative day , get salivary samples to calculate the change of salivary cortisol, baseline(8am), 8pm|Change from baseline in salivary cortisol at the first day after surgery, At the time of 8am(baseline) and at the time of 8pm in the first day after surgery , get salivary samples to calculate the change of salivary cortisol, baseline(8am), 8pm
Numbers of Acquired Infection Events, Acquired infection using extra antibiotics(not prophylactic antibiotics) after surgery., up to 10 days after surgery|Numbers of using inotropic drugs, Inotropic drugs include norepinephrine, adrenaline, phenylephrine and dopamine., within 3 days|Days of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) after surgery, Days of stay in ICU after surgery., up to 10 days after surgery
* Sample size assessment: Using formula to calculate the total number is 30.
* Statistical analysis: ANOVA
* Reporting for adverse events: During the period of study, if there is any severe adverse event happening, such as severe infection, severe low cortisol concentration threatening the patient's life we will stop the trial.
