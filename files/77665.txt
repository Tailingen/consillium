Cabozantinib With Topotecan-Cyclophosphamide
This research study is a clinical trial of a new combination of drugs as a possible treatment for relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma and/or osteosarcoma.

* The names of the drugs are:

  * Cabozantinib
  * Topotecan
  * Cyclophosphamide
* The names of the non-investigational supportive care drugs are:

  * Filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or a related growth factor.
Relapsed Ewing Sarcoma|Refractory Ewing Sarcoma|Relapsed Osteosarcoma|Refractory Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Myeloid growth factor
Maximum Tolerate Dose, Combination of cabozantinib with cyclophosphamide and topotecan

* If no Dose Limiting Toxicities occur during the first cycle for all three subjects, dose escalation to the next highest dose level will occur for the next three enrolling patients.
* If one out of three patients experience a DLT during the first cycle of therapy, up to three additional subjects will then be enrolled at the same dose level for a total of six patients at this dose level. If two or more patients experience DLTs in the 1st cycle, the trial will stop enrollment and this dose level will be the MAD.
* Up to six additional patients will be enrolled at the dose level below the MAD, with the MTD being established once â‰¤1 patient in a dose level experiences DLTs.
* If two out of three patients experience DLTs during the 1st cycle, the protocol will halt enrollment at this dose level, which will be considered the MAD., 1 Year
Number of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The CTCAE version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and performance reporting. Tabulations will be generated by toxicity type and grade, counting only the maximum grade per type within a given patient. Serious adverse events will be separately tabulated. This analysis will be conducted within the safety population., 1 year|Objective Response Rate, The objective response rate to cabozantinib, topotecan and cyclophosphamide will be calculated as follows: (# responders) / (# of patients in the response analysis population) \* 100%. A 95% exact two-sided confidence interval will be placed on this proportion. In addition, the number and proportion of patients by level of response will be presented. Patients with an overall best objective response of partial response or complete response prior to local measures will be categorized as responders, and all other patients as non-responders. This analysis will be conducted within the response analysis population., 1 year|Progression Free Survival, PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods as time from study entry to first episode of disease progression or death, with patients without these events censored at last follow-up., study entry to first episode of disease progression or death, with patients without these events censored at last follow-up up to 1 year
This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, phase 1 clinical trial. A single cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma will be enrolled and treated in a 3+3 design with a combination of cabozantinib, topotecan and cyclophosphamide.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including medical tests and follow up visits.

* The names of the drugs are:

  * Cabozantinib
  * Topotecan
  * Cyclophosphamide
* The names of the non-investigational supportive care drugs are:

  * Filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or a related growth factor.

It is expected that up to 16 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the drugs to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved all medications included in this trial as a treatment for multiple types of cancers.

The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide has been used for treatment of this population. Cabozantinib has been used alone for treatment of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma and shown to have an effect in some patients. This is the first time that cabozantinib will be studied in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide.
