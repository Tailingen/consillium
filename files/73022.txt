Chidamide Plus PD-1 Plus Paclitaxel of Neoadjuvant Treatment in Low HR Expression,HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer.
Triple-negative breast cancer has always been a difficult problem in clinical practice because of its young onset age, high aggressiveness, no clear therapeutic target and poor clinical prognosis. The treatment of triple-negative breast cancer is mainly chemotherapy, and in order to break the current dilemma, new treatments must be introduced. Immunotherapy is one of the most high-profile treatments. The KEYNOTE-522 study and Impassion 031 Study have found that immunotherapy can significantly improve the pCR of patients with triple yin breast cancer, rate, independent of PD-L1 expression status, and good safety.Cedardenamine is a histone deacetylation (HDAC) inhibitor developed in China.Many studies suggest that the use of sidabamine will likely enhance the efficacy of PD-1 / PD-L1 mAb in breast cancer and expand the use of PD-1 / PD-L1 mAb in the beneficiary population of breast cancer

Pathology tpCR (ypT0/is, ypN0) rate, After completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, there was no residual invasive carcinoma in the pathological evaluation of hematoxylin-and eosin-stained resected breast cancer samples and all ipsilateral lymph node samples. Count pCR rate in patients undergoing surgery., 1 year
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieved CR or PR as optimal tumor response in the ITT population, as assessed by the efficacy evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST1.1)., 1 year|Disease-free survival (DFS), Defined as the time interval from the first day of no disease (the date of surgery) to the first recording of a related event, including postoperative disease recurrence or metastasis and death from any cause., 1 year|Disease-free survival in 3 years, Defined as disease-free survival for all patients undergoing surgery from the first day of no disease ( the date of surgery) to 3 years., 3 year|Event-free survival (EFS), Defined as the time interval from the first day of no disease (the date of surgery) to the first recording of related events, including postoperative disease recurrence or metastasis., 1 year
Cedaramine can effectively inhibit subtypes 1,2,3 of HDAC class I and type 10 of class IIb. Sidabamide can directly induce cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumors and has demonstrated its clinical role in lymphoma and breast cancer.besides, In recent years, many studies have found that HDAC inhibitors also have their functions in regulating immunity, Such as: 1) upregulated tumor antigen / co-stimulatory molecule / receptor levels of tumor cells (such as MHC I / II, PRAME, MIC A/B, PDL-1, etc.), Make it easier to be recognized by the immune system; 2) Initialize the natural immune system, Activating NK cell activity; 3) Initialize the acquired immune system, Activating initial T cells (Naive T cells) to target tumor antigen; 4) Increase the CD8 + effector cells that kill tumor cells, Downregulation of the immunosuppressive cells, Such as the Treg 6 7 and MDSC, Promote the formation and maintenance of acquired immune memory T cells. Preclinical studies suggested that HDAC was synergistic with PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies and could serve as a sensitizer for PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies. A phase I study in solid tumors found that sitabenamine combined with natureumab had an objective response rate (ORR) of 48% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 87%.Therefore, we conduct this study to observe the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy in early HR low-expression ,HER2-negative breast cancer patients treated with PD-1 mAb and paclitaxel.
