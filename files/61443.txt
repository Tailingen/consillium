Comparison of Full Robotic Instrumentation and Assistant-Controlled Laparoscopic Instrumentation in Robotic Distal Gastrectomy
This pilot study aims to provide valuable insights into the optimal surgical approach for robotic distal gastrectomy. By comparing full robotic procedures with assistant-controlled techniques, the results may guide future practice, enhancing surgical efficiency, reducing costs, and improving patient outcomes.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Arm I (Assistant-Controlled Laparoscopic Instrumentation)|PROCEDURE: Arm II (Assistant-Controlled Laparoscopic Instrumentation)
Average operative time (in minutes)., The primary outcome is the average operative time (in minutes) from skin incision to skin closure. This measurement will compare surgical efficiency between the assistant-controlled laparoscopic instrumentation group and the full robotic instrumentation group., At the end of the surgery
Total cost of consumable surgical materials., The total cost of surgical consumables, including robotic instruments, staplers, clips, and other disposable materials used during the procedure, will be calculated from the surgical expense records., At the end of the surgery (up to 12 hours)|Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scores at 72 hours postoperatively., The total cost of surgical consumables, including robotic instruments, staplers, clips, and other disposable materials used during the procedure, will be calculated from the surgical expense records., 72 hours postoperatively|Time to first flatus and bowel movement., The time taken for the patient to pass gas and have a bowel movement will be recorded to assess postoperative gastrointestinal recovery., Up to 1 month after surgery|Postoperative laboratory markers (e.g., CRP, WBC)., Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, will be measured from blood samples to evaluate the patient's inflammatory response., Up to 5 days after surgery|Incidence of postoperative complications., The incidence of postoperative complications, including infections, bleeding, anastomotic leakage, and other surgical site issues, will be recorded and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification., Within 30 days postoperatively
