PD will be assessed by the investigator based on the analysis of serum and urine protein electrophoresis (sPEP and uPEP), serum free light chain protein (sFLC), Corrected serum calcium assessment, imaging and bone marrow assessments as per modified IMWG guidelines., from recruitment to the date of the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever comes first (approximately up to 2 years).|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time, in months, Time from first dose of study treatment to death (approximately up to 2 years)|Time to next treatment, Time to next therapy will be defined as the time, in months., From first dose until the date to next anti-neoplastic therapy or death from any cause, whichever comes first (approximately up to 2 years)|Spinal cord compression (Skeletal surveys-Skeletal related events), Spinal cord compression will be evaluated in terms of number (and percentage) of patients with events and number of events per patient, From baseline to 24 months (up to 2 years)|The incidence of pathological fractures (Skeletal surveys-Skeletal related events), The incidence of pathological fractures will be evaluated in terms of number (and percentage) of patients with events and number of events per patient, From baseline to 24 months (up to 2 years)|Need for radiotherapy or surgery to the bones (Skeletal surveys-Skeletal related events), Need for radiotherapy or surgery to the bones will be evaluated in terms of number (and percentage) of patients with events and number of events per patient, From baseline to 24 months (up to 2 years)|Safety (adverse events), The incidence of Adverse Events will be assessed according to the common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events., Continuously throughout the study, starting from informed consent until 30 days after last study treatment (approximately up to 30 months)
This is a prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label Phase II study. Daratumumab will be administered according to approved label. Approximately 57 subjects located in Greece will be enrolled in the study.

Patients shall receive treatment until disease progression, physician decision, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first). Survival status and data of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment will be collected post-treatment.

Primary and secondary variables related to bone disease markers will be evaluated every other cycle of therapy. Disease evaluations will occur monthly and consist mainly of measurements of myeloma proteins. Other parameters may include bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin, and β2- microglobulin and albumin. Assessment of myeloma response and disease progression will be conducted in accordance with the modified IMWG response criteria
