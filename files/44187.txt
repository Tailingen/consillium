Characterization of Colorectal Neoplasia
This is a post-marketing, single-arm, prospective study investigating the use of GI Genius CADx device in the real-time characterization of colorectal polyps (i.e. prediction of their histology during the colonoscopy). Patients enrolled will undergo a standard white-light colonoscopy with the support of the latest version of the CE-marked GI Genius CADx device. Colonoscopy will be performed according to the standard practice.
