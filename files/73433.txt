Circulating Tumor Cells and Melanoma: Comparing the EPISPOT and CellSearch Techniques
The main objective of this study is to compare results for the detection of circulating melanoma cells (CMC) using CellSearch versus EPISPOT (EPithelial ImmunoSPOT) techniques between a group of patients with metastatic melanoma and a group of hospitalized control patients.
Metastatic Melanoma
Presence/absence of at least 2 CMCs per ml blood, both techniques, Presence/absence of at least 2 CMCs per ml blood, using both the Epispot and the CellSearch techniques, Day 1 at 8 am
CMCs per ml blood, Epispot, The number of CMCs per ml blood as determined by the Epispot technique, Day 1 at 8 am|CMCs per ml blood, CellSearch, The number of CMCs per ml blood as determined by the CellSearch technique, Day 1 at 8 am|delta CMC, The difference between the number of CMCs per ml blood detected with the CellSearch technique and the Epispot Technique (CellSearch - Epispot), Day 1 at 8 am|% delta CMC, The % difference between the number of CMCs per ml blood detected with the CellSearch technique and the Epispot Technique (CellSearch - Epispot)/CellSearch\*100, Day 1 at 8 am|Presence/absence of KI67 antigen markers, Day 1 at 8 am|% cells with S100 protein markers, Day 1 at 8 am
The secondary objectives of this study include:

A. To compare the following elements between the two patient groups:

* the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by EPISPOT
* the number of CMCs per ml of blood as determined by CellSearch
* the percentage of patients with at least 2 CMCs per ml of blood according to the two techniques
* the % of CMCs expressing KI67
* the % of CMCs expressions S100 (only the EPISPOT technique)

B. To compare the EPISPOT and CellSearch techniques is terms of the following:

* the number of CMCs detected per ml blood
* the number of CMCs expressing antigen KI67

C. To re-evaluate the 2-CMC per ml blood threshold
