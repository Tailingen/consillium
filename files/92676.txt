A Triple-targeted Cell Preparation Targeting CD19/CD20/CD22 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
A phase I, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-AIO, a triple-targeted cell preparation targeting CD19/CD20/CD22, in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: LCAR-AIO Cells
Incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment, [Time Frame: Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) finding, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design, [Time Frame: 30 days after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow after LCAR-AIO infusion, [Time Frame: 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]
Overall response rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or CRi after treatment via LCAR-AIO cell infusion, [Time Frame: 90 days after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-AIO to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for CR or CRi., [Time Frame: 90 days after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Remission (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (CR or CRi) to the first documented relapse evidence of the responders, [Time Frame: Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Relapse-free survival (RFS), Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LCAR-AIO to the first documented disease relapse or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, [Time Frame: Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-AIO to death of the subject, [Time Frame: Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)]|Incidence of anti-LCAR-AIO antibody and positive sample titer, Venous blood samples will be collected to measure LCAR-AIO positive cell concentrations and the transgenic level of LCAR-H93T, at the time points when anti-LCAR-AIO antibody serum samples are evaluated, [Time Frame: Minimum 2 years after LCAR-H93T infusion (Day 1)]
This is an open-label, dose escalation/expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-AIO in patients â‰¥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of LCAR-AIO infusion. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, pre-treatment (cell product preparation; lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment and follow up.
