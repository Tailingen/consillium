HaemoCerTM Application in Breast Cancer Surgery
HaemoCer is a hemostatic agent to control bleedings during surgical procedures by accelerating natural hemostasis and is frequently applied during breast conserving surgery in women with breast cancer. There is however no adequate data available on the efficacy of HaemoCer regarding seroma formation or drainage output. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the intraoperative application of haemostatic powder (HaemoCer) in breast-conserving surgery in breast cancer patients reduces the postoperative drainage output and number of days until drain removal (number of hospitalization days).
