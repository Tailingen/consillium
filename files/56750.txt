10-year Retrospective Study of Oral and Maxillofacial Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Introduction: The incidence of occult cervical lymph node metastases (OCLNM) is reported to be 20%-30% in early-stage oral cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. There is a lack of an accurate diagnostic method to predict occult lymph node metastasis and to help surgeons make precise treatment decisions.

Aim: To construct and evaluate a preoperative diagnostic method to predict occult lymph node metastasis (OCLNM) in early-stage oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OC and OP SCC) based on deep learning features (DLFs) and radiomics features.

Methods: A total of 319 patients diagnosed with early-stage OC or OP SCC were retrospectively enrolled and divided into training, test and external validation sets. Traditional radiomics features and DLFs were extracted from their MRI images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was employed to identify the most valuable features. Prediction models for OCLNM were developed using radiomics features and DLFs. The effectiveness of the models and their clinical applicability were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and survival analysis.
