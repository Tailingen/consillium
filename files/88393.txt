A Phase I Study of AC220 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia Regardless of FLT3 Status
Patients received oral AC220 daily for 14 days to study the side effects, tolerability and best dose for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, regardless of FLT3 status.

DRUG: AC220
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Treatment Related Adverse Events Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Baseline up to 30 days post last dose|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events By At Least 10% of All Participants By Dose Group Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Baseline up to 30 days post last dose
Number of Participants Achieving a Best Disease Response by Dose Cohort in Terms of Progressive Disease Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Progressive disease response criteria included doubling of blast count % in bone marrow (biopsy or aspirate) from baseline; considering measurements starting on Study Day 15, doubling of blast count % in blood from baseline; death determined to be related to disease or disease progression; and investigator reported disease progression., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose, up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants Achieving a Best Disease Response by Dose Cohort in Terms of Best Overall Response Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Complete Response (CR) response criteria included either a post-baseline bone marrow (BM) biopsy or aspiration % blasts \<5%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1×10\^9/L and platelet count \>100×10\^9/L on the same date as the qualifying BM assessment. CRp response included all CR criteria met, except participant did not experience a platelet recovery (ANC recovery required). CRi response included a qualifying BM result, but not an ANC recovery. Participants may or may not have had a platelet recovery and were not required to be transfusion independent. Partial remission (PR) response included a decrease of ≥50% in % blasts in the BM aspirate or biopsy from baseline to a post-baseline result between 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate or biopsy. Nonresponders (NR) had a pre- and 1 or more post-baseline BM assessment carried out, but results did not meet any response criteria. Participants who were not evaluable (NE) did not have at least 14 days of treatment and were not assessed., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose, up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants Achieving a Best Disease Response by Dose Cohort in Terms of Best Overall Response Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Complete Response (CR) response criteria included either a post-baseline bone marrow biopsy or aspiration % blasts \<5%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1×10\^9/L and platelet count \>100×10\^9/L on the same date as the qualifying bone marrow assessment.

Partial remission (PR) response included a decrease of ≥50% in % blasts in the bone marrow aspirate or biopsy from baseline to a post-baseline result between 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate or biopsy. Nonresponders (NR) had a pre- and 1 or more post-baseline bone marrow assessment carried out, but results did not meet any of the CR or PR or progressive disease criteria., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose, up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Hematologic Improvement Following Oral Administration of Quizartinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Hematologic improvement is summarized in terms of Erythroid Response (HI-E), Platelet Response (HI-P), Neutrophil Response (HI-N), and Hematologic Improvement (HI).

For post-treatment results, HI-E major responders had \>2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin for at least 1 result after first treatment and transfusion independent; minor responders 1 to 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin for at least 1 result post first treatment and a 50% decrease in red blood cell transfusion requirements. For HI-P, major responders had ≥30 × 10\^9/L increase in platelet count and transfusion independent; minor responders had 50% or more increase in platelet count with a net increase between 10 to 30 × 10\^9/L and 50% decrease in platelet transfusion requirements. For HI-N, major responders had an increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 100% or an absolute increase of more than 0.5 × 10\^9/L (whichever is greater); minor responders had an increase in ANC of 100% but an absolute increase of \<0.5 × 10\^9/L., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose, up to approximately 3 years
This is a multi-center clinical study conducted in the USA and two international sites. This open-label, dose escalation study was designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally administered AC220 as a single agent given daily for 14 days. Cohorts of 3 patients received AC220 until dose limiting toxicity was noted (DLT). At that point cohorts expanded to 6 patients until MTD was determined. Patients not experiencing DLT or significant disease progression at Day 15 may have continued receiving AC220 at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor. FLT3 positive and negative patients were allowed to participate.
