Immediate Compared With Delayed Chemotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Without Signs or Symptoms of Disease
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of immediate with delayed fluorouracil plus leucovorin in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer without signs or symptoms of disease.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: leucovorin calcium
Survival, 8 years
Quality of life, 8 years|Toxicity, 8 years|Time to progression, 8 years|response rate, 8 years|response duration, 8 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival and quality of life in asymptomatic patients with advanced colorectal cancer randomized to immediate fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/CF) vs. 5-FU/CF delayed until onset of symptoms.

OUTLINE: Randomized, unblinded study. Arm I: Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590. Arm II: Observation followed by Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Clinical observation until symptomatic; followed by 5-FU; with CF.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 144 patients will be entered over 4 years.
