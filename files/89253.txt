Study to Evaluate Palifermin in the Reduction of Dysphagia in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine if palifermin will reduce the incidence of dysphagia in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy for treatment of unresectable stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

Number of Participants With Grade 2 or Higher Dysphagia, Participants underwent acute dysphagia assessments twice weekly during Weeks 1 through 7, and twice weekly thereafter (Weeks 8 through 12) and once weekly after Week 12 until dysphagia resolved to grade ≤ 1 but not beyond Week 16. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) dysphagia scale according to the following:

Grade 1: Symptomatic, able to eat regular diet; Grade 2: Symptomatic and altered eating/swallowing (e.g., altered dietary habits, oral supplements), IV fluids indicated \<24 hours; Grade 3: Symptomatic and severely altered eating/swallowing (e.g., inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake), IV fluids, tube feedings, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) indicated ≥24 hours; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences (e.g., obstruction, perforation)., Start of treatment through Week 16
Duration of Grade 2 or Higher Dysphagia, Duration of grade 2 or higher dysphagia was calculated in days from the onset (first occurrence of grade ≥ 2) to the resolution (grade ≤ 1 after the last grade ≥ 2) of dysphagia.

Participants with no assessments were assumed as having grade ≥ 2 dysphagia and with a duration of the mean duration of all participants., Start of treatment through Week 16|Maximal Dysphagia Grade, The mean maximal grade of dysphagia for each participant during the study. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) dysphagia scale according to the following:

Grade 1: Symptomatic, able to eat regular diet; Grade 2: Symptomatic and altered eating/swallowing (e.g., altered dietary habits, oral supplements), IV fluids indicated \<24 hours; Grade 3: Symptomatic and severely altered eating/swallowing (e.g., inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake), IV fluids, tube feedings, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) indicated ≥24 hours; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences (e.g., obstruction, perforation)., Start of treatment through Week 16|Number of Participants With Severe (Grade 3 or Higher) Dysphagia, Participants underwent acute dysphagia assessments twice weekly during Weeks 1 through 7, and twice weekly thereafter (Weeks 8 through 12) and once weekly after Week 12 until dysphagia resolved to grade ≤ 1 but not beyond Week 16. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) dysphagia scale according to the following:

Grade 1: Symptomatic, able to eat regular diet; Grade 2: Symptomatic and altered eating/swallowing (e.g., altered dietary habits, oral supplements), IV fluids indicated \<24 hours; Grade 3: Symptomatic and severely altered eating/swallowing (e.g., inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake), IV fluids, tube feedings, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) indicated ≥24 hours; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences (e.g., obstruction, perforation)., Start of treatment through Week 16|Number of Participants With Unplanned Breaks in Radiotherapy, The number of participants with unplanned breaks in radiotherapy of ≥ 5 days or who discontinued radiotherapy during Week 1 to Week 6., Week 1 to Week 6|Maximal Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Increase, Maximal increase from Baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. ECOG is a scale to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.

Grade 0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; Grade 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature; Grade 2: Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 3: Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 4: Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any selfcare. Totally confined to bed or chair; Grade 5: Dead., Baseline through Week 12|Number of Participants Hospitalized, Baseline to Week 16|Maximal Body Weight Loss, Maximal weight loss observed from Baseline through to Week 12., Baseline through Week 12
During the acute dysphagia evaluation phase (the period lasting from the administration of the first dose of investigational product through Week 12 (or up to Week 16 if dysphagia is not resolved to CTCAE v3.0 grade ≤ 1 by Week 12) participants underwent acute dysphagia assessments twice weekly. All participants were followed for disease progression, second primary tumors, other malignancies, and overall survival until death or loss to follow-up during the long term follow-up (still ongoing).
