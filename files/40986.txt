HPVPro Study: Comparison of HPV Detection in Clinician-collected Cervical Swabs and Self-sampled Cervicovaginal Swabs
Comparison of the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in paired physician-obtained cervical swabs and self-sampled cervicovaginal swabs and evaluation of HPV prevalence in Czech women screening population.

HPV prevalence, Evaluation of the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in screening population of Czech women., 18 months|Concordance of HPV positivity in self-collected cervicovaginal swabs and clinician-collected cervical swabs, Paired cervical and cervicovaginal swabs will be collected in the same day and will be tested by the same method. Concordance of HPV positivity in both swabs will be evaluated., 18 months
Comparison of different human papillomavirus DNA detection methods in cervical and cervicovaginal swabs., Hybridization and PCR-based HPV detection methods will be tested in both cervical and cervicovaginal swabs and results of these two methods will be compared., 18 months
The cervical screening program in the Czech Republic is based on cytology with HPV triage. Nevertheless, cytology-based cervical screening may switch to HPV-based cervical screening in future. The implementation of primary HPV screening and insuficiency cervical screening attendance are a major challenge. The offering of self-sampling to the cervical screening non-attenders could increase women's participation as was shown in several European countries. The objective of the HPVPro study was to find out the HPV prevalence in the screening population of Czech women since there are no data for the Czech Republic. The second objective was to compare HPV DNA detection rate in paired self-sampled cervicovaginal swabs and physician-obtained cervical swabs and to determine acceptability of self-sampling HPV DNA test by Czech women. This information is important for optimisation of cervical cancer screening program in the Czech Republic.
