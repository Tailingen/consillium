Study of Tisagenlecleucel in Combination With Ibrutinib in r/r Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients
A multi-center, open-label, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the administration of tisagenlecleucel in combination with ibrutinib in patients with r/r DLBCL who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy, including an anti-CD20 and anthracycline based chemotherapy, and who have progressed after or are not candidates for ASCT.
