A Study in Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level and schedule of dosing LY2940680 that can safely be taken by participants with advanced cancer. The study will also explore the changes in a cancer marker level in skin, hair follicles, buccal cells, and tumor cells. Finally, the study will help document any antitumor activity this drug may have.

DRUG: Taladegib
Recommended Phase 2 Dose: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Recommended Phase 2 dose was determined by maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which was determined by Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). For the purpose of this study, the MTD was defined as the highest tested dose that had \<33% probability of causing a DLT in Cycle 1 of Part A., Time to First Dose to the End of Cycle 1 of Part A (Up To 28 Days)

CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PD is a ≥20% increase in the sum of diameter of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase in the sum diameter of ≥5 millimeter (mm), the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., Baseline to Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 32 Months)|Part C and D: Progression Free Survival (PFS), For each participant in Part C and D who is not known to have died or to have had a progression of disease as of the data inclusion cut-off date, PFS was censored at the date of last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy. Progressive disease (PD) was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause (Up To 32 Months)
Participants may include those who have previously received treatment with another hedgehog smoothened (Hh/Smo) inhibitor (excluding LY2940680).
