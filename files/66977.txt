Study to Assess the Effect of Rifampicin (CYP Inducer) on Blood Levels and Safety of Olaparib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the effect of rifampicin on the PK parameters of olaparib in patients; Part B will allow patients continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.
