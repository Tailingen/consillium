Cladribine Plus Pegylated Interpheron Alfa-2a in Systemic Mastocytosis
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy in terms of clinical and biological response rates of Cladribine plus Pegylated Interpheron alpha-2a therapy in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis carrying D816V or other exon 17 KIT mutations.
Systemic Mastocytosis
DRUG: Cladribine and pegylated interpheron alpha-2a
To evaluate the effect of therapy on bone marrow mast cell infiltration., Evaluation of bone marrow response will be assessed by immunohistochemestry, citology, flow cytometry and molecular analyses of bone marrow samples., 6 months
To determine the effect of therapy on serum tryptase levels and other altered peripheral blood parameters due to mastocytosis., Serum tryptase and any other mastocytosis-related altered biochemical parameter at diagnosis will be measured monthly until the end of therapy., 6 months|To evaluate the effect of therapy on mast cell-mediator release symptoms: pruritus, flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms or anaphylaxis)., Specific questionnaires regarding mast cell-mediator release symptoms will be filled monthly by each patient until the end of therapy., 6 months|To determine de safety of combined therapy with low doses of cladribine plus pegylated interpheron alpha-2a., Potentially drugs-related adverse events will be recorded in each case following accepted criteria (NIH CTCAE)., 6 months|To evaluate the effect of therapy on mastocytosis skin lesions., Evaluation of cutaneous response will be assessed by macroscopic inspection including photographs and by skin immunohistochemestry., 6 moths|To evaluate the effect of therapy on mastocytosis-related organomegalies., Evaluation of organomegalies response will be assessed by abdominal ultrasound and/or computerized tomography., 6 months|To evaluate the effect of therapy on mastocytosis-related bone alterations., Evaluation of bone response will be assessed by X-ray survey and/or computerized tomography., 6 months
