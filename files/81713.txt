Immunoscore in Rectal Cancer
This is an observational study of tumor samples and MRI imaging in patients with colorectal cancers. A tumor sample, MRI scans, and treatment outcome data will be used for research purposes to see if it is possible to predict patients' response to treatment.

Correlation of the number of infiltrating leukocytes within a biopsy sample with pathologic response, Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis will be performed on parameters of interest on both pre-treatment biopsy specimens as well as post-operative specimens. The pre-treatment sample will be used to establish the immunophenotype score. The primary analysis will evaluate the ability of immunophenotype score to correlate with pathologic response., 16 weeks
The quality of the immune environment in colorectal cancer biopsy samples correlates with disease-free survival and overall survival more so than current staging conventions. This study will use a scoring system called 'immunoscore' to characterize the immune enviroment. Researchers hypothesize that the immunoscore will correlate with outcomes of colorectal patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
