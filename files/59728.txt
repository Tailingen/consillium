Eribulin Versus Vinorelbine in Subjects With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Anthracyclines and Taxanes
This study is designed as an open-label randomized parallel two-arm multicenter efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety study of intravenously administered eribulin versus intravenously administered vinorelbine in Chinese population. Eligible female subjects will have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 with the modification that chest x-ray cannot be used for assessment of disease.
