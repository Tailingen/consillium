To evaluate the effectiveness of dexamethasone (dex) alone as compared to dex in combination with thalidomide in low risk patients relapsing after autologous transplantation.
To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities associated with the regimens.
Maintenance

Dexamethasone

Patients will receive 40 mg dexamethasone days 1-4 only, every 3-4 weeks. Response will be assessed at least every 3 months while on maintenance therapy. Appropriate H2 blocker and antibiotics will also be given.

Thalidomide

Thalidomide will continue at a dose of 400 mg daily, or at the dose that was reduced and judged to be well tolerated in induction therapy. Thalidomide will be given as an oral, once daily dose at bedtime. Those patients unable to tolerate dexamethasone may continue on thalidomide alone until criteria for removal from treatment is met.
