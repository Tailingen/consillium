The Advantages and Disadvantages Between Uncut Roux-en-Y Reconstruction and Billroth II Reconstruction After Laparoscopy-assisted Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Uncut Roux-en-Y Reconstruction|PROCEDURE: Billroth II Reconstruction
The time of reconstruction during operations of Uncut Roux-en-Y Reconstruction and Billroth II Reconstruction, The time of reconstruction operation will be recorded in the operating note by nurses in minutes., within 2 hours after surgery|change of potential of hydrogen ( pH) in remnant stomach, In the morning of 1-6 days after operation , monitor the number of gastric juice's potential of hydrogen ( pH) value through gastric tube and write down the data. So if the data is greater than 7,the complication of bile reflux happened, 1-6 days after surgery|the amount of blood loss during operations of Uncut Roux-en-Y Reconstruction and Billroth II Reconstruction, During the operation the amount of blood loss will be recorded in the operating note by nurses in milliliters., within 2 hours after surgery
the number of patients with the complication of Residual food, During the upper gastrointestinal radiographyï¼Œif there is residual food,the meglumine diatrizoate will be separate and then write down the number., 6 month after surgery|the number of patients with the complication of Reflux esophagitis, During the upper gastrointestinal radiography,if there is meglumine diatrizoate refluxing to esophagus,it will be observed and written down in number., 6 month after surgery
the number of patients with the complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD), all patients of this clinical trial will be investigated by Gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire(GerdQ),and all patients whose score is beyond 8 will be collected., 6 month after surgery
To search which is the better reconstructions by comparing and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages between Uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II reconstructions after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Method: It's a prospective study including all patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in the First Hospital of Jilin University, from February 2016 to February 2017. All surgical procedures will be performed by the single surgery team, which is leaded by professor Wang Quan. The reconstruction method will be selected randomly from Uncut Roux-en-Y and Billroth II anastomosis by drawing lots preoperatively without distinct indications. Clinical data, operation data and perioperative complications and related physiological indexes of differences.
