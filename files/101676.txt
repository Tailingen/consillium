A Study of Debio 1347 Plus Fulvestrant in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of a phase Ib study is to find out the best or maximum tolerated dose of a medication or combination of medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to decide the best dose of the study drug, Debio 1347, that can be given in combination with the standard hormonal drug, fulvestrant. Debio 1347 and fulvestrant could shrink the cancer but it could also cause side effects. This study tells us about the side effects of these drugs when given in this new combination, and how often they occur.
