Intraoperative Use of an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System to Guide Additional Margin Cavity Shaves in Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS)
Female patients undergoing a breast conserving procedure will be consented for the excised breast tissue to be imaged on an investigational OCT-based device. Additional tissue may be excised to obtain clear/negative margins based on routine standard of care tissue assessment techniques and intraoperative OCT image review.

DEVICE: OCT- based investigational imaging device
Number of times the surgeon recorded a decision to excise additional tissue based on intra-operative Wide Field Optical Coherence Tomography (WF-OCT) image review in addition to Standard of Care tissue assessment., Surgeon's assessment of margin status post Wide Field OCT (WF-OCT) image review and any action taken, will be recorded., Within 1 hour of tissue excision|Average time to excise additional tissue during Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS), Time taken to excise additional tissue based on WF-OCT image review, will be recorded., Within 1 hour of primary tumor excision|Calculate percentage of patients that require a second surgery, Record percentage of patients with positive margins per pathology, that require a second surgery., Within about 3 months of first surgery
Note: A retrospective review of the stated purpose and objectives of the PER-19-02 protocol has determined that this study better fits the definition of a medical device feasibility study, with regard to FDA guidance "Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies," issued October 2013. The primary objectives of the PER-19-02 study (NCT04314700) emphasize user factors, rather than health outcomes, as the focus is on collecting information related to usability and timing, with no change to the standard of care (pathology analysis and additional surgery when needed). PER-19-02 was not used as a pivotal study to support the substantial equivalence or safety and effectiveness evidence submitted as part of an FDA pre-market submission. The IDE-approved pivotal study for evaluating the effect of Perimeter's OCT technology on health-related outcomes in breast surgery is the randomized control trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under protocol PER-19-04 (NCT05113927). Perimeter has determined this trial does not meet the definition of an Applicable Clinical Trial per the "Checklist for Evaluating Whether a Clinical Trial or Study is an Applicable Clinical Trial (ACT) Under 42 CFR 11.22(b) for Clinical Trials Initiated on or After January 18, 2017."
