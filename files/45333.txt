Diagnostic Performance of Ultrasound Elastography for Detection of Thyroid Cancer
For patients with thyroid gland nodule, fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been proved to be an efficient tool for thyroid cancer diagnosis. However, it is somewhat an invasive procedure and is subject to sampling and analysis uncertainties. Thus, improved, more reliable criteria for determining which nodule should be be aspirated are needed. Ultrasound elastography has been shown to be useful in the differential diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers. Ultrasound elastography also may discriminate malignant from benign nodule.
