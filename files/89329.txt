Tax First-line Chemotherapy With Different Doses and Then Maintenance Therapy
The Primary Objective is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS).

The secondary objectives are:

* To compare the disease control rates of different doses of Docetaxel+Cisplatin as first-line treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria;
* To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR);
* To evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP);
* To evaluate the overall survival (OS);
* To evaluate the toxicity.

Progression-free survival (PFS) during the maintenance treatment phase, From 2nd randomization to progression or death of any cause (every 2 cycles (6 weeks) during study treatment, and then every 8 weeks during follow-up period)
Disease control rate (DCR) during the first line treatment phase, Every 2 cycles (6 weeks)|Overall response rate (ORR) during the first line treatment phase, Every 2 cycles (6 weeks)|Time to disease progression (TTP) during the maintenance treatment phase, From 2nd randomization up to disease progression (every 2 cycles (6 weeks))|Overall survival (OS), From 1st randomization to death of any cause (every 2 cycles (6 weeks) during study treatment, and then every 8 weeks during follow-up period)
The study consists in:

* A first line treatment phase: participants receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle contains 3 weeks) with either docetaxel (75 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or docetaxel (60 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) ,
* A maintenance treatment phase: participants with disease control (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\] or stable disease \[SD\]) after the initial treatment receive up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m2) or best supportive care (BSC).
* A follow-up period from the end of study treatment until participant death or end of study.
