Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Personal Pap Smear Deviceâ„¢ for Collection of Cervical Cells
This purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of the Personal Pap Smear TM Device to collect adequate cervical cell samples for cytology examination when compared with the Rover Cervex-Brush (Cervix-Examination Brush).
Cervical Cancer Screening
DEVICE: Pap smear collection using the Personal Pap Smear (PPS) Device|DEVICE: Active Comparator: Pap smear collection using the Rovers Cervex-Brush
Comparison of the samples for the Predicate Device versus PPS device, Data of Adequate versus Inadequate will be reported to include a positive percent agreement (PPA) defined as PPA= A/(A+C) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) defined as NPA = D/(B+D) along with their 95% confidence bounds using the Clopper-Pearson method., Baseline
The Comparison of Cell Types of the PPS Device versus the Predicate Device, The PPS Device and the Predicate Device cell types will be measured against the 2014 Besthesda cytology categories that will be displayed in a 8 x 8 contingency table., Baseline
To determine the effectiveness of the Personal Pap Smear TM Device to collect adequate (as defined by Bethesda Guidelines 2014) cervical cell samples for cytology examination as compared with the Rover Cervex-Brush (Cervix-Examination Brush).
