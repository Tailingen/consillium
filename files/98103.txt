Delphinus SoftVue™ ROC Reader Study
The purpose of this multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) reader study is to evaluate reader performance when SoftVue™ automated breast ultrasound and screening mammography are combined, compared to screening mammography alone, in women with dense breast parenchyma.

This reader study will include approximately 32 radiologist readers and a sample of approximately 200 breast screening cases to be selected from the library of images collected under Delphinus Protocol #DMT-2015.001 (NCT03257839) Arm 1 Phases B, C, and D. The reader study image case set will be enriched with cancer cases.
