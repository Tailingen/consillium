Phase III Study of Rilvegostomig in Combination With Bevacizumab With or Without Tremelimumab as First-line Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase III, randomised, open-label, sponsor-blinded, 3-arm, multicentre, global study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig in combination with bevacizumab with or without tremelimumab compared to atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab. This study will be conducted in participants with advanced HCC who are not amenable to curative therapy or locoregional therapy

The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rilvegostomig in combination with bevacizumab with or without tremelimumab as first-line treatment in participants with advanced HCC. The study comprises 2 parts - a safety lead-in and a randomised period. Prior to the start of the randomised period of the study, a single-arm safety lead-in period will be applied to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rilvegostomig in combination with bevacizumab and tremelimumab.
