A Master Protocol to Evaluate DCC-3009 in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
The purpose of this Phase 1/2 master protocol study is to evaluate if DCC-3009 is safe, tolerable and works effectively in the treatment of GIST. The study will use a modular approach with each module being defined according to therapy: DCC-3009 alone or DCC-3009 in combination with other anticancer therapies. Each module will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion). Participants will be treated in 28-day treatment cycles with an estimated duration of up to 2 years.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: DCC-3009
Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) (Part 1 Escalation), DLTs assessed for each dose level., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Part 2 Expansion), ORR is the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), v1.1., Baseline to Progressive Disease (PD), Death due to Any Cause, or Start of New Antitumor Therapy (Estimated up to 24 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Part 1 Escalation), ORR is the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based on mRECIST, v1.1., Baseline to Progressive Disease (PD), Death due to Any Cause, or Start of New Antitumor Therapy (Estimated up to 24 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR for participants with confirmed CR or confirmed PR based on mRECIST, v1.1, defined as the time interval from the time that the measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the disease progression is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., First Recorded CR or PR until PD or Death (Estimated up to 24 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from initiation of treatment until documented disease progression per mRECIST, v1.1, or death, whichever occurs first., Initiation of Treatment to PD or Death (Estimated up to 24 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from initiation of treatment to the date of death from any cause., Initiation of Treatment to Death from Any Cause (Estimated up to 24 months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum observed plasma drug concentration (Cmax), Cmax, Estimated up to 24 months
