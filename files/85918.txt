Application of 68GA-labeled CD73 Targeting Probe PET/CT Imaging in the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
We plan to conduct a 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE PET/CT imaging study on breast cancer patients to observe the binding of the tracer to lesions and evaluate CD73 expression. Alongside this, we will correlate these imaging results with relevant clinical indicators to assess the effectiveness of 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE in diagnosing and guiding treatment in breast cancer patients. This study aims to predict responses to targeted therapies.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: 68GA-DOTA-dPNE
The evaluation of diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE PET in breast cancer, Patients with histologically proven breast cancer will be prospectively recruited in this study. They will receive 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE and 18F-FDG. The detection rates of lesions, bones and lymph nodes (visual) were compared., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The investigators plan to conduct a 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE PET/CT imaging study in breast cancer patients to observe the binding of the tracer to tumor lesions and evaluate CD73 expression. As part of the study design, a subset of patients will initially undergo dynamic PET/CT imaging to evaluate the safety profile and pharmacokinetic distribution of the radiotracer in vivo. Subsequently, static PET/CT imaging will be performed on additional patients to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of 68Ga-DOTA-dPNE. Imaging results will be correlated with relevant clinical indicators to evaluate the potential of this tracer in diagnosing breast cancer, guiding therapeutic decisions, and predicting responses to targeted therapies.
