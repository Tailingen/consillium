Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Frail and Elder Patients With Metastatic NSCLC (DURATION)
AIO-YMO/TRK-0416 (DURATION) is a open-label, treatment stratified and randomized phase II study of Durvalumab, frail or elderly patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no targetable molecular alterations (EGFRwt; ALKtransl-) and not amenable to cisplatinum-based standard-combination chemotherapy but eligible for at-least mono-chemotherapy with gemcitabine or vinorelbine.

Rate of treatment related Grade III/IV adverse events (CTCAE V4.03), Comparison of the outcome of sequential therapy consisting of standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy followed by durvalumab versus standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy in frail/elderly patients, through study completion, an average of 24 months
PFS, Progression Free Survival, approx. 24 months|ORR using assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), approx. 24 months|OS, Overall Survival, approx. 60 months|Adverse Events /Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events: Type, incidence, and severity according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03, approx. 48 months|Health related Quality of Life (HR-QoL), as determined with FACT-L (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung), approx. 60 months|Geriatric assessment, G8-questionnaire, approx. 60 months|Geriatric assessment, Timed up \& go (test of basic functional mobility), approx. 60 months|Geriatric assessment, 6MWT (6 minutes walk test), approx. 60 months
The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of sequential therapy consisting of standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy followed by durvalumab in comparison to standard of care mono- or combination chemotherapy in frail/elderly patients.
