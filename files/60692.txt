Telephone Counseling or Standard Care in Patients Who Have Completed Treatment for Stages I, II, or III Cervical Cancer
RATIONALE: Telephone counseling after treatment may reduce stress and improve the well-being and quality of life of patients who have cervical cancer. Changes in quality of life may be related to changes in immune function and neuroendocrine function.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying how well telephone counseling works compared to standard care in reducing stress in patients who have completed treatment for stage I, stage II, or stage III cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer|Psychosocial Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment
BEHAVIORAL: Psychosocial Telephone Counseling (PTC)
Change in quality of life measured by FACT-Cx, FACT-Cx (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervical), Baseline and 4 months after enrollment|Change in neuroendocrine parameters, Saliva samples were tested for cortisol, Baseline and 4 months after enrollment|Change in neuroendocrine parameters, Saliva samples were tested for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to calculate cortisol/DHEA ratios, Baseline and 4 months after enrollment|Change in immune parameters, Blood samples were tested for T helper type 1and 2 (Th1/Th2) bias, as measured by IFN-Î³/interleukin-5 ELISpot T, Baseline and 4 months after enrollment|Change in immune parameters, Blood samples were tested for counterregulatory cytokine IL-10, Baseline and 4 months after enrollment|Correlation of psychosocial measures and immunologic stance, Spearman's correlation coefficient between the change in FACT-Cx and the change in Th1/Th2 Immune system bias, Baseline and 4 months after enrollment
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare quality of life (QOL) at baseline and changes in QOL, immune response, and neuroendocrine parameters over time in patients who have completed treatment for stage I-III cervical cancer receiving psychosocial telephone counseling vs usual care.
* Correlate psychosocial measures with immunologic stance.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo psychosocial telephone counseling comprising 5 weekly sessions and a 1-month follow-up session to learn strategies for reducing stress.
* Arm II: Patients undergo usual care for approximately 4 months. All patients complete questionnaires and Quality of life assessment at baseline and at 4 months. They also undergo saliva and blood sample collections at baseline and at 4 months for neuroimmune studies.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
