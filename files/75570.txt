This study consisted of 2 parts.

* During the first part (Phase I) of the study, 6 subjects with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) received the investigational product (IP) and remained at the site for approximately 6 hours post-administration in order to assess the PK, biodistribution versus time, and dosimetry for critical organs. Subjects received a single dose of 3 MBq/kg, (\>=150 and =\<250 MBq), of 68\^Ga-PSMA-R2 intravenously. Serial blood and urine samples were collected for PK characterization and dosimetry and whole-body PET/CT were acquired at selected time points (0 to 4 hours) to determine organ and tumor absorbed doses. Safety assessments were conducted after IP administration on Day 1, and during follow-up on Days 7 and 28.
* In the second part of the study (Phase II), 2 groups of 12 subjects were enrolled (subjects with PCa in biochemical recurrence \[PCa-BR\], and subjects with prostate cancer in the metastatic stage \[mPCa\]). Based on the preliminary data analysis from the Phase I part of the study provided sufficient dosimetry data, all subjects underwent the whole body PET/CT imaging optimized for time (up to 2 time points) according to the data analysis from the Phase I part of the study.

This study was comprised of 4 clinical visits and conducted in 3 study periods: screening, administration/imaging, and safety follow-up period.
