PTC299 for Treatment of Advanced Cancer
Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in advanced cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral investigational new drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. When given in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, PTC299 increases the antitumor activity over use of docetaxel alone. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of anti-VEGF and antitumor activity when administered orally to participants with cancer.

The study will be conducted in 3 stages. In Stage 1 of the study, successive groups of 3 to 6 participants will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment will be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. In Stage 2, additional groups of 3 to 6 participants will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously (that is, without the 2-week no-drug period as in Stage 1). In Stage 3, additional groups of 3 to 6 participants will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 3-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously in combination with docetaxel (75 milligrams/meter squared \[mg/m\^2\] intravenously \[IV\] every 3 weeks). All planned dose levels in all stages are expected to achieve circulating blood levels of PTC299 known to be active in animal models of human cancer. Treatment for each participant can continue as long as the therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control to that participant. Up to 76 evaluable participants will be accrued across the 3 stages.
