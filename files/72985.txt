Assessing Benefits of NIRAF Detection for Identifying Parathyroid Glands During Total Thyroidectomy.
This study describes a single center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial to assess the clinical benefits of the use of near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with an FDA-cleared device 'Parathyroid Eye (PTeye)' for identifying parathyroid glands (PGs) during total thyroidectomy (TTx). It compares risk-benefits and outcomes in TTx patients where NIRAF detection with PTeye for parathyroid identification is either used or not used.
Postoperative Hypoparathyroidism|Thyroid Neoplasms|Thyroid Cancer
DEVICE: NIRAF Detection Technology
Average Number of Parathyroid Glands Identified With High Confidence Per Patient, Average number of parathyroid glands identified (Experimental Group: Glands identified with naked eye + NIRAF; Control Group: Glands identified with naked eye) per patient, Immediate. During total thyroidectomy procedure.
Postoperative Hypoparathyroidism/Hypocalcemia (Permanent), If blood calcium has not normalized at 1st postsurgical clinical visit, total calcium level and/or PTH is subsequently measured as necessary. Patient is defined to have permanent hypoparathyroidism if PTH \< 16 pg/mL and/or activated Vitamin D is required to be symptom free at or after the 6th postoperative month., 6 months after total thyroidectomy|Postoperative Hypoparathyroidism/Hypocalcemia (Transient), Undetectable postoperative PTH and/or low calcium (total calcium \< 2mmol/L or 8 mg/dL, serum intact PTH \< 16 pg/mL or 1 pmol/L) at first postoperative visit (usually 5-30 days after total thyroidectomy)., 5 days to 6 months after total thyroidectomy.|Postoperative Hypoparathyroidism/Hypocalcemia (Immediate), Postoperative low calcium (total calcium \<8mg/dL or \<2mmol/L) and/or undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) (serum intact PTH \< 16 pg/mL or 1 pmol/L) within 24 hours after surgery, Within 24 hours after total thyroidectomy.|Number of Frozen Sections Sent for Analysis (of Suspected Parathyroid Tissue)., Number of frozen sections sent for analysis during the procedure to confirm potential parathyroid tissue, Immediate. During total thyroidectomy procedure.|Number of Auto-transplanted Parathyroid Glands, Number of auto-transplanted parathyroid glands if the parathyroid gland was accidentally excised/devascularized., Immediate. During total thyroidectomy procedure.|Number of Nights Spent in the Hospital After Total Thyroidectomy, Number of nights spent in the hospital after the surgical procedure. 0 nights, 1 night, \>1 night, 0 - 4 nights after total thyroidectomy|Number of Inadvertently Resected Parathyroid Glands, Number of inadvertently resected parathyroid glands when parathyroid tissue is found in the resected thyroid specimens., Intraoperatively or on histology (within 24 hours post operation)
Inadvertent damage or excision of a healthy parathyroid gland (PG) following a total thyroidectomy (TTx) could result in transient hypocalcemia (\< 6 months) in 5 - 35% of cases or permanent hypocalcemia (\> 6 months) in 7% of the patients (1, 2). In both of these circumstances, patients would require calcium and active vitamin D supplementation in addition to a potentially prolonged hospital stay and/or unplanned hospital readmission adding to unnecessary burden and healthcare costs. These complications could be minimized with label-free intraoperative PG identification using near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with a fiber-probe based approach (3 - 5) as utilized in 'PTeye', which is medical device that was recently FDA-cleared (6). However, the true impact of this particular NIRAF-based approach on patient outcomes is yet to be determined

The aim of this prospective single blinded randomized study is to compare 2 groups of patients: TTx patients operated using NIRAF detection technology with PTeye as adjunct tool (NIRAF+) vs. patients operated without the adjunct technology (NIRAF-). The main objective of this study is to assess the benefit of intraoperative use of NIRAF detection technology via PTeye during TTx procedures with regard to postoperative hypocalcemia, PG identification, PG auto-transplantation and inadvertent resection rates compared to standard of care.
