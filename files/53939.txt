FDG Uptake in Vaginal Tampons is Due to Urine
The etiology of FDG uptake in vaginal tampons during PET/CT examinations remains unclear and can potentially impair image interpretation.

The aim of this study is to determine the etiology of this artefact and identify potential means how to prevent it.
Cancer
DEVICE: modified vaginal tampon
Number of FDG Positive Tampoons, Number of FDG positive Tampoons with an SUV \> 3, 1 month
Tampon Position Relative to the Pubococcygeal Line, measure tampon position in regard to the pubococcygeal line to identify if positioning is responsible for urinary contamination., 1 month
In this prospective, Institutional Review board approved study we included 44 women referred to FDG PET/CT for staging or follow-up in an oncology setting. All women were provided a normal commercial or modified vaginal tampon with a silicon coated base to be used during examination. Images were analyzed to determine the localization and the FDG uptake in the tampons. Between the uptake phase and imaging, all patients were asked to void. After image acquisition, tampons were individually analyzed for creatinine concentration, blood traces, position relative to the pubococcygeal line, and FDG activity. Statistical significance was determined by means of the Mann-Whitney U test.
