Study of Denosumab vs. Zoledronic Acid to Treat Bone Metastases in Subjects With Advanced Cancer or Multiple Myeloma.
The purpose of this study is to determine if denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid (Zometa®) in the treatment of bone metastases (lytic bone lesions from multiple myeloma) in subjects with advanced cancer and multiple myeloma (excluding breast and prostate cancer)
Bone Metastases
BIOLOGICAL: Denosumab|DRUG: Zoledronic Acid
Time to the First On-Study Skeletal-Related Event (Non-Inferiority), Time to the first on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using a non-inferiority analysis. Median was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., up to 33 months
Time to First On-Study Skeletal-Related Event (Superiority), Time to first on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using a test for superiority. Median was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., up to 33 months|Time to the First-and-Subsequent On-Study Skeletal-Related Event, Time to the first-and-subsequent on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using multiple event analysis. To be considered a subsequent SRE, the event must occur at least 21 days after the previous SRE.

This outcome measure utilizes multiple event times, was analyzed based on a proportional mean model, and is therefore more appropriately summarized by the cumulative mean number of events., up to 33 months
