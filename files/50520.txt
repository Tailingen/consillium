Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT)
Subjects must be diagnosed with melanoma. All subjects receive Wide Excision (WEX) of their melanoma. If the melanoma meets study requirements, the subject is randomized to receive either (1) no further surgical procedures as part of the study or (2) a Selective Lymphadenectomy with the possibility of a Complete Lymphadenectomy. Subjects are then followed for 10 years.
Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection|PROCEDURE: Complete Lymph Node Dissection|PROCEDURE: Wide Excision
To determine whether wide excision of the primary with intraoperative lymphatic mapping (LM) followed by selective lymphadenectomy will effectively prolong overall survival compared to wide excision of the primary melanoma alone., 10 years
Disease-free survival; Incidence, timing, and anatomic distribution of distant metastases; Morbidity of procedures; Significance of TA90 levels; Incidence of Sentinel Node Metastases (biopsy) vs clinical metastases (observation); Accuracy of LM, 10 years
