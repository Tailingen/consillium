Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Anti-tumour Activity of Alflutinib in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Alflutinib Mesylate Tablets is a Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor which can efficient suppress the EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation tumor cell in Xenograft mouse model. This study aims at local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with T790M drug-resistant mutation.

This is a Phase I study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of AST2818 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who progressed on prior therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent. The tolerability of AST2818 20 mg/day - 240 mg/day in 14 subjects was observed. 7-days observation period for a single dose and 21-days observation period for multiple doses.
