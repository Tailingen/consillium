Feasibility of Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Human-papilloma Virus-positive Oropharyngeal Cancer Patients on MRIdian Linac
The purpose of this research is to determine whether it is feasible to treat patients with Human Papilloma Virus positive (HPV-positive) oropharyngeal tumors on a specialized treatment machine (MRIdian linear accelerator \[Linac\]), which utilizes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiation planning and delivery.
Oropharynx Cancer
DEVICE: MRIdian Linac
Percent difference between initial reference plan and adaptive weekly RT plan, Weekly adaptive plans will be compared to the initial reference plan and compared using a percent difference equation estimating the actual values of the quantities used as dosimetric constraints for each participant between the initial reference plan and the weekly adaptive plan\[s\]., Up to 6 months|Evaluation of deformable imaging registration, For evaluation of deformable imaging registration, deformed contours will be compared to the physician-segmented contours using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)., Up to 6 months
Treatment times recorded in minutes, We will follow previously-established guidelines by the MR-Linac Consortium Head and Neck Tumor Site for measuring treatment times. Treatment times will be calculated in minutes from the time stamps in the record and verify system. Three timepoints will be recorded: \[1\] setup and plan optimization \[i.e. time between the participant's arrival to the MRidian and delivery of the first beam\]; \[2\] beam delivery \[i.e. the time between delivery of the first and last beam\]; and \[3\] total treatment time., Up to 6 months|Patient-reported Quality of Life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) (EORTC QLQ-C30), Quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). It consists of 30 items to measure multiple aspects that incorporated five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, and six single common items (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The scoring system ranged from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). High scores for functional items and low scores for symptoms represent the good QoL.There are two questions for the overall quality of life rating, and the ranking ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent)., Up to 1 year|Patient-reported Quality of Life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment Head & Neck 43, Quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-H\&N43). The questionnaire used will be for that for head and neck patients, score range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), higher scores indicate lower quality of life., Up to 1 year
