Phase II Study of FTD/TPI (Lonsurf) in Metastatic Breast Cancers With or Without Prior Exposure to Fluoropyrimidines (LONBRECA)
This is a single arm, open-label, lead in phase Ib dose confirmation, followed by phase II study with 2 parallel study cohorts.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cohort A|DRUG: Cohort B
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Primary endpoint is proportion of patients who are PFS at 4 months in Cohort A, 4 months
Overall Response, The death of any patient in the trial from any cause will be recorded and the amount of time from enrollment in the trial until death will be recorded in weeks., 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Proportion of patients who are PFS at 6 months in Cohort B, 6 months|Safety and Efficacy, All adverse events experienced by all patients (in both cohort , RP2D of FTD/TPI in MBC Patients) exposed to Trifluridine/tipiracil will be recorded and graded according to CTCAE version 5., 5 years

Oral FTD/TPI at RP2D will be administered until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal.

2 parallel cohorts of patients will be enrolled : Cohort A : patients with prior exposure to fluoropyrimidines Cohort B : patients without prior exposure to fluoropyrimidines
