Sarcopenia and Systemic Therapy in HCC
This is a multi-center, retrospective observational study in patients with liver cancer (HCC) to assess the impact of sarcopenia (muscle loss) on the prognosis, duration, and tolerance of systemic treatment.
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Prognostic role of Sarcopenia in HCC patient's survival, Evaluation of the prognostic role of sarcopenia in the survival of patients affected by HCC in liver cirrhosis and candidates for systemic treatment. Possible development of a specific classification system for the risk of death., From January 2008 to April 2021
Role of Sarcopenia in HCC systemic therapy tolerability, Evaluation of the role of sarcopenia on the duration and tolerability of systemic treatment in patients affected by HCC in liver cirrhosis., From January 2008 to April 2021
The impact of sarcopenia will be assessed 12 months after the start of chemotherapy. Additionally, other factors affecting prognosis will be investigated to develop a specific predictive model for the risk of death at 12 months. Finally, an external validation of this predictive model for the risk of death will be carried out.
