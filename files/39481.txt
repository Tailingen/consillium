A Study Evaluating Safety and Therapeutic Activity of THOR-707 in Adult Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (THOR-707-101)
Primary Objectives:

* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of THOR-707 as a single agent and as a combination therapy (identify Dose Limiting Toxcitiy (DLTs) in Cohorts A, B, C, D, and G, and adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse event (SAE) profile in Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, F, and G)
* Define the Maximium Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of THOR-707 as a single agent and as a combination therapy (Cohorts A, B, C, D, and G)
* Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of THOR-707 as a single agent by determination of the objective response rate (ORR) defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (Cohort H only)

Secondary Objectives:

* Evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of THOR-707 as a single agent and as a combination therapy by determination of the objective response rate (ORR) defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, F, and G)
* Determine time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of THOR-707 as a single agent and as a combination therapy
* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of THOR-707 monotherapy QW/Q2W (AE/serious adverse event \[SAE\] profile) (Cohort H only).
