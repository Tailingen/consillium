FT538 in Subjects With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
This is a Phase I dose-finding study of FT538 as monotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in combination with monoclonal antibodies in multiple myeloma (MM). The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage where participants will be enrolled into indication-specific cohorts.
