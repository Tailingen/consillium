A Pilot Trial of GI-4000 Plus Bevacizumab and Either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of GI-4000 and see what effects (good and bad) it has against cancer over time. This study is also being done to measure the immune response to GI-4000. Study drug will be given in addition to a standard of care which is a standard therapy given to patients with your type of cancer (colon).
Colon Cancer
DRUG: chemotherapy and GI-4000|DRUG: GI-4000
Number of Participants Alive and Free of Progression at 4 Months (Patients Who Have Undergone Prior Therapy) and 10 Months (Untreated Patients), Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients alive and free of progression at 4 Months (Patients Who Have Undergone Prior Therapy) and 10 Months (Untreated Patients), assessed from first treatment with GI-4000. Progression is defined as CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions; PR (partial response) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions; PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions; or SD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet the above criteria., 4 Months for patients who had undergone prior 1st-line therapy, and 10 months for previously untreated patients
Subject visits will occur 1-4 weeks prior to initiation of GI-4000, then

* In newly diagnosed (Group A) patients, at every FOLFOX/FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab visit, bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then quarterly after completion of therapy
* In patients with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen (Group B), at every bevacizumab and GI-4000 dosing visit, GI-4000 dosing visit and then quarterly after completion of therapy

Group A patients (N=26) will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of first line therapy with bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX (N=13) or FOLFIRI (N=13)

* Subjects will receive 1 40 yeast units (YU) dose of GI-4000 prior to initiation of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, then intercycle doses of GI-4000 will be given 7 days after each cycle while first line therapy is given (up to 8 cycles)
* After completion of first line therapy, subjects will enter the maintenance phase in which bevacizumab and GI-4000 will be given concurrently every 2 weeks for as long as therapy can be tolerated or until progression
* If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the study

Group B patients (N=26) with stable disease who have completed a first line therapy with an oxaliplatin or irinotecan plus fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab containing regimen ) will enter the trial prior to receiving therapy with bevacizumab

* Subjects will receive 40 yeast unit (YU) GI-4000 concurrently with each bevacizumab dose for as long as therapy can be tolerated or until progression
* If a subject discontinues bevacizumab therapy due to intolerance, the subject will continue GI-4000 every 2 weeks until progression, intolerance or withdrawal from the study
