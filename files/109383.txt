Safety, Tolerance, PK, and Anti-tumour Activity of AZD1775 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase Ib study of AZD1775 designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumour activity of AZD1775 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumours.
Ovarian Cancer, TNBC, SCLC, Other Solid Tumours
DRUG: AZD 1775
Number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) as a measure of safety and tolerability., The AZD1775 dose is considered safe and tolerable if ≤ 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT., From first dose of study treatment up to last day of Cycle 1 (21 days)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial tumour response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation as defined by RECIST 1.1, projected 12 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, Every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation as defined by RECIST 1.1, projected 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The time from first documented tumor response until the date of documented progression or death from any cause., Every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation as defined by RECIST 1.1, projected 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from date of first dose of AZD1775 until the date of objective disease progression or death by any cause as defined by RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation as defined by RECIST 1.1, project 12 months.|PK profile: Plasma concentrations of AZD1775 and PK parameters (Cmax, C8hr, tmax, AUC, tlast, t½λz), Blood samples will be collected at various timepoints post-dosing, Pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours post-dose of AZD1775 during Cycle 1-Day 1 and Cycle 1-Day3 or Day-10 of the safety lead-in part of study|QTc prolongation, ECGs will be obtained at various timepoints, ECGs collected pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours post-dose in Cycle 1-Day 1 and on Cycle 1-Day 3 or Day 10.
This study is being conducted in two parts, designated Parts A and B. Part A is a safety lead-in consisting of a cohort of approximately 12 patients with advanced solid tumours.

Part B expansion cohorts will investigate AZD1775 monotherapy in advanced tumour types with molecular biomarkers of interest. The tumour types to be evaluated are: 1) ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation \[PARP-failures\]), 2) ovarian cancer (BRCA wild-type) with more than three prior lines of treatment, 3) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 4) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
