Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program
Effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening relies on early identification and removal of both polypoid and non-polypoid lesions with neoplastic potential. The investigators hypothesize that an intensive training program designed to enhance both recognition and classification of lesions with neoplastic potential, will result in an increase in non-polypoid adenoma detection in addition to and independent of an increase in overall adenoma detection rates.

OTHER: Training session
Measurement of overall adenoma detection rate, Primary outcome measures will include overall and per patient adenoma detection rate for polypoid and non polypoid neoplastic lesions., 1 year
Measurement of total polypectomy rate, Secondary outcomes will include total polypectomy rate (hyperplastic vs. adenoma),, 1 Year|Measurement of colonoscopy time, Total colonoscopy time and endoscopist acceptance. Variables such as patient demographics and prep quality will be adjusted for., 1 Year|Endoscopist Acceptance, Ensdoscopist acceptance rate will be measured. Variables such as patient demographics and prep quality will be adjusted for., 1 Year
Our Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program (EQUIP) was a prospective educational intervention with our staff endoscopist as our study population. The investigators measured adenoma detection rates for a baseline period then randomly assigned half of the endoscopists to undergo EQUIP training. The investigators then examined baseline and post-training study adenoma detection rates (ADR's) for all endoscopist (trained and un-trained) to evaluate the impact of training.
