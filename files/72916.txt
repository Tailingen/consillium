A Study of REC-1245 in Participants With Unresectable, Locally Advanced, or Metastatic Cancer
This is a multi-center, open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary activity of REC-1245 administered orally on a once daily (QD) schedule in participants with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors.

Approximately 85 individuals will be enrolled in this open-label Phase 1/2 study, allocated 55 individuals in Phase 1 and 10-30 individual's in Phase 2. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of REC-1245 for the treatment of participants with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Participants will receive treatment with REC-1245 for up to 2 years.
