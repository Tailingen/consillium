This study is mainly designed to evaluate the tolerability and safety of HG146 capsule in patients with multiple myeloma. Secondly, to get pharmacokinetic data and preliminary efficacy of HG146 capsule in human.

This study adopts the traditional design of "3 + 3" dose escalation. The starting dose is 5 mg and subsequent dose group is respectively for 10, 15 and 20 mg. For each dosing group, subjects are administered orally HG146 every other day for two weeks, followed by one week of rest with 21-day as one treatment cycle. Patients will be treated for 4 cycles or disease progression or unacceptable toxicities, whichever comes first.
