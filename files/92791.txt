Predictive Value of FDG-TEP During Radiotherapy or Chemo-radiotherapy in Patients With NCSC on the One-year Survival
The poor prognosis in the early-stage of lung cancer is due to potential worsening of the disease (local relapse, metastasis), to insufficient efficacy and toxicity of actual treatments.

FDG-PET is a medical imaging modality allowing the quantification of the tumour glucose consumption. Then, this exam is used for pathology staging, target volume definition for RT, and treatment efficiency few months after RT or CRT. Our assumption is that an FDG-PET exam during the course of the RT or CRT might be predictive of the treatment efficiency few months later.

In this study, the investigators propose to perform 4 FDG-PET: first "PET1" before radiotherapy, second "PET2" during the radiotherapy (see RTEP1), third and fourth "PET3" "PET4" 3month and 12 month after the therapy.

The investigators will investigate the performances of FDG-PET performed during the RT or CRT for the prediction of the one-year patient heath outcome. If the predictive value of TEP2 is confirmed, the investigators would be able to optimize the planning treatment during the course of the therapy.
Lung Cancer|NSCLC
PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography
SUV max from FDG PETScan, Measure of FDG-TEP uptake variation (SUV max) to assess predictive value of FDG-TEP during radiotherapy, Baseline - 5 Weeks after begining of radiotherapy- 3 months after end of radiotherapy- 1 year afterwards
Study of several optimized radiotherapy scenary according to the quantification of the tumour glucose consumption during radiotherapy, after the completion enrollment date
