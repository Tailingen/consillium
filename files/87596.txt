Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to Predict Outcomes of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
The purpose of this study is to assess if Six-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (6D-MRI) is effective in predicting outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
PDAC - Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 6D-MRI
Rate of progression-free survival from baseline, Progression-free survival will be determined by tumor activity assessed from radiomic features on imaging., 2 years|Number of participants with R0 resection, The rate of negative tumor resection margins for patient's with resectable cancer that undergo surgery., 2 years|Change in overall health from baseline, as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Scores are summed depending on the patient's age and the presence of certain comorbidities. Lower scores are correlated to higher overall survival rates., Baseline, 2 years|Change in functional status from baseline, as measured by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale of Performance Status, Scores range from 0 to 4, with 0 denoting fully active and 1-4 for varying degrees of disability., Baseline, 2 years
The overarching goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the usefulness of a novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) approach, which measure properties of tumor microenvironment (i.e. vascularity, fibrosis), to predict PDAC response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).
