A Phase 1 Study of BGB-B2033, Alone or in Combination With Tislelizumab, in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 study of BGB-B2033 to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of the BGB-B2033 in participants with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (GC), extragonadal yolk sac tumors, non-dysgerminomas, or glypican-3 (GPC3)-positive squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will also identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-B2033 alone and in combination with tislelizumab for subsequent studies. BGB-B2033 will be administered by intravenous infusion. The Phase 1 study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A (Monotherapy Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion) and Part B (Combination Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion).
