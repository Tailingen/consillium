Phase II Study About Combination CHOP-21, Obinutuzumab and Ibrutinib in Untreated Young High Risk DLBCL Patients.
This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in young patients (18-60 years) with poor-prognosis (aaIPI 2 or 3) newly diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

Aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and the safety of G-CHOP in combination with ibrutinib.

This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in young patients (18-60 years) with poor-prognosis (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, aaIPI, 2 or 3) newly diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

Patient will receive 6 courses of G-CHOP21 (Obimutizumab- cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, and prednisone) followed by 2 doses of Obinutuzumab supplemented with Ibrutinib. Duration of treatment will be 5 months plus 4-5 weeks for response evaluation.

During the study, disease status will be evaluated after the 4th cycle by computed tomography (CT) scan, and after end of treatment by imaging test (18FDG-PET \[positron emission tomography\] and CT scan).

Patients will be recruited over 2 years and followed for a minimum of 2 years after the end of the treatment phase.
