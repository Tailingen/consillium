Exploratory Study of Irinotecan Liposomes in Maintenance Therapy of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS1), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival from first-line treatment initiation (PFS2), overall survival (OS), and safety of irinotecan liposome combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer.
