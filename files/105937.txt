Study With Pazopanib and Weekly Paclitaxel in Penile Carcinoma (PAZOPEN-SOGUG)
Penile cancer is an uncommon disease, with devastating physical and psychological effects on patients. Penile carcinoma even in advanced stages is responsive to several chemotherapeutic agents. However, due to the low incidence of penile cancer, no large studies have been reported concerning chemotherapy.

Various single agents were tested for activity en penile cancer in de 70s and 80s. Response rates ranged from 10 to 27% with cisplatin, 20 to 21% with bleomycin, and 0-62% with methotrexate. These agents in combination were tested in different studies. Other chemotherapy schemes have been studied, as combination of cisplatin with 5 fluorouracil with or without taxol, and cisplatin plus irinotecan. All of them in limited phase II studies, with described higher responses rates in some of them but without results confirmation in phase III studies.

In conclusion, tested regimens so far have not been very successful in advanced stages of the disease.

Antiangiogenic therapy has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of similar cancer types as lung and head and neck, so it can be postulated that antiangiogenic therapy can be effective in the treatment of penile carcinoma. Pazopanib is a new potent oral antiangiogenic therapy.

Cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, when administered at low doses and frequent intervals, may exert antiangiogenic effects, thereby enhancing anticancer activity. Recently, combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel administered in a metronomic schedule (80mg/m2 weekly 3 weeks every 4 weeks cycle) obtained a 40% response rate and an 80% of disease control in the first-line treatment of melanoma patients. Treatment was well tolerated.

As paclitaxel and antiangiogenic drugs seem a very active treatment, combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel seems a good combination to be tested in patients with penile carcinoma.
