Study KBP-2020-CPHG Documenting New Cases of Primary Lung Cancer (PLC) Diagnosed in Respiratory Medicine Departments and Lung Cancer Units at General Hospitals From January 1st to December 31st 2020
Twenty years after KBP-2000-CPHG study and ten years after KBP-2010-CPHG study, the CPHG proposes to conduct a new epidemiological study on primary PLC in order to evaluate and analyze the changes that have occurred over the last decade.

Primary endpoint:

Estimate 1-year- and 5-year-mortality rates in patients with PLC.

Secondary endpoints:

* Describe PLC patient population managed by pulmonologists at French General Hospitals in 2020
* Describe PLC diagnostic and therapeutic management by pulmonologists at French General Hospitals in 2020 and compare them to KBP-2000-CPHG and KBP-2010-CPHG studies
* Estimate prognostic factors
* Compare patient and tumor characteristics to those observed for KBP-2010-CPHG and KBP-2000-CPHG studies
* Compare observed survival rates to those reported for KBP-2000-CPHG and KBP-2010-CPHG studies
