HEALTH4CLL2: A Randomized Waitlist Control Trial of Behavioral Interventions in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
To learn if exercise and weight management can help to improve feelings of fatigue in CLL survivors.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires|OTHER: Fit Bit
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires., Score Scale ranges (0-4)

0-Not at all

1-A little bit

3-Somewhat

4-Quite a bit

5-Very much, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

--Evaluate the impact of an organized, longitudinal, diet and exercise training program on fatigue as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) score in patients with CLL.

Secondary Objectives:

--Assess changes in physical activity, dietary behavior, physical function using the PROMIS physical function questionnaire and performance tests of physical function, body mass index (BMI) and global quality of life. Additionally, we will assess changes in fecal microbiome composition, metabolic parameters including a comprehensive lipid panel, glucose, insulin, TNF alpha, IL6, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, IGF1 and IGFBP1 and immunologic function as assessed by T cell and monocyte phenotypic and functional assays in patients with CLL after participation in the behavioral intervention.

Exploratory Objectives:

-- Identify differences in the metabolic, immunologic and fecal microbiome composition in patients with CLL who have a high CLL comorbidity index score (CLL-CI) compared to patients with CLL and a low CLL-CI score. And, investigate the association of comorbidity score, disease features, CLL-specific prognostic factors and clinical outcomes.
