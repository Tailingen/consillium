Collecting Tumor Samples From Patients With Gynecological Tumors
This laboratory study is collecting tumor tissue and blood samples from patients with gynecologic tumors. Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help in the study of cancer.

OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Collection of gynecological tumor specimens and serum from patients at GOG institutions, Baseline|Create a repository for long-term storage of these specimens, Baseline|Make available tissue and blood for proposed projects, Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect gynecologic tissue and blood from participating Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) institutions.

II. To provide a repository for long-term storage of gynecologic tissue and blood that will be used in studies designed to better understand the molecular biology of gynecologic tumors.

III. To make available, through the GOG Tissue Bank, tissue and blood for proposed projects conducted by GOG and non-GOG investigators.

OUTLINE:

Snap frozen tumor tissue, OCT molds of tumor tissue, formalin-preserved tumor tissue, buffy coat-prepared tumor tissue, and blood samples are collected and stored in the repository. Patient information is kept confidential, and patients are not informed of any research/test results from use of their tissues.
