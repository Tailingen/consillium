A Study of onCARlytics (CF33-CD19) in Combination With Blinatumomab in Adults With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (OASIS)
This is an open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion, multi-center phase I study evaluating the safety and tolerability of CF33-CD19 administered intravenously (IV) or intratumorally (IT) in combination with blinatumomab and with or without hydroxyurea in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Combination Treatment Arms - Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for CF33-CD19 + blinatumomab + hydroxyurea combination as supported by immune response as seen in lymphocyte subsets, Change in lymphocyte subset expression in tumor tissue and peripheral blood pre and post dose, From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|Combination Treatment Arms - Determination of RP2D for CF33-CD19 + blinatumomab + hydroxyurea combination as supported by immune response as seen in cytokines, Change in cytokine levels in peripheral blood pre and post dose, From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|Combination Treatment Arms - Determination of RP2D for CF33-CD19 + blinatumomab + hydroxyurea combination as supported by anti-tumor activity, Stable Disease and Response (PR and CR) based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST v1.0., From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|All Treatment Arms - Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects in the efficacy population who achieve a radiographic Investigator-assessed confirmed CR or PR, per RECIST v1.1 or confirmed iCR or iPR per iRECIST v1.0., From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|All Treatment Arms - Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from first dose of study drug to first documentation of PD based on RECIST 1.1, or to death from any cause., From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|All Treatment Arms - Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DoR) measured as the time from the date a response of PR/iPR or better was first recorded to the date on which progressive disease was first noted or the date of death due to any cause., From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months|All Treatment Arms - Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR), measured as the proportion of subjects who achieve an Investigator-assessed confirmed CR/iCR, PR/iPR, or Stable Disease (SD)/immune SD (iSD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST v1.0., From first dose of study drug through treatment discontinuation, an average of 6 months
CF33-CD19, a novel chimeric orthopoxvirus, will be administered as a monotherapy or in combination with blinatumomab and with or without hydroxyurea to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimens as well as immunological changes in the tumour microenvironment.

Subjects eligible for treatment include those with any metastatic or advanced solid tumor who have documented radiological progression per RECIST following at least two prior lines of therapy.

All enrolled monotherapy subjects will be treated with CF33-CD19 on Day 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle thereafter. Subjects treated with the combination regimen will receive CF33-CD19 on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In addition, they will receive blinatumomab as a 7-day continuous infusion from Days 2-9 and Days 16-23 of each cycle.
