Analysis of Therapy Sequence in Women With HR+, HER2 - mBC in Moscow: A Multicenter Retrospective Observational Study.
A assessment of the efficacy of first-/second-line endocrine therapies Â± target therapies and chemotherapy in real-life of in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer has not yet been conducted in Moscow.

Methods: Observational, retrospective study carried out in oncology hospitals in Moscow, in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The descriptive analysis will be conducted for patient characteristics, responses to treatment and treatment outcomes.

This study will provide retrospective chart review of evidence on the use of therapy in routine clinical practice, with a focus in population of Moscow
Breast Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Alpelisib
To describe treatment sequences of all lines of therapy received by HER2 + mBC patients in Moscow, The proportion of each type of treatment received for all lines of therapy in the metastatic setting will be determined., 12 months
Proportion of patients among study population who have with symptomatic visceral metastasis, Proportion of patients among study population who have with symptomatic visceral metastasis, 12 months|Proportion of patients among study population who have treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Proportion of patients among study population who have treatment-emergent Adverse Events, 12 months|Proportion of premenopausal women among study population, Proportion of premenopausal women among study population, 12 months|percentage of obtaining tumor specimens and reevaluating targeted markers in breast cancer patients who relapsed after curative treatment, percentage of obtaining tumor specimens and reevaluating targeted markers in breast cancer patients who relapsed after curative treatment, 12 months|Proportion of patients among study population who have visceral metastasis, Proportion of patients among study population who have visceral metastasis, 12 months|Evaluation of the outcome per treatment line, To evaluate the outcome of patients per treatment line (objective response, progression free survival, time to disease progression per line of therapy), overall survival, 12 months
The combination CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) (Palbociclib, Ribociclib and Abemaciclib) with endocrine therapy (ET, i.e. aro- matase inhibitors (AI) or Fulvestrant) has significantly increased objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of first- and second-line treatments in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative (luminal) mBC. Now this combination is the standard treatment for luminal mBC. Recommendation for endocrine therapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of luminal mBC is endorsed by the main international guidelines such as ASCO and ESO-ESMO guidelines. Endocrine therapy should be used as initial treatment except in cases of immediately life-threatening disease, tumors refractory to endocrine therapy, visceral crisis, or rapid progressive disease that mandate a high response rate treatment. The aim of this study is to provide real-life treatment patterns data for luminal MBC with a focus in population of Moscow
