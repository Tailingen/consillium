A Phase II Study of Dexamethasone, Azacitidine, Pegaspargase and Tislelizumab Plus Radiotherapy for Patients With Stage I/II Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if the regimen of dexamethasone, azacitidine, pegaspargase and tislelizumab (DAPT regimen) combined with radiotherapy works to treat stage I or II NK/T cell lymphoma in adults. It will also learn about the safety of the DAPT regimen. The main questions it aims to answer are:

What are the efficacy of the DAPT regimen plus radiotherapy in participants with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma? What medical problems do participants have when taking the DAPT regimen?

Participants will:

Receive the DAPT regimen every 21 days for 6 cycles and radiotherapy Visit the clinic according to clinical trial requirement for checkups and tests Receive blood tests and radiological imaging tests according to the clinical trial requirement
NK/T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: DAPT regimen plus radiotherapy
Complete response rate, Complete response rate is assessed according to the 2014 Lugano criteria for response assessment of lymphoma., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks
Objective response rate, Objective response rate is assessed according to the 2014 Lugano criteria for response assessment of lymphoma, including complete response and partial response., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|2-year progression-free survival rate, Progression-free survival (PFS) is measured from the time of start of treatment to the time of first progression, relapse after response, death from any cause, or the date of last follow-up. 2-year PFS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From enrollment to 2 years after the end of treatment|2-year overall survival rate, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the time of death from any cause or the date of last follow-up. The 2-year OS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From enrollment to 2 years after the end of treatment|Adverse events, All adverse events will be recorded and graded according to CTCAE 5.0, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 1 month
Exploratory biomarker analyses, Patients' tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected and analyzed to explore predictive biomarkers for treatment response and prognosis., From enrollment to 2 years after the end of treatment
