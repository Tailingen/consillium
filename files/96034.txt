Effect of Enteral Immunonutrition on Immune, Inflammatory Markers and Nutritional Status in Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
Enteral immunonutrition (EIN) has been gaining increasing attention, but data of its immune and anti-inflammatory function in patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer are poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of EIN on immune function, inflammation response and nutrition status when compared to standard enteral nutrition (SEN).

The investigators believe that the proportion of cluster of differentiation 4 T-cells(CD4＋T-cells), cluster of differentiation 3 T-cells(CD3＋T-cells) and the counts of CD4＋ / cluster of differentiation 8 T-cells (CD8＋), immunoglobulin G(IgG), immunoglobulin M(IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were larger in EIN group, while the level of WBC, CRP and TNF-α were lower and nutritional status was similar.
