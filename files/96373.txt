Combination Study of Prexasertib and Olaparib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment for Advanced Solid Tumors.

The study interventions involved in this study are:

* LY2606368
* Olaparib
Solid Tumor

This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY2606368 as a treatment for any disease.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib for ovarian cancer but it has not been approved for other uses.

LY2606368 is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by preventing the cancer cells from being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of a cell) which then leads to cell death.

Olaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is a protein in the body that repairs damage to DNA. In cells that are rapidly growing such as cancer cells, blocking repair of DNA may be of benefit, since it will cause the cell to die.

In this research study, the investigators are combining LY2606368 with Olaparib in the hopes that it will be a safe combination and that the LY2606368 will enhance how the cancer will respond to Olaparib. In previous laboratory studies performed by treating cancer cells with a CHK1 inhibitor and a PARP inhibitor, it was found that the CHK1 inhibitor was successful in increasing efficacy.
