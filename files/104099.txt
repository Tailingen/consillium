Magnesium and Dexmedetomidine in Pheochromocytoma
Anesthesia management of pheochromocytoma excision surgery is associated with severe hemodynamic fluctuations.The objective of this study was to compare the hypertensive episodes requiring sodium nitroprusside administration between the group treated with magnesium-dexmedetomidine and conventional group in pheochromocytoma.
