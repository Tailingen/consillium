Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Biliary Tract or Gallbladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have unresectable or metastatic biliary tract or gallbladder cancer.
Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer|Gallbladder Cancer|Liver Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: leucovorin calcium
survival at 6 months, at 6 months
overall survival, Up to 5 years|tumor response rate, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the 6-month survival and overall survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma or gallbladder cancer treated with gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the tumor response in these patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
