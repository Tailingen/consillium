Ribociclib-endocrine Combination Therapy Versus Chemotherapy as 1st Line in Visceral mBC
The aim of this trial is to assess if patients treated with the combination of ribociclib and endocrine therapy respond to treatment as fast as patients treated with chemotherapy only, without decreasing their quality of life (QoL).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ribociclib|OTHER: Mono-chemotherapy|OTHER: Endocrine-Therapy
Quality of life-adjusted early disease control, A patient will be counted as a success for this endpoint when during the first 12 weeks

- the response according to RECIST v1.1 is stable disease or better., at 12 weeks.|Quality of life-adjusted early disease control, A patient will be counted as a success for this endpoint when during the first 12 weeks

- the QoL according Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Trial Outcome Index \[FACT-B TOI\] score does not worsen by 5 points or more., at 12 weeks.
Disease Control (DC) at 12 weeks, A patient will be counted as a success for this endpoint when during the first 12 weeks the response according to RECIST v1.1 is stable disease or better. Patients with missing response assessments within the first 12 weeks will be counted as failure unless there was no progressive disease (PD) documented within the first 12 weeks and the first subsequent assessment also shows no PD, week 6, 12.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during trial treatment. Response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., week 6, 12, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years or end of trial treatment.|Time to objective response (OR), Time to OR will be calculated from randomization until first documented CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. Time to OR will be calculated for patients having achieved a CR or PR at any time during trial treatment., week 6, 12, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years or end of trial treatment.|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until progression according the RECIST v1.1 criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients not having an event at the time of analysis as well as patients starting a new anti-cancer therapy in the absence of an event will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment before starting a new anti-cancer treatment, if any., week 6, 12, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years.|Time to treatment failure (TTF), TTF is defined as the time from randomization until stopping of trial treatment from any cause. Patients not having an event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last known date of trial treatment., week 6, 12, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years.|Overall survival (OS) at 3 years, OS at 3 years is determined by the Kaplan-Meier estimator for OS at 3 years. OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive., week 6, 12, then every 12 weeks up to 3 years.|Changes in overall QoL (FACT-B) until 24 months, Changes in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) total score (score range 0-148, higher scores indicate better quality of life), Changes from baseline to 24 months|Time to QoL deterioration, Time to QoL deterioration is defined as the duration between baseline and first occurrence of a decrease of ≥ 5 points in the FACT-TOI score., From baseline to 24 months|Time to QoL improvement, Time to QoL improvement is defined as the duration between baseline and first occurrence of an increase of ≥ 5 points in the FACT-TOI score., From baseline to 24 months|Time to pain improvement, Improvements in pain will be assessed up to 24 months by the item pain severity of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), scale range: 0= no pain to 10 = pain as bad as one can imagine., From baseline to 24 months|Adverse events (AEs), All AEs will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v5.0., every 4 weeks up to 3 years.
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women and the leading cause of cancer mortality in most countries in Europe. Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease with a median overall survival (OS) of 2-4 years and a 5-year survival of only 25%. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer involving visceral disease at diagnosis have an even worse outcome.

Many oncologists still prefer to treat visceral disease primarily with chemotherapy rather than with endocrine treatment, thinking to receive a faster response with chemotherapy than with endocrine therapy, especially in patients with clinical symptoms or potentially threatening lesions. However, results from cross-sectional clinical practice studies suggest that endocrine therapy is associated with better quality of life, fewer concerns about side effects, less activity impairment and higher treatment satisfaction compared to chemotherapy. In addition, with the new data of CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine treatment there is an even better efficacy data available compared to endocrine therapy alone.

The aim of this trial is to assess if patients treated with the combination of ribociclib and endocrine therapy respond to treatment as fast as patients treated with chemotherapy only, without decreasing their quality of life (QoL).
