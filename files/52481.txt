Pembrolizumab and Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for the Treatment of Mucosal Melanoma
This is an open-label, single center, one cohort, non-randomized, phase II study. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) and pembrolizumab on local tumor control in mucosal melanoma patients. Treatment effect will be compared with historical radiation therapy-alone control data.
Mucosal Melanoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiation therapy
Local tumor control rate, 1 year after completion of treatment (estimated to be 2 years)
Number of treatment-related grade 3 or greater adverse events, Baseline through 30 days after end of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Number of treatment discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events, Through end of treatment (estimated to be 1 year)|Relapse-free survival (RFS), -Defined as the duration of time from the start date of study treatment to the date of earliest disease relapse or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither relapse nor die by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up date., At 3 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)|Distant metastasis-free survival, -Defined as the duration of time from the start date of study treatment to the date of appearance of a distant metastasis or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither develop distant metastasis nor die by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up date., At 3 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)|Overall survival, -Defined as the duration of time from the start date of study treatment to death from any cause. Patients who are alive by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up date., At 3 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)
