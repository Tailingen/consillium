A Trial of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in Combination With Hypofraction Radiotherapy in Patients With NSCLC
This is a phase II clinical trial of SHR-1210 （an anti-PD-1 Inhibitor） simultaneously combined with hypofraction radiotherapy in patients with previously treated oligometastatic NSCLC.

It is a single center, single arm, open label trial. Subjects with oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer who is previously treated will be recruited. 12 subjects will be enrolled at the first part of the study which aims to evaluate the tolerability of SHR-1210 in combination with hypofraction radiotherapy. 30 subjects will be enrolled at the second part of the study which aims to evaluate the primary efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in combination with hypofraction radiotherapy.
