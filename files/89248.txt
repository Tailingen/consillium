Cognitive Trance, Hypnosis and Meditation in Oncology
Patients with cancer often suffer from a symptom cluster, including pain, fatigue, sleep difficulties, emotional distress and cognitive impairments. In oncology settings, there is a growing interest in "mind-body" intervention, to relieve them in a non-pharmacological way. Hypnosis and meditation are two modified state of consciousness shown to positively this symptom cluster. Cognitive trance is also a modified state of consciousness, but is induced by body movements and/or vocalizations. Subjective reports of experts in cognitive trance showed a modification of self, emotion regulation, pain perception, attention and concentration. However, we still need to develop studies to better characterise this particular state of consciousness and its clinical applications. Our randomized-controlled trial aims at comparing both interventions in terms of (1) benefits on cancer patients' quality of life (pain, fatigue, sleep, distress, cognitive impairments), (2) phenomenological/subjective experiences and neurophysiological correlates, and (3) mechanisms involved in patients' responsiveness, based on the biopsychosocial model of hypnosis.
