Early Switch Maintenance vs Delayed Second-line Nivolumab in Advanced Stage Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients (EDEN Trial)
The study's hypothesis is that using Nivolumab as early switch maintenance, after 4-6 cycles of standard first-line chemotherapy, might improve survival in patients with advanced stage squamous NSCLC.

DRUG: Nivolumab 10 MG/ML Intravenous Solution|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to death date. Please note: a subject who has not died will be censored at the last known date alive., From date of randomization until the date of death by any cause or study discontinuation due to lost to follow up/withdrawal of consent assessed up to 14 months .
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Please note: clinical deterioration not radiologically confirmed is not considered progression for the purpose of this measure. Subjects who did not have any study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date they were randomized. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation od the subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From date of randomization until the date of the first documented tumor progression or death by any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 6 months in the arm B and 10 months in arm A.|Progression-Free Survival from induction (PFSind), Time from first chemotherapy cycle until documented tumor progression or death by any cause., From date of first chemotherapy cycle until the date of the first documented tumor progression or death for any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 10 months in the arm B and 14 months in arm A.|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), Time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patients preference, Investigator's decision or death., From date of randomization until the date of treatment discontinuation, assessed up to 9 months in the arm B and 14 months in arm A.|Overall Survival from Induction (OSind), Time from first chemotherapy cycle until death by any cause, From date of first chemotherapy cycle until the date of death, assessed assessed up to 14 months in the arm B and 18 months in arm A..
