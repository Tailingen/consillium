Conversion Surgery After Target Therapy or Immunotherapy in Stage IV Gastric Cancer
In this retrospective study, investigators conducted a comprehensive investigation of the factors influencing postoperative prognosis in patients with stage IV gastric cancer undergoing conversion surgery. Specifically, investigators examined the impact of targeted therapy or immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with preoperative chemotherapy on (1) prognostic differences based on initial progression (invading adjacent organs) and metastatic site (peritoneum, distant lymph node \[LN\]) at the time of stage IV gastric cancer diagnosis and (2) conversion surgery outcomes and pathological complete response (pCR).
Gastric Cancer Stage IV

overall survival and disease free survival, from date of surgery until the date of first documented cancer recurrence or date of death from cancer progression, whichever came first, assessed up to 160 months
