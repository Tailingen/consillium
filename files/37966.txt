Multicenter Trial to Treat Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a multicenter study to assess the anti-tumour activity,to investigate the safety profile and to obtain additional pharmacokinetic information for Aplidin® given as 1-hour weekly IV infusion in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
DRUG: Aplidin®
Objective Response Rate, The primary objective of the study was the exploration of the efficacy of plitidepsin when given as a weekly 1-hour infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 in 4-week cycles to patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the Objective Response Rate, defined as the combined rate of Complete Response (CR), Unconfirmed Complete Response (CRu) and Partial Response (PR) following the definition of response according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first
Time to Response Onset, Time to response onset was defined as the time from the first day of plitidepsin treatment to the first documentation of response., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR, CRu or PR) to disease progression or death. Patients who had not progressed or died were to have their duration censored at the date of their last disease assessment., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) was to be calculated from the first day of plitidepsin treatment to the date of disease progression., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first|Time to Subsequent Chemotherapy, Time to subsequent therapy was to be calculated from the first infusion of the study drug to the start date of the subsequent therapy. Patients without subsequent therapy were to be censored at their last reported date., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was to be calculated from the date of registration to the date of first objective disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were lost to follow-up without documentation of progression were to be censored at the last date they were assessed and found progression-free.

A patient receiving a new treatment in the absence of documented progression was to be considered as progressing at the time of re-treatment., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was to be calculated from the date of registration to the date of death from any cause. Patients with no documented death were to be censored at the last date they were known to be alive., All patients were followed up to progressive disease, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, death or one year after the last treatment visit of the last patient, whichever occured first
A Phase II Multicenter,Open-Label, Clinical And Pharmacokinetic Study Of Aplidin® As A 1-Hour Weekly IV Infusion, In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Primary

• To assess the anti-tumour activity of Aplidin® given as a 1-hour weekly IV infusion, in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, relapsing or refractory to a prior therapy.

Secondary

* To further investigate the safety profile of Aplidin® given as 1-hour weekly IV infusion in this patient population.
* To obtain additional pharmacokinetic information for Aplidin® given as 1-hour weekly IV infusion in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
