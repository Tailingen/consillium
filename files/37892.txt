Application of Proteome Profiler Antibody Arrays to Find Angiogenetic Predictors in Glioma Paitents.
Bevacizumab has become the standard of care of recurrent glioblastoma based on promising clinical trial results with with response rates up to 50% and progression-free survival up to 9 months. In our study, we set to find the serum angiogenesis biomarkers of bevacizumab response.
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Angiogenesis
RADIATION: Chemoradiation with temozolomide
Response of bevacizumab therapy., Base on the image after bevacizumab therapy (after recurrence), 3 months after bevacizumab therapy
Pre-chemoradiation and post-chemoradiation peripheral blood will be obtained to see if there are some angiogenesis biomarker available for prediction of bevacizumab response later.
