Study of TST005 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open label Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) study of TST005, a bi-specific antibody consisting of a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) trap in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic cancers
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancers|Metastatic Human Papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: TST005
Part A - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D), As measured by the number of participants experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in each dosing cohort, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Patient safety as characterized by frequency and severity of adverse events, Characterize the safety profile of TST005 including the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events., Up to 90 days following last dose
Part A - Area under Plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) for TST005, Observe changes in AUC over time, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part A - Peak Plasma concentration (Cmax) for TST005, Observe the maximum serum concentration, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part A - Time to maximum observed serum (Tmax) for TST005, Tmax is the time in hours / days for TST005 to reach the maximum concentration after administration, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part A - Terminal half-life of TST005, Time for serum level to decrease by 1/2 during the terminal elimination phase, Up to 90 days following last dose|Immunogenicity of TST005, To determine if the formation of Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) or neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against TST005 are observed, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Objective response rate (ORR) of TST005, as measured by RECIST v 1.1 and iRECIST, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Disease Control rate (DCR) of TST005, Percentage of patients that exhibit stable disease (SD), + partial response (PR), + complete response (CR), Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Duration of Response of TST005, Measured by the time a patient shows response, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Time to Response (TTR) of TST005, Measured by the average time patients show a response to TST005, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Progression -free Survival (PFS) of TST005, Measured by the average time before patients show signs of disease progression after receiving TST005, Up to 90 days following last dose|Part B - Assess the Overall Survival (OS) of TST005, Time between treatment of TST005 and death for any reason, Up to 90 days following last dose
The study has 2 parts. Part A is a dose escalation portion where the patients will be doses every three weeks following an accelerated 3+3 design. This portion will enroll approximately 25 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers.

Part B is an expansion portion where approximately 30 additional patients will be dosed at the recommended dose level every 3 weeks. This part will include patients with locally advanced or metastatic HPV related malignancies.

The trial will last approximately 2 years, with assessments including safety labs, ECGs, PKs and PDs and CT/MRI tumor assessments, based on the Q3W dosing schedule.
