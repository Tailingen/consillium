Study of Enzalutamide in Patients With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
This research study is evaluating a drug called enzalutamide in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide is already FDA approved for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer after treatment with chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study is to analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy and at disease progression to determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment with Enzalutamide.

Prior chemotherapy is not a requirement of this trial.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Enzalutamide
Number of Patients With Gene Alterations, Serial biopsies was performed at pre-study and progression to analyze mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide, such as alterations in AR (mutations, amplifications), tumor suppression genes, DNA repair genes, and SPOP. Whole exome sequencing was performed on tumor tissue biopsies., Tumor biopsies were performed at pre-study and progression. Progression occurred up to 41 months after initiation of enzalutamide.
Changes in Serum Androgen Concentrations Between Baseline and Subsequent Assessment Visits, Serum testosterone were be collected at pre-study (C1D1) and every cycle and changes over time from baseline were planned to be summarized descriptively., Not collected.|Number of Participants With a PSA Response, PSA response is defined per PCWG2 criteria (PSA decline \>=50% relative to cycle 1 PSA) and is summarized as frequency and percent., PSA was measured at pre-treatment, each C1D1 (1 cycle=28 days), end of treatment, and follow-up visits (every 6 months). PSA were measured up to 52 months.|Duration of PSA Response, Duration of PSA response is defined as time from the first achievement of PSA response (PSA decline \>=50% from cycle 1) to the date of PSA progression or death, whichever occurs first., PSA was measured at pre-treatment, each C1D1 (1 cycle=28 days), end of treatment, and follow-up visits (every 6 months). PSA were measured up to 52 months.|Response of Measurable Disease at Baseline, Objective responses for measurable disease was evaluated using RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Response was tabulated with frequency., Imaging was performed at pre-study and every 12 weeks on treatment. Treatment cycles is 28 days. Patients were assessed up to 41 months.|Duration of Response of Measurable Disease, Duration of response of measurable disease is defined as time from the date of first objective response (PR/CR) to date of progression or death, whichever comes first.

Objective response is per RECIST 1.1 criteria:

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Imaging was performed at pre-study and every 12 weeks on treatment. Treatment cycles is 28 days. Patients were assessed up to 41 months.|Toxicity Measurements, For safety and tolerability, treatment-related grade 3 or higher toxicities was assessed using CTCAE v. 4.0 and was provided using frequency., Toxicity was reported at pre-study, every cycle, and end of treatment visit. Patients reported toxicities up to 39 months.|Number of Participants With PSA Response Stratified by Gene Alterations in Serial Tumor Biopsies, Serial biopsies was performed at pre-study and progression to analyze mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide, such as alterations in AR (mutations, amplifications), DNA repair genes, and SPOP. Whole exome sequencing was performed on tumor tissue biopsies. Gene alterations were tabulated with PSA response., Tumor biopsies will be performed at pre-treatment and end of treatment visit. Treatment cycle is 28 days. PSA was collected up to 52 months.|Subsequent Lines of Therapy, Subsequent lines of therapy following study drug discontinuation was summarized descriptively., Subsequent treatments were followed up to 31 months after discontinuation of study drug.
After the screening procedures confirm that the patient is able to participate in the study,

* The patient will have the first of two required prostate biopsies prior to starting study treatment.
* The patient will be given a prescription for study drug and a study drug-dosing diary for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the patient will be taking the study drug once daily. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study drug. The study drug (enzalutamide) should be taken orally (by mouth) at home.

On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 4 days), the following procedures will be performed in clinic:

* A medical history.
* A Physical examination
* Performance status
* Blood tests (2-3 tablespoons).
* The patient will be asked about medications they are currently taking, including over-the counter medications, herbal remedies, vitamins, and supplements.
* The patient will be asked about any disease-related symptoms they are experiencing.
* The patient will receive a new supply and the medication diary will be reviewed.

Every 12 weeks (+/-1 week) the following procedures will be performed in clinic:

* Blood tests. A small sample of the patient's blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be collected. This blood will be collected for specialized laboratory tests.
* A (CT) scan of the patient's chest and a CT or MRI scan of abdomen, and pelvis and a bone scan will be performed every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) while the patient is on active treatment. If your baseline CT of the patient's chest does not show disease, the investigator may not asked for this to be repeated.

End of Study Visit in clinic:

* A medical history.
* A physical examination
* Performance status
* Blood tests (2-3 tablespoons)
* The patient will be asked about any disease-related symptoms If the patient completed at least 4 cycles of enzalutamide, the patient will undergo a second of two required biopsies.
