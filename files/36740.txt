A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of SYS6020 CAR T-cells in Patients With Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
This study is a single-arm, open, 2-stage (dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase), multi-center, phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerance of SYS6020 injection in the participants with refractory systemic myasthenia gravis, and determine the recommended dose (RD) for subsequent studies of the product, and to preliminarily evaluate the clinical efficacy of the product, as well as to explore the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of the product in vivo.

The dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase include 7 periods, and they are respectively in sequence as follows: the screening period, apheresis period, pre-dosing assessment, SYS6020 injection infusion, DLT observation period, the primary follow-up period (6 months), and the long-term follow-up period (5 years). The DLT observation period is 28 days after receiving SYS6020 injection. The participants will not undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

The efficacy and safety profile of the participants will be continuously assessed during the trial. Efficacy measurement includes the MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, MG-QoL 15R scale, MGFA clinical classification, and MGFA post-intervention state (MGFA PIS) grading scales, as well as self-antibodies, etc. Safety measurement includes vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, cytokines, and ECG, etc. The adverse events and concomitant therapy will be continuously collected during the trial. In addition, during the study period, blood samples will be collected from participants who have received SYS6020 treatment for PK/PD test, and immunogenicity test.

For the dose-escalation phase, 3 to 5 dose levels are proposed to be explored. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will discuss the safety data and make a decision if the next SYS6020 injection could be initiated or dose-escalation could be initiated. After the completion of the dose-escalation phase, the recommended doses would be determined for dose-expansion phase. For the dose-expansion phase, further safety and efficacy data will be collected among the participants who will receive the recommended dose of SYS6020 injection.
Myasthenia Gravis
BIOLOGICAL: SYS6020 injection
The frequency and the grade of DLT and the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. (For the dose-escalation phase), For the dose-escalation phase, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety of SYS6020, as measured by the frequency and nature of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the incidence of all adverse events and serious adverse events. DLT is defined as any adverse event related to SYS6020 that occurs within 28 days after the infusion of SYS6020 and that meets certain criteria., 12 months|Response rate at 12 months after dosing （For the dose-expansion phase), Response rate is defined as:

1. The score of Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Scale (MG-ADL) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (QMG) is decreased by ≥2 points from baseline to 12 months after dosing; or
2. The score of Myasthenia Gravis Composite Scale (MGC) is decreased by ≥3 points from baseline to 12 months after dosing; or
3. The concentration of specific autoantibodies (i.e., AChR-Ab or MuSK-Ab) is decreased by ≥50% from baseline to 12 months after dosing., 12months
