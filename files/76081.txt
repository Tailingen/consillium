Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy Study of ALS-357 in Patients With Cutaneous Metastatic Melanoma
A phase I trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALS-357 when administered for four weeks as a topical ointment, in escalating doses, to patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma and to evaluate the effect of escalating doses of topically applied ALS-357 on histological remission of cutaneous metastatic melanoma and induction of apoptotic biomarkers.
