A Translational Systems Medicine Approach to Provide Predictive Capacity for Therapy Response in Advanced or Metastatic Malignant Melanoma
This is an exploratory prospective translational multicentre study. Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer diagnosed in Ireland and its incidence among women and men is above the European average.

Following treatment the elimination of cancer cells ultimately occurs by the activation of apoptotic cell death pathways. The SYS-ACT approach builds on a combination of mathematical systems of modelling, quantitative biochemistry and cell biology, and specifically predicts the drug responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to various apoptosis-inducing treatments.

The investigators propose to validate the SYS-ACT approach and application in a translational systems medicine study.
