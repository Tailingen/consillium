Immune Therapy of HPV-induced Cancers
Patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cancers will receive the peptide P16_37-63 in combination with MontanideÂ® ISA-51 VG so that an immune response directed against the tumor cells can be induced. The aim is to show that vaccination with P16_37-63 is safe and can induce or enhance immune responses against p16INK4a.
HPV-induced Cancers
BIOLOGICAL: P16_37-63
Immune response, Immune response against peptide P16_37-63. A positive immune response is defined as positive DTH response against peptide P16_37-63 or a humoral (ELISA for the detection of p16-specific IgG/IgM/IgA) and/or CD8 and/or CD4 cellular (IFN gamma ELISpot for the detection of p16INK4a-specific T cells) immune response exceeding the assay specific cut-off values for a positive response against peptide P16_37-63., every 2 weeks
Tumor response, assessed by CT or MRI scans according to RECIST, every 8 weeks|safety, number and severity of adverse events categorized according to CTC criteria version 4.0, up to 8 months
The present study is initiated to evaluate vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer. Specifically, the present study aims at the following questions:

* Evaluation of potential toxicity of the vaccination with P16_37-63 -peptide
* Evaluation of the immune response in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer before vaccination and after vaccination with P16_37-63.

In this context, the present study shall demonstrate whether application of P16_37-63 in a vaccination approach is associated with the induction of peptide-related toxicity. Hence, the study marks the first step towards the application of P16_37-63 in humans, as it provides information on the safety of P16_37-63 as vaccination agent for the first time. Moreover, the study shall provide initial information, whether vaccination with P16_37-63 can induce p16INK4a -specific immune responses in patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer. Thus, it shall provide information, whether P16_37-63 has the potential to elicit peptide-specific immune responses and therefore represent a suitable target for the induction of tumor antigen-specific immune responses in this population.

The present study marks an important milestone towards a potential application of P16_37-63 as therapeutic agent in the management of patients with advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head and neck cancer. Long-term goal of this approach is to develop novel tools for the palliative and/or adjuvant therapy of patients with advanced advanced HPV- and p16INK4a -positive tumors.
