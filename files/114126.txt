PBI-MST-01 (NCT04541108) Substudy AZN-05: Intratumoral Microdosing of Rilvegostomig, Volrustomig, Sabestomig, and AZD9592 in HNSCC
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 0 substudy designed to evaluate the localized pharmacodynamics (PD) of rilvegostomig, volrustomig, sabestomig, and AZD9592 within the tumor microenvironment (TME) when administered intratumorally in microdose quantities via the CIVO device in patients presenting with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) with a surface accessible lesion, who are scheduled for tumor and/or regional node dissection as part of their standard treatment. PD effects due to injected investigational agents, either as single agents or as AZD9592 drug combinations with the evaluated biologics, will be compared to those elicited by pembrolizumab alone, which will also be injected in microdose quantities via the CIVO device.

Evaluation of signature scores using Gene Set Variability Analysis within regions injected with microdoses of rilvegostomig, volrustomig, sabestomig, AZD9592, or pembrolizumab as single agents or as AZD9592 drug combinations with the evaluated biologics, The localized activity of injected microdoses will be analyzed using the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) and the GeoMx Cancer Transcriptome Atlas to comprehensively profile over 1800 genes simultaneously with spatial resolution to describe tumor biology, the TME, and the immune response signatures of each drug at an injection site. DSP outcomes may be validated via IHC, immunofluorescence, or ISH technique., 1 to 3 days after microdose injection
Incidence of reported Adverse Events and/or Adverse Device Effects [Safety and Tolerability], Safety of the microdose injection procedure and injected content will be assessed by quantification of the frequency, intensity, and relatedness of all reported Adverse Events and/or Adverse Device Effects., Up to 28 days after microdose injection
Evaluation of tumor whole exome sequencing (WES)/whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), Tumor WES/WTS will be performed to help develop a comprehensive understanding of the observed PD responses of the tumor samples to the injected microdoses of the study drugs. Tumor WES/WTS (with matched blood circulating tumor DNA as control) will collect information on the tumor and TME background to provide critical tumor- and immune-related information such as, but not limited to, T-cell and B-cell repertoire, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, and immunogenomic changes/immune profiling of the TME., Sample collected at screening
The CIVO Microdose Injection Device (MID) simultaneously delivers multiple drugs and drug combinations (Up to 8), each in microdose amounts, into a single patient tumor and enables comparisons of the resulting biomarker responses that occurred while that tumor was still in the native microenvironment. AstraZeneca is developing three novel assets: rilvegostomig, volrustomig, and sabestomig, all of which are bispecific monoclonal antibodies designed to stimulate antitumor immunity. In this Phase 0 clinical trial, the PD effects of these investigational assets in the TME of patients presenting with HNSCC will be evaluated. These investigational assets will be injected alone in microdose quantities at tumor sites in HNSCC patients. Pembrolizumab, also used therapeutically in this patient population, will be included in the CIVO injection array administered as a single agent. In addition, microdoses of AZD9592, a novel antibody drug conjugate (ADC), alone or in combinations with the evaluated biologics will also be assessed. The CIVO-injected portion of the tissue will be analyzed for localized response at sites of drug exposure in the TME.
