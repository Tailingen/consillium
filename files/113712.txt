Serum Free Fatty Acid Metabolite Biomarkers of Lung Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the performance of serum free fatty acids as biomarkers for the identification of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer|Biomarkers|Fatty Acids
OTHER: serum sample
Compare Concentration of Fatty Acids and Their Metabolites, Biochemical analysis of serum sample was conducted by an investigator who was strictly blinded to cancer status and patient characteristics., At the time of diagnosis, prior to the initiation of lung cancer treatment
We will compare the concentration of free fatty acids and their metabolites between patients with lung cancer and control pulmonary patients without known cancer. The diagnostic accuracy will be assessed for potential predictors.
