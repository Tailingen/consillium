Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Docetaxel/Paclitaxel
Overall Survival, ("Date of death from any cause" - "Date of randomization" + 1) / 30.4375. For subjects lost to follow-up and subjects who are alive at the time of data cutoff date, data will be censored at the time the subject was last confirmed to be alive.
Progression-free Survival, Please refer to the protocol, overall response and best overall response will be determined solely by imaging assessment according to the RECIST Guideline Version 1.1, and will not take into account any clinical/symptomatic progression. Evaluable imaging data will be overall response without an overall response of "Not Evaluable (NE).", ("Earlier date on which either the overall response was assessed as PD or the subject died of any cause" - "Date of randomization" + 1) / 30.4375.|Duration of Response, Please refer to the protocol, overall response and best overall response will be determined solely by imaging assessment according to the RECIST Guideline Version 1.1, and will not take into account any clinical/symptomatic progression. Evaluable imaging data will be overall response without an overall response of "Not Evaluable (NE).", ("Earlier date on which either the overall response was assessed as PD for the first time after confirmed response or the subject died of any cause" - "Date of first assessment of confirmed CR or PR" + 1) / 30.4375.
