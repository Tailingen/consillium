Comparison of Hemostatic Agent to Suture in Terms of Hemostatic Function and Preservation of Ovarian Function
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of preservation of ovarian function, hemostasis, and safety of a hemostatic agent versus suturing during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy for ovarian endometriosis.
Benign Ovarian Cyst
PROCEDURE: Hemostatic agent (EVICELÂ®) application during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy|PROCEDURE: suturing with barbed sutures during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy
Ovarian function preservation 12 weeks after surgery, Reduction rate of AMH level in serum 12 weeks after surgery, 12 weeks after surgery
Ovarian function preservation 48 weeks after surgery, Reduction rate of AMH level in serum 48 weeks after surgery, 48 weeks after surgery|The time required to finish hemostasis, Stop-watch will be operated right after finishing stripping endometrioma. It will be evaluated how long the time have been spent for bleeding control, during operation|the success rate of hemostasis within 10 minutes, Stop-watch will be operated right after finishing stripping endometrioma. It will be evaluated whether hemostasis is finished within 10 minutes, during operation|Blood loss during operation, The volume of blood loss will be estimated by using simple visual assessment technique referring to gauze count and irrigation bottle, during operation|Hemoglobin, Change of serum hemoglobin from baseline, post-op 2 days, 12 weeks and 48 weeks|Transfusion during admission, whether patients are transfused during admission period, post-op 2 days|Adverse events associated with operation, bleeding or transfusion, any adverse events during admission period, post-op 2 days|Hospitalization period, days from admission day to discharge day, within post-op 2 weeks|Operation running time, time from anesthesia start to delivery of patient to recovery room, during operation
In women with endometrioma who plan to undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, surgical technique can influence postoperative ovarian function because of removal of normal ovarian tissue with ovarian cyst and damage to ovarian tissue during bleeding control after stripping of endometrioma. This study is designed to compare hemostatic sealant to suturing in terms of hemostatic function, safety and preservation of ovarian function.

Ovarian function of all patients will be evaluated on pre op, post op 12 weeks, post op 48 weeks by measuring AMH and ovarian volume. And Hemostatic function will be evaluated by measuring serum hemoglobin, blood loss during operation, etc.
