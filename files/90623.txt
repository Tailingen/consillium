Young adults (YA) with cancer have unique challenges in coping, and their primary partners may experience burden and low self-efficacy related to caregiving. In this single-arm pilot trial, the investigators shall deliver an eight-session intervention to YAs with cancer and their self-identified partners who provide caregiving. The intervention is founded on principles from cognitive-behavioral therapy and couples-focused interventions, tailored for YA. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, which will inform refinements prior to a larger-scale clinical trial. This study will include 10 YAs and their partner-caregivers (N=20). Participants will complete surveys at baseline and after the intervention, and will be invited to complete optional semi-structured exit interviews.
