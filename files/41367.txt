A Comparison of Recall Rates Between Conventional 2d Mammography and 2d Plus 3d (Tomosynthesis) Mammography in a Screening Population
The primary aim of this study is to measure, document and compare recall rates of two-dimensional plus three dimensional (2D plus 3D) (Tomosynthesis) mammography to that of 2D mammography in a screening population. This study will compare recall rates for both non-cancer and cancer cases.
