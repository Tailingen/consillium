A Study of Amivantamab and Lazertinib in People With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The researchers think that the study drugs, amivantamab and lazertinib, may be an effective treatment for people who have metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR mutation. Both drugs work to target cancer cells with an EGFR mutation, and this targeting action could stop or slow the growth of cancer cells. The researchers are doing this study to find out how well amivantamab and lazertinib work against metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR mutation.
