Interleukin 4 and Interferon Gamma Predictors of Human Papillomavirus Immunotherapy in Warts
In the present study the investigators assessed the invitro role of IL-4 and IFN-γ in predicting the response to bivalent HPV vaccine after whole blood stimulation
Warts Hand|Wart, Genital
BIOLOGICAL: IL-4 and IFN-γ measurements
Change of IFN-γ and IL-4 levels, Quantitative measurement of IFN-γ and IL-4 in culture supernatants, 48 hours
Change in the size of warts, Clinical observation and photographing of wart size, 6 months
40 Patients and 40 controls are enrolled in the study. Participants suffer from chronic recurrent cutaneous and genital warts. Blood samples were withdrawn then whole blood cultures are prepared. Cultures are stimulated with bivalent HPVvaccine. IL-4 and IFN-γ measurement in culture supernatants by ELISA. IL-4 and IFN-γ are investigated to predict the therapeutic response to bivalent HPV vaccine immunotherapy in warts.
