Study of Nutrition and Exercise in Adults Hospitalized for Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
This clinical trial aims to assess the effect of nutrition and exercise on muscle and adiposity in adults with Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) Negative B-ALL undergoing inpatient induction therapy.

Participants will take part in 2 different interventions:

* Nutrition Intervention
* Physical Exercise Intervention

All subjects will be provided with a wearable electronic activity monitor (FitBit®) to assist in recording activity levels in minutes of activity.
Philadelphia Chromosome Negative|B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)|B-ALL
BEHAVIORAL: Nutrition Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Exercise intervention
Feasibility of nutrition and exercise intervention, Percentage of eligible patients that consent to trial., End of study recruitment (approximately 1 year)
Adherence to dietary intervention, Percentage of participants that are "adherent", defined as \>75% of the patient's dietary assessments consistent with the prescribed diet., 22 days|Adherence to exercise intervention, Percentage of participants able to meet the exercise goal in 2 out of 3 weeks of induction therapy or 66% of their weeks of inpatient admission if admitted for more than 3 weeks., 22 days|Usability of interventions, To assess intervention usability, a 10-item questionnaire, the System Usability Scale Questionnaire, will be administered to each patient postintervention. This instrument rates responses from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". A score \>68 is considered of acceptable usability., 22 days|Body composition changes - Visceral Adiposity, Percent change in Visceral Adiposity from baseline to day 22 on study will be described. CT measurements of height-adjusted lumber adiposity area (VAT) are calculated from routine contrast and non-contrast CT scans of chest and abdomen, 22 days|Body composition changes - Sarcopenia (SMI), Percent change in sarcopenia score from baseline to day 22 on study will be described. Sarcopenia is loss of skeletal muscle mass and function associated with aging and will be calculated as mg/m2 measurements of skeletal muscle cross-sectional area, index, and radiation attenuation utilizing clinical computed tomography (CT) scans. The lower the value the worse the outcome., 22 days|Impact on minimal residual disease (MRD), Number of participants that are MRD positive at end of induction therapy, 22 days|Impact on Treatment toxicities, Number of participants that experience experience grade 3-4 hyperglycemia and hepatoxicity during induction. Adverse Events will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5 criteria., 22 days|Changes to the Host Metabolome, Assessment of changes to the host metabolome throughout the intervention on daily serum samples (excluding weekends and holidays) will be assess descriptively, 22 days
