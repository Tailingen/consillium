Research on Precise Immune Prevention and Treatment of Glioma Based on Multi-omics Sequencing Data
This project intends to use multiple types of biological samples from glioma patients and mouse intracranial tumor models as research objects, and comprehensively apply a series of omics sequencing technologies and molecular biology technologies to jointly define the following research objectives :

1. Through high-throughput sequencing technologies such as， genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and single-cell sequencing, Proteomics，Metabonomics and Metagenomics， the similarities and differences of the glioma immune microenvironment within and between individuals were revealed from the multi-dimensional and big data level, and the immune molecular typing of glioma was established.
2. Establish and verify that the neoantigen polypeptides predicted by AI algorithm after analyzing multi-omics data (genome, transcriptome, etc.) have good killing effect on individual tumor cells.
3. To establish an intelligent evaluation model of glioma immunotyping by integrating imaging, pathology, high-throughput sequencing data and other omics information, and to provide a visual tool for monitoring changes in the intratumoral microenvironment of glioma patients, with the expectation of helping timely intervention of immunotherapy in patients with recurrence.
