Primary Objectives

* to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nal-IRI (ONIVYDE®) in combination with TAS-102 (LONSURF®)
* to evaluate the toxicity profile of the combination therapy Secondary Objectives
* to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy of nal-IRI (ONIVYDE®) and TAS-102 (LONSURF®)
* to study the pharmacokinetics of the combination therapy

A phase 1 study with a classical 3 + 3 dose escalation design. The target population is patients who have pathologically confirmed malignant solid tumors with no standard treatment available.
