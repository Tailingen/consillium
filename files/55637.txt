Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TWP-101 in Patients With Advanced Melanoma and Urothelial Carcinoma
This study is a multi-center, phase Ia/Ib, open clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TWP-101 in patients with advanced melanoma and urothelial carcinoma. This study consists of two parts (Part A and Part B). Part A was a dose escalation study, and Part B was a dose expansion study.

DRUG: TWP-101
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), From the first dose of study drug up to 4 weeks|Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse event (defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE V5.0)) and irAE., From enrollment until 90 days after the last dose
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST Version 1.1, From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), From first dose to disease progression, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR)., From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS)., From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 2 years|Maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax) of TWP-101., From first dose until 90 days after the last dose|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of TWP-101., From first dose until 90 days after the last dose|Half-life (T1/2) of TWP-101., From first dose until 90 days after the last dose|Immunogenicity profile of TWP-101., Blood samples will be collected from subjects post treatment for assessment to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies by meso scale discovery(MSD)., From first dose until 90 days after the last dose
