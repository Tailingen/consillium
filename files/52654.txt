This 2-arm phase II study proposes to determine the efficacy of ketamine oral rinse in pain relief from mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Ketamine Topical
Number of patients who have altered pain response from mucositis in head and neck cancer undergoing radiation treatment from using ketamine oral rinse., Review weekly questionnaires of patients who received ketamine oral rinse to assess if it helped with the pain of mucositis caused by the radiation in head and neck cancer patients., 6 months
Number of patients whose dysphagia was decreased by the use of ketamine oral rinse among head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy., Dysphagia as assessed by MDADI., 6 months.|Number of patients whose quality-of-life increased after the use of ketamine oral rinse among head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy., Quality of life as assessed by FACT-HN., 6 months|Number of patients who need morphine prescription equivalent reductions as a result of using ketamine oral rinse., Pain medication requirement measured in morphine equivalents., 6 months
Patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer undergoing radiation or concurrent chemoradiation as part of their treatment plan, will either receive ketamine oral rinse or unmedicated oral rinse to use 4 times a day if they develop oral mucositis during their radiation.

Patients will be monitored during treatment and up to 30 days after and will utilize a pain diary to document daily.
