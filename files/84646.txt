Impact of Locoregional Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma on Status of Patients Aged 70 Years and Over
In order to describe functional impact of surgery in elderly patients treated for lower-limb soft-tissue sarcoma, the investigators set up this project which aims to identify prognostic factors among geriatric and functional assessment.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Adult

This is a prospective cohort including 100 patients \> 70 year-old treated by surgery for lower-limb soft-tissue sarcoma. Data on clinical and geriatric characteristics of the patient as well as functional and quality of life assessment will be collected among patient participation (3 years). Primary endpoint is to describe evaluation of the Impact of Locoregional Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma on the Functional Status.
