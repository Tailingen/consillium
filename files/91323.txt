A Basket Trial of an ERK1/2 Inhibitor (LY3214996) in Combination With Abemaciclib.
The purpose of CTO-IUSCC-0730 study is to assess the clinical efficacy of LY3214996 in combination with abemaciclib at the recommended phase 2 dose of LY3214996 200 mg orally daily and abemaciclib 150 mg orally twice daily. Patients will be treated until evidence of disease progression, non-compliance with study protocol, unacceptable major toxicity, at subject's own request for withdrawal, or if the study closes for any reason.

Overall Response Rate, The number of patients who achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of patients treated (efficacy population) as determined by RECIST v1.1., from cycle 1 day 1 until safety follow up visit (up to 1 year)
Number of Patients With Treatment Related Adverse Events Grade 3 or Above, Number of unique patients with any Abemaciclib or LY3214996 treatment related (possible, probable, or definite) adverse events with grade \>=3. CTCAE Version 5.0 will be used., baseline until safety follow up visit (up to 1 year)|Duration of Overall Response Rate, Measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented through RECIST v1.1. Please note that there were no patients who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) within this study., up to 1 year|Progression Free Survival, The time from the date of start of treatment to the first date of the observed clinical or radiologically documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For patients who are not known to have died or progressed as of the data-inclusion cut-off date, PFS time will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent systematic anticancer therapy. Assessment are completed using RECIST v1.1. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used and the median and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated., up to 1 year, 1 month
