A Study to Compare Uliledlimab Combined With Sintilimab and Chemotherapy Versus Sintilimab Combined With Chemotherapy in Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare intravenous uliledlimab combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy versus sintilimab combined with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC who are not suitable for targeted therapies such as EGFR or ALK.

Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either uliledlimab combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy or sintilimab combined with chemotherapy. Enrolled subjects will first enter a safety run-in period. When at least 12 subjects have been randomly assigned to Group A and have received ≥ 1 dose of study drug (with a total of approximately 24 subjects), enrollment will be suspended for safety evaluation. The safety evaluation period will last 3 weeks, during which safety, tolerability, and PK data of uliledlimab combined with sintilimab and chemotherapy will be collected and evaluated by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). The SRC will decide through discussion whether to proceed to the next stage of randomized enrollment, whether additional subjects need to be enrolled for safety evaluation, or whether the study treatment should be terminated due to high safety risks. After the SRC reaches a unanimous resolution, enrollment will continue until a total of approximately 150 subjects are enrolled. All 150 subjects will be included in the final efficacy analysis. If 3 or more subjects experience Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related AEs that are unrelieved and lead to discontinuation of all study drugs during the safety run-in period, enrollment in the next stage will be terminated.
