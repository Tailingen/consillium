A TEAE was an AE that started on or after the first dose of investigational product (emirodatamab) up to 30 days after the end of investigational product or end of study date, whichever was earlier.

A treatment-related AE was any TEAE that per investigator review had a reasonable possibility of being caused by the investigational product (emirodatamab)., Day 1 Cycle 1 to 30 days after last dose of investigational product or end of study; median treatment duration was 0.62 months
Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: Cycle 1 Day 5 (C1D5); Cohorts 14 and 15: Cycle 1 Day 8 (C1D8) (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: C1D5; Cohorts 14 and 15: C1D8 (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: C1D5; Cohorts 14 and 15: C1D8 (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-last) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis. AUC(0-last) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: C1D5; Cohorts 14 and 15: C1D8 (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|AUC From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis. The AUC(0-inf) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: C1D5; Cohorts 14 and 15: C1D8 (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|AUC From Time Zero to 14 Days Post-dose (AUC14d) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis. AUC(14d) was calculated as the sum of AUC values of all dosing days in cycle 1., For all cohorts: from time zero to 14-days following the C1D1 dose (1 cycle= 14 days)|Terminal Half-life (t1/2,z) of Emirodatamab, Serum concentrations of emirodatamab were determined using a validated assay. Noncompartmental analysis was performed for estimation of PK parameters. Concentrations below the LLOQ (0.05 ng/mL) were set to zero before data analysis. t1/2,z was calculated as t1/2,z = ln(2)/λz, where λz is the first-order terminal rate constant estimated via linear regression of the terminal log-linear phase., Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17: C1D5; Cohorts 14 and 15: C1D8 (sampling pre-dose up to 72 hours post-dose)|Best Overall Response According to Revised International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria, A response consisted of any of the following, assessed according to the IWG response criteria:
