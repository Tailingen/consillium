A Study of QL1706 in Combination With Chemotherapy in PD-L1-Negative Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 combined with platinum-based chemotherapy versus tislelizumab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy in PD-L1 negative, locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups according to 1:1, with about 304 subjects in the experimental group and the control group.

DRUG: QL1706|DRUG: Tilesizumab
PFS, Progression Free Survival in the intent to treat (ITT) population, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, Informed consent until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|OS, Overall Survival (OS) in the ITT population determined by the investigator, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, which ever came first, assessed up to 2 years
ORR, Objective Response Rate assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, First administration until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|DOR, Duration of Response assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, First administration until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|DCR, Disease Control Rate assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, First administration until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|PFS, Progression Free Survival in the intent to treat (ITT) population, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, Informed consent until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)
This study was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 in combination with chemotherapy or commercial PD1 in combination with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who are PD-L1 negative.608 patients would be enrolled . Subjects will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to experimental group and control group. Subjects will be stratified by pathological type: squamous cell carcinoma versus non-squamous cell carcinoma; brain metastasis: present versus absent; gender: male versus female. After randomization, subjects will be treated according to the randomization results.
