This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. A total of 300 patients with different cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were included in this vaccination study. All of the patients will further accept 12 months follow-up study after vaccination. Safety and immunogenicity will be carefully recorded and detected.
