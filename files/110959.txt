Angiosarcoma
DRUG: Pazopanib + Paclitaxel
Rate of Progression-free Survival, The diagnosis of progession is based on tumor measurements assessed 182 days +/- 32 days after start of treatment (with imaging date as reference date) and according to the RECIST Version 1.1 criteria based on a predefined set of target lesions and non-target lesions., 6 Month|Rate of Progression-free Survival, Subgroup 1 Analysis, Rate of progression-free survival for Subgroup 1 categorizing the 12 participants who showed PFS after 6 months into cutaneous angiosarcoma versus visceral angiosarcoma The diagnosis of progession is based on tumor measurements assessed 182 days +/- 32 days after start of treatment (with imaging date as reference date) and according to the RECIST Version 1.1 criteria based on a predefined set of target lesions and non-target lesions., 6 months|Rate of Progression-free Survival, Subgroup 2 Analysis, Rate of progression-free survival for Subgroup 1 categorizing the 12 participants who showed PFS after 6 months into primary angiosarcoma versus secondary angiosarcoma.

Overall Survival, Survival time of patient from start of treatment until death, from start of treatment until death within study's actual observation time for OS (22 months).|Overall Survival, Subgroup 1 Analysis, Survival time of patients from start of treatment until death, Subgroup 1 categorizing 26 overall participants into 18 cutaneous angiosarcoma versus 8 visceral angiosarcomas, from start of treatment until death within study's actual observation time for OS (22 months)|Overall Survival, Subgroup 2 Analysis, Survival time of patients from start of treatment until death, Subgroup 2 categorizing 26 overall participants into 13 primary cutaneous angiosarcoma versus 13 secondary angiosarcomas, from start of treatment until death within study's actual observation time for OS (22 months)|Response Rate (RR), Measurable skin lesions will be evaluated clinically and documented photographically, all other target lesions will be evaluated radiologically by CT or MRI according to RECIST Version 1.1.

RR is given as 'Best overall response" BOR" defined as CR (complete remission), PR (partial) remission), SD (stable diesease) and PD (progressive disease) or NE (not evaluated) and provided by absolute and relative frequencies, determined every 8 weeks during first 6 month then every 12 weeks in follow-up period until progression or death or end of overall study observation period (22 months), then evaluated as BOR|Response Rate (RR), Subgroup1 Analysis, Measurable skin lesions will be evaluated clinically and documented photographically, all other target lesions will be evaluated radiologically by CT or MRI according to RECIST Version 1.1.

Open-label phase II trial investigating the efficacy and safety of the investigational combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel.This multi-center, open-label, prospective, single arm phase II study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the experimental combination of pazopanib with paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma.The safety evaluations (physical examination, laboratory checks as defined in protocol, toxicity/adverse event assessment according Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group version 4.0) are scheduled every cycle at day 1, 8, 15 and 29 (= day 1 of the next cycle).
