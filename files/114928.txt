A Study of BIND-014 Given to Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
The goal of this Phase 1 clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of BIND-014 that can be given in the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.
Metastatic Cancer|Cancer|Solid Tumors
DRUG: BIND-014
To assess the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of BIND-014 when on day 1 of a 21-day cycle or when given on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle., This information will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIND-014 when given weekly or three weeks.
To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BIND-014 following an IV infusion., Pharmacokinetic parameters such as time to peak concentration (Tmax), peak concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin), volume of distribution (Vd), half life (t1/2), total body clearance (CL) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) will be determined for each patient using plasma concentration data., First two cycles of BIND-014|To assess any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity observed with BIND-014., 18 months|To assess changes in serum tumor markers when appropriate., 18 months
The study is designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BIND-014 and define a recommended Phase 2 dose of BIND-014.

All cycles of therapy will consist of the patient taking BIND-014 intravenously once every three weeks or weekly for three out of four weeks.
