Tight Glycemic Control by Artificial Pancreas
This study evaluated a closed-loop system providing continuous monitoring and strict control of perioperative blood glucose following pancreatic resection.
Pancreatic Neoplasm
DEVICE: Artificial Pancreas (STG-22)
the incidence of severe hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dl) during the intensive care period following pancreatic resection in patients monitored using the artificial pancreas, the first postoperative 18 hours in the surgical intensive care unit
the total amount of insulin required for glycemic control after pancreatic resection, the first postoperative 18 hours in the surgical intensive care unit
This study recruited 32 patients undergoing elective pancreatic resection for pancreatic disease.
