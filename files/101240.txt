Boron Neutron Capture Therapy With B10 L-BPA for Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers
This Phase II study, titled "A Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) Using B10 L-BPA in Patients with Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers," aims to assess the efficacy and safety of B10 L-BPA-based BNCT in this patient population. The primary objective is to evaluate its efficacy, while secondary objectives include assessing safety, survival outcomes, tumor response, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of B10 L-BPA and boron.

Assessment of the Efficacy of B10 L-BPA-Based BNCT in Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers, The objective response rate (ORR) of the B10 L-BPA-based BNCT, as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of the target lesions., 6 months
Evaluation of the Safety of B10 L-BPA-Based BNCT in Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers, Safety parameters, including occurrence, severity, and relationship of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), as assessed by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 during the study period., 6 months|Assessment of the Survival Status of B10 L-BPA-Based BNCT in Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers, PFS is defined as the time from receiving the B10 L-BPA-based BNCT until progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever comes the first.

OS is defined as the time from receiving the B10 L-BPA-based BNCT until death from any cause., 6 months|Assessment of Tumor Responses to B10 L-BPA-Based BNCT in Unresectable Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers, Tumor responses, including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), time to CR, and time to PR, as evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., 6 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed concentration of B10 L-BPA in plasma., 3 Days|Time to Peak Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Time at which the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of B10 L-BPA occurs., 3 Days|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve to Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration of B10 L-BPA., 3 Days|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve to Infinity (AUCinf), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity for B10 L-BPA., 3 Days|Elimination Half-Life (t1/2), Time required for the plasma concentration of B10 L-BPA to decrease by half., 3 Days|Percentage of Recovered B10 L-BPA in Urine, Percentage of the administered B10 L-BPA dose recovered in urine., 3 Days|Percentage of Recovered B10 L-BPA Metabolites in Urine, Percentage of the administered B10 L-BPA metabolites recovered in urine., 3 Days|Renal Clearance of B10 L-BPA, Renal clearance rate of B10 L-BPA based on urine and plasma concentrations., 3 Days
Assessment of the Population of Circulating Immune Cells and Associated Cytokines Before and After B10 L-BPA-Based BNCT, Blood samples will be collected to assess MDSCs, T cells and interleukin-1 Î² at multiple time points: before and after BNCT. This approach aims to clarify whether the levels of circulating immune cells could serve as prognostic indicators for BNCT treatment outcomes., 6 months
