MoCA vs. MMS: Which Tool to Detect Cognitive Disorders in Oncogeriatric?
This study concerns elderly patients with cancer with onco-geriatric assessment.

This study propose to associate the collection of the results with the Mini-Cog and the CODEX with the passing of the MoCA and the MMS tests, as well as a neuropsychological assessment, in order to determine if the patients have cognitive impairments, to evaluate the sensitivity of these 4 screening tests in elderly patients seeking treatment for their cancer. The results of this study will make it possible, where appropriate, to adapt the practice in the context of oncogeriatric assessment.

OTHER: Passation of neuropsychological test
Evaluate the sensitivity of MoCA test, MoCA is considered clinically relevant if its sensitivity to identify patients with cognitive impairment is at least 75%, Up 2 months after inclusion, before initiation of treatment
