Construction and Clinical Translation of ACE Targeted Nuclear Medicine Imaging Probe
This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the clinical predictive value of 68Ga-DOTA-BPP in subjects with triple-negative breast cancer. The visual and semiquantitative methods will be used to assess the PET/CT images
Cancer
Visual assessment of lesions, Visual analysis of 68Ga-DOTA-BPP PET images will be performed by consensus reading by at least 2 experienced nuclear medicine physician, 1 year|Semiquantitative assessment of lesions, The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 68Ga-DOTA-BPP in lesions will be measured by the same nuclear medicine physician for all the cases, 1 year
ACE expression analysis of tumor tissues, Tumor tissues obtained from biopsy or surgery will be stained for ACE, 1 year|Correlation analysis of 68Ga-DOTA-BPP uptake and lesion size changes, The SUVs of 68Ga-DOTA-BPP in individual lesions will be compared to the changes in lesion sizes, 1 year
ACE is expressed in triple-negative breast cancer cells. This project develops new type of 68GA-labeled DOTA-BPP, leveraging the inherent strengths of this nuclear medicine discipline, promoted the formulation of the production of this drug To obtain 68Ga-DOTA-BPP injection that can be used in preclinical studies and meets clinical standards. Join a group In clinical patients, 68Ga-DOTA-BPP PET/CT imaging of patients with ACE-positive TNBC was performed, and ACE was obtained To provide evidence for patient screening and efficacy evaluation before targeted therapy with high expression of TNBC, and preliminatively evaluate the level of ACE against high level of ACE. The effect of tumor development can provide a practical basis for the establishment of ACE-targeted PET imaging platform
