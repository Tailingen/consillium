Health Literacy and Digital Health in Cancer Patients.
This is a multicentric, prospective, observational, transversal study, aiming to evaluate the health literacy of cancer patients using the approved French version of the Functional, Communicative and Critical Health Literacy (FCCHL) scale in 2 populations:

* Population A: patients age 65 and over treated in an oncology or oncogeriatric outpatient clinic, or seen in an oncology or oncogeriatric consultation.
* Population B: young patients age 18 to 64 treated in an oncology or outpatient clinic, or seen in an oncology consultation.

The following questionnaires:

* Approved French version of the FCCHL scale
* Questionnaire on the use of digital tools adapted from the questionnaire on digital tools,

will be completed once only. It will be completed by the participant during the oncology or oncogeriatric consultation or outpatient clinic appointment, in self-questionnaire mode or face to face, assisted if necessary by a family member or member of the medical team.

Percentage of Participants With an Overall Score of ≤ 4 on the FCCHL Scale., Health literacy of cancer patients using the approved French version of the Functional, Communicative and Critical Health Literacy (FCCHL) scale. The FCCHL questionnaire includes 14 items, divided into 3 sub-scales, reflecting 3 health literacy skills (functional literacy, interactive literacy and critical literacy). The overall score will be calculated by determining the mean score for the 3 sub-scales. A score of ≤ 4 on the FCCHL scale, corresponds to a low level of health literacy. Each item of the FCCHL takes a score of 1 to 5 points. For each patient, a literacy score per sub-scale will be determined by calculating the number of points divided by the number of items on the sub-scale. The score can range from 1 to 5. The overall literacy score will be calculated as the mean of the 3 sub-scales. This score can range from 1 to 5.

For functional scale, higher value represent worse outcome and for the other scale, a higher value represent a better outcome., 1 month
Number et Percentage of Participants by Items of the Questionnaire on the Use of Digital Tools., The questionnaire on the use of digital tools will be described per item:

* This questionnaire includes 10 items.
* A Likert-type scale with five modalities of response is proposed (never, rarely, sometimes, often, always).
* No overall score will be calculated., 1 month
