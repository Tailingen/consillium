Fosaprepitant for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Pediatric Patients
The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with dexamethasone or placebo plus ondansetron with dexamethasone in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with MEC/HE multi-day chemotherapy in children with solid tumors.
Pediatric Cancer
DRUG: Fosaprepitant,ondansetron, dexamethasone|DRUG: placebo ondansetron with dexamethasone
CR rate, Percentage of participants who experienced a complete response (CR; no vomiting/rescue medication) rate in overall phases., between 0 and 120 hours after the start of chemotherapy
CR rate in acute phase, Complete response rate in acute phase, 0 to 24 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy|CR rate in delayed phase, Complete response rate in delayed phase, 25 to 120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy
Participants will randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-blind study drug ( fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with dexamethasone). Fosaprepitant or placebo to fosaprepitant were supplied and administered in a blinded manner.

Experimental:

Participants received a single dose of fosaprepitant (age-based adjustment) administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after chemotherapy.

Placebo Comparator:

Participants received a single dose of matched placebo for fosaprepitant administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 prior to chemotherapy plus ondansetron (weight based) IV with dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po prior to chemotherapy and up to 72 hours after chemotherapy.
