Phase 1b Study of AdV-tk + Valacyclovir Combined With Radiation Therapy for Malignant Gliomas
This phase I study evaluated a Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy approach for malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering an experimental approach called GliAtak which uses AdV-tk, an adenoviral vector containing the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase gene, plus an oral anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, in combination with standard of care radiation.

This study was designed to include patients with newly diagnosed unresectable (Arm A) and resectable (Arm B) malignant glioma. Three dose levels of AdV-tk were evaluated with a fixed dose level of valacyclovir prodrug. AdV-tk was delivered to tumor cells by stereotactic injection into the tumor at the time of biopsy (Arm A) or injection into the tumor bed following resection (Arm B). Oral valacyclovir began 1-3 days after the AdV-tk injection and continued for 14 days. Standard radiation therapy began 3-7 days following the AdV-tk injection to maximize synergy with radiation. Standard temozolomide could be administered after completion of valacyclovir.
