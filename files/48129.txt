Study of Interleukin-21 for Metastatic Malignant Melanoma and Metastatic Kidney Cancer
This study is being done to see if an experimental drug called recombinant interleukin-21 (rIL-21) when given to patients with stage 4 malignant melanoma or stage 4 kidney cancer is safe and has any effect on these types of cancers.
Melanoma|Kidney Neoplasms|Metastases
DRUG: Recombinant Human Interleukin-21
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rIL-21|To further characterize the safety of rIL-21 at the MTD
Characterize pharmacokinetics of rIL-21|Evaluate immunogenicity of rIL-21|Identify clinical or biological parameters that may correlate with clinical efficacy|Characterize anti-tumor effect of IL-21
This is a phase 1 safety study. Everyone enrolled and eligible will be given rIL-21. The study has 2 parts, Part A will determine how high a dose of rIl-21 can be safely given to patients with these types of cancers. Part B will determine if the drug is of any benefit to patients with these types of cancers. Part A may have up to 7 different dose groups. Beginning with the lowest dose, 3 patients will be treated and will be watched for side effects. If the side effects are not severe, the next group of 3 patients will recieve a higher dose. This cycle is repeated until the highest tolerated dose group is found.
