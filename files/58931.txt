Determinants of Health and Cancer: Investigating the Conceptions of Children From 6 to 11 Years Old
Model and map, from a qualitative multi-phased protocol, the conceptions and systems of conceptions of the determinants of health and cancer expressed and perceived by schoolchildren aged 6 to 11 years. The secondary objectives are to analyze the ability to question the conceptions of children's health regardless of their age and to link conceptions and determinants to contextual factors. The informative value and complementarity of the collection tools (photo expression, QC, photo-narration) and the relevance of a mixed analysis methodology (qualitative and quantitative) in order to highlight the different determinants of health will also be studied.

Qualitative observational study of human and social sciences (SHS), multicenter, conducted with schoolchildren.

The qualitative methodology used combines the use of photographs, open questionnaires and focus groups, over very large panels, aiming at both diversity and representativeness.

* Photo expression: to identify the determinants perceived as having a positive or negative influence on one's health;
* CQR : Certainty/Question/Rumour on how to take care of one's health (health promotion input following on from school policies, i.e. PES: Politique d'Etablissements Scolaires);
* Photo narration: to identify argumentative frameworks in health and alternatives perceived as being positive or negative for one's health,
* Focus groups: to improve understanding of the rationalities built by adolescents in relation to that which determines their health.

This choice is justified by the need to explore and understand the actions from the participants' point of view.

The diversity of schools and pupils (5 classes in 4 schools in the AURA region, i.e. 320 pupils) will make it possible to obtain the data saturation required in qualitative research.

This makes it possible to consider a mixed analysis strategy, both qualitative and quantitative.

This project aims to better understand the rationalities elaborated by children and the way in which their concepts on the determinants of cancer interlink, as well as to describe the declared impact these concepts have on the decision-making regarding their health.
