A Comparative Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Face Talc Slurry and Iodopovidone for Pleurodesis
Pleurodesis is a technique used to fuse the two layers of the lining over the lung. This is done to get rid of collections of fluid or air in this space. A common reason would be cancer of the underlying lung or elsewhere causing fluid to collect in the pleural space. In this situation it is a palliative procedure to free the patient from symptoms like breathlessness.
