A Trial to Find and Investigate a Safe Dose of BI 836858 in Combination With Decitabine for Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
Phase I Dose Escalation:

Primary objective is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for Phase I Extension.

Secondary objective is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of BI 836858 in combination with decitabine

Phase I Extension:

Primary objective is to collect additional data on safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and to define the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of BI 836858 in combination with decitabine.

Phase II: Primary objective is to investigate efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BI 836858 in combination with decitabine compared to decitabine monotherapy.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: BI 836858
Phase I: Number of Patients With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT(s)) During First Treatment Cycle, Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity (DLT(s)) for BI 836858 in combination with decitabine during first treatment cycle (Phase 1).

DLT was defined as any non-disease-related non-haematological adverse event (AE) of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher. Expected non-haematological disease-related AEs were not to be regarded as a DLT.

These included complications resulting from haematological AEs such as:

* Bleeding and complications from bleeding due to thrombocytopenia as defined by the Investigator,
* Infection and complications from infections due to neutropenia as defined by the Investigator,
* Constitutional symptoms due to anaemia as defined by the Investigator, Up to 28 days (first treatment cycle).|Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836858 in Combination With Decitabine, The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836858 in combination with decitabine was estimated after the dose escalation part of the trial obtaining on the basis of dose limiting toxicities (DLT(s)) observed during the first treatment cycle. However, for those patients who receive more than one cycle of the combination treatment, all adverse events that constitute a DLT will be considered for re-estimation of the MTD based on the Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). The MTD is defined as the highest dose of BI 836858 (in combination with decitabine) with less than 25% risk of the true DLT rate being above 33% during the MTD evaluation period., From first drug administration until end of treatment, up to 941 days.
Phase 1: Number of Patients With Objective Response (CR + CRi), Number of patients with objective response (Complete remission (CR) + complete remission with incomplete remission (CRi)).

CR was defined as bone marrow (BM) blasts \< 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \> 1.0 x 109/L \[1,000/μL\]; platelet count \> 100 x 109/L \[100,000/μL\]; independence of red blood cells transfusions (no transfusion for 1 week prior to the assessment). No minimum duration of response is required.

CRi was defined as all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\< 1.0 x 109/L \[1,000/μL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100 x 109/L \[100,000/μL\])., From start of treatment until the earliest of progression, death or end of trial, up to 971 days.
