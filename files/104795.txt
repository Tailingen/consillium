Study of Metabolic, Transcriptomic and Proteomic Characteristics in Relapsed Glioblastoma
Glioblastomas are the most frequent and aggressive malignant tumors of the CNS in adults, with almost systematic relapse despite treatment with surgery followed by radio-chemotherapy (STUPP protocol). The aim of this study is to better characterize transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic changes in relapsed glioblastoma compared to the initial tumor, in order to identify new prognostic markers and potential new therapeutic targets.

Glioblastomas are the most frequent and aggressive malignant Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors in adults, with a median survival of only 14 months.

Current treatment is based on surgery followed by radiochemotherapy (STUPP protocol), unchanged since 2005. Clinical trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have largely failed to demonstrate efficacy in these tumors. In order to better understand the oncogenesis of glioblastoma and identify potential new therapeutic targets, the study of the characteristics of relapsed tumors compared with the initial tumor seems relevant.

The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic characteristics of relapsed glioblastomas reoperated at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, France, between 2005 and 2023, for which tumor material is available. These analyses will be correlated with relapse-free and overall survival of the patients.
