PK characteristics of BCG for therapeutic use by the level of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the blood sample, The peripheral blood of the subjects was collected within 1h before the 1st and 6th administration and 2 h±30 min、24 h±2 h after the 1st and 6th administration to evaluate the exposure of BCG for therapeutic use in the blood.

The levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (nucleic acid positive/negative) in the blood sample after the 1st and 6th administration were detected., 1h before the 1st and 6th administration and 2 h±30 min、24 h±2 h after the 1st and 6th administration|Immune response characteristics of BCG for therapeutic use by the level of cytokines in the blood and urine sample, Blood sample collection: Peripheral blood samples of subjects were collected within 1 h before the 1st and 6th administration, and 2 h±30 min and 24 h±2 h after the 1st and 6th administration.

Urine sample collection: last excreted urine of subjects were collected before the 1st and 6th administration, and excreted urine of subjects were collected 2 h±1 h, 4 h±1 h, 8 h±2 h, and 24 h±3 h after 1st and 6th BCG administration .

The levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN- γ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in blood and urine sample were detected., before the 1st and 6th administration， 2 h±30 min and 24 h±2 h after the 1st and 6th administration， 2 h±1 h, 4 h±1 h, 8 h±2 h, and 24 h±3 h after 1st and 6th BCG administration .|Shedding of BCG for therapeutic use by the level of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the urine sample, The urine excreted from the subjects were collected on the 1st and 3rd day after the 1st and 6th administration , in which the urine on the first day included 2 h ±1 h, 4 h ±1 h, 8 h ±2 h and 24 h ±3 h after BCG administration, and only once on the 3rd day to investigate the drug shedding.

The levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (nucleic acid positive/negative) in the urine sample after the 1st and 6th administration were detected., 1st and 3rd day after the 1st and 6th administration
This clinical study adopted a single-arm, open, single-centertrial design. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK characteristics, shedding and immune response characteristics of BCG for therapeutic use developed by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., Ltd. in patients aged 18 and over after transethral resection of non-muscular invasive bladder cancer.

This study includes three stages: screening period, observation period of administration, and safety follow-up period.

Screening period:

within 28 days before the first administration, the subjects will be eligible for enrollment confirmation.

Observation period of administration:

10 patients with non-muscular invasive bladder cancer ≥ 14 days after operation were included.The 10 patients were infused with BCG 120mg once a week for 6 times, then once every 2 weeks for 3 times, and then once a month (30 days) for 10 times, with a total of 19 times.

The peripheral blood samples of the subjects were collected to evaluate the exposure and immune response characteristics of the drugs in the blood, and the urine samples were collected to examine the immune response characteristics and shedding of the drugs. The safety data of each subject were observed ,collected and recorded, including vital signs, laboratory examination, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) (within 7 days after the first 5 times of each infusion treatment, and within 14 days after the sixth infusion (before V8 visit)). After 14 days of follow-up after the sixth infusion of the last subject, the clinical trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will conduct an interim analysis to evaluate the safety and tolerability based on the obtained data. For the AE that did not recover within 14 days after the sixth infusion, the investigators should followe up until the AE was remission, or returned to the baseline, or the subject's condition was stable, or the subject lost follow-up / death.

When the subjects continued 13 times in the later period of bladder instillation therapy; blood routine examination was performed before the 10th, 13th, 16th and 19th instillation, and blood biochemical examination was performed before the 13th and 19th instillation. Cystoscopy and urine cytology were performed at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months after the first infusion. The subjects then continued their follow-up visits..

Safety follow-up period:

Safety follow-up was performed for7 days after the last administration. For the AE that did not recover 7 days after the last administration, the investigators should follow up to AE remission, or return to the baseline, or the subject's condition was stable, or the subject lost follow-up / death.
