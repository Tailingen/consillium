A 10 points mean score difference expected between groups. Each question is ranged from 0 (no need of supportive care) to 5 (strong need of supportive care). Scores for Outcome 1 may vary from 0 to 25., 6 months
Before the start of the study, medical oncologists and supportive care physicians from both the sites will attend Communication Skills Training (CST) workshops provided by an expert team in the field. The training sessions will focus on practicing the required communication skills needed in consultations.

The randomization will assign patients, with a 1:2 ratio, to "Introduction of supportive care when medically needed" (Arm A: Control Group) or "Initial concomitant management by the oncologist and the supportive care team" (Arm B: Early Together Group).

Selected and validated questionnaires will be filled at baseline, 6 and 12 months by the patients before the consultation, in the 2 groups.
