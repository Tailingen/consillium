Pivotal Study of the NanoKnife System for the Ablation of Prostate Tissue
Pivotal study to evaluate the use of the NanoKnife System as a focal therapy option for prostate cancer patients. This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of the device when used to ablate prostate tissue in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients.
