Evaluating a Physical Activity Index for Assessment and Counseling for Breast and Colon Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this research study is to determine whether using the physical activity index screener, exercise coaching, and self-monitoring will increase physical activity and reduce time spent sitting or being inactive in patients who had breast or colon cancer.

Number of Eligible Participants - Participation Rate, Participation will be measured by the number of eligible participants who agree to participate. Investigators will calculate 95% confidence interval for each of the feasibility measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with the data., 17 months|Percentage of Participants to Complete Exercise Sessions - Adherence, Adherence will be measured by the percent of participants who complete at least 3 out 5 exercise sessions. Investigators will calculate 95% confidence interval for each of the feasibility measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with the data., 17 months|Number of Participants Who Complete Study Questionnaires - Retention, Retention will be defined as the number of participants who complete study questionnaires at baseline and one follow-up timepoint. Investigators will calculate 95% confidence interval for each of the feasibility measures to determine the range of estimates that are consistent with the data., At baseline and up to 17 months
To assess the feasibility (participation rate, adherence, and retention) of the Physical Activity Index (PAI) intervention in breast and colon cancer survivors supported by exercise coaching and self-monitoring tools.
