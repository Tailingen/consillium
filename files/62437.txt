Screening Plasma HER2 Amplication by Digital PCR in Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Trastuzumab and Pyrotinib
The hypothesis of this study is to discover the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab combined with pyrotinib in treating advanced breast cancer with HER2 positive, which is detected by digital PCR. It is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study.

The purpose of this study is:

1. To explore the Response rate (RR) and progression-free survival(PFS) and safety of patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer who received trastuzumab combined with pyrotinib in positive plasma HER2 amplification detected by digital PCR.
2. To explore the potential using of digital PCR in recurrent and metastatic breast cancer.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab and Pyrotinib
objective response rate(ORR), The ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients in the Efficacy Evaluable patient Set who achieve complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), up to 1 year after the last patient enrolled
Progression free survival(PFS), PFS will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, up to 1 year after the last patient enrolled|Incidence and Severity of adverse events, hematologic, hepatotoxicity, Incidence of hypertension, Incidence of proteinuria, approximately 1.5 years
