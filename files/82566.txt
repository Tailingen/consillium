Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy Versus Radiofrequency Ablation
This is a prospective randomized controlled study comparing laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) versus image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating aldosterone-producing adenoma.

The objectives of this study are to

1. compare the short-term outcomes of LA and RFA in treating aldosterone-producing adenoma.
2. compare the treatment success rates of LA and RFA during follow-up for primary aldosteronism.
