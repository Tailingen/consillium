Human (Autologous) Oral Mucosal Cell Sheet Transplantation After ESD in Patients With Superficial Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esophageal epithelial regenerative treatment by the transplantation of the product, CLS2702C, to the esophageal wound site after extensive ESD for superficial esophageal cancer.
Superficial Esophageal Cancer
DEVICE: CLS2702C/CLS2702D
Proportion of participants without stenosis until 8 weeks after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), Up to 8 weeks after ESD
Time to wound healing, Wound healing is defined as re-epithelized state with no white coat, erosion, or ulcer in the process of healing. The time to wound healing will be assessed endoscopically., Up to 24 weeks after ESD|Number of esophageal balloon dilatations (investigated until wound healing is confirmed), Number of esophageal balloon dilatations will be counted., Up to 24 weeks|Number of participants reporting one or more adverse events and product deficiencies, An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who has used the product or received the study treatment, regardless of the causal relationship with the product.

An adverse event can therefore be any untoward and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new disease or worsening of an existing disease) temporally associated with the use of the product or implementation of the study treatment., From day -16 to 24 weeks|Quality of Life (QOL) measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 is a quality-of-life instrument for use in international clinical trials in oncology. The QLQ-C30 incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale., Up to 4 weeks|QOL assessed by the EORTC QLQ-OG 25, EORTC QLQ-OG25 questionnaire is a quality-of-life instrument for use in patients with esophagogastric cancers. The QLQ-OG25 has six scales, dysphagia, eating restrictions, reflux, odynophagia, pain and anxiety., Up to 24 weeks
This study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of CLS2702C/D in patients who plan to undergo ESD for superficial esophageal cancer.

In this study, the efficacy and safety of CLS2702C (cell sheet) transplanted (applied) to the wound site after ESD using CLS2702D (transplantation device) will be evaluated.
