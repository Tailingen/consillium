Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy With Weekly Paclitaxel and Vinorelbine and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) Support in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility based on toxicity and response rate of giving paclitaxel weekly with concomitant every-other week radiotherapy to limit skin toxicity. This study will also seek to determine the maximally tolerated dose of Navelbine added to this combination when followed by Filgrastim and the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen.
