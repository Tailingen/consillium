Almonertinib With Chemotherapy in mEGFR NSCLC
The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication called Almonertinib when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Almonertinib Pemetrexed/Cisplatin
PFS, Progression-free survival, The primary analysis of Progressionfree survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment will occur when PFS maturity is observed at approximately 33 months
In total the study aims to enroll approximately 36 patients who will receive almonertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. The study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre.
