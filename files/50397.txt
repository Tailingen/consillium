Circulating microRNAs in Small Testicular Masses and Retroperitoneal Post-chemotherapy Residual Masses.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating microRNAs in detecting the presence of germ cell cancer in patients with small testicular mass or retroperitoneal post-chemotherapy residual mass and suitable for testis sparing surgery and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, respectively.
