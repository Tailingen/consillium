Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Subjects Treated With PROVENGE® + One Infusion of Sipuleucel-T
A multicenter, open-label, prospective study to investigate immune boost response changes in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
DRUG: Sipuleucel-T Injection
Assess humoral immune response to PAP and PA2024 after booster infusion, To assess the humoral response ((i.e. antibody titer) to PAP and PA2024 after booster infusion in subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have received a single booster dose of sipuleucel-T vs those subjects who have not, Once all subjects have completed the study through the 5 year Overall Survival Period|Geometric Mean Ration of the difference in Humor Response, The difference in humoral response to PAP and/or PA2024 after booster infusion (measured approximately 2 weeks after receipt of booster) assessed by Geometric Mean Ratio of the difference between humoral response at each timepoint and after booster within and between the groups.Subjects will be evaluated for IgG and IgM antibody responses by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and both the antibody titer as well as percent maintaining an antibody response, as determined by number of subjects with an antibody titer greater that the 9th percentile at baseline, will be compared between booster and control arms, Once all subjects have completed the study through the 5 year Overall Survival Period
Evaluate the incidence of adverse events including laboratory abnormalities after a single booster does of sipuleucel-T, For all subjects enrolled in the study. Evaluation will include descriptive statistics by treatment arm and in the aggregate of the incidence of adverse events (Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), and the incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (Number of participants experiencing clinically significant laboratory abnormalities) after initial treatment and booster (Week 28) within and between groups., Once all subjects have completed the study through the 5 year Overall Survival Period
Assess biomarkers of response to treatment, Biomarkers, such as cytokines, will be assessed for response to booster treatment using appropriate descriptive statistics assessed over time and at Week 28. Nominal p-values will be provided without multiplicity adjustment .appropriate descriptive statistics assessed over time and at Week 28., Once all subjects have completed the study through the 5 year Overall Survival Period|Assess Antigen Response, Comparison of (over time and at Week 38), the number of subjects per treatment arm with PAP and PA2024 antigen antigen positive response using descriptive statistics., Once all subjects have completed the study through the 5 year Overall Survival Period
Those enrolled in the Booster Study will have had their course of treatment with PROVENGE® immunotherapy and then randomized to the Booster Study to be treated with a single booster dose of sipuleucel-T.
