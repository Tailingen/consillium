Self-Compassion Scale, In order to determine the self-compassion levels of the patients participating in the study, the Self-Compassion Scale, which was developed by Neff (2003) (Neff, 2003) and adapted to Turkish by Akın, Akın and Abacı (2007) (Akın et al., 2007), was used. The English form of the Self-Compassion Scale consists of 26 items and 6 subscales. These subscales are self-compassion, isolation, awareness of sharing, self-judgment, over-identification and mindfulness. The self-kindness sub-dimension includes items 2, 6, 13, 17, 21, the self-judgment sub-dimension includes items 4, 7, 15, 20, 26, the awareness of sharing sub-dimension includes items 1, 8, 12, 22, the isolation sub-dimension includes items 5, 11, 19, 25, the conscious awareness sub-dimension includes items 9, 14, 18, 23, and the over-identification sub-dimension includes items 3, 10, 16, 24. The scale is a 5-point Likert-type scale with the ratings "1 Never", "2 Rarely", "3 Often", "4 Usually", "5 Always". The factor loadings in all, Change from before implementation, after practice is completed (1th week)|Mindful Self-Care Scale (MSCS), The scale, developed by Cook-Cottone and Guyker in 2018, consists of 33 items covering self-care behaviors (Cook-Cottone and Guyker, 2018). The scale consists of 5-point Likert-type questions and only the 6th item is reverse coded. The sub-dimensions of the scale consist of physical care, supportive relationships, conscious awareness, self-compassion and purpose, conscious relaxation, and supportive structure. As the scores obtained from the scale increase, it is seen that the individual's self-care skills are high. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.89 overall, 0.69 for physical care, 0.86 for supportive relationships, 0.92 for awareness, 0.83 for self-compassion and purpose, 0.77 for conscious relaxation, and 0.77 for the supportive structure subscales. The scale was adapted to Turkish by Aydın Sünbül and colleagues in 2018 (Aydın Sünbül et al., 2018). After adaptation to Turkish, the scale maintained its subdimensions, while the internal consistency, Change from before implementation, after practice is completed (1th week)
Brief Self-compassion Program will be held in a face-to-face hospital environment for the patients with colorectal cancer in the experimental group. This training program has been developed based on the concepts of Mindfulness-Based Compassionate Living and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Programs. The content and topics of the sessions in the program are arranged according to the conceptual structure and flow of the mindfulness-based model. The training program was created in a certain flow, based on the introduction to a short self-compassion program (1 sessions), the importance of self-compassion and self-care in the cancer experience (1 sessions), a self-compassionate approach to challenging emotions and situations (1 sessions). There are 3 sessions in the program and the frequency of sessions is 3 times a week, and each session lasts approximately 45 minutes. The training program will be applied to 33 patients with colorectal cancer in the experimental group.
