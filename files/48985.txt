Safety and Anti-Tumor Study of Oral EPI-506 for Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I (Dose Escalation) and Part II (Dose Expansion). In Part I, patients will participate in single, multiple, and long-term dosing periods using EPI-506 to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, the maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary indications of anti-tumor activity. Part I is an open-label, adaptive 3 + 3 design, dose-escalation study. Approximately six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at 80 mg/day. Enrolled patients may be allowed to escalate to a subsequent dose cohort after their initial twelve weeks. Additional patients may be enrolled at any safe dose level prior to or concurrent with enrolling patients in Part II.

In Part II, 3 patient populations; post-abiraterone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but enzalutamide-naïve, post-enzalutamide mCRPC but abiraterone-naïve, and post-abiraterone and enzalutamide mCRPC will be studied at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Part I over 12 weeks of daily dosing. Approximately 120 patients (40 in each cohort) will be enrolled.

The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I (Dose Escalation) and Part II (Dose Expansion). In Part I, patients will participate in single, multiple, and long-term dosing periods using EPI-506 to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, the maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary indications of anti-tumor activity. Part I is an open-label, adaptive 3 + 3 design, dose-escalation study. Approximately six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at 80 mg/day. Enrolled patients may be allowed to escalate to a subsequent dose cohort after their initial twelve weeks. Additional patients may be enrolled at any safe dose level prior to or concurrent with enrolling patients in Part II.

In Part II, 3 patient populations; post-abiraterone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but enzalutamide-naïve, post-enzalutamide mCRPC but abiraterone-naïve, and post-abiraterone and enzalutamide mCRPC will be studied at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined in Part I over 12 weeks of daily dosing. Approximately 120 patients (40 in each cohort) will be enrolled.
