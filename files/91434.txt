Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Radiotherapy Combined With Ripretinib in the Treatment of Unresectable Advanced GIST
The goal of this prospective study is to learn whether there is a synergistic effect when radiotherapy is combined with ripretinib in the treatment of patients with unresectable advanced GIST. It will also learn about the safety of this regimen.The main questions it aim to answer is: Dose radiotherapy combined with ripretinib prolong the time to disease progression for patients with advanced GIST?
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
RADIATION: simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy combined with ripretinib
Time to disease progression of irradiated lesions, Time from start of radiotherapy to progression of irradiated lesions, Approximately 12 months since the first subject enrolled
Time to disease progression of any lesions, Time from start of radiotherapy to progression of any lesions, Approximately 12 months since the first subject enrolled|Overall survival (OS), the time from start of radiotherapy to all-cause death., Approximately 12 months since the first subject enrolled|Objective Response Rate(ORR) of irradiated lesions, the percentage of patients whose efficacy is confirmed as complete response(CR) or partial responses(PR) based on mRECIST 1.1, Approximately 12 months since the first subject enrolled
ripretinib is the standard fourth-line treatment agent for inoperable advanced GIST patients, but the mPFS is only 6.3 months. Prolonging the time to TKI resistance by using a new treatment approach is important to increase the chances of surgery ,improve the survival time, and quality of life for patients. GIST was previously thought to be a tumor that was insensitive to radiotherapy, but a growing number of studies have shown that GIST is moderately sensitive to radiotherapy and that radiotherapy is effective in controlling the tumor. In our previous work, palliative radiotherapy was given to patients with advanced GIST after multiline drug resistance, and we achieved local control for nearly 2 years while significantly improving the patient's symptoms .

In recent years, radiotherapy technology has been continuously improved, and new radiotherapy techniques can be more precise and have less impact on surrounding organs, making it possible to increase the dose of radiotherapy. For large GIST, our research team has optimized the radiotherapy technique by using simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique, which can deliver a safe dose at the edge of the tumor while delivering a high dose of radiotherapy at the center of the tumor, ensuring safety and resulting in better therapeutic effects.

We proposed to select some patients with unresectable advanced GIST to explore the feasibility of radiotherapy combined with TKI for the treatment of advanced GIST after failure of first-, second-, and third-line drug therapies with simultaneous addition of radiotherapy to oral ripretinib treatment
