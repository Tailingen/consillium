HIPEC in the Treatment of Stage IIc-IV Epithelial Ovarian Cancer After CRS (HIPECOC)
This study evaluate the Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy(HIPEC) in the treatment of Stage IIc-IV epithelial Ovarian Cancer after primary Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS).Half participants will receive HIPEC twice with one intravenous chemotherapy and 5 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel after CRS. Half participants will receive 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel after CRS.
Ovarian Cancer|Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
PROCEDURE: Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced ovarian cancer undergoing primary tumor cell depletion (HIPEC) during surgery., From the date of random enrollment to the date of tumor progression or death. The appearance of the new lesion was taken as the criterion of progression, and the date of the first measurable observation of the new lesion was the marker of progression.ovarian cancer undergoing primary tumor cell depletion (HIPEC) during surgery., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, now recognized as the most effective treatment is maximizing tumor reduction (cytoreductice surgery, CRS) within the abdominal cavity with platinum-based chemotherapy (intraperitoneal chemotherapy, IPEC) or intravenous chemotherapy.

Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) refers to the chemotherapy drugs will be diluted and heated to the specified temperature (usually the 42 degrees), then injected into the abdominal cavity, maintain a constant temperature, repeated perfusion filling, so as to achieve the purpose of prevention and treatment of intra-abdominal tumors of a way of treatment.

CRS combined with HIPEC is the most effective treatment strategy for peritoneal cancer at present.
