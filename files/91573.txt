A Single Arm, Phase II Study of Simvastatin Plus XELOX and Bevacizumab as First-line Chemotherapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
1. Study Objectives 1) Primary Objective: Progression-free survival 2) Secondary Objectives:

   1. overall survival
   2. response rate
   3. incidence, nature and severity of all adverse events
   4. lipid lowering effect of simvastatin
   5. exploratory biomarker analysis : angiopoietin 2, BiP (Binding protein), Hsp (Heat shck protein) 90α
2. Study hypothesis In our recent in vitro study, addition of simvastatin to bevacizumab reduced proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation of endothelial cell. Moreover, colorectal cancer cell media which was treated with simvastatin combined with bevacizumab inhibited endothelial cell invasion and it was associated with decreased mediator of angiogenesis, such as angiopoietin 2, BiP and HSP 90α.. Treatment with bevacizumab and simvastatin more reduced the growth of xenograft tumors compared with bevacizumab alone.
3. Assessments 1) Safety : physical examination, vital signs, body weight, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, clinical laboratory evaluation (chemistry, blood cell count) and any AE (adverse effect) graded by using CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects ) v 4.0 2) Efficacy : progression-free survival and overall survival will be collected. Response rate according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1,1 guideline will also be evaluated 3) PFS (Progression free survival): time from randomization to tumor progression or death 4) OS (Overall survival) : time from randomization to death or last follow-up 5) Biomarker analysis; The correlation between blood level, protein expression of angiopoietin 2, BiP, Hsp90α and clinical response will be explored.
