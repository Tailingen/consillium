Phase 1 Study of GEN2 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Protocol GVO-1102 is a phase 1, open label, multi-center study in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study includes two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion. In the dose escalation phase, GEN2 will be administered at increasing dose levels via intravenous infusion or intratumoral injection on Days 1, 3 and 8 every 4 weeks. Valganciclovir will start dosing on Day 12 and continue for 10 days (through Day 21). Once a recommended dose has been defined in approximately 35-45 patients, the dose expansion phase will initiate to further assess intravenous administration of GEN2 in specific tumor types. Approximately 15 patients per tumor type will be enrolled in the intravenous dose expansion phase.
Solid Tumor, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: GEN2 + Valganciclovir
Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GEN2 by intravenous infusion and intratumoral injection., The RP2D will be determined by evaluating the number of subjects with treatment related adverse events and Dose Limiting Toxicities, First 28 days.
Safety and tolerability as assessed by adverse event monitoring, Adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity (graded by NCI CTCAE v 5.0), timing, seriousness and relationship to study therapy, Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Intravenous Administration Cohorts Only: area under the concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to 48 hours after dosing (AUC48h), AUC48h will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected, Up to 24 months|PK - Intravenous Administration Cohorts Only: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 24 months|To assess replication competent retrovirus (RCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Up to 36 months|To assess vector integration into genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of PBMCs, Up to 36 months|Overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors Version 1.1) by Investigator Review, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response with confirmation status is rated as (confirmed or unconfirmed) complete response (CR) or (confirmed or unconfirmed) partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months|Disease control rate including a best overall response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or stable disease (SD), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response with confirmation status is rated as (confirmed or unconfirmed) CR, (confirmed or unconfirmed) PR or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is measured from the day the criteria are first met for time point overall response rated as CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date of documented radiological disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death in the absence of progression., Up to 24 months|Assess the immunogenicity of GEN2, Serial blood samples will be screened for anti-vector antibodies (AVAs) and neutralizing antibodies, Up to 24 months
GEN2 is a non-replicating off-the-shelf gene therapy vector product being developed as a cancer immunotherapy to activate a patient's immune system against their personal cancer antigens (neoantigens). The vector payload encodes for a suicide gene, an enhanced viral thymidine kinase enzyme (HSV-eTK), which in the presence of a prodrug, valganciclovir, causes the tumor to release patient specific tumor antigens. These neoantigens in the presence of a human immune modulator cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF), results in the generation of immune effector cells. These effector cells maintain continually amplifying therapeutic immune responses as more tumor cells are killed and release antigen and will potentially kill any new tumor metastases that arise.
