TACE With or Without SBRT as Bridging Therapy for Pre-transplant HCC Patients
This trial is designed to be the initial prospective pilot investigation of the effectiveness of combined SBRT and TACE as bridging therapy for HCC patients awaiting liver transplanation. No prospective clinical trials regarding the combination of TACE and SBRT in pre-transplant population have been performed. We propose the trial be conducted as a pilot clinical trial with the goal of enrolling 40 patients into each arm
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: TACE transarterial chemoembolization|RADIATION: stereotatic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
Progression Free Survival, endpoint is OLT, 10 days
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of stereotatic body radiotherapy (SBRT) tand transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective "bridging therapy" for patients hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the liver awaiting transplantation.
