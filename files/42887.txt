Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose of Cabazitaxel, MTD was highest dose level of cabazitaxel at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable participants experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLT). DLT defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory values related to study treatment: hematologic DLTs: any Grade(G)4 hematologic toxicity except neutropenia G4 lasting≤7 days,G3 or 4 febrile neutropenia except G3 or 4 febrile neutropenia in absence of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor prophylaxis, G4 thrombocytopenia; non-hematologic DLTs:any G≥3 non-hematologic toxicity except G3 nausea or G3 or4 vomiting, G3 or4 diarrhea,G3 or4 dehydration,G3 fatigue lasting≤7 days, inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions, elevated transaminases\<10\* upper limit of normal of ≤7 days, re-treatment delay of\>2 weeks due to delayed recovery from toxicity related to study treatment to baseline G or≤ G1(except for alopecia) and platelet transfusion during Cycle1. Grades based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0., Cycle 1 (21 days)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), OR in participants was defined as the participants with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) after 3 cycles of cabazitaxel treatment and maintained for at least 4 weeks. CR and PR were based on modified response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria for participants with CNS tumors. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of target lesions, compared to the baseline measurement., Baseline, every 9 weeks until DP or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as time (in days) from date of first response until date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or death (from any cause), whichever came first. If progression or death was not observed, participant was censored at the date of participant's last progression-free tumor assessment prior to study cut-off date. PD as per RANO criteria was defined as ≥ 25% increase in the product of perpendicular diameters of any target lesion, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (example, anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, presumed post-therapy swelling etc.) plus any increase in tumor cross-sectional area (or tumor volume)., Baseline, every 9 weeks until DP or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)
Phase 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in grade or became serious during the on-treatment period which was defined as the period from the time of first dose of cabazitaxel until 30 days following the last administration of cabazitaxel., Baseline up to DP or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 112.1 weeks for Phase 1 and 12.1 weeks for Phase 2)|Phase 1: Number of Participants With Objective Response, OR in participants was defined as the participants with a CR or PR after 3 cycles of cabazitaxel treatment and maintained for at least 4 weeks as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and RANO criteria for CNS tumors. For solid tumors, as per RECIST 1.1, CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (any pathological lymph nodes, must had reduction in short axis to \<10 mm); PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. For CNS tumors, as per RANO criteria, CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR defined as a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of target lesions, compared to baseline measurement., Baseline, every 9 weeks until DP or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 112.1 weeks)|Phase 1 and 2: Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of Cabazitaxel: Area Under the Plasma Concentration (AUC) Versus Time Curve, Blood samples for PK parameters were collected at 5 minutes before end of infusion (EOI), 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 7 hours and 71 hours after the EOI on Day 1 of Cycle 1., Day 1 of Cycle 1: 5 minutes before EOI up to 71 hours after the EOI|Phase 1 and 2: PK Parameter of Cabazitaxel: Total Plasma Clearance (CL), Blood samples for PK parameters were collected at 5 minutes before EOI, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 7 hours and 71 hours after the EOI on Day 1 of Cycle 1., Day 1 of Cycle 1: 5 minutes before EOI up to 71 hours after the EOI|Phase 1 and 2: PK Parameter of Cabazitaxel: Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss), Blood samples for PK parameters were collected at 5 minutes before EOI, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 7 hours and 71 hours after the EOI on Day 1 of Cycle 1., Day 1 of Cycle 1: 5 minutes before EOI up to 71 hours after the EOI|Phase 1 and 2: PK Parameter of Cabazitaxel: Maximum Plasma Concentration Observed (Cmax), Blood samples for PK parameters were collected at 5 minutes before EOI, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 7 hours and 71 hours after the EOI on Day 1 of Cycle 1., Day 1 of Cycle 1: 5 minutes before EOI up to 71 hours after the EOI|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), The PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose administration until the date of first documented PD or death (from any cause), whichever came first. If progression or death was not observed, the participant was censored at the date of the participant's last progression-free tumor assessment prior to the study cut-off date. PD as per RANO criteria was defined as ≥25% increase in the product of perpendicular diameters of any target lesion, taking as reference the smallest product observed since the start of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression (example, anticonvulsant or corticosteroid toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, presumed post-therapy swelling etc) plus any increase in tumor cross-sectional area (or tumor volume). The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline, every 9 weeks until DP or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first dose administration until the date of death (from any cause). If death was not observed, the participant was censored at the earliest of the last date the participant was known to be alive and the study cut-off date. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline up to death or study cut-off (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)
The study duration will include a period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks and a 3-week treatment cycle(s). The participants may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up.
