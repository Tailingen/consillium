Clinical Study to Evaluate Debio0123 + Sacituzumab Govitecan Combination in TNBC or HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
The WIN-B is an international, multicenter, single-arm, phase Ib/II study to evaluate the safety and activity of the Debio 0123 and Sacituzumab govitecan combination therapy in patients with pre-treated advanced/metastatic TNBC or HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Phase Ib will explore if the addition of increasing doses of Debio 0123 to Sacituzumab govitecan is safe and active in pre-treated advanced/metastatic TNBC and HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. The Debio 0123's recomendad phase 2 doses (RP2D) obtained during phase Ib will then be administered in combination with Sacituzumab govitecan in phase II of the study.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Debio 0123 and Sacituzumab govitecan
Phase Ib - Debio 0123's recommended phase II dose (RP2D) when administered in combination with Sacituzumab govitecan in patients with TNBC or HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer., The RP2D of Debio 0123 when used in combination with Sacituzumab govitecan will be determined based upon evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse events (AEs) and other available data from secondary endpoints., Baseline up to 42 days.|Phase II - Efficacy in terms of objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST v.1.1 in each cohort., ORR, defined as the rate of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined locally by the investigator using RECIST v.1.1 in patients with TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer., Approximately 9 months from baseline.
Safety and tolerability., Measures will include AEs and treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), including NCI CTCAE v5.0 severity grade and relationship to study drugs., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Preliminary objective response rate (ORR) in TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., ORR, defined as the rate of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined locally by the Investigator., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Efficacy in terms of PFS as per RANO-BM for intracranial lesions and RECIST v.1.1 for extracranial lesions in patients with metastatic TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., PFS, defined as the period from treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined locally by the Investigator., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on local Investigator assessment as per RANO-BM for intracranial lesions and RECIST v.1.1 for extracranial and overall lesions in TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., CBR, defined as the rate of patients with an objective response (CR or PR), or stable disease for at least 24 weeks, based on local Investigator assessment in all patients., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Time to response (TTR) based on local Investigator assessment as per RANO-BM for intracranial lesions and RECIST v.1.1 for extracranial and overall lesions in TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., TTR, defined as the period from start of treatment to time of the first objective tumor response (tumor shrinkage of ≥ 30%) observed for patients who achieved a BOR of CR or PR, based on local Investigator assessment in all patients., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Duration of response (DoR) based on local Investigator assessment as per RANO-BM for intracranial lesions and RECIST v.1.1 for extracranial in TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., DoR, defined as the period from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, based on local Investigator assessment in all patients., Approximately 9 months from baseline.|Efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) as per RECIST v.1.1 in TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients., OS, defined as the period from treatment initiation to death from any cause, as determined locally by the investigator in patients with TNBC and HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer., Approximately 9 months from baseline.
This is an international, multicenter, open-label, single arm, phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate Debio 0123's RP2D when administered in combination with Sacituzumab govitecan, safety and efficacy of this combination therapy in advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with TNBC or HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer relapsing after one or two lines of treatment are eligible to participate in the study.

In the phase Ib of the study the investigators will recruit 12-24 patients with TNBC or HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer and the dose escalation will follow pre-defined dose levels, starting at DL1. In the phase II, 26 patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC and 26 patients with HR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer will be treated with Debio 0123's RP2D plus 10 mg/kg of Sacituzumab govitecan. Patients will be treated until disease progression, discontinuation for any reason or study termination.
