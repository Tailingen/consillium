Ovarian Function of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Women Survivors
This is an observational cohort study aimed to explore the fertility concerns, fertility preservation strategies, fertility status (pregnancy and Ovarian Failure) and birth outcome among young woman Nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Premature Ovarian Failure (POF), Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) was defined as menopause before age 40 years. Menopause was defined as cessation of menstruation at least 1 year before the date of the survey in the absence of pregnancy, breastfeeding, continuous use of progestagens or other medication causing amenorrhea, or surgical removal of uterus and/ or ovaries., 3 years after Radiotherapy
Progress-Free Survival (PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of registration to the date of the first progress at any site., 3 years after Radiotherapy|Pregnancy and birth outcome, The pregnancy history and pregnancy outcome of female Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients before diagnosis of NPC would be investigate Within 6 months of diagnosis.

The pregnancy events and birth outcome of female NPC patients after diagnosis of NPC would be investigate among 3 to 5years after Radiotherapy., Within 6 month of diagnosis, or 3-5years after Radiotherapy|Overall Survival (OS), The Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the duration from the date of registration assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years after Radiotherapy|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival (LRFS), The Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival (LRFS) is evaluated and calculated from the date of registration until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit, 3 years after Radiotherapy|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of registration until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years after Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy on ovarian function and pregnancy outcome after treatment in female survivors of non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, so as to clarify the relationship between ovarian dysfunction after treatment and pregnancy outcome, as well as clarify the relationship between pregnancy after treatment and tumour progression.
