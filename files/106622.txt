Trial of Forodesine in Patients With Relapsed B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
To determine the dose and duration of treatment for the best overall response with Forodesine in relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Forodesine
To determine the dose and duration of treatment for the best achievable overall response and partial responders with forodesine in relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-Cll)
Assess safety & tolerability of forodesine in B-CLL in vitro sensitivity to forodesine & drug combinations including forodesine of peripheral lymphocytes of patients enrolled in study & to correlate these in vitro findings with clinical response
An open label, multi centre, three arm, dose finding Phase 1 trial with Forodesine as a single drug treatment in patients with relapsed CLL to establish dose and duration of treatment resulting in the best achievable response with Forodesine as a single drug treatment.
