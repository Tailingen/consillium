A Study of LY3484356 in Women With Breast Cancer Before Having Surgery
The purpose for this study is to see if the study drug, LY3484356, is safe and to determine what effects it has on breast cancer in participants with Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER+), HER2 Negative (HER2-) early stage (stage I-III) breast cancer, when given prior to surgery. Participation in this study could last up to 2.5 months.
