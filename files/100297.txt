Adapting Treatment to the Tumor Molecular Alterations for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors: MyOwnSpecificTreatment
The MOST Plus study is a two-period phase II clinical trial, conducted in patients with all types of progressive solid tumors after at least 1 prior systemic treatment regimen for advanced disease (in the absence of a validated second line therapy).

The main goal of this study is to evaluate for these patients the clinical benefit of a maintenance treatment in patients with stable disease (SD) after induction treatment with a selected therapy (Molecular Targeted Therapy (MTT) or with SD, partial response (PR) or complete reponse (CR) with Immunotherapy (IT)).

For MTT, the first period of this trial (induction period) will enable to establish whether the identification of genomic alterations in genes encoding for "actionable" targets in the tumor cells, regardless of the histological subtype, can be used to select efficient treatment targeting the pathway activated by the mutation.

For Immunotherapy, induction period with durvalumab + tremelimumab is expected to be an innovative therapy for an efficient tumor control and may allow to identify types of cancer or molecular types of cancer that are more receptive to immunotherapy.

For all treatments, the second period (maintenance period) will use a randomized design to evaluate the clinical benefit of a maintenance treatment with the targeted therapy or immunotherapy selected based on tumor molecular profile in patients treated by MTT with SD and in patients treated by IT with SD, PR or CR.

Each patient enrolled will receive the matching targeted therapy during 12 weeks (MTT) or 52 weeks (IT). At the end of this induction period:

MTT cohorts :

* patients with a tumor response (CR: complete response or PR: partial response) will continue the targeted therapy,
* patients in progression will discontinue the targeted therapy and will be withdrawn from study and oriented towards standard treatments
* patients with a stable disease at 12 weeks will be randomized in order to determine if they continue or stop the therapy.

IT cohort :

- patients with SD, PR or CR at 52 weeks will be randomized in order to determine if they continue or stop the therapy.

For each MTT treatment group: \~80 patients treated in the first step (induction period), 50 patients randomized in the second step (maintenance period, 25 patients per arm).

For IT treatment group: \~125 patients treated in the first step (induction period), 50 patients randomized in the second step (maintenance period, 25 patients per arm).

In total (for 7 treatment groups): \~ 900 patients treated in the induction period and 350 patients randomized in maintenance period.

Induction Progression-Free Rate after induction treatment, The proportion of patients without documented disease progression within induction period (the first 12 weeks of study treatment or 52 weeks for IT)., 12 weeks for MTT or 52 weeks for IT after initiation of study treatment|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in both study arms after randomization, Measured from the date of randomization until the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death from any cause. Patients with no event at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last available tumor assessment., 16 weeks after randomisation date
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response over the induction period., Over the induction period|Overall survival (OS), from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause|Patient's quality of life score (QLQ-C30) in both arms after randomization, At randomization (week 12 for MTT or week 52 for IT), 16 weeks after randomisation (week 28 for MTT or week 68 for IT) and end of study for patient (week 136 for MTT or until up to 130 months after treatment start for IT)|Safety assessment, Type, frequency, seriousness and causality of adverse events reported from treatment initiation based on the common toxicity criteria grade (NCI CTC-AE-V4.03), Over the whole study
Duration of response (exploratory outcome), Measured from the time of first documented response (CR or PR) until the first documented disease progression or death due to underlying cancer, and censored at the date of the last available tumor assessment, Over the whole study|Medico-economic evaluation: cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis, Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be expressed as:

* the cost per life year gained;
* the cost per progression-free year gained., From randomization until patient's end of study|Progression Free Survival (exploratory outcome), Measured from the date of the first administration of the treatment until the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death from any cause. Patients with no event at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last available tumor assessment., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Molecular evolution of tumor at progression (for olaparib and durvalumab + tremelimumab groups), ctDNA analysis, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
