Paclitaxel With or Without Gemcitabine in Treating Women With Advanced Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if paclitaxel is more effective with or without gemcitabine for advanced breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine in treating women who have advanced breast cancer.
