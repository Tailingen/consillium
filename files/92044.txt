Adebrelimab and Concurrent Radiochemotherapy as First-line Treatment for Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
Patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) have poor prognosis, with limited treatment options. Chemo-immunotherapy is the standard 1st-line therapy for patients with ES-SCLC.When 4 cycles of etoposide+carboplatin (EC) or etoposide+cisplatin(EP) chemotherapy combined with PD-L1 inhibitor are effective, guidelines recommend additional thoracic radiotherapy.

In this study, the investigators bring radiotherapy forward, which means that after 2 cycles of EC chemotherapy plus Adebrelimab, participants with response（PR/CR/SD）will receive concurrent radiotherapy and 2 cycles of EC chemotherapy plus Adebrelimab, then maintenance therapy with Adebrelimab （Q3W）.

The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of Adebrelimab combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in untreated participants with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

6-m PFS rate, 6-m PFS rate is defined as the percentage of participants whose disease is still progression-free at the 6th month, 6 months
ORR, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who have a CR or a PR, up to 24 months.|PFS, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first treatment to the first documented disease progression, From date of the first treatment to the first documented disease progression, assessed up to 24 months|OS, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first treatment to death due to any cause., From date of the first treatment to death due to any cause, assessed up to 24 months|12-m PFS rate, 12-m PFS rate is defined as the percentage of participants whose disease is still progression-free at the 12th month, 12 months|AEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, up to 24 months
Participants receive EC chemotherapy combined with Adebrelimab for 2 cycles, and the efficacy will be evaluated. If the efficacy evaluation is SD/PR/CR, concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with EC(2 cycles) + Adebrelimab will be initiated. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy + Adebrelimab, Adebrelimab was maintained until PD or intolerance or for at most 2 years.
