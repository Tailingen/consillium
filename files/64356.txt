A Study to Compare Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of GME751 and EU-authorized Keytruda in Adult Participants With Untreated Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GME751 compared with KeytrudaÂ® (pembrolizumab) in participants with untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC (irrespective of PD-L1 status), without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations.
Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: GME751|DRUG: Keytruda-EU
Best Overall Response (BOR), Best Overall Response (BOR) of either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) up to 9 months according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Blinded Central Imaging, up to 9 months from date of randomization
Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either GME751, or European Union (EU)-authorized pembrolizumab (Keytruda-EU) in combination with chemotherapy. The maximum study duration for a participant will be approximately 56 weeks including screening.

Treatment duration is 52 weeks (17 treatment cycles of study treatment GME751 or Keytruda-EU in combination with chemotherapy, each cycle with a duration of 3 weeks).

Participants will discontinue study participation in case of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons.

Participants who are benefiting from treatment with pembrolizumab without signs of progression or unacceptable toxicity will be eligible for continued pembrolizumab treatment via most suitable option based on the respective country regulations.
