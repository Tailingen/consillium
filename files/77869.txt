An Immunogenic Personal Neoantigen Vaccine for Cancer Treatment
Despite years of preclinical efforts and hundreds of clinical studies, therapeutic cancer vaccines with the routine ability to limit or eliminate tumor growth in humans have been elusive. With advances in genome sequencing, it is now possible to identify a new class of tumor-specific antigens derived from mutated proteins that are present only in the tumor. These "neoantigens" should provide highly specific targets for antitumor immunity. Although many challenges remain in producing and testing neoantigen-based vaccines customized for each patient, a neoantigen vaccine offers a promising new approach to induce highly focused antitumor T cells aimed at eradicating cancer cells
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: tumor neoantigen
Safety of the immunogenic personal neoantigen vaccine, The incidence of serious adverse events, 1.5 years
Disease control rate, It is defined as the proportion of complete response, partial response and stable disease, 1 year
1. Methods of vaccine storage and transportation: as a special biological product, the vaccine should be stored at 2-8 â„ƒ to protect the efficacy (titer) of the vaccine from being damaged.All vaccines must be stored and transported at temperatures that meet regulatory requirements.A cold chain system is required to support and monitor the temperature at all stages of the vaccine from production to final inoculation (aircraft, ship, train, automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, walking, etc.);Cold storage, refrigerator, vaccine transport box, cold pack, ice bar, etc.) to avoid overheating or over-cooling.
2. Treatment plan: intramuscular injection of vaccines of D1, D4, D7, D14, D21, D51, D142 of the deltoid muscle of the left and right upper arm, every six months for the next 3 years, and every year for the next 3 years, until the patient withdrew from the clinical study or the study was discontinued.
