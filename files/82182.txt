Rituximab EfFicacy IN MyasthEnia Gravis (REFINE)
The primary objective of this phase III trial is to investigate if Rituximab can reduce patients' functional impairment caused by MG. The secondary objectives of this trial are to assess whether treatment with rituximab in patients with MG will:

* Allow faster and greater corticosteroid tapering
* Reduce the frequency of exacerbations
* Improve quality of life
* Offer an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: Rituximab|OTHER: Placebo
To assess whether rituximab can reduce MG-related functional impairment., Change from baseline in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score (QMG) at week 12 (3 months) of the RCP.

QMG score 0 - 39 A higher score means a worse outcome, 12 weeks
To evaluate the effect of rituximab on corticosteroid usage., Change in corticosteroid dosage from week 12 to the end of the RCP., 48 weeks|To evaluate the effect of rituximab on MG-related disability., Change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at week 12.

MG-ADL score 0 - 24 A higher score means a worse outcome, 12 weeks
