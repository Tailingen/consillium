Social Media-Based Education on Cancer Screening Awareness in Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial
This randomized controlled trial investigates the impact of a social media-based educational program on women's knowledge, attitudes, and digital health literacy regarding breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings. The intervention is based on the Socio-Ecological Model and aims to improve awareness and screening participation. Participants in the intervention group receive daily educational content for 8 weeks via social media platforms (WhatsApp/Instagram), while the control group receives two standard online education sessions via Microsoft Teams app. The study includes 132 women aged 30 to 70 in Türkiye who have not previously participated in cancer screenings. The primary outcomes include changes in cancer knowledge, attitudes, and digital health literacy levels measured by validated scales.

This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of a social media-based educational intervention on women's knowledge, attitudes, and digital health literacy regarding cancer screenings. The trial will include 132 women between the ages of 30 and 70 who have never undergone breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening. Participants are recruited through health institutions and randomized into two parallel groups: the intervention group and the control group.

The educational intervention was developed in accordance with the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM), incorporating individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy-level messages. The intervention group receives 56 infographics and/or videos total over 8 weeks via closed WhatsApp and Instagram groups. The content includes evidence-based information on cancer epidemiology, risk factors, symptoms, screening methods, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and digital health tools such as e-Nabız and MHRS.

The control group receives traditional education via two 40-minute online sessions (1 week apart), covering the same content without daily engagement. The outcomes will be measured using validated instruments to assess changes in participants' knowledge of cancer screenings, their attitudes towards screening, and their digital health literacy. Data collection will take place before and after the intervention period. The study has been approved by the Istanbul Medipol University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Approval Number: E-10840098-202.3.02-7880).

This research is expected to contribute to public health strategies that use digital platforms to enhance cancer screening behaviors and improve health literacy among women.
