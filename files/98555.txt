A Study of the Safety and Pharmacology of MetMAb (PRO143966), a Monovalent Antagonist Antibody to the Receptor C-Met, Administered Intravenously in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open label, dose-escalation study of MetMAb administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in patients with advanced solid malignancies that are refractory to or for which there is no standard of care. The study consists of a dose-escalation stage, an expansion stage testing MetMAb at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), and a dose-escalation stage testing the combination of MetMAb, at two different doses with bevacizumab at a recommended dose.
