Single-institution Register of Individuals Undergoing Cancer Genetic Risk Assessment
Single-centre, retrospective, prospective observational cohort study, based on the registration of data from users of the Oncology Genetics Outpatient Clinic
Genetic Predisposition to Cancer
Register and follow up over time individuals assessed for suspected genetic predisposition to cancer, Register and follow up over time individuals assessed for suspected genetic predisposition to cancer, 15 years
Possibility of conducting studies targeted at specific objectives, Acquire information that can be used for conducting specific studies aimed at clarifying the various uncertainties that still characterize these cancer diseases due to genetic predisposition, 15 years
The primary objective of this study is to establish a register to collect and update over time the clinical, genetic and socio-demographic data of all patients who will be assessed for a suspected oncological genetic predisposition, in order to acquire information that can be used for conducting specific studies aimed at clarifying the various uncertainties that still characterise these diseases, such as the clinical significance and the genotype-phenotype correlations of many alterations in oncological predisposition genes oncological predisposition genes, the clinical and bio-pathological features predictive of a significant probability of identifying mutations in these genes, the efficacy of surveillance and prevention measures undertaken to reduce the risk oncological risk according to guidelines, the effectiveness of oncological therapies in patients with hereditary tumours in comparison with those with sporadic neoplasms sporadic neoplasms, risk perception, emotional impact and also interpersonal experiences associated with oncological genetic risk assessment.

These are objectives of primary interest to both the patient and public health (given the general frequency of oncological diseases), because the information acquired will make it possible to improve the general clinical management of all cancer patients and their families.
