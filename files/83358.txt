A Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Either Obinutuzumab Plus Bendamustine or Obinutuzumab Plus (+) Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (CHOP) in Participants With Follicular Lymphoma (FL) or Rituximab + CHOP in Participants With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in combination with either obinutuzumab + bendamustine (Atezo-G-benda) or obinutuzumab + CHOP (Atezo-G-CHOP) in participants with FL and atezolizumab + rituximab + chemotherapy (Atezo-R-CHOP) in participants with DLBCL, followed by post-induction treatment consisting of either atezolizumab plus obinutuzumab (Atezo-G) in participants with FL who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at end of induction (EOI) or atezolizumab alone in participants with DLBCL who achieve a CR at EOI.

DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Rituximab
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) at End of Induction (EOI), as Determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) Using Modified Lugano 2014 Criteria, Primary end point was positron emission tomography (PET) CR at EOI by IRC according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake less than or equal to \[\</=\] mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than \[\<\] mediastinum but \</=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-point scale (5-PS), for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/immunohistochemistry (IHC)-negative bone marrow morphology. All PET evaluable 1L FL and 1L DLBCL participants with at least one dose of atezolizumab were included in efficacy population., Up to approximately 6 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to approximately 4 years
