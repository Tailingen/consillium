Rebastinib Plus Antitubulin Therapy With Paclitaxel or Eribulin in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of rebastinib when combined with antitubulin therapy with paclitaxel or eribulin in patients with advanced breast cancer.

Recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D)., Arm A: To determine the recommended phase II dose (Arm A1 - dose escalation cohort) and overall safety profile (Arm A2 - expansion cohort) of Rebastinib (50 mg PO BID or 100 mg PO BID) given concurrently with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly x 12 ) over 3 consecutive weeks (1 cycle) in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Arm B: To determine the recommended phase II dose (Arm B1 - dose escalation cohort) and overall safety profile (Arm B2 - expansion cohort) of Rebastinib (50 mg PO BID or 100 mg PO BID) given concurrently with weekly eribulin (1.4 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days) over 3 consecutive weeks (1 cycle) in patients with metastatic breast cancer., After 1 treatment cycle (3 weeks) during dose escalation cohort (N=24)
Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Arm A1-2 and Arm B1-2 (evaluate separately for each arm): To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with Rebastinib plus paclitaxel, and Rebastinib plus eribulin (at all Rebastinib dose levels)., From treatment start until progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 36 months|Median Overall Survival (OS)., Arm A1-2 and Arm B1-2 (evaluate separately for each arm): To determine overall survival of patients treated with Rebastinib plus paclitaxel, and Rebastinib plus eribulin (at all Rebastinib dose levels)., From treatment start until death by any cause, assessed up to 36 months.|Clinical benefit rate, Arm A1-2 and Arm B1-2 (evaluate separately for each arm): To determine clinical benefit rate of patients treated with Rebastinib plus paclitaxel, and Rebastinib plus eribulin (at all Rebastinib dose levels)., Proportion of patients who achieved complete response or partial response for at least 24 weeks after study start.|Change of ANG1 and ANG2 levels, Arm A1-2 plus Arm B1-2 (evaluate combined dataset including both arms): To determine correlation between Rebastinib and angiopoietin (ANG1 and/or ANG2) levels (a surrogate marker for TIE2 inhibition), Before and after cycle 1( week 3) for each patient.|Change in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) levels., Arm A2 plus Arm B2: To perform an exploratory analysis of the effects of Rebastinib plus antitubulin therapy on circulating tumor cell (CTCs) during cycle 1, by comparing CTCs during cycle 1 in patients randomized to receive or not rebastinib during cycle 1., Before and after cycle 1( week 3) for each patient.|Change in TIE-2 expressing monocyte levels., Arm A2 plus Arm B2: To perform an exploratory analysis of the effects of Rebastinib plus antitubulin therapy on TIE-2 expressing monocytes (TEM) during cycle 1., Before and after cycle 1( week 3) for each patient.|Change in TMEM score., Arm A2 or Arm B2: To perform an exploratory analysis of the effects of Rebastinib plus antitubulin therapy on TMEM score and TMEM function in a cohort of up to 6 patients with metastatic cancer who have their primary tumor in place and are agreeable to up to 2 research biopsies of the primary tumor before and during (i.e., after 3 weeks of) Rebastinib therapy., Before and after cycle 1( week 3) for each patient.
Metastasis is the primary cause of death from breast cancer, invasive carcinoma cells in mouse and rat mammary tumors co-migrate accompanied by macrophages towards intravasation sites . The intravasation occurs at sites where a TIE2-expressing macrophage, a mena-expressing tumor cell, and an endothelial cell are in direct contact, forming a micro-anatomic structure called tumor micro-environment of metastasis (TMEM). Ablation of the presence or activity of the TMEM associated macrophages blocks intravasation at TMEM demonstrating an essential role of perivascular macrophages in TMEM function. Rebastinib, a TIE2 inhibitor , blocks TMEM assembly and function in-vivo and in-vitro assays. We hypothesize that rebastinib combined with antitubulin therapy (eribulin or paclitaxel) could improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer by preventing intravasation at TMEM sites and preventing further metastasis.
