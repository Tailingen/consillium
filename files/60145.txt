Fujifilm DBT Plus S-View Versus FFDM Alone in the Detection of Breast Cancer
The purpose of this pilot is to provide credible performance estimate information in order to conduct a subsequent pivotal reader study.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: DBT plus S-View|DEVICE: FFDM alone
Compare Per Subject Average Area Under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve (AUC), Compare per subject average area under the ROC curve (AUC) for DBT (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) plus S-View (Synthesized View) versus FFDM (Full Field Digital Mammography), based on per-subject POM (probability of malignancy) scores and requiring correct lesion localization. The primary endpoint was non-inferior per-subject average AUC. Statistician estimated AUCs for each reader in each review condition (FFDM, DBT plus S-View) based on per-subject POM scores requiring correct lesion localization. Statistician also calculated for each reader the non-parametric (trapezoidal) AUC for the FFDM read, the DBT plus S-View read, and the difference between them. These AUC's, differences between them, and the associated variance-covariance matrix were obtained using the method of DeLong, et al., 2 visits with 4 week washout period
This clinical research is a retrospective, pilot, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study with an enriched sample of 100 breast screening or diagnostic cases which were selected from the library of mammograms collected under Fujifilm protocol FMSU2013-004A (all subjects previously provided written informed consent agreeing their image data and supporting documentation could be used for future research and investigations). Approximately 6 qualified radiologists will independently perform two reads on all (approximately 100) cases. Each reader will read each case both as a FFDM (Full Field Digital Mammography) read, and a DBT (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis) plus S-View (Synthesized View) read on the ASPIRE Bellus II workstation.
