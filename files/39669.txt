Biomarkers to Detect Endocrine Therapy Resistance
This pilot observational study is being done to identify possible biomarkers of response to endocrine therapy in patients with ER/PR+ metastatic lobular breast cancer (LBC) starting new endocrine therapy. 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FFNP-PET/CT) and liquid biopsies will be performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. Baseline levels and dynamic on-treatment changes in estrogen signaling as measured by FFNP-PET/CT and circulating tumor cell (CTC) liquid biopsy will be correlated with clinical response to endocrine therapy and progression-free survival in the above cohort of patients.

Number of Participants who have decreased FFNP uptake on PET/CT in response to endocrine therapy, baseline, 4 weeks|Number of Participants who have decrease in circulating tumor cell estrogen signaling in response to endocrine therapy, Baseline level and on-treatment CTC ESR1 and estrogen regulated gene expression will be evaluated as well as endocrine-resistance associated mutations including ESR1 (though rare in this patient population) and PGR., baseline, 4 weeks|Number of Participants who have a decrease in concentration of Circulating Tumor DNA in response to endocrine therapy, baseline, 4 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS) for 6 months, up to 6 months|Correlation coefficients, Correlate baseline levels and dynamic on treatment changes in estrogen signaling as measured by FFNP-PET/CT and CTC liquid biopsy with clinical response to endocrine therapy and progression-free survival in patients with ER/PR+ metastatic LBC., up to 6 months|Adverse Events within 24 hours of FFNP infusion, a 24 hour period up to 7 days pre-treatment, a 24 hour period 4 weeks after the first infusion
