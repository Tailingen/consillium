Study of Chemotherapy in Combination With All-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) With or Without Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Mutant Nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) Gene Mutation
Randomized Phase-III, two-arm, open-label, multi-center study in adult patients with AML and NPM1 mutation.

Before Amendment No. 4 (December 2013):

Primary Efficacy Objective:

* Evaluation of efficacy based on event-free survival (EFS) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutant nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)

After Amendment No. 4 (December 2013):

Primary Efficacy Objective:

* Evaluation of efficacy based on overall survival (OS) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutant nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)
