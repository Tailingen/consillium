Combination Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective as first-line therapy in treating pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works as first-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|DRUG: oxaliplatin
Objective response rate (Phase II)|Survival (Phase III)
Toxicity|Progression-free survival (Phase III)|Quality of life (Phase III)|Overall response rate (Phase III)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare the objective response rate in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil vs gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy. (Phase II)
* Compare the survival of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

Secondary

* Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)
* Compare the overall response rate in patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)
* Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. (Phase III)

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, irinotecan IV over 1Â½ hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 5 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days.
* Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Beginning on day 57, patients receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for 3 weeks (days 57, 64, and 71). Courses repeat every 28 days.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 348 patients (88 for phase II and 260 for phase III) will be accrued for this study.
