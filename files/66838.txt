Advanced Breast Cancer Study of CDK4/6 Inhibitor Combined With Endocrine Therapy Endocrine Therapy in HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
By retrospectively collecting and arranging real-world data of multi-center HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in China combined with CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy, we analyzed different HER2 expression levels (HER2 0, 1+, 2+ and FISH-), especially Clinical outcomes of endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression (HER2 1+, 2+ and FISH-), exploring potential biomarkers of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and understanding the outcome characteristics of HER2 heterogeneity in MBC through multivariate analysis , and guide clinical application.
