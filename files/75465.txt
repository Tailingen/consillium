A Study of Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-64457107 in Participants With Advanced Stage Tumors
The primary purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of JNJ-64457107 when administered intravenously (IV) to participants with advanced stage solid tumors in Part 1 and to further characterize the safety of JNJ-64457107 when administered IV to participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer and cutaneous melanoma in Part 2.
Advanced Solid Neoplasms
DRUG: JNJ-64457107
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (Part 1), Dose-limiting toxicities will be reviewed as a subset of adverse events that occur within the first 28 days of dosing and meet protocol-specified criteria., Up to 28 days|Incidence of adverse events (Part 1 and 2), From signing of informed consent form (ICF) until 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately up to 29 Months)
Overall response rate (ORR), The ORR is the proportion of participants with confirmed best objective response of complete response (CR) or immune-related CR (irCR)., Disease assessment will continue until progression or lost to follow-up (approximately up to 29 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who achieve CR or partial response (PR), DOR will be calculated as time from initial response of CR or PR to progressive disease or death due to underlying disease, whichever comes first., Disease assessment will continue until progression or lost to follow-up (approximately up to 29 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of JNJ-64457107 to progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Disease assessment will continue until progression or lost to follow-up (approximately up to 29 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from first dose of JNJ-64457107 to date of death from any cause., Disease assessment will continue until progression or lost to follow-up (approximately up to 29 months)|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-64457107, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15: predose, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 hours post end of infusion (EOI); any time (Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 22); predose (Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 3 and 4); end of treatment|Time of maximum observed serum concentration (Tmax) of JNJ-64457107, The Tmax is defined as actual sampling time to reach maximum observed analyte concentration., Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15: predose, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 hours post end of infusion (EOI); any time (Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 22); predose (Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 3 and 4); end of treatment|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) of JNJ-64457107, The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant., Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15: predose, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 hours post end of infusion (EOI); any time (Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 22); predose (Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 3 and 4); end of treatment|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the final quantifiable time point (t) [AUC(0-t)] of JNJ-64457107, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15: predose, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 hours post end of infusion (EOI); any time (Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 22); predose (Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 3 and 4); end of treatment|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve during a dosing interval (AUCtau) of JNJ-64457107, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15: predose, 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 hours post end of infusion (EOI); any time (Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 22); predose (Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 3 and 4); end of treatment|Immunogenicity of JNJ-64457107 when administered IV, Detection and characterization of antibodies to JNJ-64457107, Cycle 1: predose on Day 1; Cycle 2: predose on Day 1; Cycles 3, 4: predose; end of treatment visit
This study has 2 parts: Dose Escalation (part 1) and Dose Expansion (part 2) which are conducted in 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to first dose of study drug and includes procedures like electrocardiogram \[ECG\], serum pregnancy test), Treatment phase (continues until the completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit \[30 days after last dose of study drug\]) and Post-treatment follow-up phase (continues until the participant has died, is lost to follow-up, or has withdrawn consent or the study ends). In follow-up, participants will continue to be monitored for survival status and subsequent cancer-related therapies until the end of study. Additional bio-markers will be assessed, in an optional sub-study, to define the impact of JNJ-64457107 on innate and adaptive immune responses in tumors. Safety will be monitored throughout the study by Safety Evaluation Team (SET).
