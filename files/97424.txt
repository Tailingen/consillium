A Study of Daratumumab, Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
This study is being done to find out whether carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRD) or KRD and Daratumumab (KRD+DARA) might be safer and more effective ways of controlling multiple myeloma than the standard of care treatment, which is lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (VRD).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Acetaminophen|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Montelukast|DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Daratumumab|BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT)
Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity, MRD will be assessed by the MRD scale ranging from 10 (increased disease detection) to -5 (less to no disease detection) after 8 cycles of therapy., Up to 32 weeks
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to death from any cause, Up to 16 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of randomization to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 16 weeks|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as time from date of randomization to the time of 1) achieving a PR or less with the first four cycles of therapy, 2) transplant, 3) progression, or 4) death, whichever occurs first., Up to 16 weeks|Rate of Response, Rate of Response will be reported as the percentage of participants achieving a response of: a) Partial Response (PR) or better, b) Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better and c) Complete Response (CR) and Stringent Complete Response (sCR). Responses will be evaluated from participant serum, urine and bone marrow samples., Up to 3 years|Rate of MRD Negativity as best response, MRD will be evaluated from bone marrow samples., Up to 3 years|Incidence of treatment related toxicity, Toxicity will be evaluated by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 9 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity, MRD Negativity using bone marrow and blood samples, Up to 3 years
Per protocol amendment version 4.0 (May 23, 2022), Arm A will be closed and no additional participants will be enrolled in this arm.
