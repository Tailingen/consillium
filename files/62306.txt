Anatomical Resection in Colorectal Liver Metastases Patients
The type of liver resection (anatomical resection, AR or nonanatomical resection, NAR) for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is subject to debate. The debate may persist because some certain prognostic factors, associated with aggressive biological behavior of tumor, have been overlooked. The aim of our study was to investigate the characteristics of patients who would benefit more from anatomical resection for colorectal liver metastases.
The Characteristics of CRLM Patients Who Would Benefit More From Anatomical Resection
PROCEDURE: Anatomical Resection
RFS, Relapse-free survival since patients undergoing hepatic resection, 2012.6.1-2022.6.1
OS, Overall survival since patients undergoing hepatic resection, 2012.6.1-2022.6.1
729 patients who underwent hepatic resection of CRLM were retrospectively collected from June 2012and May 2019. Treatment effects between AR and NAR were compared in full subgroup analyses. Tumor relapse-free survival (RFS) was evaluated by a stratified log-rank test and summarized with the use of Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods.
