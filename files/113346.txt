Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS will be assessed by radiology tests, patient's clinical symptoms or physical exam., From study entry until disease recurrence, death, or date of last contact, assessed up to 8 years
Overall survival (OS), OS assessed by the contact with patient in person or by telephone, from study entry to death or date of last contact, assessed up to 8 years
Incidence of acute and adverse effects as graded by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version (CTCAE) version 4.0, From study entry through completion of study treatment, assessed for 1 year.
To determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (experimental arm) reduces the rate of recurrence (increases recurrence-free survival) when compared to sandwich therapy (control arm).

To determine if treatment with cisplatin and volume-directed radiation followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 cycles (experimental arm) reduces the rate of death (increases survival) when compared to sandwich therapy (control arm).
