Colectomy for Cancer in the Elderly by Laparoscopy or Laparotomy
The purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative global morbidity between patients who have been operated on for a colon cancer by laparotomy and those operated on by laparoscopy
Colonic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparotomy|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopy
Global postoperative morbidity in both arms, Postoperative morbidity is defined as any surgical or medical complications occurring up to 30 days after surgery. It will be collected using a standardized collection form during hospitalization and eventual subsequent consultations in case of patient discharge before then, At 30 days after the surgery
Postoperative mortality, Death from any cause, Evaluated at 30 days and at 90 days after the surgery|Rate of readmission, Defined as any rehospitalization whatever the cause, Within the 30 days after discharge of the patient|Number of examined lymph nodes, Quality of surgical resection : Number of examined lymph nodes, At surgery|Type of resection (R0 or R1), Quality of surgical resection : Type of resection (R0 or R1), At surgery|Pathological evaluation of mesocolic resection quality, Quality of surgical resection : Pathological evaluation of mesocolic resection quality, At surgery|Health-related quality of life : Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30), Health-related quality of life : Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30), At randomization and three months postoperatively|Health-related quality of life : Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-CR29), Health-related quality of life : Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-CR29), At randomization and three months postoperatively|Mini Mental State (MMS) Examination or Folstein test, Evolution of geriatric scores : The Mini Mental State (MMS) Examination or Folstein test; (Comprehensive geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician on each site), Before randomization and three months postoperatively|Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale, Evolution of geriatric scores :The Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale (Comprehensive geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician on each site), Before randomization and three months postoperatively|Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Evolution of geriatric scores :The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Comprehensive geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician on each site), Before randomization and three months postoperatively|Timed Get-up-and-go (TGUG), Evolution of geriatric scores :The Timed Get-up-and-go (TGUG) test (Comprehensive geriatric assessment performed by a geriatrician on each site), Before randomization and three months postoperatively

The present study is a national, multicenter, open-label randomized, 2-arm superiority trial. Patients aged 75 years or older with uncomplicated colonic cancer or precancerous colonic lesion non-endoscopically resectable, will be randomized to either colectomy by laparoscopy or laparotomy. All patients that might be included will have a comprehensive geriatric assessment performed within the 30 days before randomization with the following scores: MMS (Mini Mental Score), ADL scale (Activities of Daily Living), IADL scale (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale) and TGUG test ("Timed Get-Up-and-Go" test).
