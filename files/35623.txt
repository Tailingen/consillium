177Lu-PSMA, Niraparib/AA Plus Prednisone for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and possible side effects of Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-617 along with niraparib and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone when it is given to people diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and does not improve with hormonal therapies) at different dose levels. Once an optimal dose is selected, the researchers want to find out what how well these treatments work to improve survival and control the growth of the tumor.

Determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D is determined based on the number of participants experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during phase 1. DLT is defined as any of the following treatment-related adverse events (AE) during Cycle 1, per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.

* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade ≥3 requiring platelet transfusion
* Grade 4 anemia or Grade ≥3 requiring blood transfusion
* Grade 4 neutropenia ≥7 days, or Grade 3/4 associated with infection or fever \>38.5°C
* Seizure, any grade
* Concurrent elevation of ALT/AST \>3×ULN \& bilirubin \>2×ULN, unless concurrent elevation is related to biliary obstruction or otherwise unrelated to study treatment
* Grade 3 fatigue \>5 days
* Grade 3 nausea \>3 days, despite optimal medical therapy
* Grade ≥3 hypertension despite receiving \>2 weeks of optimal medical therapy
* Grade ≥3 vomiting or diarrhea persisting \>3 days, despite optimal medical therapy
* Other treatment-related Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity except Grade 3 rash, 6 weeks|Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA)-50 response rate, PSA-50 response is defined as a decrease ≥ 50% from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result. This measure will be expressed as a percent of participants who experience this response., 2 years
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the duration of time in months from treatment initiation to the first date of documented radiographic progression using conventional imaging or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The radiographic progression will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) for bone lesions., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time in months between the first dose of study therapy and death from any cause (participants who have not died will be censored at the most recent last-known-alive date)., 2 years|PSA-80 response rate, PSA-80 response is defined as a decrease ≥ 80% from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result. This measure will be expressed as a percent of participants who experience this response., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration of time in months from when criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented or expiration. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria will be used for bone lesions., 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percent of participants who meet criteria for CR or PR. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria will be used for bone lesions., 2 years
