OPTIMIZATION of ADVANCED MR SEQUENCES
This monocentric methodological study aims at optimizing advanced MR sequences for image quality (reduced artefacts, signal to noise ratio, acquisition time, stability of quantitative measurements) on a new MR unit dedicated to research in clinical and cognitive neuroscience.

MR sequences optimization, Optimization of MR protocols and validation of acquisition parameters of advanced MR sequences on healthy volunteers or patients on a new 3T MR unit dedicated to research in neurosciences. Outcome measures depend on each pulse optimized sequence (signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, quantitative MR biomarkers)., 72 months
Reproducibility studies, Reproducibility studies (quantitative parameters, effect of denoising ...). Outcome measures depend on each pulse optimized sequence (artifacts, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, quantitative MR biomarkers)., 72 months|Pilot studies, Feasibility studies in cognitive neurosciences. Outcome measures depend on each MR protocol (artifacts, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, quantitative MR biomarkers)., 72 months
Primary goal : Optimization of MR protocols and validation of acquisition parameters of advanced MR sequences on healthy volunteers or patients on a new 3T MR unit dedicated to research in neurosciences.
