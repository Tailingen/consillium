Nivolumab, Ixazomib, Cyclophosphamide, and Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma
This research is being done to assess the effectiveness and safety of the combination of nivolumab with ixazomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
Relapsed Multiple Myeloma|Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ixazomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria below.

* CR = Negative immunofixation on serum and urine; disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow
* Stringent CR = Above definition plus normal FLC ration and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by IHC or 2-4 color flow cytometry
* PR = At least 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 urinary M-protein by at least 90% or to \<200 mg/24 h. If serum and urine M-protein unmeasurable, require at least 50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. If serum free light assay also unmeasurable, require at least 50% reduction in plasma cells, provided baseline was at least 30%
* Very Good PR (VGPR) = Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg/24 h, up to 8 months
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from starting study treatment to disease progression or death from any cause. The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria defines progressive disease (PD) as at least 25% increase from lowest response value of any of the following:

* Serum M-component (absolute increase must be at least 0.5 g/dL)
* Urine M-component (absolute increase must be at least 200 mg/24 h)
* If serum and urine M-protein unmeasurable, absolute increase in free light chain (FLC) must be \>10 mg/dL. If FLC levels also unmeasurable, absolute increase in bone marrow plasma cell percentage must be at least 10%.
* Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
* Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder, Up to 2 years
This research study is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab for relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma but it has been approved for other uses.
* The FDA has approved ixazomib and cyclophosphamide as treatment options for your disease.
* Nivolumab is a type of antibody (a protein that attaches to other cells to fight off infection and disease) that attaches to and inhibits a protein called PD-1.

  -- PD-1 is a checkpoint protein on immune cells called T cells. It normally acts as a type of "off switch" that helps keep the T cells from attacking other cells in the body. Some cancer cells have large amounts of PD-L1 which binds to PD-1 and turns off the immune system. Nivolumab inhibits PD-1 and helps take the "brake" off the immune system. The investigators' hope that nivolumab will inhibit the PD-1 protein, thus allowing your immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells.
* Ixazomib is a type of inhibitor that blocks a protein in your cells called a proteasome. This protein is responsible for breaking down other proteins in your cells when they need to be disposed of. By blocking the proteasome from working, a buildup of proteins will be created in the cancer cells, which may lead to cell death.
* The investigators hope that the combination of ixazomib and nivolumab with standard of care chemotherapy cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone will work together with ixazomib and nivolumab to treat multiple myeloma.
