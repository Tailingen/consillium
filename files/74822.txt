Assessing Perfusion of Osteotomized Scapula and Lat Flap
The gold standard for reconstruction of the jaw is the utilization of a bone free tissue transfer. Scapula reconstruction is an excellent option for elderly patients, those with significant comorbidities and for complex defects with large soft tissue reconstructive requirements. The scapula is supplied by the angular artery and circumflex scapula arteries. No studies have shown with objective measures, the viability of the lateral border of the scapula bone supplied by either the angular artery or circumflex scapula arteries. The aim of this observational study is to demonstrate with objective clinical measures, via SPY-Q software analysis, that the angular artery can adequately supply the scapula tip flap including with a single osteotomy giving two bone segments, in 30 patients who will undergo reconstructive head and neck surgery at LHSC.

To assess flap viability, To evaluate whether scapular tip flaps with an osteotomy with adequate bone perfusion scores resulted in surgical success (flap viability), Intra-operatively; up to 10 days post-operatively|Concordance between subjective and objective measure of blood perfusion, To assess the concordance between visual inspection of blood perfusion and SPY-Q analysis of blood perfusion, Intra-operatively; up to 10 days post-operatively|Blood perfusion of latissmus dorsi, To measure the adequacy of blood perfusion of the latissimus dorsi muscle component of the scapula flap via SPY-Q analysis, Intra-operatively
The aim of this follow-up observational study is to demonstrate with objective clinical measures via SPY-Q software analysis, that the angular artery can adequately supply the scapula tip flap including a single distal osteotomy segment. 30 patients undergoing mandible or maxillary reconstruction with the scapular tip flap will be included. An osteotomy will be performed at up to 8cm from the scapular tip. The adequacy of blood supply to the scapula tip flap after a distal osteotomy and the latissimus dorsi muscle component of the flap will be measured intraoperatively, using SPY-Q software analysis.
