Study of PSMA-targeted 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the Evaluation of Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
In this study the investigators aim to evaluate diagnostic utility of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Renal Cell Carcinoma|Kidney Cancer
DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL|PROCEDURE: PET/CT
Number of Participants With 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Detected Sites of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), This was assessed to compare the sites of disease images of patients with RCC on conventional imaging with the images on the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to evaluate the sensitivity of DCFPyL PET/CT scans in detecting sites of disease compared to conventional imaging., 12 Months|Number of Participants With a Correlation Between Radiotracer Uptake on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and Conventional Imaging, This was assessed to Correlate Sites of Radiotracer Uptake on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT With Conventional Imaging Findings., 12 Months
