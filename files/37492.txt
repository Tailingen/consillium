Optimizing the Interval Between Cycles of PRRT with 177lu-dotatate in Sstr2 Positive Tumors
Randomized Phase II Trial in sstr2 Positive Tumors to Optimize the Interval Between Cycles of PRRT With 177lu-dotatate
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: PRRT every 5 weeks|DRUG: PRRT every 8-10 weeks
PFS, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The evaluation of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, defined as any G3/G4 toxicity from 1st treatment cycle until 30 days after the last treatment cycle will be based on version 4.0 CTC-AE, up to 30 days after last treatment cycle
DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease for at least 12 weeks from therapy start. DCR will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the Version 1.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), up to 5 years|OS, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from treatment start to the time of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off., up to 5 years
The main objective of this randomized phase II comparative study is to evaluate the Progression Free survival (PFS) and the safety as co-primary objective of two different schedule of administrations of 177lu-dotatate: intensive (every 5 weeks) vs no intensive (every 8-10 weeks) The secondary objectives are DCR, the late toxicity, OS and dosimetry. Patients with any tumor histotype documented as sst2-positive in pre-study period will be enrolled in the study.

The study will include a total of 618 planned patients. They will be randomly assigned to receive 5 cycles of PRRT at intervals of 5 or 8-10 weeks between cycles.
