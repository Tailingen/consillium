IASLC Grading System as a Predictor for EGFR-TKI Therapy
The investigators previously validated the grading system proposed by International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) for invasive nonmucinous lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) for its reproducibility, prognostication function and predictive value of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). In this exploratory study, the investigators aimed to investigate the role of IASLC grading system in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy selection either as adjuvant or palliative therapy.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: IASLC grading system
Disease-free survival, DFS was defined as time from initiation of surgery to date of first event (recurrence or death), 5 years|Progression-free survival, PFS was defined as time from initiation of systemic palliative treatment to date of disease progression or death for 1L treatment of each patient and the initiation time was re-assigned additionally for each drug applied during the treatment history of the patients regardless of line of therapy (all lines), 5 years
Overall survival, was defined as time from surgery to date of death resulting from any cause in ADJUVANT subgroup and from 1L systemic palliative treatment assignment to date of death resulting from any cause in RECURRENCE subgroup., 5 years
