A Pilot Study to Develop Predictive Biomarkers for the Response to Immunotherapy in Lung Cancer
Several immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1 pathway have been developed with clinical trials showing an approximately 20% durable response in unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At the moment, no clear biomarker exists to accurately predict anti-PD1/PDL1 tumor responsiveness. The goal of this study is to broadly discover and evaluate the utility of blood based biomarkers for use in measuring and predicting response to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer.
