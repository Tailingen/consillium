Study of Nivolumab and Axitinib in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center study of axitinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously treated and untreated advanced RCC. This clinical study will be composed of a dose finding phase (Phase I) and two parallel dose expansion phases (Phase II). The dose finding phase will assess the safety of the combination and establish a recommended phase II dose (RP2D, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and the Sponsor Investigator) in patients with advanced RCC who have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy of the combination at the RP2D in two parallel expansion cohorts in both previously treated and treatment naïve patients.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Axitinib
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, To be assessed by CTCAE v4.03. Will be used to establish recommended phase II dose (RP2D), Up to 15 months|Overall response rate (ORR), To be assessed by RECIST 1.1, Up to 12 months
Duration of response (DOR), DOR is the time from first partial response or complete response until progressive disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is the time from initiation of treatment to confirmed disease progression per RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from initiation of treatment to death or when the patient is lost to follow up, From date of initiation of treatment to death or when the patient is lost to follow up, approximately 25 months on average|Safety profile as assessed by CTCAE 4.03, Summarized by type, frequency, and severity, Up to 15 months|PD-L1 expression on tumor biospecimens, Descriptive statistics from analysis of patient samples, Up to 12 months|Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte assessments on tumor biospecimens, Descriptive statistics from analysis of patient samples, Up to 12 months|Pharmacodynamic effect of study treatment including cytokines, Descriptive statistics from analysis of patient samples, Up to 12 months
