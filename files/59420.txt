A Phase 2 Trial of AMG 706 or Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemo for Advanced NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to estimate the difference in objective response rates between each paclitaxel/carboplatin plus AMG 706 arm (Arm A and B) and paclitaxel/carboplatin plus bevacizumab arm (Arm C) in subjects with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab|DRUG: AMG 706|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective tumor response rate, Response assessments will be obtained every 6 +/- 1 week until subjects develop disease progression.
Duration of response, Time from first objective tumor response to disease progression or death, if the death was due to disease progression.|Progression free survival, Number of days from randomization tot he date of radiological evidence of disease progression or death.|Overall survival, Time from randomization to death.|Pharmacokinetics of AMG 706 when administered with paclitaxel and carboplatin in Arms A and B, From randomization until disease progression or death.|Safety and tolerability in the 3 arms, From randomization until disease progression or death.
