Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Chemoradiation in Patients With Potentially Resectable Gastric Carcinoma
To investigate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of Preoperative Chemoradiation in Patients With Localized Gastric Cancer. Primary endpoint: R0 resection rate. Secondary endpoint: resection rate, pathological complete regression (pCR), effectiveness and safety of regime, disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS).
Gastric Cancer
RADIATION: S1，oxaliplatin，radiation
R0 resection rate, 6-8 weeks after Radiation therapy，we evaluate the lesion，if it is resectable，we will give surgical therapy，, 6-8 Weeks
safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy，we evaluate the side effects , and record the side effects, up to 10 weeks
resection rate, 6-8 weeks after Radiation therapy，we evaluate the lesion，if it is resectable，we will give surgical therapy，, 6-8 Weeks|disease-free survival, after surgical therapy，we followup the patients and stat the recurrence and death and calculate the disease-free survival, up to 36 months|over-all survival, after surgical therapy，we followup the patients and stat the recurrence and death and calculate the over-all survival, up to 36 months
The prognosis of gastric cancer is poor partially due to low R0 resection rate. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was reported to be effective in this setting by several phase II studies. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in a prospective phase II study.
