Study Of The Impact Of Inlyta In 2nd Line On The Treatment Outcomes Of mRCC Patients Treated With Sutent In 1st Line In The Real Life Setting
This is an international, multi-centre, prospective (partly retrospective), observational study to evaluate treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC treated with sunitinib in first line and/or receiving axitinib in second line post sunitinib. The study is designed to enroll approximately 750 patients over the course of an enrollment period of approximately 36 months.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)
OTHER: observational
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS for patients with adv/mRCC receiving Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent is defined as the time from when the patient receives the first dose of Inlyta to the time of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 60 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Combined PFS for patients with adv/mRCC receiving the Sutent-Inlyta sequence is defined as the time from when the patient receives the first dose with Sutent in first line, until progression or death due to any cause with Inlyta in 2nd line, whichever occurs first during the Sutent-Inlyta sequence, 60 months|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF for Inlyta 2nd line is defined as from when the patient receives the first dose of Inlyta to the time of Inlyta discontinuation (date completed by the physician)., 60 months|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF for the Sutent-Inlyta sequence is defined as the time from when the patient receives the first dose with Sutent in first line to the time of Inlyta discontinuation (date completed by the physician)., 60 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR for adv/mRCC patients receiving Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria v1.1, relative to all patients who have baseline measurable disease., 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS for adv/mRCC patients receiving Sutent in first line followed by Inlyta in 2nd line as measured from the date of first Sutent dose to the date of death of any cause., 60 months|Time to strategy failure (TSF), TSF for patients receiving the Sutent-Inlyta sequence is defined as the time from when the patient receives the first dose with Sutent in first line to the time of Inlyta discontinuation (date completed by the physician) without the time between discontinuation of Sutent and start of Inlyta., 60 months|Dosing, Description of real life usage of flexible dosing across Europe with description of treatment schedules (dosing change, dosing schedule, average dose received during the period treatment), 60 months|Proportion of titrated patients, A patient is considered as titrated when an Inlyta dose increase is maintained for at least 4 weeks., 60 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS for titrated and non-titrated patients when they receive Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent, 60 months|Efficacy, Efficacy parameters (PFS, OS) for the combined 1st line Sutent - 2nd line sequences according to the second line post Sutent (other than Sutent-Inlyta), 60 months|Safety, Safety description with AE listing in patients receiving Inlyta, 60 months|QoL, QoL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index 19 (FKSI-19) questionnaire and the Mental Health (MH) and Role-Emotional (RE) domains of the SF-36 questionnaire., 60 months
Patients will be enrolled when they start a treatment with Sutent in 1st line or Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent treatment. The possible sequences of treatment under investigation will be:

* Sutent (prospective) - Inlyta
* Sutent (retrospective) - Inlyta
* Sutent - not further active treatment (supportive care)
* Sutent - other second line treatment (Nexavar (sorafenib), Votrient (pazopanib), Afinitor (everolimus), Torisel (temsirolimus), other)) The study will enroll approximately 750 adv/mRCC patients at the 1st and 2nd line treatment level. Patients will be enrolled when they start a treatment with Sutent in 1st line or Inlyta in 2nd line post Sutent treatment. Therefore for some patients there will be a retrospective Sutent data collection. The primary endpoints of this study in patients with adv/mRCC are PFS and TTF for patients receiving Inlyta in 2nd line, and the combined PFS and TTF for patients receiving the Sutent-Inlyta sequence. In this non-interventional real life study, the objective is only descriptive and the sample size will rely on the precision of the estimate.
