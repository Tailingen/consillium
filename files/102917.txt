Genetic Predictors of Efficiency and Safety of ICIs in Patients With Different Malignancies (ICIPRESIST-0519)
This is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study (with two prospective cohorts), including previously treated patients with melanoma, squamous cell lung cancer in the late stages (inoperable or metastatic) and Hodgkin disease at any stages.

The duration of the follow-up will be 12-60 months. Data from medical records will be retrospectively collected at different points in time. The first data extraction will consist of collecting data from the initial level (before treatment with immune checkpoints inhibitors (anti-PD1 / PDl1) before the end of the recruitment period for this study (up to 3 years of follow-up). Two additional annual data collections are planned for display additional follow-up and data for patients who will survive.

overall survival (OS) of patients receiving immune checkpoint blockers (PD1 / PDl1 blockers) in the first and subsequent treatment lines in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma, lung cancer and lymphoma granulomatosis, Overall survival (OS) will be calculated and presented in graphical form using the method of the product of Kaplan-Meier limits. The report will include a median of C with corresponding bilateral values of 95% CI. The proportion of patients who survive at certain points in time (1, 2, and 3 years), as well as the corresponding bilateral values of 95% CI, will be evaluated and reported., dec 2021|incidence and severity of all adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockers (PD1 / PDl1 blockers) in the first and subsequent treatment lines in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma, lung cancer and lymphoma., dec 2021
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockers (PD1 / PDl1 blockers) in the first and subsequent treatment lines in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma, lung cancer and Hodgkin disease, dec 2021|response rate in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockers (PD1 / PDl1 blockers) in the first and subsequent treatment lines in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma, lung cancer and Hodgkin disease, dec 2021|Development of predictive molecular testing tools, The predictive power parameters of the predictive tools being developed will be generalized using descriptive statistics methods. The significance of the results of the qualitative tests will be assessed using Fisher's two-sided exact test. The optimal threshold values for quantitative tests will be evaluated using the ROC curve method, and for the mutational load, the four squares method of Abeshouse, 2017 will also be calculated. using the proportional Cox test., dec 2021
