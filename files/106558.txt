Characterizing the Cross-sectional Approach to Investigate the Prevalence of Tissue BRCA1/2 Mutations in Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Cancer Patients
This is a multi-center, observational study in Japan. Patients with newly diagnosed FIGO stage III - IV advanced OC will be enrolled sequentially.

In this study, data of 200 subjects will be collected at approximately 20 sites in Japan. To reduce regional bias of study sites, the number of enrolled patients per site will be capped
Ovarian Neoplasms
The prevalence of tBRCAm in the newly diagnosed advanced OC patients, For BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations detected by Myriad myChoice HRD, the number and percentage of patients with the following results will be indicated; deleterious mutation / suspected deleterious / variant of uncertain significance (VUS) / favour polymorphism / no mutation detected, Baseline
The prevalence of gBRCAm in the subjects, For BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations detected by BRACAnalysis, the number and percentage of patients with the following results will be indicated; deleterious mutation / suspected deleterious / variant of uncertain significance (VUS) / favour polymorphism / no mutation detected, Baseline|The prevalence of sBRCAm in the subjects, For BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations detected by BRACAnalysis and Myriad myChoice HRD, the number and percentage of patients with the following results will be indicated; deleterious mutation / suspected deleterious, Baseline|The ratio of sBRCAm out of tBRCAm, Calculate the rate of sBRCAm out of tBRCAm, Baseline
tBRCA variant description, BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants detected by Myriad myChoice HRD (location and type of mutation) will be described., Baseline
