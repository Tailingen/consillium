Chemo-immunotherapy, Hypo-fractionated RT and Maintenance Immunotherapy for Stage III NSCLC.
Aim of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the combination of induction chemotherapy plus durvalumab followed by reduced-dose hypo-fractionated thoracic RT (concurrent with durvalumab) and durvalumab maintenance for stage 3 unresectable NSCLC patients candidate to sequential chemo-RT.
NSCLC, Stage III
DRUG: Durvalumab
Safety, Incidence of Grade 3 or more possibly related adverse events (PRAEs), Within 6 months from study enrollment
Progression-Free Survival, Kaplan-Meier Progression-Free Survival, according to RECIST 1.1 and as assessed by the Investigators, 0-36 months from study enrollment|Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival, 0-36 months from study enrollment
Quality of Life, EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13, 0-36 months
The study hypothesis is that the new regimen tested in this study will be safe and effective by:

1. anticipating the use of durvalumab, together with chemotherapy (higher efficacy)
2. harnessing response to induction chemo-durvalumab (which is expected to be significant) to be able to reduce radiotherapy dose without reducing tumor control probability
3. reducing radiation-induced immunosuppression
4. reducing radiation-induced late morbidity, this aspect is important when considering that this regimen is expected to be able to cure a proportion of patients (long-term survivors)

In this phase II study, the investigators will evaluate the combination of induction chemotherapy plus durvalumab followed by reduced-dose hypo-fractionated thoracic RT (concurrent with durvalumab) and durvalumab maintenance for stage 3 unresectable NSCLC patients candidate to sequential chemo-RT.
