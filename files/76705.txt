Research of Circulating Tumor Cells Released During Endometrial Cancer Surgery.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the spread of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) during surgery in endometrial cancer. Although this cancer is often discovered at early stage, the risk of recurrence is estimated at 6 to 21%, according to grade. Early stage tumor is accessible for curative surgical treatment by laparoscopy but this kind of surgery may induce CTCs spread, and could be an explanation of this recurrence. Through this study, concordance between two blood punction sites, peripheral vein and ovarian vein, will be evaluated to detect these cells during surgery.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: blood samples
Qualitative assessment, Presence or not of at least one CTC during endometrial cancer surgery detected on two venipuncture site (peripheral and ovarian vein)., During surgery (at the ligature of the ovarian ligament)
Quantitative assessment, Number of CTC detected from each sampling, Before surgery and during surgery
The goal of this single-center clinical trial is to determine the best blood punction site to observe the spreading of CTC during surgery in endometrial cancer. CTCs are very rare events on blood and their detection require extremely sensitive technologies. This pilot study will investigate CTC spread during surgery on 10 patients with endometrial cancer.

The main objective is to compare venipuncture site for detection of CTCs in endometrial cancer during surgery. Blood samples are collected on a simple sampling (arm) compared to sampling as close as possible to the tumor (ovarian vein).
