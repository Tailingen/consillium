Omitting CTV for Primary Tumor in LS-SCLC
This randomized controlled non-inferior trial prospectively enrolled patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). Patients in the experimental group would receive radiotherapy with omission of the clinical target volume (CTV) for the primary tumor, while those in the control group would receive radiotherapy including CTV. The efficacy and toxicity of the two groups are compared to provide evidence for the radiotherapy of LS-SCLC. The target volume of LS-SCLC may be reduced by omitting CTV without increasing local recurrence but potentially reducing the dose to organs at risk and the side effects.
SCLC, Limited Stage|Radiation Exposure|Radiotherapy Side Effect|Progression
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Etoposide + carboplatin; Etoposide + cisplatin|RADIATION: Creating CTV for primary tumor|RADIATION: prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)
Local progression free survival, From the date chemotherapy commenced to the first clinical or radiological evidence of progressive disease at the primary site or death, whichever occurs first, to be assessed up to 3 years|Severe toxicity free survival, From the date chemotherapy commenced to the first record of serious adverse events related to radiotherapy, to be assessed up to 3 years
Overall survival, From the date chemotherapy commenced to the date of death from any cause or the end of follow-up at 3 years|Progression free survival, From the date chemotherapy commenced to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, to be assessed up to 3 years|Number of participants with recurrence or metastasis as evaluated by RECIST 1.1, From the date chemotherapy commenced to the end of follow-up at 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, From the date chemotherapy commenced to the end of follow-up at 3 years
