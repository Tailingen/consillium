T-Cell Depleted Double UCB for Refractory AML
This trial is proposes to build on our experience and is designed to maximize early (day 3-14) and late (day 60-71) donor-derived natural killer (NK) cell expansion and function in vivo. The proposed platform will allow us the unique opportunity to compare in vivo function from a transplanted umbilical cord blood (UCB) source (presumed to contain NK progenitors requiring "education" in the recipient).
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Allopurinol|DRUG: Fludarabine|RADIATION: Total body irradiation|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Levetiracetam|DRUG: Busulfan|BIOLOGICAL: Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation|BIOLOGICAL: Interleukin-2
Disease Free Survival, The primary endpoint is a disease free survival at 3 months in patients with chemotherapy refractory AML after a double T-cell depleted (TCD) umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation where one TCD unit is activated overnight in IL-2 followed by the administration of two courses of IL-2 three times a week for 6 doses beginning on day +3 and on day +60 to expand UCB-derived NK cells in vivo., At 3 months
Incidence of Graft Failure, Incidence of graft failure defined as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500/uL and a bone marrow that is less than 5% cellular (marrow aplasia), Day 42|Incidence of Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease, Day 60|Transplant-Related Mortality, Day 180 after Transplantation|Clinical Disease Response, Defined as leukemia clearance and complete remission. Patients will be followed for disease response for 1 year from transplantation unless: consent is withdrawal, patient is unevaluable - if a patient is not evaluable, follow only until the resolution or stabilization of treatment related toxicity, new anti-cancer treatment is started, patient is discharged to hospice (terminal) care., 1 Year from Transplantation|Duration of Survival, 6 months after Transplantation.|Duration of Survival, 1 year after Transplantation.|Duration of Survival, 2 years after Transplantation.|Clinical Disease Response, Defined as leukemia clearance and complete remission. Patients will be followed for disease response for 2 years from transplantation unless: consent is withdrawal, patient is unevaluable - if a patient is not evaluable, follow only untilthe resolution or stabilization of treatment related toxicity, new anti-cancer treatment is started, patient is discharged to hospice (terminal) care., 2 Years from Transplantation
This single center study will determine the feasibility and safety of using a myeloablative conditioning regimen followed (on day 0) by transplantation with double T-cell depleted (TCD) umbilical cord blood (UCB) units where the unit with fewer mononuclear cells (MNCs)/kg will be selected for overnight IL-2 activation prior to infusion. Beginning on day +3, post transplant IL-2 will be administered thrice weekly, not on consecutive days, for a total of 6 doses to expand UCB derived progenitor cells. Post transplant immune suppression prophylaxis will not be administered with the intent to lessen toxicity and allow allogeneic NK cells to function longer providing better anti-leukemic therapy. However if either UCB unit has more than 5% T-cells, the patient will not receive either course of IL-2. Beginning on day +60 after transplantation, a second course of IL-2 will be administered thrice weekly, not on consecutive days, for a total of 6 doses with the purpose of enhancing the in vivo expansion and education of NK cells derived from engrafting UCB cells.
