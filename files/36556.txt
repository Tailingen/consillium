Natalizumab in Recurrent, Refractory or Progressive Pulmonary Metastatic Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab in children, adolescent and young adult patients with pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma (pOS) and to assess clinical response associated with this treatment as well as overall survival.
Pulmonary Metastatic Osteosarcoma (pOS)
DRUG: Natalizumab
Dosing limiting toxicity, Hematologic dose limiting toxicities: Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia of \> 7 days duration; or myelosuppression that causes a delay of \> 8 weeks between treatment courses

Non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicities: Any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity attributable to Natalizumab with the specific exclusion of:

* Grade 4 nausea and vomiting responding to anti-emetics, alopecia, fatigue and drug related fever
* Grade 4 fever
* Any Grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity
* Any Grade 3 or greater anaphylaxis
* Any Grade 2 or greater elevation in transaminases and bilirubin levels
* Any Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities (excluding alopecia, nausea and vomiting) that do not resolve to â‰¤ Grade 1 by 8 weeks following the most recent dose of Natalizumab, 30 days after end of treatment (1 year)
Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate as defined by the number of participants that have Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) after 12 cycles, 1 year after start of treatment|Overall survival measured in months, Overall survival measured in months and summarized using Kaplan-Meier analysis. This will be calculated from the date of registration on-study to the dates of documented evidence of progression or death, up to 3 years, Up to 3 years
This study is a single-arm, open-label, proof of concept clinical trial in children, adolescent and young adult patients with unresectable pOS that have progressed, relapsed or are refractory to standard systemic therapy.

All participants will receive the study therapy and there will be dose escalation in a traditional 3 + 3 design during the Phase I study of this trial.

In the Phase II study of the trial, treatment will continue if the subject has Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) of pOS after every 3 cycles after the first 6 cycles but not beyond 24 cycles, unless it is judged to be in his/her best interest.

Approximately 3-9 subjects will be enrolled in the phase I part and 10-12 in the phase II part of this trial. Participants will be followed for toxicity for 30 days after treatment has been discontinued or until one of the protocol-defined reasons

This study seeks to evaluate if Natalizumab can be used safely and effectively as immunotherapy in children, adolescent and young adult patients with pOS. Natalizumab is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders The study team will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Natalizumab as well as the clinical response associated with Natalizumab treatment and evaluate overall survival.
