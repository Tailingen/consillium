Breakthrough Invasive Mold Infections Under Posaconazole Prophylaxis (BIMI)
Invasive mold infections (IMI) mainly affect patients with hematologic malignancies receiving intensive chemotherapy or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prolonged neutropenia after remission induction chemotherapy (\>10 days duration) and continuous immunosuppression in the context of prevention or therapy of graft versus host disease (GVHD) for HSCT recipients (first 100 days post-transplantation and thereafter if GVHD is present) are considered as periods at high risk of IMI.

Posaconazole prophylaxis is prescribed according to current guidelines to reduce the occurrence of IMI. Nevertheless, breakthrough IMI (bIMI), i.e. IMI occurring under mold-active prophylaxis, are still observed.

The investigators hypothesized that the epidemiology of bIMI (under posaconazole prophylaxis) differs from that of IMI occurring in the absence of mold-active antifungal prophylaxis. Because bIMI are rare events since the introduction of posaconazole prophylaxis, epidemiological data of bIMI are scarce.

This study aims to i) describe the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment and outcome of bIMI, ii) assess the causes of bIMI, iii) determine potential risk factors associated with the developllement of bIMI iv) assess the impact of bIMI on overall mortality.

Design

Retrospective and prospective, observational, case-control, multicenter, international study.

The retrospective part will enroll previously identified bIMI cases and control cases (1:2) over the last five years: October 1st 2015 to September 30st 2020.

The prospective part will enroll bIMI cases and control cases (1:2) occurring over a two-year period: October 1st 2020 to September 30st 2022.

Setting

The aim is to enroll 10 to 15 European centers with dedicated units for hematologic cancer patients. Currently, six centers have confirmed their participation (from Switzerland and Germany).

Study Population

Adult (≥ 18 years old) patients with a hematologic malignancy receiving posaconazole prophylaxis during induction, consolidation or re-induction chemotherapy or after HSCT.

Cases : patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis for at least 7 days and diagnosed with bIMI proven or probable according to EORTC-MSGERC.

Controls: patients receiving posaconazole prophylaxis for at least 7 days, without diagnosis of bIMI possible, probable or proven according to EORTC-MSGERC.

The objective is to enroll about 100 bIMI cases and 200 controls.

Assessment of the impact of bIMI on overall mortality, • Comparison of mortality rate (6 and 12 weeks) between bIMI and control cases., 6 weeks and 12 weeks after inclusion|Assessment of factors influencing outcomes of bIMI, • Univariate and multivariate analysis of predictors of mortality (6 and 12 weeks) among bIMI cases., 6 weeks and 12 weeks after inclusion
