TmCD19-IL18 in CD19+ Cancers
This is a Phase I, open-label dose finding study to assess the safety, tolerability, manufacturing feasibility, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of TmCD19-IL18 CAR T cells in patients with CD19+ cancers. This study will take place in two parts: a Dose-Finding Phase to determine the maximum tolerate dose (MTD), followed by a Dose Expansion Phase. In the Dose-Finding Phase, dose levels will be evaluated using a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the MTD (as defined below). Cumulative safety experience and manufacturing feasibility data from the Dose-Finding Phase will then be used to identify the dose level that can be progressed into the Dose Expansion Phase.
