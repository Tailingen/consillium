Study of Erlotinib With or Without Investigational Drug (U3-1287) in Subjects With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2 study. In Phase 1b, subjects will know the treatment they are receiving. Subjects will receive Erlotinib + U3-1287. The Phase 1b portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to Erlotinib will be safe in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who fail prior treatment. In the Phase 2 portion, subjects will be blinded to the treatments they are receiving. Subjects will receive either Erlotinib alone or Erlotinib + U3-1287.

The Phase 2 portion will determine if adding U3-1287 to Erlotinib will be safe and improve survival in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed the first treatment.

SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions)., For participants whose best response is SD as the time from date of first documentation of stable disease up to the date of first documentation of progressive disease, up to 3 years 2 months|Time to Disease Progression Following U3-1287 (AMG 888) in Combination With Erlotinib, Time to disease progression was defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of first objective documentation of disease progression. As per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Time from date of randomization up to the date of first objective documentation of disease progression, up to 3 years 2 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Cycle 3 Patritumab Area Under the Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval 0 to τ (AUC) Following U3-1287 (AMG 888) in Combination With Erlotinib, AUC was calculated from the concentration-time data at Cycle 3 using a noncompartmental analysis (NCA) method., Cycle 1: predose, end of infusion (EOI), 3 hour (h) postdose; Cycle 2: predose; Cycle 3: predose, EOI, 3 h, 6h, 24 h, 72 h, 168 h, 336 h; Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 7, and Cycle 9: predose (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Cycle 3 Patritumab Concentration End of Infusion (CEOI) and Minimum (Trough) Concentration (Cmin) Following U3-1287 (AMG 888) in Combination With Erlotinib, Concentration end of infusion (CEOI) was defined as the concentration within ± 5 minutes of the end of infusion.
