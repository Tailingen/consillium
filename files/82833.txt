Investigation Into the Differentiation of Tumour and Healthy Brain Tissue Using Multi-exponential T2 Components
The purpose of this study is to see if a specialized imaging technique using MRI called multi-exponential T2 component analysis can reliably differentiate between normal brain and brain tumour.
Glioma
T2 characteristics of glioma tissue versus normal, Before radiotherapy treatment begins
Existing methods of contouring tumours for radiation therapy involve manual interpretations of qualitative diagnostic images. These methods, being qualitative, do not offer a consistent and reproducible platform for contouring, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of contouring choices on treatment outcome. T2 component analysis in MRI has the potential to offer a quantitive basis for identifying tumor tissue- this potential is investigated in this pilot study.
