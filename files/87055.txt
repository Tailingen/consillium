Palliative Stereotactic Radiation for Pancreatic or Periampullary Adenocarcinoma
The investigators are looking to see if a certain dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may be a viable treatment option for recurrent or residual pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic Cancer|Periampullary Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
Late Gastrointestinal Toxicities, Late (Up to 3 months post-treatment to date of first progression or date of death, (whichever comes first-up to 36 months) Grade 2 or greater gastritis, enteritis, fistula, or ulcer and any other grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity attributable to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT).

Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria., 3 months post-treatment to date of first progression or date of death, whichever comes first assessed up to 36 months
Acute Gastrointestinal Toxicity, Any acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities grade 3 or greater., within 3 months of treatment|Local Progression Free Survival From SBRT, Local progression free survival defined as the length of time (months) during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with cancer, but the disease does not worsen., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause (up to 36 months).|Local Progression Free Survival From Diagnosis, Local progression free survival defined as the length of time (months) during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with cancer, but the disease does not worsen., From date documented diagnosis to date of first documented local disease progression.|Change in Patient Reported Quality of Life (PR-QOL) Assessment at Baseline (Pre-treatment) and 3 Months (Post-Treatment), To evaluate whether a change in patient reported quality of life (QoL) occurred between baseline (pre-SBRT) and at 3 months (post-SBRT) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer quality of life core cancer questionnaire with the pancreatic cancer module (EORTC QLQ-C30/Pan26). This assessment is a multi-dimensional, 30-item questionnaire which assesses 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), 3 symptom scales ( fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a global health/QoL scale as well as 6 single items. There are also 26 questions specific to patients with pancreatic cancer.

Scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning whereas a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Baseline (Pre-SBRT) and at 3 months (Post-SBRT)|Linac Based SBRT Pain Control, To evaluate the ability of Linac based SBRT to provide pain control among symptomatic patients as measured by pain medication requirement at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment., 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment|Linac Based SBRT Standardization, To develop and standardize Linac based SBRT delivery and dosimetric parameters, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment|FDG-PET Use for Planning and Estimation of Survival, To evaluate the utility of FDG-PET for treatment planning and estimation of progression-free survival., 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then annually thereafter|Toxicity and Outcomes for Patients With Chemotherapy, With or Without Surgery and Radiation for Tumor Assessments, To evaluate toxicity and outcomes among patients with recurrent or residual disease after previous chemoradiation therapy, with or without surgery, who will be treated with 5 Gy x 5., 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then annually thereafter|Toxicity and Outcomes for Chemotherapy Only and Radiation, To evaluate toxicity and outcomes among patients with recurrent or residual disease after chemotherapy only, (with or without surgery), who will be treated with 6.6 Gy x 5., 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then annually thereafter
No standard treatment option has yet been established for patients with recurrent or residual disease after definitive treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancers (duodenal, ampullary, bile duct). Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) administered in 1-3 fractions has been shown to be an effective treatment option for patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, achieving local control rates of 84-92% at one year. Associated late gastrointestinal toxicity rates have been reported to be 22-25% at 1 year. We hypothesize that similarly excellent local control rates (80-90% at one year) with a reasonable rate of toxicity (≤20%) can be achieved using Linac based SBRT delivered as 5 Gy x 5 for patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous treatment with conventional chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without surgery and as 6.6 Gy x 5 for radiation-naïve patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The toxicities of note for this trial are grade 2 and greater gastritis, fistula, enteritis, ulcer, or any other grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity.
