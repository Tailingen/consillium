The Study of Massively Parallel Sequencing in Early Detection for Gynecologic Malignant Tumor
As human aging, 50% of women will be faced with the threat of cancer, especially gynecological malignancies. Ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancer are three major gynecological malignancies. In recent years, the incidence of cervical cancer, especially in young women significantly increased; ovarian cancer, although the incidence of malignant tumors in the female reproductive system ranked second, but its mortality rate already in the first place; and the morbidity and mortality of endometrial cancer is also rising.

The key to gynecologic malignancies is how to early diagnose and treat. With the advancement of science and technology, such as molecular biology techniques widely used in the medical field, early diagnosis, proper treatment and other aspects in gynecologic malignancies is expected to achieve a breakthrough. Genome-wide scan strategy, making the whole genome for linkage analysis for gynecological malignancies possible. Therefore, the investigators intend to find specific mutations to provide a new early screening approach for gynecological malignancies, which in later result in early diagnosis and specific treatment for gynecological malignant tumors.
Gynecologic Malignant Tumor
Gene mutation from species of cervical cancer, endometrial cancers and ovary cancer, We expect to found spcific DNA mutation in the species (peripheral blood, liquid Pap smear and cancer tissue) from cervical cancer, endometrial cancers and ovary., 4 years
the difference between detection sensitivity, Comparing sensiitivity of the three kinds of samples on early detection of gynecologic malignancies, 4 years
