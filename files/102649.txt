Regorafenib for Recurrent Grade 2 and 3 Meningioma (MIRAGE Trial)
The focus of this study will be to investigate whether Regorafenib demonstrates antitumor activity against recurrent grade II or III meningiomas.

Small trials and case series suggest clinical relevant activity of several VEGF inhibitors such as sunitinib, bevacizumab and valatinib reporting a 6m-PFS rate of 42-64%. Indeed, VEGF and VEGF receptors (VEGFR) are regularly overexpressed in meningiomas and can correlate with outcome.

Regorafenib inhibits angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and is highly selective for VEGFR1/2/3; moreover Regorafenib inhibits PDGFRB, FGFR1 and oncogenic intracellular signalling cascades involving c-RAF/RAF1 and BRAF highly expressed in meningiomas.

Noteworthy, Regorafenib showed antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo in a recent study; indeed, Regorafenib showed significant inhibition of meningioma cell motility and invasion and in vivo, mice with orthotopic meningioma xenografts showed a reduced volume of signal enhancement in MRI following Regorafenib therapy; this translated in a significantly increased overall survival time (p\<0.05) for Regorafenib treated mice.

Moreover, Regorafenib showed good efficacy in different cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, GIST, hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma (REGOMA trial) , maintainingmaintaining a good quality of life.

Progression free survival (PFS), The progression free survival (PFS) will be determined as the time from the date of enrolment to the date of disease progression determined using RANO criteria or to the date of death, whichever occurs first., Up to 36 months
Overall survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) will be determined as the time from the date of enrolment to the date of death from any cause., Up to 30 months|Objective response rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) determined using modified Macdonald criteria., Up to 30 months|Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), Quality of life will be assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire., Up to 30 months|Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), Quality of life will be assessed by the QLQBN20 questionnaire., Up to 30 months|Toxicity during treatment, Toxicity during the treatment will be recorded and graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5., Up to 30 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The disease control rate (DCR) will be defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) determined using modified Macdonald criteria., Up to 30 months
