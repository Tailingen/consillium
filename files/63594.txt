A Phase 1 Study of ZL-1218 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of ZL-1218 as a single agent and as combination therapy in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
