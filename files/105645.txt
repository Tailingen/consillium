Study of XB010 in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a FIH study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of XB010 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom alternative therapies do not exist or available therapies are intolerable or no longer effective.

This study consists of Dose-Escalation and Cohort-Expansion Stages. The Dose-Escalation Stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dosage(s) for expansion (RDE\[s\]) of XB010 as a single agent, and to evaluate XB010 monotherapy RDE(s) in combination with pembrolizumab. The Cohort-Expansion Stage is designed to explore the clinical activity and further characterize the safety and tolerability of XB010 as monotherapy in multiple tumor-specific cohorts.
