Neural Stem Cell Preserving Brain Radiation Therapy & Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Patients With 1-6 Brain Metastases
For patients with 1-6 intraparenchymal brain metastases from various primary histologies (except for melanoma), stereotactic radiosurgery (administered upfront or concurrently) or complete surgical resection with neural stem cell (NSC)-preserving whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) results in improved neurocognitive profile over standard WBRT. The goal of this study is to assess feasibility of this treatment approach.

Increase in the Bi-dimensional Tumor Area for Any of the Tracked Brain Metastases or the Appearance of Any New Brain Metastases on a Follow-up MRI., Increase in the bi-dimensional tumor area for any of the tracked brain metastases or the appearance of any new brain metastases on a follow-up MRI., 12 months after end of radiation therapy
Cancer patients (except patients with melanoma) with 1-6 brain metastases are randomized to receive standard whole brain radiation therapy or whole brain radiation therapy in a neural stem cell-preserving manner.
