Analgesic Effect of Adding Thoracic Paravertebral Nerve Blocks to Modified PEC Block in Breast Cancer Surgery
To compare efficacy and safety of adding thoracic paravertebral nerve blocks to modified PEC block versus modified PEC block only in breast cancer surgery. This study evaluate systemic opioid requirement in 48 hours in primary outcome and the analgesic profile ( pain score at rest and on shoulder movement), opioid-related side effects and nerve blocks complications.

Regional anesthesia has been used and studied extensively in breast surgery as an opioid-sparing strategy, with block of the intercostal supply by thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) becoming a popular technique.

This prospective randomized controlled trial is aimed to study the proper regional nerve block technique to reach the postoperative opioid-free requirement modality for breast cancer surgery.
