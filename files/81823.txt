This trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm pilot trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of the HistoSonics Investigational System in treating primary solid renal tumors. Following histotripsy treatment of the solid renal tumor, subjects will undergo imaging ≤36 hours post-index procedure to determine technical success. Additionally, subjects will be followed 180 days (6 months) post-index procedure, with evaluations at the 14-day, 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day time points to establish the efficacy and safety profile of the HistoSonics Investigational System.
