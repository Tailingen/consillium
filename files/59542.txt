Expression of Oncogenic Human Papillomavirus E6/E7 Protein in Tampon Self-Tests
The purpose of this study is to examine for HPV E6/E7 mRNA in tampon self-tests, and compare with the cytological and histological diagnoses.

Study Hypothesis: Expression of HPV E6/E7 mRNA in Tampon self-tests are a suitable alternative to the routine cervical smear.
