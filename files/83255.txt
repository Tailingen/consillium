Multi-center Study on CCeLL-In Vivo's Clinical Efficacy for Intraoperative Brain Tumor Diagnosis.
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of cCeLL compared to frozen section analysis. The investigational device is intended for use with indocyanine green (ICG) for fluorescence imaging as an aid in the visualization of vessels (micro- and macro-vasculature) blood flow in the cerebrovascular before, during or after cranial diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as tumor biopsy and resection, which is then read and analyzed by trained-professional for intraoperative diagnosis. The comparison will be held by the device with the conventional intraoperative histological frozen section analysis of identical brain tissue samples in the same patient. Both methods will be compared in terms of their accuracy using the standard of practice, the final pathological diagnosis.

Non-Inferiority of Diagnostic Accuracy (Percentage of Correct Normal/Tumor Classifications) of cCeLL Compared to Frozen Biopsy, The diagnostic accuracy of cCeLL-In vivo will be assessed by measuring the percentage of correct normal/tumor classifications compared to the reference standard frozen biopsy. Non-inferiority will be determined using pre-specified statistical margins for sensitivity and specificity., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day
Diagnostic Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity of cCeLL Compared to Frozen Biopsy Across Tumor Types and Locations, The diagnostic performance of cCeLL-In vivo will be evaluated by calculating accuracy (percentage of correct diagnoses), sensitivity, and specificity across various tumor types and locations. These values will be compared to those obtained using frozen biopsy as the reference standard., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day|Percentage of Non-Diagnostic Samples in cCeLL Imaging, The percentage of non-diagnostic samples (images that cannot be used for a definitive diagnosis) obtained using cCeLL-In vivo will be recorded. A lower rate of non-diagnostic samples would indicate higher image usability and reliability., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day|Time (Minutes) Required to Obtain a Diagnosis Using cCeLL-In vivo vs. Frozen Biopsy Description:, The time required to obtain a definitive diagnosis will be measured in minutes, from the point of sample collection to the final diagnostic decision. The average diagnostic time for cCeLL-In vivo will be compared to the traditional frozen biopsy method to evaluate potential time efficiency improvements., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day|Inter-Observer Agreement (Cohen's Kappa Score) Between Two Pathologists Using cCeLL-In vivo Images, The level of agreement between two independent pathologists interpreting cCeLL-In vivo images will be measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient (Îº). The kappa score will quantify inter-observer agreement beyond chance, with values ranging from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement)., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day|Diagnostic Accuracy (Percentage of Correct Tumor Classifications) of AI-Based Brain Tumor Diagnosis Using cCeLL-In vivo Images, The accuracy of AI-based diagnosis will be measured as the percentage of correct tumor classifications (normal vs. tumor) compared to the reference standard diagnosis made by expert pathologists. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy will be calculated to evaluate AI performance., Visit 1 (Surgery Day / Intervention Day) as D-Day
