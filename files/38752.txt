MRI-guided Bone Marrow Biopsies of Prostate Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to target lesions of the prostate in the bone and to biopsy these lesions using MRI to identify the areas.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy
To compare the yield of detecting metastatic prostate cancer tissue using MRI-guided bone marrow needle biopsies to that of historical controls obtained through unguided biopsies.
To evaluate the sensitivity of radiographic bone marrow changes detected by MRI for prostate cancer, as determined by the pathologic findings from bone marrow biopsy.
* This study involves a one-time, MRI-guided bone marrow biopsy. Prior to this procedure, patients will need to have a bone scan performed within the last three months and a PSA blood test drawn within one month of registration to the study.
* Patients are also required to participate in the DFCI research study "Collection of Specimens and Clinical Data for Patients with Prostate Cancer or at High Risk for Prostate Cancer".
