Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Combination With Toripalimab for HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer : a Randomized, Open-label, Parallel-controlled, Multi-center Phase III Study (NEOTORCH-BREAST04)
Our center plans to conduct a randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, multi-center phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with Toripalimab for HR+/HER2- breast cancer. The aim is to further explore the treatment strategy of chemotherapy with immunotherapy for patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, provide more treatment options for breast cancer patients, and offer a potential theoretical basis for the precision treatment of breast cancer.The primary study objective is to evaluate the pathologic complete response（PCR）and RCB0-1 ratio of neodjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer.
HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
DRUG: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Combination with Toripalimab|DRUG: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Pathologic Complete Response（PCR）, The primary study objective is to evaluate the pathologic complete response（PCR） of the control group and experimental group., 2 years|RCB 0-1 Ratio, 2 years
Event Free Survival（EFS), Event Free Survival (EFS) refers to the time from the start of randomization (the start of treatment in a single-arm trial) to the first occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression that makes surgical treatment impossible, local or distant recurrence, death due to any cause, etc. It can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug., 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is a key indicator used in medical research, especially in oncology, to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment. It refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a certain extent and remains in that state for a specific period of time after receiving a particular treatment., 5 years
