Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by Central Review Assessment, PFS by central review assessment was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.

Median, 95% Confidence Interval were calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve for each treatment arm., From randomisation until cut-off date 14JUN2016.|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomisation to the time of death from any cause.

Median, 95% Confidence Interval were calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curve for each treatment arm., From randomisation until cut-off date 14JUN2016.
Objective Tumour Response (Complete Response (CR)) + Partial Response (PR) by Central Review Assessment, Objective tumour response was defined as best overall response of CR or PR determined by central review assessment., From randomisation until cut-off date 14JUN2016.|Disease Control (Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease) by Central Review Assessment, Disease control was defined as best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)., From randomisation until cut-off date 14JUN2016.
