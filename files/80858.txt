A Study Comparing Imetelstat Versus Best Available Therapy for the Treatment of Intermediate-2 or High-risk Myelofibrosis (MF) Who Have Not Responded to Janus Kinase (JAK)-Inhibitor Treatment
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the overall survival of participants treated with imetelstat compared to best available therapy with intermediate-2 or high-risk Myelofibrosis (MF) who are relapsed/refractory (R/R) to Janus Kinase (JAK)-Inhibitor treatment.
Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Imetelstat|DRUG: Best Available Therapy (BAT)
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from randomization date to date of death from any cause., Baseline (Day 1) until End of Study (EOS) (approximately 3 years )]
Symptom response rate, The proportion of participants achieving a ≥50% reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) measured at Week 24 compared to baseline, Baseline (Day 1), and at Week 24|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time interval from randomization date to the first date of disease progression (worsening splenomegaly or leukemic transformation per 2013 International Working Group - Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline (Day 1) until End of Study (EOS) (approximately 3 years)|Spleen response rate, The proportion of participants who achieve a reduction in spleen volume of ≥ 35% from baseline at Week 24., Baseline (Day 1), and at Week 24|Complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), clinical improvement (CI), spleen response, symptoms response, and anemia response per modified 2013 IWG-MRT criteria, The proportion of participants achieving CR or PR, CI, spleen response, symptom response, and anemia response per modified 2013 IWG-MRT criteria., Baseline (Day 1) until End of Treatment (approximately 3 years)|Reduction in the degree of bone marrow fibrosis, Reduction in the degree of bone marrow fibrosis will be assessed., Baseline (Day 1) until End of Treatment (approximately 3 years)|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Safety will be assessed based on the incidence and severity (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) of treatment emergent adverse events from the time of randomization until 30 days after completion of treatment, Screening (Day -28 to -1) until End of Study (approximately 3 years)|Assessment of Cmax, Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax)., Day 1 of all cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Assessment of Tmax, Time to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration, Day 1 of all cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Assessment of t1/2, Elimination half-life., Day 1 of all cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Assessment of AUC, Area under the drug concentration-plasma time curve (AUC) from time zero to last measurable concentration, Day 1 of all cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life-Questionnaire-Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores, Patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life, pain, and overall change in participant's health will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30 items resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. Higher scores indicated worse outcome., Baseline to End of Study (approximately 3 years)|EuroQol-EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire scores, EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Baseline to End of Study (approximately 3 years)
This is a multicenter study with 2 arms, and will include 3 phases: a) screening phase of up to 28 days before randomization during which participants will complete a 14-day washout period from all prior therapies including JAK-inhibitor treatment, and the participant's eligibility will be reviewed; b) treatment phase, from randomization until study treatment (imetelstat or BAT) discontinuation; and c) post treatment follow-up phase, that begins when the participant discontinues treatment, and will continue until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study end, whichever occurs first. Participants will be randomized (2:1) into 2 Arms (Arm A will receive imetelstat and Arm B will receive BAT).

Participants who meet progressive disease criteria and discontinue BAT, may crossover to receive imetelstat treatment after sponsor's approval.
