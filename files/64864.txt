Genetic Biomarkers in Saliva Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma
This clinical trial studies genetic biomarkers from saliva samples in patients with Ewing sarcoma. Studying samples of saliva from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
Ewing Sarcoma/Peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET)
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: questionnaire administration
Main effect of gene polymorphisms, Risk ratios (RR) for the main effect of gene polymorphisms will be calculated using log-linear models. RRs and 95% confidence intervals for the gene-environment interaction are calculated by stratifying the likelihood according to case exposure., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the association between the length of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion protein binding sites (microsatellites) and risk of Ewing's sarcoma (ES).

II. To determine the frequency and commonality of Caucasian ancestral markers in cases of ES self-identified as non-Caucasian (African-American, Asian, Hispanic).

III. To determine the association between genomic variants in ES-related genes and hernia development (i.e. the integrin signaling pathway) and risk of ES.

OUTLINE:

Genomic DNA is extracted from participants' saliva samples and analyzed for expression of EWS-FLI1 and other ES-target genes.
