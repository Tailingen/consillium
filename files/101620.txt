Invasive vs. Conservative Management in Cancer Patients With Non-ST Elevation MI (CAN-NSTEMI)"
This retrospective study investigates the impact of invasive versus conservative management strategies in cancer patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-ST MI). Patients aged 18 and older, who were treated for non-ST MI in a hospital setting and had a confirmed cancer diagnosis, are included. The primary outcome is hospital mortality, assessed using GRACE scores to evaluate mortality risk. Patients are grouped based on their received interventions-either invasive (including coronary angiography and revascularization) or pharmacological treatment. Risk factors contributing to mortality, such as cancer type, metastasis presence, comorbidities, and laboratory findings, will also be analyzed to better understand the interplay of oncologic and cardiovascular conditions in this population.

hospital mortality, Hospital mortality rate in cancer patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, comparing invasive and conservative treatment strategies, From the date of hospital admission for NSTEMI until the occurrence of mortality, cardiovascular events, or hospital discharge, assessed up to 30 days.
Length of hospital stay:, Comparison of the duration of hospitalization between the invasive treatment group and the conservative treatment group., From the date of hospital admission for NSTEMI until the occurrence of mortality, cardiovascular events, or hospital discharge, assessed up to 100 days.|Re-hospitalization rate, Rate of readmission after initial discharge, comparing the two treatment strategies., The time frame for assessing re-hospitalization is from the date of hospital discharge to 100 days post-discharge
