Reolysin in Combination With FOLFOX6 and Bevacizumab or FOLFOX6 and Bevacizumab Alone in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if giving reolysin in combination with FOLFOX6/ bevacizumab can offer better results than standard therapy with FOLFOX6/ bevacizumab.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Folfox plus Bevacizumab and reolysin|DRUG: Folfox plus Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival, Time from the day of randomization until the first observation of objective disease relapse or progression, or the appearance of new lesions or death due to any cause. If a patient had not relapsed/progressed or died, PFS was censored on the date of last disease assessment defined as the earliest test date of target lesion or non-target lesions (if patient had no target lesions). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 19 months
Changes in CEA Levels, Changes in CEA level from baseline to week 28 during treatment., Baseline and at 28 weeks|Objective Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response Rate =Proportion of (CR + PR) observed over all randomized patients., 19 months|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause or censored at the time of last known alive, From date of randomization to death from any cause or censored at the time of last known alive, assessed up to 49 months
Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given together with FOLFOX6/ bevacizumab.
