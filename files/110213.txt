Study of SRF617 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase 1, first-in-human, monotherapy and combination dose escalation and expansion study of SRF617.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SRF617|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Dose Limiting Toxicity of SRF617, Evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., Assessed during first 28 days of treatment
Safety Analysis: Summary of adverse events (AEs) and based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), Safety and tolerability of SRF617 monotherapy and combination therapy will be assessed by summarizing adverse events (AEs) and will be based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). A TEAE is an AE that emerges or worsens in the period from the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug assessed by per CTCAE version 5.0 or higher., Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of SRF617, Serum concentrations of SRF617 will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of SRF617., Up to 24 months|Pharmacodynamics of SRF617, Pharmacodynamics of SRF617 will be evaluated via serum target occupancy., Up to 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR will be estimated by the percentage of patients achieving a best overall response of CR or PR per iRECIST., Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first documented response (CR or PR) to documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria, or documented death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with CR, partial PR, or stable disease lasting a minimum of 12 weeks., Up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first treatment on study with study drug to documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria or death., Up to 24 months|Landmark PFS rate, Landmark PFS is defined as the percentage of patients who have not developed PFS events (ie, death or documented disease progression as determined by applicable disease criteria) at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years., Up to 24 months|Effect of SRF617 on intratumoral CD39 enzymatic activity, Levels of intratumoral CD39 enzymatic activity will be evaluated in patients receiving pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies via an in situ ATPase histochemistry assay., Up to 24 months
A Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, study of SRF617, consisting of a monotherapy dose escalation, a monotherapy tumor biopsy expansion, combination dose escalations, and combination safety and efficacy expansions that will enroll patients with advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy tumor biopsy expansion portion of the study will further evaluate the safety and intratumoral pharmacodynamics of SRF617 monotherapy. The combination therapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 in combination with gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel, or SRF617 in combination with pembrolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Once the SRF617 combination recommended Phase 2 doses are established, additional patients with select solid tumors may be enrolled in the respective combination expansion arm of the study. An additional quadruplet combination will also be explored in patients with advanced first line (1L) PDAC (i.e., SRF617 + pembrolizumab + gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel).
