Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Next-generation CD19-UCART
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Next-generation CD19-UCART in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell hematological malignancies.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-UCART
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) incidence, Incidence of adverse events (AEs) defined as DLTs, Day 0 up to 35 days after T cell infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients in whom a response among complete response and partial response as defined by standard disease-specific criteria, will be observed., At 12 weeks
Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death due to disease relapse or drug-related toxicity, up to 2 years after T cell infusion|Progress free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the T cell infusion date to the date of disease progression or death from any cause, up to 2 years after T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of leukapheresis until death from any cause, up to 2 years after T cell infusion
CD19-UCART is a kind of "off-the-shelf" product originated from health donor's PBMC. This is an open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and anti- tumor efficacy of Next-generation CD19-UCART in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell hematological malignancies.
