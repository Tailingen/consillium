Outcomes of A Novel Treatment Decision of Patients With Esophageal and Head and Neck Carcinoma Synchronously
To summarise the outcomes of a treatment decision of patients with superficial esophageal carcinoma synchronously associated with head and neck cancer, that is endoscopic treatment for the superficial esophageal carcinoma plus surgery of the head and neck carcinoma.
Head and Neck Cancer|Esophageal Cancer Stage
The first day of food intake of enrolled patients, The first day of food intake after surgery of the head and neck carcinoma, An average of 1week
The relapse rate of the enrolled patients, the relapse rate of esophageal cancer or head and neck carcinoma respectively of the enrolled patients., an average of 2 years|The hospital stay of enrolled patients, The total hospital stay during the first hospitalization of the enrolled patients, An average of 1 month.|The incidence of stenosis, The average interval of the stenosis, an average of 2 years|The severity of stenosis, The average diameter of the stenosis, an average of 2 years
As a same risk factor, such as heavy drinking and smoking, patients with head and ncek carcinoma are always suffering from synchronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Previous studies illustrated that many patients with multiple esophageal lesions of early stage. In clinical practice, those patients are treated by extensive surgical resection of total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy plus free jejunum interposition or gastric tube, then followed by chemoradiotherapy as standard treatment, resulting in a low quality of life for the patients, and due to the above mentioned disadvantages, many patients with synchronous superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck carcinoma refused the surgery treatment. Our aims is to summarize the the outcomes of endoscopic treatment for the superficial esophageal carcinoma plus surgery of head and neck carcinoma.
