Efficacy and Safety Study of Darolutamide (ODM-201) in Men With High-risk Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BAY1841788 (ODM-201) in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer Non-Metastatic|Castration-Resistant
DRUG: Darolutamide (Nubeqa, BAY1841788)|DRUG: Placebo
Metastasis-Free Survival, Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS) is defined as the time from randomisation to evidence of metastasis or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (cut-off date 15 Nov 2019), From randomization to the time approximately 385 MFS events were observed (approximately 48 months)
Overall Survival - Primary Analysis, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., From randomization of the first subject to the time approximatively 140 death events were observed (approximately 48 months)|Time to Pain Progression - Primary Analysis, Time to pain progression (PP) is defined as time from randomization to pain progression, where progression is defined as an increase of 2 or more points from baseline in question 3 of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaire (BPI-SF) related to the worst pain in the last 24 hours taken as a 7-day average for post-baseline scores, or initiation of short or long-acting opioids for pain, whichever comes first. Initiation or change in the use of other non-opioid analgesics is not used in the analysis of pain progression., From randomization until last study treatment (assessed every 4 months) (approximately 48 months)|Time to Initiation of First Cytotoxic Chemotherapy for Prostate Cancer - Primary Analysis, The time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was defined as the time from randomization to the start of the first cytotoxic chemotherapy cycle., From randomization until last study treatment (assessed every 4 months) (approximately 48 months)|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE) - Primary Analysis, The time to the first SSE was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first SSE., From randomization until last study treatment (assessed every 4 months) (approximately 48 months)|Overall Survival - Final Analysis, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The final analysis was done at the time of the data cut-off (15 NOV 2019)., From randomization of the first subject to the time approximatively 254 death events were observed (approximately 56 months)|Time to Pain Progression - Final Analysis, For time to pain progression, the analysis performed using the primary completion cut-off data (03 SEP 2018) was considered final and no new analysis was performed for time to pain progression., From randomization until last study treatment (assessed every 4 months) (approximately 48 months)|Time to Initiation of First Cytotoxic Chemotherapy for Prostate Cancer - Final Analysis, The time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was defined as the time from randomization to the start of the first cytotoxic chemotherapy cycle. The final analysis was done at the time of the data cut-off (15 NOV 2019)., From randomization until initiation of first cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment (approximately 59 months)|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE) - Final Analysis, The time to the first SSE was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of the first SSE. The final analysis was done at the time of the data cut-off (15 NOV 2019)., From randomization until occurrence of first SSE event (approximately 59 months)
