Nilotinib and LDE225 in the Treatment of Chronic or Accelerated Phase Myeloid Leukemia in Patients Who Developed Resistance to Prior Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of administering the combination of nilotinib and LDE225 to patients with chronic or accelerated phase of chronic myeloid leukemia and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose level (RP2D) of LDE225 in combination with nilotinib.
