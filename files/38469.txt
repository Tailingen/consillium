ORR, The proportion of participants whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)
CBR, the percentage of subjects with CR+PR+SD and last more than 24 weeks in all of the evaluable subjects, Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|PFS, time to progressive disease (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|OS, time to death due to any cause, Randomization to death from any cause, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)
Seven precision treatment cohorts, which targeting NF1 mutation, gBRCA mutation,HER2 mutation, FDGFRb mutation PAM pathway mutations, CD8 and AR, as long as an epigenetic therapy cohort and a combined immunization cohort were initially set up based on gene expression profiles and molecular pathways. The main purpose is to screen valuable treatment cohorts and prepare for subsequent randomized controlled phase III clinical studies with larger sample size.
