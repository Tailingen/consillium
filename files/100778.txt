Comparison of Metal and Plastic Stents for Preoperative Biliary Decompression
Covered self expandable metal stents (CSEMS) are three times larger in diameter than 10 Fr plastic stents. When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in patients with pancreatic cancer.

PROCEDURE: Metal stent|PROCEDURE: Plastic stent
Complications related to stent dysfunction, Complications related to stent dysfunction which include hyperbilirubinemia or cholangitis that warrant stent exchange (repeat intervention by ERCP), 30 days

When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in patients with pancreatic cancer as there will be better drainage of the obstructed biliary system with fewer adverse events.
