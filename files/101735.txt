Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Cetuximab (TPC) in Palliative Treatment of Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)
Docetaxel and cetuximab are FDA-approved for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Cisplatin and carboplatin, while not FDA-approved for SCCHN, have been used as standard of care in SCCHN patients in combination with other drugs. This study evaluates if weekly cisplatin and docetaxel, in combination with cetuximab, is effective in palliative treatment of patients with SCCHN. These drugs will be given intravenously weekly, repeated 3 of every 4 weeks until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), Clinical response for each participant will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. Overall response rate (ORR) was assessed as the sum of the number of participants that experience a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The outcome is defined and reported as the number of subjects that responded, a number without dispersion. Other response statuses are included. RECIST v1.1 criteria is defined as follows.

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial Response (PR) = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria, 8 weeks
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, was assessed through 24 months, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. The outcome is reported as the median time that participants remained free of progression, with 95% confidence interval (CI).

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions
* Partial Response (PR) = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
* Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria, 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was assessed through 24 months. The outcome is reported as the median time that participants remained alive, with 95% CI., 24 months|Grade 3, 4, and 5 Related Adverse Events (Toxicities), Related adverse events are considered toxicities. The outcome was assessed as adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs per 21CFR§312.32) at least Grade 3, and are reported as the number of toxicities by grade (3, 4 or 5), a number without dispersion., 2 years
Primary Objective:To establish the response rate using RECIST 1 criteria to weekly TPC in patients with metastatic or relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Secondary Objective: To establish the safety profile, progression free and overall survival of weekly TPC in this patient population.
