Comparison of Whole Body DWI to FDG PET
This is a single arm prospective trial that evaluates whole body diffusion weight imaging (DWI) compared to 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography with Magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in participants with known metastatic cancer.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Fluorodeoxyglucose F18|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography combined with Magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI)|PROCEDURE: Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (WB-MRI-DWI)|DEVICE: General Electric (GE) SIGNA PET/MR
Proportion of lesions characterized as positive, The overall proportion of lesions that will be characterized as positive on whole body (WB) diffusion weight imaging (DWI) and FDG PET., Up to 6 months
Inter-reader variability of diffusion weight imaging (DWI) interpretation, Inter-reader variability is the degree of agreement among independent observers who rate, code, or assess the same image. Eighteen regions per participant will be scored by two blinded readers at each time point and assessed for the presence of DWI positive disease (local disease; nodal disease: pelvic, retroperitoneal, thoracic, and other; osseous disease: skull, ribs and sternum, cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine, right/left pelvis, sacrum and upper/lower extremities; visceral disease: lung, liver, and other). Scores range from 0 to 1 with 1 being excellent agreement between the two readers., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Correlation of DWI and FDG to detect disease.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Inter-reader variability of DWI interpretation by region.

OUTLINE:

Participants will be imaged at a single timepoint using whole body DWI concurrent with FDG PET/MRI within 60 days of receiving a non-FDG PET (either PET/CT or PET/MRI). There will be an optional PET/MRI performed within six months of the original study. Participants will be followed up through a medical records review for up to two years.
