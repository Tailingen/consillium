Status of Surgical Resection and Histologic Subtype as Predictors of Local Recurrence in Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas are rare malignant tumors. Liposarcoma constitute the most frequent histological subtype of retroperitoneal sarcoma. The prognosis of soft tissue sarcomas depend on clinical and histologic characteristics. Objective: Evaluate variables that may be related to overall survival and local recurrence free survival in patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Methods: retrospective analysis of medical records of 60 patients attended from 1997 to 2017, who underwent surgical resection of retroperitoneal liposarcoma.
