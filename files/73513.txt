Phase 1 Study of Oprozomib Administered Orally in Patients With Advanced Refractory or Recurrent Solid Tumors
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Oprozomib in patients with advanced refractory or recurrent solid tumors including determination of its Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Oprozomib To explore the anti-tumor activity of Oprozomib in this patient population including the overall response rate (ORR), the duration of responses (DOR), the progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) To define the pharmacodynamics (PDn) of Oprozomib.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Oprozomib
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), * To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Oprozomib in patients with advanced refractory or recurrent solid tumors including determination of its Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
* To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Oprozomib, 31 months
Overall response rate (ORR), duration of responses (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to progression (TTP), * To explore the anti-tumor activity of Oprozomib in this patient population including the overall response rate (ORR), the duration of responses (DOR), the progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP)
* To define the pharmacodynamics (PDn) of Oprozomib., 31 months
This is a Phase 1, open label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, MTD, and PK/PDn of Oprozomib when administered orally (PO) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of a 14 day cycle in patients with advanced refractory or recurrent solid tumor malignancies for which standard curative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.
