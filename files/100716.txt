Holmium-166 Retrospective Collection of Real-World Data
The primary objective of the study is to further describe the general safety and clinical performance of QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres and QuiremScoutTM Holmium-166 Microspheres in a real-world post-market setting, with specific attention to outcomes per tumor origin.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Metastatic Cancer
DEVICE: Selective Internal Radiation Therapy with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres
Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, The primary safety endpoint is defined in terms of incidence of adverse events CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade â‰¥ 3, or any grade of a predefined list of events stemming from risk management of QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres and QuiremScoutTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 30 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from SIRT procedure until overall progression or death, 30 months|Hepatic Progression Free Survival (HPFS), Time from SIRT procedure until progression in the liver or death, 30 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from SIRT procedure until death from any cause, 30 months|Tumor response in the liver, Response as per routine practice following the guidelines for corresponding tumor type, 3 months|Lung shunt prediction, Lung shunt prediction will be evaluated by comparing the predicted and actual lung shunt, either in terms of percentage or absorbed dose, 1 month
Administered activity, The technical performance of SIRT in term of administered activity in Becquerel (GBq or MBq) with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 1 month|Liver volume treated, The technical performance of SIRT in term of liver volume treated in mL with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 1 month|SIRT treatment approach, The technical performance of SIRT in term of treatment approach (selective, lobar, bi-lobar, whole liver) with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 1 month|Tumor absorbed dose, The technical performance of SIRT in term of tumor absorbed dose in Gray (Gy) recorded from post-treatment imaging or based on injected activity and target volume with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 1 month|Normal liver absorbed dose, The technical performance of SIRT in term of normal liver absorbed dose in Gray (Gy) recorded from post-treatment imaging or based on injected activity and target volume with QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres., 1 month|The use of Q-SuiteTM in clinical practice, The use of Q-SuiteTM in clinical practice will be recorded based on the software which is mentioned in the description of treatment or the presence of a Q-SuiteTM generated report in the patient's medical file., 1 month|Number of patients downstaged to liver resection or liver transplantation, The number of patients downstaged to liver resection or liver transplantation will be reviewed based on the number of patients that underwent liver resection or liver transplantation after the SIRT procedure, 30 months
This study, with an observational retrospective longitudinal design, is intended to collect data from the devices (QuiremScoutTM Holmium-166 Microspheres, QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres, and where available, Q-SuiteTM) used in a post-market, real-world setting. It is non-comparative due to the retrospective nature of the study.
