Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: JNJ-78278343
Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/ biological agent under study., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants With AEs by Severity, Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) will be graded according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) guidelines., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be reported. The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Up to 1 year and 10 months
Serum Concentration of JNJ-78278343, Serum concentrations of JNJ-78278343 will be determined., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Systemic Cytokine Concentrations, Cytokine concentrations will be determined for biomarker assessment., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Concentration, Serum PSA concentration will be measured., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants With Anti-JNJ-78278343 Antibodies, Serum samples will be analyzed for the detection of anti-JNJ-78278343 antibodies using a validated assay method., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a partial response (PR) or better according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 response criteria without evidence of bone progression according to prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3)., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as time from the date of first dose of JNJ-78278343 until the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever comes first., Up to 1 year and 10 months|PSA Response Rate, PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a decline of PSA of 50 percent (%) or more from baseline. The maximum reduction from baseline in PSA will also be calculated during the treatment., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated among responders (PR or better) from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the PCWG3 or RECIST version 1.1 response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 1 year and 10 months
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-78278343 in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and the safety at the RP2Ds in Part 2 (Dose Expansion).
