QL1706 Plus Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early High-Risk ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
This study will look at the efficacy and safety of QL1706 plus albumin-bound paclitaxel followed by AC/EC in a neoadjuvant setting, in high-risk, ER+/HER2- early breast cancer.

pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0/Tis, PCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|pCR rate in PD-L1+ population, pCR rate (ypT0/is ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in participants with tumors expressing Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|rate of RCB scored 0-1, Residual cancer burden scored at 0-1 on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Objective Response Rate (ORR) Objective Response Rate (ORR) Objective Response Rate (ORR)Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on BICR and investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start
This study is a single-arm, single-center, phase II clinical trial aimed at observing and evaluating the effectiveness and safety of QL1706 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel, sequential AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) neoadjuvant therapy for early high-risk ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

A total of 76 subjects are planned to be enrolled. After enrollment, subjects will receive QL1706 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel for 4 cycles followed by sequential AC/EC treatment for 4 cycles. Each treatment cycle will span 3 weeks until the occurrence of a specified treatment termination event, after which subjects will continue to undergo postoperative efficacy and safety assessments.

Safety assessments will be conducted before each QL1706 treatment cycle. Imaging evaluations will be performed every 2 cycles until completion of 8 cycles of treatment to assess efficacy. Additional imaging assessments may be performed as clinically indicated during the study. Tumor imaging assessments will continue until confirmed disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, initiation of new anti-tumor therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first.

Following treatment completion, a treatment completion visit will be conducted. Subjects who discontinue treatment due to reasons other than RECIST v1.1-defined disease progression will undergo regular tumor imaging assessment follow-ups to evaluate time to disease progression. Subjects will also undergo survival follow-up visits every 6 months (every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months thereafter) after treatment completion to collect and record survival status and subsequent anti-tumor treatment information.
