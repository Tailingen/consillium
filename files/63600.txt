Talazoparib - Carboplatin for Recurrent High-grade Glioma With DDRd
In view of the strong biological rationale of employing PARP inhibition in high grade glioma, the current study purposes testing of talazoparib in a biomarker-enriched group of glioma. Carboplatin will be added to sensitize the tumor to PARP inhibition, and low dose radiation therapy will be applied to increase talazoparib drug penetration through blood-brain barrier. The goal is to estimate the effect size of such combinational treatment approach in recurrent high-grade glioma with DNA damage repair deficiency (dDDR)
Recurrent Glioma|Recurrent Glioblastoma|Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor|PTEN Gene Inactivation|IDH Mutation
DRUG: Talazoparib
Progression free survival in 6 months, Free from disease progression based on RANO criteria, 6 month
Overall survival, from date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause, 1 year|Objective response rate, The percentage of patients with radiologically complete or partial response as determined by the investigator according to RANO criteria, 1 year|Duration of response, The time interval between the time patient develops radiologically complete or partial response to disease progression according to RANO criteria, 1 year
Recurrent high grade glioma with dDDR, defined by genomic aberrations associated including IDH mutation, PTEN mutation and "BRCAness" signature as defined by next-generation-sequencing (NGS) based comprehensive genomic profiling, will be enrolled.

Patients will receive treatment in 7-day cycle. D1-4: Oral talazoparib 0.75mg daily; D1: Carboplatin (AUC 1.5). On cycle 1 day 1 low dose whole radiation radiation therapy will be given to increase drug penetration. Primary outcome is 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6) by RANO criteria. The study intended to recruit 33 subjects
