A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of TRK-750 for the Treatment of Patients With CIPN (Chopin Study)
The primary objective of the study is:

• to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple oral (twice daily \[BID\]) doses of TRK-750 in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

The secondary objectives of the study are:

* to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 in reducing neuropathic symptoms, improving quality of life (QoL), and clinician-reported outcomes in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.
* to study the relationship between plasma concentrations of TRK-750 and safety and efficacy variables in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.

The exploratory objective of this study is:

• to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 on pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker(s) in blood, psychophysical, electrophysiological, and histological parameters of neuropathy in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.
