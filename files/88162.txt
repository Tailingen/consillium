KN026 Plus Chemotherapy ± KN-046 in HER2 Positive Colorectal Cancer and Biliary Carcinoma
The goal of this Interventional clinical trial is to learn about the efficacy and safety of KN026 and chemotherapy ± KN046 in HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer and biliary tract cancer. Participants will receive standard first-line chemotherapy (capecitabine + oxaliplatin) combined with KN026 (a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody) ± KN046 （a PD-L1/CTLA-4 targeted bispecific antibody）.
