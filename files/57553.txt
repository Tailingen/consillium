Soft Coagulation for the Prevention of Adenoma Recurrence
Recurrence after endoscopic mucosal resection of laterally spreading lesions (LSL) \>= 20mm in size occurs in approximately 20% of cases at surveillance colonoscopy. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic adjuvant thermal ablation of the EMR mucosal defect margin in reducing adenoma recurrence following colonic EMR.
