Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Urinary Tract Stones: a BMI-Adjusted Analysis in Iraqi Women
The goal of this observational case-control study is to find out the impact of PCOS as a risk factor for the presence of urinary tract stones taking into account the BMI of women aged 18-40 years consulting the gynecology and obstetrics outpatient clinic at Al-Elwiya Maternity Teaching Hospital.

The study aims to collect information from approximately 200 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 200 volunteers who do not have PCOS.

A written consent was obtained from all the participants. The information collected included age, weight, and height. In addition, focused history and clinical examination were conducted for all patients, and for some patients, one or more additional blood tests were obtained. The additional tests included but not limited to serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone-binding globulin. Moreover, ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained for all patients as part of the diagnosis of PCOS and as screening for urinary tract stones. Also, transvaginal ultrasonography was obtained for some patients according to the individual condition as requested by the treating gynecologist. The diagnosis ofc PCOS was based on the Rotterdam criteria. (1)

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Is PCOS a risk factor for urinary tract stones when taking BMI into account?
* Is PCOS a risk for urinary tract stones at all?
* Is there an association between PCOS and BMI?
* Does BMI affect the presence of urinary tract stones at all and the presence of urinary tract stones when taking PCOS into account?
