Adjuvant Therapy Omission for Resected NSCLC Patients With Longitudinal Undetectable MRD
Molecular residual disease (MRD) has strong relationship with clinical outcome in multiple solid tumors. Here, the investigators try to verify the negative predictive value of undetectable MRD, which is considered as a superior prognostic factor for resected NSCLC patients, and not requiring excessive adjuvant therapy. Stage IB-IIIA resected NSCLC patients with landmark and longitudinal undetectable MRD are enrolled and under close surveillance in this study.

Stage IB-IIIA resected NSCLC patients will undergo two-round MRD tests after operation, first in 3-7 days and second in 1 month after operation. And patients who confirm two-round landmark undetectable MRD will be enrolled. Enrolled patients will be under close MRD and imaging monitoring without any adjuvant therapy.
