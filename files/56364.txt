A Study of ES102 (OX40 Agonist) in Combination With JS001 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ES102 (OX40 agonist) in combination with JS001 (anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
