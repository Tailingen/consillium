Biobank and Register of Patients With Agresive Tumors for Translational and Analytical Research
The investigators will collect biosamples of patient blood and tumour tissue for further immunological analysis of blood cell subpopulations, immunosupressive factors concentration, HLA expression an lymphocytes and tumour tissue, and and cancer testis antigenes expression on tumour cells, as well as clinical data on patient's stage, therapy, response and demographics. Possible prognostic and predictive dynamic biomarkers will be discovered for individualisation of treatment strategies
