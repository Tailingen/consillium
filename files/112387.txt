A Comparative Study of Degarelix Three-month Depot in Three Different Dosing Regimens in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The rationale of the study was to evaluate different degarelix dosing regimens for a three-month interval that was to produce and maintain castration in prostate cancer patients through immediate and prolonged testosterone suppression, and to provide confirmatory evidence of the safety of degarelix.

Number of Participants With Testosterone Level <=0.5 ng/mL From Day 28 Until the End of the Study, Figure in the table give the number of participants with all testosterone values \<=0.5 ng/mL from Day 28 to the end of the study., From Day 28 to 12 or 13 months
Number of Participants With Testosterone Level <=0.5 ng/mL After the Dose at Day 28 Until the End of the Study, Figures in the table give the number of participants with all testosterone values \<=0.5 ng/mL after the dose at Day 28 to end of study. Thus, the testosterone response after the initial dose is not included in this outcome measure., From after Day 28 to 12 or 13 months|Number of Participants With Testosterone <=0.5 ng/mL at Day 28, Figures in the table give number of participants with testosterone \<=0.5 ng/mL 28 days after the initial dose of trial medication., 28 Days|Liver Function Tests, The figures present the number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and bilirubin levels plus the number of participants who had ALT increases \>3x ULN and ALT increases \>3x ULN with concurrently increased bilirubin \>1.5 ULN., 12 or 13 months|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Change in Vital Signs and Body Weight as Compared to Baseline, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight. The table presents the number of participants with normal baseline and at least one post-baseline markedly abnormal value., 12 or 13 months
