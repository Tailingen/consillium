Stage I/II NSCLC Perioperative Chemotherapy
The addition of chemotherapy to lung cancer surgery is now considered as the standard of care. Solid data support postoperative chemotherapy but only few results are available in the preoperative setting. To define which timing of perioperative chemotherapy offers the best survival improvement, the IFCT 0002 study is conducted in France.

In this multicenter study, patients are randomized to receive either two preoperative chemotherapy cycles plus two additional preoperative cycles if they respond to chemotherapy, or two preoperative plus two postoperative cycles in case of response.
