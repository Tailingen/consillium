Number and percentages of patients with documented OR will be presented., Until disease progression or end of study, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months|Evaluation of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Will be calculated as from the first study drug dose to the day progression of disease is confirmed radiological or date of death., From first study drug dose until disease progression or end of study, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months|Evaluation of Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) â‰¥6 months, Will be calculated according to standard response criteria, Until disease progression or end of study, whichever comes first, assessed up to 6 months|Evaluation of duration of response., Will be calculated from the day the initial response is observed to the day progression of disease is observed, Until disease progression or end of study, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months|Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Investigator assessment (based on Immunotherapeutics Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [iRECIST]), Will be based on Investigators assessment on Immunotherapeutic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), Until disease progression or end of study, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months|Evaluation Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival will be derived from start of treatment until death or latest survival follow-up., From first dose of study drug until death or latest survival follow-up assessed up to 30 month|Evaluation of immunogenicity of each antibody drug in the combinations, Occurrence of antidrug antibody (ADA) measured in serum at selected time points during the study, From screening up to 30 months
The study will evaluate safety and efficacy in patients with:

* Biliary tract carcinomas patients who have progressed on one prior line of gemcitabine and platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.
* Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients who have progressed on one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

The trial is set up as 3 sub-studies.

* Sub-study 1 includes biliary tract carcinoma patients and is composed of 2 investigational combination treatment arms (Sym021+Sym022 \[Arm A\] and Sym021+Sym023 \[Arm B\]).
* Sub-study 2, includes biliary tract carcinoma patients and is composed of one investigational combination treatment arm:Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan. A safety lead- in phase is included to assess tolerability of the combination. A Study Safety Team will review clinical and laboratory safety data and will make decisions regarding the continued enrollment after the safety lead-in phase.
* Sub-Study 3, includes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients and is composed of one investigational combination treatment arm: Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan. Dose of irinotecan in this arm will be selected based upon the safety lead in in sub-study 2 period.

August 2021 : Based upon results from a recent per protocol Interim Analysis (IA) it is has been decided as of 3rd of August 2021 to stop further enrollment into Sub-study 1 Arm A (Sym021+Sym022). Future patients will be allocated to either Sub-study 1 Arm B (Sym021+Sym023) or Sub-study 2 (Sym021+Sym023+irinotecan).
