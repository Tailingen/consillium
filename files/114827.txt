Capecitabine Pharmacokinetics(PK)-Actual Versus Ideal Body Weight
The purpose of this research study is to find what happens to capecitabine in the body when dosed using actual versus ideal body weight in subjects with advanced tumors and elevated body mass index.
Obesity|Neoplasms
DRUG: Xeloda
Area Under the Curve (AUC) on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 9, AUC will be calculated for Capecitabine dosed for Ideal Body Weight during the first cycle (days 1-7) and for Capecitabine dosed for Actual Body Weight for first cycle (days 9-15). \[nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach\], Up to 15 days|Cmax During Cycle 1, Cmax will be reported for Capecitabine dosed for Ideal Body Weight during the first cycle (days 1-7) and for Capecitabine dosed for Actual Body Weight for first cycle (days 9-15). \[nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach\], Up to 15 days
Response Rate, Responses will be determined using RECIST v. 1.1 criteria and summarized in tabular format. The complete and partial response rates will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals., Up to 6 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 6 months
Cycle 1 : Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 orally Per os (PO) once a day (BID) for 7 consecutive days (D1 - D7) will be administered by subject (with Ideal Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage. Day 8-No drug administered.

Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 7 more consecutive days (D9 - D15) will be administered by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage. There will be 6 consecutive days that no drug will be administered by subject (Days 16-21).

Cycle 2 and beyond: Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 14 consecutive days (D1 - D14) will be administered by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage. Days 15-21-No drug administered.
