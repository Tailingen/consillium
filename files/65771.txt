Comparative Effectiveness of Targeted Therapies in BRAF Positive Metastatic Melanoma in the US
This study aims to compare real-world effectiveness of BRAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients in the United States by line of therapy.

The Flatiron Health electronic health record (EHR) data from US cancer clinics will be used for this retrospective database analysis.
Melanoma
DRUG: Encorafenib|DRUG: Binimetinib|DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Dabrafenib|DRUG: Trametinib
Overall Survival (OS), As per COLUMBUS trial, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause; if death was not observed, participants were censored at the date of last contact or the data analysis cut-off date, whichever occurred first. As per Flatiron EHR, OS was defined as the time from the index date to the date of death; participants without a date of death were censored at their last known activity date or the end of the follow-up period, whichever occurred first. Index date in each treatment group was defined as the date of treatment initiation. Kaplan-Meier analyses was used for analysis., COLUMBUS: From date of randomization until death or censoring (approx 80.5 months); Flatiron: From index date until death due or censoring or end of follow-up period (92.7 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), COLUMBUS:PFS=time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first; PD:at least 20 percentage (%) increase in the sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, reference to the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition, increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimiter square (mm2) or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion, if a participant did not have an event at the analysis cut-off date, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumour assessment. Flatiron:PFS=time from the index date to either the date of first PD event or death in the absence of progression; participants without PD or death were censored at the last date the participant could have been assessed for progression or the data analysis cut-off date, whichever occurred first. Index date was =the date of treatment initiation., COLUMBUS: From date of randomization until death or censoring (approx 80.5 months); Flatiron: From index date until death due or censoring or end of follow-up period (92.7 months)
