Neoadjuvant Intra-tumor Double Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
This trial is designed to investigate the safety, response rates and survival outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by delivery of CTLA4 and PD1 or PDL1 antibodies combination through CT-guided intra-tumor (IT) injection.

Antibodies against CTLA4, PD1 or PDL1 are representative drugs for the check-points inhibitory agents, and their clinical indications have been approved in various types of tumors, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and late recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, et al. Those drugs are regularly systemically administrated by vein infusion, however, local delivery of those drugs via interventional radiology technique including trans-artery or intra-tumor injection may increase the local drug concentration of the tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions. CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab has been widely effectively using to combine with PD1 or PDL1 antibody and this study is to combine ipilimumab and PD1 antibody or PDL1 antibody, so called double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy, as neoadjuvant therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via intra-tumor admistration. To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the safety, efficacy and survival benefit of the double checkpoint inhibitors combination therapy for cancer patients as neoadjuvant treatment via intra-tumor delivery. This phase II clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and survival benefit of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab or durvalumab combination with or without chemodrug or bevacizumab as neoaduvant therapy on patients with HCC, including safety, pCR, mPR, PFS, ORR, DCR, and median survival time.
