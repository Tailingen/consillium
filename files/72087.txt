A Study to Evaluate MK-0482 for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) (MK-0482-002)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-0482. There are 2 parts of this study. Part 1 is a dose escalation which will follow an accelerated titration design (ATD) for participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML or CMML. Part 2 is a dose expansion for participants with R/R AML.

The percentage of participants that experienced a DLT was reported for each arm., Cycle 1 (up to 21 days)|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 10 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 4 months
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-0482, Cmax was defined as the maximum concentration of MK-0482 observed in plasma. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine Cmax of MK-0482., Cycle 1: Pre-dose and Days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 post-dose. Cycle=21 days.|Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of MK-0482, Cmin (or Ctrough) was defined as the lowest concentration of MK-0482 reached during a dosing interval (time interval between administration of two doses). Blood samples were collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine Cmin of MK-0482., Cycle 1: Pre-dose and Days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 post-dose. Cycle=21 days.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 21 Days (AUC0-21) of MK-0482, AUC0-21 was defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 21 days. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine AUC0-21 of MK-0482., Cycle 1: Pre-dose and Days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 post-dose. Cycle=21 days.|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of MK-0482, Tmax was defined as the time to maximum concentration of MK-0482 observed in plasma. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine Tmax of MK-0482., Cycle 1: Pre-dose and Days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 post-dose. Cycle=21 days.|Plasma Elimination Terminal Half-life (t½) of MK-0482, t½ was defined as the time required to divide the MK-0482 plasma concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and post-dose at designated timepoints to determine t½ of MK-0482., Cycle 1: Pre-dose and Days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 post-dose. Cycle=21 days.|Complete Remission (CR) Rate, CR Rate was assessed by the investigator per 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) Response Criteria for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and was defined as bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 10\^9/L (1000/µL); and platelet count ≥100 × 10\^9/L (100,000/µL). The percentage of participants with CR (CR Rate) was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 10 months|Composite CR Rate, Composite CR rate was assessed by the investigator per 2017 ELN Response Criteria for AML and was defined as CR plus CR with incomplete recovery (CRi). CR was defined as bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 10\^9/L (1000/µL); and platelet count ≥100 × 10\^9/L (100,000/µL). CRi was defined as all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 × 10\^9/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 × 10\^9/L \[100,000/µL\]). The percentage of participants with Composite CR (Composite CR Rate) was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 10 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was assessed by the investigator per 2017 ELN Response Criteria for AML and was defined as the combined percentage of participants with CR, CRi, and partial remission (PR). CR was defined as bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 10\^9/L (1000/µL); platelet count ≥100 × 10\^9/L (100,000/µL)\]. CRi was defined as all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 × 10\^9/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 × 10\^9/L \[100,000/µL\]). PR was defined as all hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pre-treatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%). ORR was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 10 months
In Part 1, single participants will be enrolled sequentially into escalating dose levels. Progression from one dose level to the next higher dose level will be based on the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Once a preliminary RP2D is identified in Part 1, approximately 10 to 15 additional participants with R/R AML will be enrolled at the RP2D for Part 2.
