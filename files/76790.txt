S-1 vs Capecitabine in the Elderly and/or Poor Performance Status Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This study is an open-label, single-center, and randomized phase II study designed to evaluate each efficacy and safety of S-1 and capecitabine in the elderly and/or poor performance status patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. The randomization will be stratified by age (70-85 years versus 65 years and \< 70 years) and performance status, which is dependent on age group; in 70-85 years, ECOG performance status 0-1 versus 2 and in ³65 years and \<70 years, ECOG performance status 2 versus 3.

* S-1 40mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1 (evening) - 15 (morning)
* Capecitabine 1250mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1 (evening) - 15 (morning) Treatment will be administered every 3 weeks and will be continued in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
