Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption Using Exablate Focused Ultrasound With Doxorubicin for Treatment of Pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted blood brain barrier disruption with Exablate Model 4000 Type2.0/2.1 in combination with Doxorubicin therapy for the treatment of DIPG in pediatric patients
Brain Tumor
DEVICE: Exablate|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Adverse Events, All adverse events from first treatment to end of study will be documented and reported according to the CTCAE terminology and severity scale, 2 years
Blood Brain Barrier Disruption (BBBD), BBBD will be assessed as a comparative ratio measured in pre and post-sonication contrast-enhanced MR images, immediately post BBBD sonication
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be assessed based on the Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) scale., 2 years
This is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of Blood Brain Barrier Disruption (BBBD) using the Exablate Type 2 system in pediatric patients with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) undergoing Doxorubicin chemotherapy. The study will be conducted at up to three sites in the United States. Patients will undergo 3 treatment cycles, approximately 4-6 weeks apart. The study aims to establish feasibility and safety of Exablate BBBD in conjunction with Doxorubicin in the treatment of pediatric DIPG and assess preliminary efficacy in this patient population.
