First-In-Human Phase I Trial of Ningetinib ( CT053PTSA ) in the Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I, single-arm, single-center, open-label, dose-escalation Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: CT053PTSA
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the CT053PTSA will be determined according to incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.0, Cycle 0 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA_Cmax, To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA with Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Cycle 0 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA_Tmax, To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA with Time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax)., Cycle 0 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA_AUC, To evaluate the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CT053PTSA with Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC)., Cycle 0 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28|Efficacy of CT053PTSA_ORR, To assess overall response rate (ORR) for patients treated CT053PTSA., up to approximately 36 months|Efficacy of CT053PTSA_DCR, To assess disease control rate (DCR) for patients treated CT053PTSA., up to approximately 36 months
This is a dose-escalation study. The primary purpose is to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend doses and regimen of CT053PTSA for further studies.
