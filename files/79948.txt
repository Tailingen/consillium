EXErcise Regimen Designed to Improve Functional Mobility, Body Composition, and Strength After Treatment for Breast CA
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn how a group resistance training plan can improve body mobility and strength in female breast cancer patients who have completed their breast cancer treatment. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is resistance training feasible following breast cancer treatment
* Can it improve the body's mobility and strength lost as a result of the breast cancer treatment
* can it improve the body's composition (for example muscle mass)
* can resistance training increase one's activity level and help prevent weight gain, perhaps, lowering the risk of cancer recurrence.

Participants will attend a group resistance training exercise group program, 3-4 times per week, under close supervision with monitoring a participant's ability to safely and effectively complete the program. The exercises include: lunges, squats and dead lifts.

Obesity and low muscle mass, i.e. poor body composition, is a risk factor for breast cancers and disease recurrence after treatment. Furthermore, weight gain during and after treatment for breast cancer is associated with higher risk of recurrence, distant metastases, and death. Activity levels have been repeatedly associated with a lower risk of cancer incidence, improved outcomes after cancer treatment and improved overall survival, yet the majority of breast cancer survivors do not meet adequate daily activity level recommendations.

This protocol seeks to prospectively follow forty (40) female breast cancer patients (ages 20-95) during exercise who are post-cancer treatment and to assess the safety and feasibility of a monitored group exercise regimen utilizing high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements under close supervision and with the goal of improving functional mobility, body composition, and strength after cancer treatment. This regimen is a standard of care regimen utilized in strength and conditioning protocols. The investigators hypothesize that an observed exercise regimen such as this will prove safe and feasible in women and may improve functional mobility, body composition and resting metabolic rate.

The exercise regimen will utilize a mixture of compound movements utilizing mainly closed kinetic chain movements (CKC), focusing on exercises with the goal of improving physical and metabolic function, mobility, muscle mass and body composition utilizing guidelines from the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA). CKC exercises include lunges, squats, and dead lifts.
