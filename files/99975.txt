Solid Tumor
DRUG: PEGPH20
To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEGPH20. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PEGPH20 in advanced cancer patients over a range of doses., 28 days
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PEGPH20, 28 days|To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of PEGPH20., 28 days|To observe patients for any evidence of anti-tumor activity (efficacy)., 28 days|To explore pharmacodynamic endpoints that may guide the further development of PEGPH20., 28 days
This is a study of PEGPH20 in human subjects and is designed to evaluate the safety of PEGPH20 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PEGPH20. All patients will receive PEGPH20. Each group of patients will receive a higher dose than the previous group. This will continue until the group with the highest planned dose completes the study or until a group has major side effects from their assigned dose.
