Preoperative Radiotherapy in Patients at High Risk of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula After Pancreatoduodenectomy
The FIBROPANC-1 investigates the feasibility and safety of preoperative stereotactic radiotherapy of 4cm pancreas in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy at high risk (\>25%) of developing post operative pancreatic fistula (POPF). A single course of 12Gy preoperative radiotherapy may lead to sufficient fibrosis in a small (4cm) targeted area, thereby reducing the risk of grade B and C POPF.
