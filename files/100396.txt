A Head-to-head Comparative Study of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging in Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy and is still incurable. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has been used to diagnose, assess treatment response, and predict prognosis in MM. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer, but there is heterogeneous uptake in MM, that is, uptake is negative in some myeloma cells. There are currently reports of cases with strong uptake of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT in MM. Therefore, this preliminary study was designed to compare the imaging results of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT, and to evaluate the additional value of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT to 18F-FDG PET/CT in MM.

DRUG: 18F-PSMA-1007|DRUG: 18F-FDG
number of myeloma lesions, comparing the number of myeloma lesions detected by 18F-PSMA-1007 and 18F-FDG PET, through study completion, an average of 1 year
standardized uptake value (SUV) of myeloma lesions, comparing the SUVmax of myeloma lesions derived from 18F-PSMA-1007 and 18F-FDG PET/CT, through study completion, an average of 1 year
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can identify bone lesions, assess disease burden, and detect extramedullary lesions in multiple myeloma(MM), but due to MM is a complex and heterogeneous disease , 18F-FDG PET/CT has heterogeneous uptake in MM bone lesions, resulting in false negative results in the diagnosis of MM bone disease, then affecting the diagnosis, staging and evaluation of the response to treatment of MM. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a specific membrane-bound glycoprotein, recently high uptake in PSMA PET/CT in MM bone lesions has been published in case reports, thus PSMA PET CT imaging may have potential value for multiple myeloma. There are no head-to-head studies comparing 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT with 18F-FDG PET/CT in multiple myeloma. Therefore, this study intends to compare the detection rate of lesions by 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in MM , and to evaluate the additional value of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT to 18F-FDG PET/CT in multiple myeloma.
