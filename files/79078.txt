Immune Repertoire of Ovarian HGSC
In this preliminary study, peripheral blood and carcinoma tissue with pericarcinomatous tissue are taken from the patients with ovarian high grade serous carcinoma at several points: before any treatment, after the debulking surgery, and after all the proposed chemotherapy. The differential expression of the T/B lymphocyte receptors in these samples will be analyzed with the platinum-based treatment and survival outcomes of the patients. The primary objective is the expression rates of T/B lymphocyte receptors in different stages of checking points.
