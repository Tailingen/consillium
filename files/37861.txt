Effect of Different Doses of AMG 706 on the Gallbladder in Advanced Solid Tumors
The study involves the use of three different dosing regimens of AMG 706 in patients with advanced solid tumors to see how the drug affects the gallbladder size and function. The study will be conducted in 11 sites in the US and Australia. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled in the study with the possibility of enrolling 8 more in each treatment arm.
