Trial of AEB071 in Combination With BYL719 in Patients With Melanoma
Primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of AEB071 and BYL719. Secondary objectives are to define the safety and tolerability of AEB071 and BYL719.

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and is thought to be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, and no systemic therapy has yet been demonstrated to improve survival. Drugs commonly used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma. Because of the lack of effective systemic treatment options, outcomes are poor once metastatic disease occurs, and the median survival from the time of the development of distant metastatic disease is 6 to 12 months. Although it is clear that novel effective therapies are desperately needed for this disease, the development of such therapies has been hampered by the rarity of uveal melanoma.
