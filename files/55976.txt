Diagnostic Value of C-reactive Protein and White Blood Cell Counts for Early Detection of Inflammatory Complications After Open Resection of Colorectal Cancer
Although widely used, there is a lack of evidence concerning diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell counts (WBC) in the postoperative course. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP and WBC for postoperative inflammatory complications after open resection of colorectal cancer.
Given Indication for Open Resection of Colorectal Cancer
postoperative inflammatory complications, 30 days
Anastomotic leakage, 60 days
