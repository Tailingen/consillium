Safety, Tolerability, Distribution & Dose Effect of Neoadjuvant Transarterial Chemoembolization With Doxorubicin in Prostate Cancer Patients Before Radical Prostatectomy
Our hypothesis is that the doxorubicin eluting-beads currently used in hepato-oncology might be applicable to high-grade prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.

The primary objective of this Phase IIa pilot study is to evaluate the safety of performing prostate embolization with doxorubicin eluting-beads according to different loading doses. Four dose levels will be tested: doxorubicin-free beads to test the effect of embolization alone, 2.5 mg of doxorubicin (1/20 of the dose administered for liver cancers), 5 mg and 10 mg of doxorubicin.

The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the tolerance (functionnal questionaries at D0, D14 M1 and M3; collection of complications at D1, D5, D14, M1, M3; MRI at D14), evaluate the systemic diffusion of doxorubicin (doxorubinemia at D1), evaluate an early anti-tumor effect of the treatment (via a prostate-specific antigen test at D14 M1, M3 and magnetic resonance imaging at D14), describe the distribution of beads observed on the surgical specimen and evaluate the dose effect at 1 month and 3 months after surgery (via a prostate-specific antigen test at D14, M1, M3 and magnetic resonance imaging at D14).

Our hypothesis is that the doxorubicin eluting-beads currently used in hepato-oncology might be applicable to high-grade prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.

The primary objective of this Phase IIa pilot study is to evaluate the safety of performing prostate embolization with doxorubicin eluting-beads according to different loading doses. Four dose levels will be tested: doxorubicin-free beads to test the effect of embolization alone, 2.5 mg of doxorubicin (1/20 of the dose administered for liver cancers), 5 mg and 10 mg of doxorubicin.

The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the tolerance (functionnal questionaries at D0, D14 M1 and M3; collection of complications at D1, D5, D14, M1, M3; MRI at D14), evaluate the systemic diffusion of doxorubicin (doxorubinemia at D1), evaluate an early anti-tumor effect of the treatment (via a prostate-specific antigen test at D14 M1, M3 and magnetic resonance imaging at D14), describe the distribution of beads observed on the surgical specimen and evaluate the dose effect at 1 month and 3 months after surgery (via a prostate-specific antigen test at D14, M1, M3 and magnetic resonance imaging at D14).
