A Clinical Study to Evaluate B4T2-001 CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first in human (FIH), open-label, dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of B4T2-001 Autologous CAR T cells in subjects with advanced solid tumors including but not limited to advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, advanced pancreatic cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancers (CRC) and metastatic breast cancer that tests positive for BT-001 target antigen according to Immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: B4T2-001 Autologous CAR T cells
Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Safety and tolerability of B4T2-001 CAR T cells, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of B4T2-001 CAR T cells, The MTD will be determined based on the occurrence of the Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) according to the accelerated titration design and 3+3 dose escalation design. RP2D will be defined based on MTD, safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy data., 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under Curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under Curve (AUC) with immunoanalytical method, Blood sampling for PK will be performed at planned time points till the end of the study|Pharmacokinetics (PK): maximum concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK): maximum concentration (Cmax) with immunoanalytical method, Blood sampling for PK will be performed at planned time points till the end of the study|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time to Cmax (Tmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time to Cmax (Tmax) with immunoanalytical method, Blood sampling for PK will be performed at planned time points till the end of the study|Overall response rate (ORR) after administration, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment via B4T2-001 CAR T cell infusion, and the objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 only, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|Duration of Response (DOR) after administration, DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (PR or better) to the first documented disease progression evidence (according to RECIST 1.1) of the responders (who achieve PR or better response), Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS) after administration, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the B4T2-001 to the first documented disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|Overall Survival (OS) after administration, OS is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of B4T2-001 CAR T to death of the subject, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion
Blood cytokine levels include interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and INF-γ with ELISA or equivalent method, Concentration and kinetics of multiple blood cytokines including (IL-6), IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and INF-γ using ELISA or equivalent before and after CAR T infusion and will be evaluated according to actual blood sampling time points, Blood sampling for cytokine measurement will be performed at planned time points till 90 days after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|H score (0-300), Explore and evaluate histology before and after CAR T infusion for expression of BT-001 antigen on the tumor by IHC with histologist scoring system to evaluate the score intensity.

H score (0-300) will be calculated, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|Overall IHC Score (0-4), Explore and evaluate histology before and after CAR T infusion for expression of BT-001 antigen on the tumor by IHC with histologist scoring system to evaluate the score intensity.

Overall IHC Score (0-4) will be calculated, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion|The percentage of positive stained tumor., Explore and evaluate histology before and after CAR T infusion for expression of BT-001 antigen on the tumor, Minimum 2 years after B4T2-001 CAR T infusion
This is an open-label dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of B4T2-001 Autologous CAR T cells in subjects with BT-001 expressing advanced solid tumors. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will receive B4T2-001 CAR T infusion after lymphodepletion. The lymphodepleting chemotherapy is administered on days -5, -4, and -3 before CAR T infusion using cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 once daily and fludarabine 30mg/m2 once daily for 3 consecutive days. Doses may be adjusted for renal and/or hepatic insufficiency, or other comorbidities. The study is designed to include the following sequential steps: patient screening, pre-treatment, treatment and follow up for up to 2 years.
