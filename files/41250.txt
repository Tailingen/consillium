Feasibility and Safety of Hybrid Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery for Colon Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radical colectomy with hybrid transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (hvNOTES). This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in 55 eligible subjects with resectable colon cancer. After informed consent, patients will be sent to have hvNOTES radical colectomy by surgeons with good experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Patients' demographic, operative detail and postoperative outcomes including conversion to open surgery, operating time, blood loss, pain score, resumption of gastrointestinal function, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, sexual function, quality of recovery, recurrence rate, recurrence patterns, relapse-free survival, and overall survival will be recorded prospectively. The results of the patients will be assessed to validate safety, functional outcomes or oncologic outcomes of hvNOTES colectomy.
Colon Cancer|Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery
PROCEDURE: hvNOTES radical colectomy
Postoperative complications, The primary end point is major complication during surgery or within 90 days after surgery. A major intraoperative and postoperative complication is defined as a surgical or medical complication with a CTCAE grade of III or higher. The most severe complication in a patient was considered for the classification of the primary end point., up to 90 days after surgery
Conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery, One of the secondary outcome measures is the rate of conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery as an indicator of surgical technical difficulty. Conversion is defined as the use of a laparoscopic port for the anastomosis, or a laparotomy wound for any part of the mesocolon dissection or the anastomosis., during the surgery|Concentration of c-reactive protein (CRP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) values on postoperative day 1and 3., 1 and 3 postoperative days|Concentration of procalcitonine (PCT), Procalcitonine (PCT) values on postoperative day 1and 3., 1 and 3 postoperative days|Complete pathological assessment of CME specimens, Complete mesocolic excision (CME) is defined as complete resection of the mesocolon with its anatomical envelope. Rate of complete and near-CME achieved with hvNOTES, based on standard pathologic assessment of CME specimens., up to 1 week after surgery|Postoperative pain assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS), Pain score assessments: The investigator's staff will provide a rating scale to the patients to self-rate and record their pain at baseline (prior to surgery), at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours following the procedure end time (or discharge if earlier) postoperatively using the numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 is for no pain and 10 is for the worst pain imaginable., up to 1 week after surgery|Amount of narcotic pain medication administered, The amount of narcotic pain medication administered through postoperative day 7 (or discharge if earlier) will be recorded (total dose of morphine equivalent during hospitalization and average dose per day)., up to 1 week after surgery|Time to first flatus after surgery, Time to first flatus is defined as days from a colectomy procedure to first occurrence of flatus during subject's postoperative recovery., up to 1 week after surgery|Number of harvested lymph nodes, Number of harvested Lymph nodes according to the pathological report., up to 1 week after surgery|R0 resection, Rate of resection without any affected margins during the surgical procedure according to the pathological report., up to 1 week after surgery|Length of hospital stay, Days in the hospital after surgery., up to 4 weeks after surgery|Sexual function assessment, Patient self-reported sexual functions as assessed by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The FSFI is a 19-item questionnaire to rate sexual function between 2.0 and 36.0, where 2.0 is low sexual function and 36.0 is high sexual function., baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery|Quality of recovery: Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40), Patient's quality of recovery is assessed by using the Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40, score range: 40-200). Higher values represent better outcomes. The validate questionnaire measure quality of recovery by evaluating patients' comfort, emotions, physical independence, and support using the same scale., 14 days after surgery|Satisfaction with surgical scars: Validated questionnaire Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ), Validated questionnaire Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ, score range: 28-102) will be administered to assess the patient's perception of scarring. Lower values represent better outcomes. The PSAQ consists of 5 subscales: Appearance, symptoms, consciousness, satisfaction with appearance, and satisfaction with symptoms., 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery|Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Score 3 months and 1 year after the procedure. This scale has functional, global health, and symptoms subscales/items all scored from 0 to 100. Higher scores on these subscales indicate high level of functioning, high quality of life, and high level of symptomatology, respectively., baseline, 3 and 12 months after surgery|Postoperative recurrence patterns, The recurrence patterns are determined according to the primary recurrence site diagnosed radiologically (CT, US, MRI, or PET-CT), or with histologic proof (ascitic cytology, colonoscopic biopsy, or surgery)., 2 years after surgery|Relapse-free survival, Relapse-free survival is defined as the time from random assignment until disease relapse or death from any cause., 2 years after surgery|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as time from surgery to death., 2 years after surgery
