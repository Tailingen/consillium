Organ Preservation Strategy of Total Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Low Rectal Carcinoma
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an organ-sparing strategy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery （TEM） or endoscopic local resection for early low rectal cancer（cT 1-3N0M0）.Besides, the clinical complete response rate and near-clinical complete response rate, organ preservation rate, local recurrence rate, distant metastasis rate and quality of life （QoL） will also be assessed.
Rectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Total Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
Organ preservation rate at 3 years, Patients with a good pathological response（ypT 0-1 without neural vascular invasion）after neoadjuvant treatment followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery（TEM）or endoscopic local resection will be offered an organ preservation strategy, 3 years
Clinical complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, Define as complete withdrawal of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and no distant metastasis in imaging examination, and no tumor residue in imaging examination and endoscopic biopsy, 18 weeks|3-year local recurrence rate, Occurrence of local recurrence in patients with an organ preservation strategy, 3 years|3-year distant metastases rate, Occurrence of distant metastases in patients with an organ preservation strategy, 3 years|3-year Disease-free survival（DFS）rates, Disease free survival defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression of local recurrence or distance metastasis or death due to any cause, 3 years|3-year overall survival（OS） rates, OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause, 3 years|Quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C 30, psychological status), Assess QLQ-C30 in patients with an organ preservation strategy, 20 weeks|5-year Disease-free survival（DFS）rates, Disease free survival defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression of local recurrence or distance metastasis or death due to any cause, 5 years|5-year overall survival（OS） rates, OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause, 5 years
