Protocole Advanced RadioTherapy ORL
The purpose of this study is to do health economic evaluation of tomotherapy and dynamic arctherapy (2 techniques exist: RapidArc and Vmat).

This study evaluate also local disease control after 18 months in patients with an ENT epidermoid carcinoma and treated by tomotherapy orarctherapy .

The number of patients required in this study is: 300:

* Number of patients treated with tomotherapy: 120
* Number of patients treated with dynamic arctherapy RapidArc: 120
* Number of patients treated with dynamic arctherapy Vmat: 60

This is a prospective; multicentric and non randomized study.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy
The various of cost between tomotherapy and Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy (IMRT), The purpose of this study is to realise a Health economic evaluation of the various cost between tomotherapy and Intensity Modulation Radiation Therapy (IMRT), 18 months
The economic impact of the learning curve of the tomotherapy process, the operating procedures and the activity of the centres, To estimate the economic impact of the learning curve of the tomotherapy process, the operating procedures and the activity of the centres, 18 months|To determine the difference of cost for the preparation phase and the irradiation phase of the radiotherapy procedure, One of the secondary objectives for the economic evaluation is to individualize the difference of cost for the preparation phase and the irradiation phase of the radiotherapy procedure, 18 months|The salivary toxicity, The salivary function will be assessed at baeline; 6; 12 and 18 months post treatment.

This evaluation will be done with differents scale (RTOG, EVA); and with salivary scan., at 6; 12 and 18 months post treatment|To determine the rate of disease local control, Assement of disease by clinical exam and/or imaging., Baseline, Month 6; Month 18
