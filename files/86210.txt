A Study of MORAb-202 Versus Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy in Female Participants With Platinum-resistant High-grade Serous (HGS) Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) and compare it to Investigator's choice (IC) chemotherapy in female participants with platinum-resistant HGS ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
