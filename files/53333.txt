Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy With Gemcitabine for Resectable Pancreatic Carcinoma
This phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine (400mg/m2, weekly) for resectable pancreatic cancer.
Resectable Pancreatic Carcinoma
RADIATION: chemoradiotherapy with Gemcitabine|RADIATION: Radiation: chemoradiotherapy with Gemcitabine
Complete resection rate, To evaluate the impact of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine by analyzing complete resection rate (R0)., Within the first 30 days after surgery
Clinical outcomes, To investigate the association between radiologic, histopathologic response, complete resection rate of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine and clinical outcomes, such overall survival and disease-free survival., Up to 3years from a initial follow-up|The association between biomolecular markers and clinical outcomes, To investigate the association between biomolecular markers and clinical outcomes (including tumor response and complete resection rate, etc.), Up to 3years until study closed|The feasibility and compliance, To evaluate the feasibility and compliance (acute and late toxicity, esp. gastrointestinal tract toxicity) of preoperative chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine for resectable pancreatic cancer., Up to 1 year
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the complete (R0) resection rate for patients with and resectable pancreatic cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and curative surgery. An experimental arm that result a complete resection rate of at least 90% would merit further study. With 90% power to reject that null hypothesis that the true complete resection rate is â‰¤75% with a type I error level of 5%, evaluable 53 patients are required. Considering the 20% unevaluable patients due to the immediate distant metastasis after treatment7, 8, 17 and 10% follow up loss, a total of 64 eligible patients will be enrolled.
