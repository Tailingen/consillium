An Open Label Phase I Dose Escalation Study of E7080 Administered to Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the related effects of E7080 administered to patients with solid tumors that are resistant to approved existing anti-tumor therapies, or for which no appropriate treatment is available.
Cancer: Solid Tumors
DRUG: E7080
Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) of E7080 Repeatedly Administered Twice a Day, The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced by the first 3 patients in that cohort, or the dose at which a DLT was experienced by no more than 1 of 6 patients evaluable for toxicity., up to 4 weeks|DLT of E7080 Repeatedly Administered Twice a Day, DLTs were defined as grade 3 or more platelet count decrease, grade 4 neutropenia, any grade 3 or more nonhematologic toxicity (with exceptions of grade 4 hypertension not controlled by any antihypertensive drugs and grade greater than or equal to 3 vomiting and diarrhea not controlled by antiemetic or antidiarrheal drugs), and failure to administer more than 75% of the planned doses of E7080 during the same cycle due to toxicity., up to 4 weeks
To Elucidate the Pharmacokinetic Profile of E7080, Every 3 weeks|Number of Participants With Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events, Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were evaluated., Until tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal due to other reasons.|Determine the Clinical Dose for Phase II Study Based on Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile, Every 3 weeks|Evaluate the Anti-tumor Activity of E7080, Every 3 weeks|To Make Exploratory Analyses of Pharmacodynamic Markers, Every 3 weeks
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the related effects of E7080 administered to patients with solid tumors that are resistant to approved existing anti-tumor therapies, or for which no appropriate treatment is available.
