Phase II Open Label Trial to Determine Safety & Efficacy of Tisagenlecleucel in Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients
The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL) including Burkitt Lymphoma and Burkitt Leukemia.

For pediatric patients who have r/r B-NHL including Burkitt Lymphoma and Burkitt Leukemia, survival rates are dismal, only \~20-50% subjects are alive at 2 years with overall response rate (ORR) of 20-30% after conventional salvage chemotherapy.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Local Investigator, The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects with a best overall disease response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), where the best overall disease response is defined as the best disease response recorded from tisagenlecleucel infusion until progressive disease or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first., 6 months post-tisagenlecleucel infusion
Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) as determined by local investigator assessments to the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer., Post-infusion Day 28, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Event Free Survival (EFS), Event free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the earliest date of death from any cause, disease progression as determined by local investigator assessments, or starting new anticancer therapy for underlying cancer, excluding hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)., Post-infusion Day 28, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS) is defined as the time from the date of first documented disease response (CR or PR) as determined by local investigator assessments to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Post-infusion Day 28, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of first documented disease progression as determined by local investigator assessments or death due to any cause.

Progression is defined using the International non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Response Criteria. For a PET-based response, progressive disease is defined as a 4 or 5 on the 5 point scale with increased uptake compared to the nadir or new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma. For a CT/MRI based response progressive disease is defined as a 25% increase in the SPD (sum of the products of two largest perpendicular diameters) of index lesions, or unequivocal progression in either non-index lesions or the spleen. Any new disease attributable to lymphoma would also constitute progressive disease., Post-infusion Day 28, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of death due to any cause., Post-infusion Day 28, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Cellular Kinetics Parameter: Cmax, The maximum (peak) transgene level (copies/μg) observed in peripheral blood or other body fluid after single dose administration as measured by qPCR.

Pharmacokinetics of tisagenlecleucel were based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene levels in peripheral blood as detected by qPCR, unless otherwise noted., Post-infusion day 4, day 7, day 11, day 14, day 21, day 28, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12, month 18, month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Cellular Kinetics Parameter: AUC0-28d, Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUCs) from the time course of transgene levels in peripheral blood following tisagenlecleucel infusion (days\*copies/μg), from day of infusion to day 28.

Pharmacokinetics of tisagenlecleucel were based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene levels in peripheral blood as detected by qPCR, unless otherwise noted., Post-infusion day 4, day 7, day 11, day 14, day 21, day 28, month 3, month 6, month 9, month 12, month 18, month 24, and then annually until Month 48|Levels of Pre-existing and Treatment Induced Humoral Immunogenicity and Cellular Immunogenicity Against Tisagenlecleucel Cellular Kinetics, Safety and Efficacy, The humoral immunogenicity assay measures the antibody titers specific to tisagenlecleucel prior to and following infusion by flow cytometry. A subject was only defined as positive for tisagenlecleucel treatment-induced or -boosted anti-mCAR19 antibodies when the anti-mCAR19 antibody median fluorescence intensity at any time post-infusion was at least 2.28-fold higher (for samples analyzed on or prior to 05-May-2021) or 2.38-fold higher (for samples analyzed on or after 06-May-2021) than pre-infusion levels for participants whose baseline status was positive (boosted) or if the baseline status was negative but any post-baseline interpretation was positive (induced)., Until disease progression or through study completion, up to 4 years|Percentage of Participants Who Proceeded to Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) After Tisagenlecleucel Infusion, These participants proceeded to transplant any time post-tisagenlecleucel therapy until end of study (EOS)., Through study completion, up to 4 years|Maximum Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Retrospective assessment of potential cytokine release syndrome (CRS) predictive models considering also data from other CTL019 trials. The Positive Predictive Value (PVV) is the percentage of participants who actually had severe CRS out of all the cases where the prediction model predicts that severe CRS will occur. The maximum PPV is the highest value attained across all potential CRS predictive models., Through study completion, up to 4 years
This study was part of an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). The single-arm study design included r/r B-cell NHL including Burkitt Lymphoma and Burkitt Leukemia subject population with poor prognosis, lack of approved effective therapies in this setting. Subject population included aggressive subtypes of B-cell NHL including Burkitt Lymphoma and Burkitt Leukemia who were allowed to receive "bridging therapy" of investigator's choice. After assessment of eligibility, subjects qualifying for the study were enrolled and were allowed to start lymphodepleting chemotherapy as recommended in protocol after which a single dose of tisagenlecleucel product was infused. The efficacy of tisagenlecleucel was evaluated through the primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR) which included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as determined by local assessment. Safety assessments were conducted until study completion.
