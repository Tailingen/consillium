Effect of Acetaminophen Preemptive Analgesia on Postoperative Cognitive Function
Patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery are prone to delayed recovery and postoperative cognitive dysfunction due to greater trauma and longer operation time. Pre-analgesia can reverse the effects of nociceptive stimulation on recovery from general anesthesia and postoperative cognitive function. Intravenous injection of non-steroidal drugs can effectively reduce postoperative pain and the use of opioids. Therefore, This study selected acetaminophen mannitol injection for preemptive analgesia to observe the effects on anesthesia recovery time and postoperative cognitive function of patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery, providing new ideas for reducing cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery
Cognitive Function
DRUG: acetaminophen mannitol|DRUG: Normal saline
Postoperative delirium, The confusion assessment method (CAM) was used to assess postoperative cognitive dysfunction, 1/3/7 days after the surgery
Recovery time, The postoperative recovery time was recorded, immediately after the surgery
Neurotransmitters in the blood, Neurotransmitters include epinephrine, norepinephrine, and so on, 1/3/7 days after the surgery
By administering acetaminophen to patients with gastrointestinal tumors before surgery, recording the time to recovery from anesthesia, and assessing cognitive function status by CAM on the first, third, and seventh day after surgery
