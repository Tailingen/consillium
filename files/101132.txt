Feasibility of Expressive Writing for Body Image Distress and Anxiety Among Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors
Each year, about 89,500 adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 15-39 years old) are diagnosed with cancer and up to 60% experience body image (BI) distress. BI is largely developed in adolescence and young adulthood and has implications for self-identity and quality of life. Cancer itself and its associated treatments precipitate changes to appearance as well as body sensation and function, all of which can alter BI and lead to increased anxiety. An in-home BI-focused expressive writing (EW) program offers a promising outlet for addressing BI distress and anxiety in a way that eliminates constraints of clinical time and specialist availability.

There are no recommended interventions to help AYA cancer survivors cope with BI distress. To address this knowledge gap, the objective of this this pilot randomized-controlled trial is to determine the feasibility of a four-week BI-focused EW intervention to decrease BI distress and anxiety among AYA cancer survivors with the hypothesis that this intervention will reduce BI distress and anxiety.

Acceptability of Intervention, 4-item measure of perceived intervention acceptability. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale and score is reported as a calculated mean with higher scores indicating greater acceptability (no cut-off scores for interpretation are yet available). We will report descriptive statistics for this measure (mean and standard deviation) to quantitatively characterize perceive acceptability of the expressive writing intervention., 7 months|Facilitators and barriers of the intervention, Qualitative interviews will be transcribed by a professional HIPAA compliant transcription agency. The Study team will analyze interview data using inductive content analysis will read transcripts to derive codes, discuss labels to group codes into categories, and identify major themes and corresponding exemplar quotes., 7 Months
Protocol was updated to make the previous secondary outcome measures now exploratory
