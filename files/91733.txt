AUY922 in Patient With Stage IV NSCLC
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: AUY922
Objective response rate, To define the by RECIST 1.1 of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC, Patients will be followed up for 2 years(post disease progression)
Efficacy, progression-free survival (PFS), Patients will be followed for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) which will be analyzed by using a Kaplan-Meier curve.

Patients will be followed up for PFS and OS for 2 years., Patients will be followed up for PFS and OS for 2 years.(post disease progression)|overall survival (OS), Patients will be followed for overall survival (OS), Patients will be followed up for OS for 2 years.(post disease progression)
Study Design:

This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC (n = 9 x 7)

Objectives:

Primary objective(s):

To define the objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC

Secondary objective(s):

(1) To define the disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease \>=24 weeks) of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC. (2) To determine the progression-free survival of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, KRAS, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC. (3) To determine the overall survival of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, KRAS, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC.

Exploratory Objective(s):

To study the pharmacodynamics of circulating tumor cells and plasma proteins.

Planned number of subjects: A total of 63 patients for the first stage of this study in 1 - 3 centers in Taiwan.

Patient population:

1. Stage IV (by AJCC 7th edition) NSCLC.
2. EGFR T790M mutation; EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon mutation; HER2 mutation; BRAF mutation; ALK translocation; ROS1 translocation; or RET translocation in tumor samples.
3. One line of prior systemic therapy.
