The Effect of Perioperative Lidocaine Infusion on Neutrophil Extracellular Trapping
To investigate the effect of perioperative lidocaine infusion on the neutrophil extracellular trapping after minimally invasive surgery for stomach cancer
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Lidocaine|DRUG: normal saline
serum concentration of NET(neutrophil extracellular trapping)-related biomarker, NET-related biomarker (citrullinated histone3, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase), 24 hours after surgery
quality of recovery, The quality of recovery is assessed using questionnaire. This questionnaire includes 15 items. The score range is from 0 to 150. The higher score means the better quality of recovery after surgery., 24 hours after surgery|postoperative pain, The postoperative pain is assessed using numeric rating scale (NRS; 0=no pain, 10=the maximal pain), 24 hours after surgery|survival of patients, The survival of patients is assessed using electronic medical record., 5 years
To investigate the effect of perioperative lidocaine infusion on the neutrophil extracellular trapping, especially citrullinated histone3, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase
