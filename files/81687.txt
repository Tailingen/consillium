A Study Assessing Perfusion Outcomes With PINPOINTÂ® Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging in Low Anterior Resection
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter study to determine the difference in post-operative anastomotic leak rate in low anterior resection procedures where colon and rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using PINPOINT as an adjunct to standard surgical practice compared to surgical procedures performed according to standard surgical practice alone.
Rectal Cancer|Rectosigmoid Cancer
DEVICE: PINPOINT|DEVICE: SPY Elite
Anastomotic Leak Rate, Anastomotic leak rate in low anterior resection procedures where colon and rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using PINPOINT Endoscopic Fluorescence imaging or SPY Elite imaging as an adjunct to standard surgical practice compared to surgical procedures performed according to standard surgical practice alone., Day 0 to Week 8 (+/- 2 weeks)
Rate of SPY Visualization and Tissue Perfusion, The ability of PINPOINT or SPY Elite to provide sufficient visualization for assessment of blood flow and related tissue perfusion during the procedure, Day 0 (Day of Surgery)|Incidence of Post-Operative Abscess Requiring Surgical Management, Rate of postoperative abscess requiring surgical management., Day 0 to Week 8 (+/- 2 weeks)
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter study to determine the difference in post-operative anastomotic leak rate in low anterior resection procedures where colon and rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using PINPOINT as an adjunct to standard surgical practice compared to surgical procedures performed according to standard surgical practice alone.
