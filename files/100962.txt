Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib (MK-7339) in Participants With Previously Treated, Homologous Recombination Repair Mutation (HRRm) or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Positive Advanced Cancer (MK-7339-002 / LYNK-002)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of olaparib (MK-7339) monotherapy in participants with multiple types of advanced cancer (unresectable and/or metastatic) that: 1) have progressed or been intolerant to standard of care therapy; and 2) are positive for homologous recombination repair mutation (HRRm) or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD).
Advanced Solid Neoplasms
DRUG: Olaparib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response (\[CR\]; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (\[PR\]: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ (modified RECIST 1.1). For participants with prostate cancer, ORR will be based on Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to 53 months
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR will be assessed by BICR according to either modified RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 for participants with prostate cancer., Up to 53 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 53 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to either: 1) the first documented disease progression as assessed either by BICR according to modified RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 for participants with prostate cancer; or 2) death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 53 months|Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants experiencing an AE will be assessed., Up to 53 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment due to an Adverse Event (AE), The number of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE will be assessed., Up to 52 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants with HRRm or HRD Positive Cancer, For participants with homologous recombination repair mutation (HRRm) or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive cancer, the ORR will be assessed. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response (\[CR\]; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (\[PR\]: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ (modified RECIST 1.1). For participants with prostate cancer, ORR will be based on Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to 53 months|Time to Earliest Progression by Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125), For participants with BRCA1/2 non-mutated ovarian cancer only, the time to earliest progression by CA-125 will be assessed. Progression by CA-125 is defined as an increase in CA-125 level ≥2x upper limit normal (ULN) on 2 occasions, 1 week apart. For participants with elevated CA-125 (≥ULN) at baseline, progression by CA-125 is defined as an increase in CA-125 level ≥2x the nadir value on 2 occasions, 1 week apart., Up to 53 months|Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate in Participants with Prostate Cancer, For participants with prostate cancer, the PSA response rate will be presented. PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population with PSA reduction of ≥50% from baseline measured twice at least 3 weeks apart., Up to 53 months|Progression-Free Survival After Next-Line Treatment in Participants with sBRCAm Breast Cancer, For participants with somatic BRCA mutated (sBRCAm) breast cancer, the PFS after next-line treatment will be presented. PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to either: 1) the first documented disease progression on the next-line of treatment, as assessed by BICR according to modified RECIST 1.1; or 2) death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 53 months
