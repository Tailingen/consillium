This is a multi-center prospective, observational real-world study, targeting patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide single drug or lenalidomide combined with rituximab (with or without other drugs) in the real-world setting.

This study will mainly focus on the following three cohorts:

Cohort 1: patients diagnosed with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; Cohort 2: patients diagnosed with CD20-positive follicle lymphoma; Cohort 3: patients on maintenance treatment who have achieved complete remission or partial remission after induction therapy.
