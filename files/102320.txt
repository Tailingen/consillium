Vaccine Therapy With or Without Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells combined with melanoma antigens may make the body build an immune response to tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for stage III or stage IV melanoma.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be surgically removed.
Melanoma (Skin)
BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: dendritic cell-gp100-MART-1 antigen vaccine
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the safety, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of autologous dendritic cells transduced with adenoviruses encoding the MART-1 and gp100 melanoma antigens with or without interleukin-2 in patients with stage III or IV melanoma. II. Evaluate the cellular response and efficacy of these regimens in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are sequentially assigned to one of three dose levels. Patients receive modified autologous dendritic cells subcutaneously on day 1 with or without interleukin-2 IV on days 4-19. Treatment continues every 21 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of modified dendritic cells with or without interleukin-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each regimen is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
