Prospective Trial of Induction Immunotherapy in Locally Advanced or Oligometastatic NSCLC Without a Primary Curative Option
In a certified lung- cancer center, patients with NSCLC and a potentially curative stage (including patients with oligometastatic disease) are prospectively enrolled if curative treatment (either definitive radio-chemotherapy or resection) cannot be performed due to large tumor size or for functional reasons. For these patients, the multidisciplinary tumor board (MDB) recommends immuno-(chemo)therapy and re-evaluation. Response is assessed radiologically including PET-CT if indicated. After review of the MDB, patients receive either definitive curative treatment or palliative treatment.

In a certified lung- cancer center, patients with NSCLC and a potentially curative stage (including patients with oligometastatic disease) are prospectively enrolled if curative treatment (either definitive radio-chemotherapy or resection) cannot be performed due to large tumor size or for functional reasons (e. g. too large radiation field or functionally inoperable for the required resection). For these patients, the multidisciplinary tumor board (MDB) recommends immuno-(chemo)therapy and re-evaluation. Response is assessed radiologically including PET-CT if indicated. After review of the MDB, patients receive either definitive curative treatment or palliative treatment.
