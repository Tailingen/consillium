A Multinational Study Assessing an Oral EGFR Inhibitor, DZD6008 in Patients Who Have Advanced NSCLC With EGFR Mutations (TIAN-SHAN1)
This study is designed to evaluate safety and anti-tumor activity of DZD6008 in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: DZD6008
Part A: To assess safety and tolerability, Number of participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), 21 days after the first multiple dose|Part A: To assess safety and tolerability, Number of participants with Adverse events (AEs)/Serious adverse events (SAEs), Through the study completion, an average of around 1 year|Part B: To assess anti-tumor activity, Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Through the study completion, an average of around 1 year

The study includes two parts: Part A (dose escalation) and Part B(dose expansion). In Part A, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations (Exon19del and/or L858R) following at least 1 prior EGFR TKI regimen will be enrolled. In Part B, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations following at least 1 prior EGFR TKI treatment and harboring C797X mutation will be enrolled.
