Phase I Study of HSK46575 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK（pharmacokinetics） and PD（pharmacodynamics） of HSK46575 when given orally in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
m CRPC
DRUG: HSK46575
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Highest dose level at which under 33% of patients in a cohort experience DLT（dose limiting toxicity）, Within first 28 days of treatment
The study will contain two phases: Phase Ia is dose escalation phase and Phase Ib is dose expansion phase.

Phase Ia will contain two part: Dose Escalation Part and Extension Part. Dose Escalation Part based on the "3+3" design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements. Patient cohorts at selected doses may be extended to further investigate the tolerability, PK and PD of HSK46575. The number of patients to be enrolled will be up to 10 subjects in each Extension Part cohort. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in Phase Ia.

Phase Ib no less than 60 subjects will be enrolled in each expansion cohort.
