Phase 2 Study of Dacomitinib in NSCLC
This is a multi-national, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 clinical study of the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment with dacomitinib, with or without dose titration, in subjects with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IIIC/IV or recurrent EGFR-mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

National Cancer Centre Singapore is the lead sponsor acting in a coordinating capacity and the rest of the participating sites are sponsors of their own individual sites.
