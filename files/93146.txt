CAPRI 2 GOIM Study: Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of a Bio-marker Driven Cetuximab-based Treatment Regimen
This clinical program aims to evaluate the activity and efficacy of cetuximab continuation of treatment for three lines of therapy with rotation of chemotherapy (FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, irinotecan) in mCRC patients, whose tumors remain RAS/BRAF WT. The study will also evaluate the activity and efficacy of cetuximab re-introduction in combination with irinotecan as third line therapy in the concept of re-challenge for those patients that will be treated in second line with chemotherapy plus anti-angiogenic drugs (FOLFOX plus bevacizumab), having a RAS or BRAF mutant disease at the time of progression after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab first line treatment. A novel characteristic of this program is that the therapeutic algorithm will be defined at each treatment decision (first line, second line and third line) in a prospective fashion in each patient by liquid biopsy assessment of RAS/BRAF status.
Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|DRUG: Irinotecan
RR, Response rate (RR) for each line of treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in patients with RAS/BRAF wild type (WT) mCRCregimen over 3 treatment lines in patients with RAS/BRAF wild type (WT) mCRC at start of first line therapy, up to 59 months
PFS, Progression free survival (PFS) for each line, from 8 weeks to 59 months (from the start of therapy until the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause)|OS, Overall Survival, up to 59 months|AE, Safety: Adverse events graded according NCI CTCAE v 5.0, from screening up to 59 months|EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire EORTC QLQ C30, The EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of multi-item scales and single items, At screening, for each line of therapy at Week 4, at Week 25 of treatment start and at progression|DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX (DLQI), The DLQI consists of 10 questions concerning patients' perception of the impact of skin diseases on different aspects of their health-related quality of life over the last week., at screening, for each line of therapy at Week 4, at Week 25 of treatment start and at progression
Explorative objective: RR for each line of therapy, the response rates for each line of therapy of RAS/BRAF WT mCRC patients who will be treated in a continuum of care strategy with cetuximab across all three therapy lines, from screening up to 23 months|Exploratory objective: cumulative PFS, the cumulative progression free survivals of RAS/BRAF WT mCRC patients who will be treated in a continuum of care strategy with cetuximab across all three therapy lines, from screening up to 23 months|Explorative objective: overall survival, overall survival of RAS/BRAF WT mCRC patients who will be treated in a continuum of care strategy with cetuximab across all three therapy lines, from screening up to 23 months|Translational analyses using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, Molecular profiles of tumor tissue and liquid biopsy samples (somatic mutations identified in tumor tissue by next generation sequencing) and surrogate markers of treatment activity (changes in molecular profile of liquid biopsies). Translational analyses of tumor biomarkers will be performed

These include mutation in RAS, BRAF, PI3KCA; amplification of HER2, MET and loss of PTEN expression, all of which are implicated in resistance to anti-EGFR treatment.

Moreover, 324 genes NGS panels will provide information regarding potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers of colorectal cancer disease.

Fecal samples will be used for gut microbioma analysis, to understand how the composition of gut microbiome could influence treatment outcome and tolerability., At day 1 of each line of therapy
Based on dynamic and longitudinal liquid biopsy assessment of RAS/BRAF status, that will be prospectively performed before each line of treatment, mCRC patients will be treated with cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy throughout three lines of therapy, as follows: FOLFIRI plus cetuximab (first line); FOLFOX plus cetuximab (second line); irinotecan plus cetuximab (third line) in case of RAS/BRAF WT at each time point of progression. If at progression after the first line, the liquid biopsy assessment indicates RAS and or BRAF mutant status, patients will be treated with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab as the second line of therapy. If at progression after the second line, the liquid biopsy assessment indicates RAS and or BRAF mutant status, patients will be treated with regorafenib or trifluridine-tipiracil (investigator's choice), as third line of therapy. Each treatment will be administered using standard doses and schedules until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.

This study will also evaluate the activity and efficacy of cetuximab re-introduction in combination with irinotecan as third line therapy in the concept of re-challenge for those patients that will be treated in second line with FOLFOX plus bevacizumab, having a RAS or BRAF mutant disease at the time of progression after FOLFIRI plus cetuximab first line treatment. A novel characteristic of this program is that the therapeutic algorithm will be defined at each treatment decision (first line, second line and third line) in a prospective fashion in each patient by liquid biopsy assessment of RAS/BRAF status
