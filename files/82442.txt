Nano Drug Interventional Therapy Using Digital Subtraction Angiography（DSA） for Liver Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nano drug（Gemzar® mix with Compound Glycyrrhizin Injection） interventional therapy using digital subtraction angiography（DSA） for liver cancer.
Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: interventional therapy
Number of participants with Adverse events, 1 year
Percentage of lesions that show no sign of recurrence 12 months after interventional therapy, 1 year|Progress free disease (PFS), 1 year|Overall survival (OS), 1 year
By enrolling patients with liver cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of nano drug interventional therapy using digital subtraction angiography（DSA）for liver cancer.

The nano drug is made by mixing Gemzar® with Compound Glycyrrhizin Injection. The nano drug's size is detected by laser diffraction particle size analyzer.
