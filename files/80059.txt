A Long Term Safety Study of Degarelix in Patients With Prostate Cancer
Patients that completed any of the trials; CS27 (NCT00738673), CS28 (NCT00831233), CS30 (NCT00833248) or CS31 (NCT00884273) will be given the opportunity to receive monthly doses of degarelix until the drug is launched in their country. Safety parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine samples and general health state will be studied. Note: patients completing the CS27 trial did not participate in the CS34 trial.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Degarelix
Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Safety Laboratory Variables, The figures present the number of participants who had markedly abnormal levels of safety laboratory variables. Only the laboratory variables that had at least one percentage of participants in either group with abnormal value are presented, more variables were included in the study., Up to 22.5 months|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Vital Signs and Body Weight, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight. The table presents the number of participants with normal baseline and at least one post-baseline markedly abnormal value., Up to 22.5 months
Serum Levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)Over Time, PSA levels were measured over time. The table below shows median levels at baseline (n=77 participants), 24 weeks (n=56), 36 weeks (n=58), 48 weeks (n=48), 72 weeks (n=9), from baseline to 72 weeks|Serum Levels of Testosterone Over Time, Testosterone levels were measured over time. The table below shows median levels at baseline (n=77 participants), 24 weeks (n=68), 36 weeks (n=59), 48 weeks (n=54), 72 weeks (n=9), from baseline to week 72
