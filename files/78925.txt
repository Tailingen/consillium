Phase I/II Safety Study of IPI-504 in Relapsed/Refractory Stage IIIb, or Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of IPI-504 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will examine how IPI-504 is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated by the body. The study will also evaluate the anti-tumor activity of IPI-504.

DRUG: IPI-504
Determine potential anti-tumor activity of IPI-504 in molecularly defined sub-groups of patients by RECIST criteria, Every 6 weeks
IPI-504 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an emerging and recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a central role in maintaining the proper folding, function and viability of various "client proteins". Many of the client proteins stabilized by Hsp90 are oncoproteins and cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival. This clinical trial will study the effects of IPI-504 in a molecularly defined sub-group of patients who carry client proteins found in non-small cell lung cancer.
