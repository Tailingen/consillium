Gemcitabine in Ovarian Cancer
The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer receiving combination of Gemcitabine at a dose 1250 mg/m2 (Day 1 and 8) with Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (Day 1) as first-line treatment
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin
Best Overall Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., every other 21 day cycle (6-8 cycles), every 3 months during long-term follow-up
Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., every other 21 day cycle (6-8 cycles) and every 3 months during long-term follow-up|Time to Progressive Disease, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., every other 21 day cycle (6-8 cycles) and every 3 months during long-term follow-up|Time to Treatment Failure, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first observation of disease progression, death as a result of any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. Time to treatment failure was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who did not discontinue early, who were still alive, and who have not progressed., every other 21 day cycle (6-8 cycles) and every 3 months during long-term follow-up|Number of Patients With Maximum Common Toxicity Criteria - National Cancer Institute (CTC-NCI): Possibly Related to Study Drug by Grade, Grades range from 0 (no toxicity) to 4 (life-threatening or disabling)., every 21 day cycle (6-8 cycles) and every 3 months during long-term follow-up
