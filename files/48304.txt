HCW9218 in Select Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single center, Phase I dose finding study of HCW9218 for the treatment of advanced/metastatic solid tumor cancer (except pancreatic and primary brain cancers). HCW9218 is a novel bi-functional fusion protein complex administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection. It is comprised of a soluble fusion of two human TGFβRII domains, human tissue factor, and human IL-15, and a second soluble fusion of two human TGFβRII domains and a sushi domain of human IL-15Rα. HCW9218 activates IL-15R signaling on effector immune cells and the dimeric TGFβRII functions as a "trap" for all three human TGF-β isoforms.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HCW9218
The primary objective of the dose finding component is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HCW9218, Given that little to no toxicity is expected, the MTD will be determined using an adaptation of the continual reassessment method (CRM) (O'Quigley, 1996) starting with 1 patient cohorts., through study completion, an average of 12 months
Estimate response rate (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Response rate will be estimated by a simple proportion with 95% confidence limits if sufficient numbers exist, 3 months after 1st dose|Estimate response rate (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Response rate will be estimated by a simple proportion with 95% confidence limits if sufficient numbers exist, 6 months after 1st dose|Estimate response rate (complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Response rate will be estimated by a simple proportion with 95% confidence limits if sufficient numbers exist, 12 months after 1st dose|Estimate progression of overall survival (OS), Estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, 6 months after 1st dose|Estimate progression free survival (PFS), Estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, 6 months after 1st dose|Estimate progression free survival (PFS), Estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, 1 year after 1st dose|Estimate progression of overall survival (OS), Estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, 1 year after 1st dose
