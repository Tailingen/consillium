Tumor Microenvironment in Gastric Cancer Patients Treated With Combined Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy
The goal of this study is to analyze the tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer patients treated with combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Provide profiles of TME between pre-treatment and post-treatment to gain insights into the mechanisms of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer
* Investigate the crucial factors affecting treatment efficacy by comparing gastric cancer patients with varying treatment responses
