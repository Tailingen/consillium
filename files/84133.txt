Immuno-PRISM (PRecision Intervention Smoldering Myeloma)
The purpose of this study is to test the anti-cancer activity of Teclistamab and to compare it with Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone combination in people with high risk smoldering multiple myeloma.

People with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) usually do not have symptoms but are at risk for progressing to active multiple myeloma (MM). Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which are an important part of the immune system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment but there are currently no approved therapies for smoldering multiple myeloma.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Teclistamab
* Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)
* Dexamethasone (also called Decadron)

Complete Response Rate (CRR), The complete response rate (CRR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response criteria. CR defined as requires all of the following:

* Disappearance of the original monoclonal protein from the blood and urine on at least two determinations for a minimum of six weeks by immunofixation studies.
* \<5% plasma cells in the bone marrow on at least two determinations for a minimum of six weeks.
* No increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).
* Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas for at least six weeks., Cycle 2 Day 1 through end of follow up (each cycle is 28 days).
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity, The MRD is expressed as a frequency that quantifies the level of residual disease based on the number of remaining copies of the initially dominant sequence(s) relative to the total number of nucleated cells in the sample., Baseline, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 13 Day 1, end of treatment, 1, 2, & 3 year after end of treatment (each cycle is 28 day).|Progression-free survival (PFS) until progression to myeloma, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response criteria: Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Every 6 months, up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.|Progression-free survival (PFS-2) post initiation of overt myeloma therapy, Progression-free survivial-2 is defined as time from randomization to disease progression (PD) while receiving overt myeloma therapy, or death from any cause., Every 6 months, up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.|Time to progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time of randomization until progression. Participants who have died without evidence of progression are censored in the TTP analysis at the time of death and participants who are alive without progression are censored at the last disease assessment., Cycle 2 Day1 through end of follow up, an average of 5 years (each cycle is 28 days).|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of overall response is measured as the time from initiation of first response to first documentation of disease progression or death whichever occurs first. Participants who have not progressed or died are censored at the date last known progression-free., Cycle 2 Day1 through end of follow up, an average of 5 years (each cycle is 28 days).|Pharmacodynamic biomarkers of antimyeloma and immune activity of Teclistamab, Serum from venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of teclistamab (Arm A - Teclistamab only) and the generation of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) where applicable to teclistamab per the Study Schedule., Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 9, 11, 15; Cycle 2 Day 1; Cycle 3 & 5 Days 1, 4, 8, and 15; Cycle 12 Day 1; End of treatment; and 8 week after last dose of Teclistamab (each cycle is 28 day).|Pharmacokinetics of teclistamab in SMM, Serum from venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of teclistamab (Arm A - Teclistamab only) and the generation of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) where applicable to teclistamab per the Study Schedule., Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 9, 11, 15; Cycle 2 Day 1; Cycle 3 & 5 Days 1, 4, 8, and 15; Cycle 12 Day 1; End of treatment; and 8 week after last dose of Teclistamab (each cycle is 28 day).|Immunogenicity of Teclistamab in SMM, Serum from venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of teclistamab (Arm A - Teclistamab only) and the generation of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) where applicable to teclistamab per the Study Schedule., Cycle 1 Days 1, 15; Cycle 3 & 5 Days 1, 4, 8, and 15; and Cycle 12 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 day)|To assess ability to collect stem cells after Teclistamab, Stem cell mobilization will be performed with filgrastim alone or filgrastim with plerixafor per institutional standard. In participants that are unable to achieve adequate stem cell yield with filgrastim and plerixafor, cyclophosphamide may be used per institutional standard., After 4 cycles of treatment; at the time of best response; or at the investigator's discretion as part of standard of care practice.(each cycle is 28 days)|To assess Overall Survival (OS), OS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from study entry to death or censored at date last known alive., Every 6 months up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.|To assess incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events that are assessed by the number of patients experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 3 or higher AE of any type during the time of observation, All grade 3 or higher adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event - Version 5 (CTCAEv5) as reported on case report forms were counted. Incidence is the number of patients experiencing at least one treatment-related grade 3 or higher AE of any type during the time of observation., Baseline through end of post-treatment follow up period, an average of 5 years
This is a multiple arm, randomized, phase II platform study investigating the efficacy of Teclistamab or other immunotherapies against a control arm of Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone combination in participants with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Teclistamab
* Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)
* Dexamethasone (also called Decadron)

Safety of Teclistamab in SMM population will be established by using safety run-in method in the beginning of the study and will enroll up to 6 participants directly into Teclistamab arm. First 3 participants in cohort 1 will receive lower than recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Teclistamab and will be closely observed for the first 28 days. If safety is established with cohort 1, the additional 3participants will be enrolled to cohort 2 to receive RP2D. Once safety run-in participants indicate that it is safe to proceed, additional participants will be randomized 1:2 to the control arm of Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone combination or an investigational single agent (i.e., Teclistamab) arm. 15 participants will be randomized to the control arm, and 30 participants will be randomized to each investigational drug arm.

This research study has several different stages: screening, treatment, end of treatment and follow up.

The study treatment (either Teclistamab or Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone combination) will continue as long as there is disease benefits from the study drugs or a maximum of 24 months. It is expected that about 51 participants (6 safety + 15 control + 30 investigational arms) will take part in this research study.

Teclistamab and Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone are 'investigational' study drugs, which means that they have not been approved for treatment in high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
