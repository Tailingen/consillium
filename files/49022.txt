Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)
The investigators will examine whether 2-cycles of DFP chemotherapy before definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) can improve progression-free survival in locally advanced (Stage III \& IVM0) hypopharyngeal and base of tongue carcinoma compared to definitive CCRT alone.
