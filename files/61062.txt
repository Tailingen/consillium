A Clinical Safety and Efficacy Study of Mebendazole on GI Cancer or Cancer of Unknown Origin.
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of mebendazole (ReposMBZ) in patient with advanced gastrointestinal cancer or cancer of unknown origin. All patients will be given ReposMBZ for 16 weeks continuous treatment, individually dosed based on the serum concentration of mebendazole.

Mebendazole has been used extensively during long time for local gut helminthic infections at low dose but also at considerably higher doses during months to years against invasive echinococcus infections. Recent research has now clearly indicated that mebendazole has anticancer effect. Given these observations and the experience of excellent tolerance to mebendazole the current clinical trial protocol is based on the repositioning strategy to more extensively investigate whether mebendazole could be developed into a useful anticancer drug.
