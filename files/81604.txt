Sunvozertinib Plus Anlotinib as 1L Treatment in EGFR Mutant Advanced NSCLC-RW
This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, single-center clinical study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of sunvozertinib in combination with anlotinib in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations and co-mutations in locally advanced or metastatic treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: sunvozertinib in combination with Anlotinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), To assess progression-free survival of patients treated by sunvozertinib according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess sunvozertinib overall response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), Time from first dose to last dose, or up to 24 month|Overall survival (OS), To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Duration of Response (DoR), To assess duration of response for subjects with CR or PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator , defined as the time from the first documented CR or PR to disease progression or death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, From first dose until 28 days after the last dose, up to 24 month
This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, single-center clinical study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of sunvozertinib in combination with anlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic primary non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-sensitive mutations combined with co-mutations. Approximately 52 NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations (19del, L858R and T790M) and co-mutations were enrolled and treated with sunvozertinib (300 mg once daily) in combination with anlotinib (8 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week interruption) until the patients experienced disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or met the criteria for discontinuation of the trial drug. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS, and secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, OS, and safety. The study is expected to commence recruitment in mainland China in about April 2024. It is expected that the trial will end in Dec 2027.
