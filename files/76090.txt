Hemodynamic Monitoring in Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) Surgery
This is a pilot study with the primary objective to validate the use of advanced minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring with the PreSep™ Central Venous Oximetry Catheter, the Vigileo™ monitor, and FloTrac™ sensor for perioperative fluid management in Hepatobiliary and Pancreas Surgery. All of these devices and monitors are FDA approved devices and routinely used in the perioperative setting for these cases.

Surgical procedures involving the liver and pancreas are complex and involve paying close attention to hemodynamics to keep the patient stable through the duration of the case. Volume overload in liver and pancreas surgery leads to more intraoperative blood loss and rapid volume shifts make the patient unstable and more difficult to manage. Traditional methods of invasive monitoring to determine cardiac output and stroke volume include the placement of a pulmonary artery catheter and an arterial line. With the addition of the FloTrac™ Sensor to the arterial line and the Vigileo™ monitor; a pulmonary artery catheter would be no longer required. The minimally invasive cardiac output monitor connected to the central venous catheter will generate detailed information of cardiac function and fluid status and thereby help monitor and manage the hemodynamics of the patient intraoperatively. The information obtained from the Vigileo™ will be compared to the regular data normally available in patients undergoing hepatobiliary surgery to determine the advantages of using the system to aid in fluid management of the patient.
