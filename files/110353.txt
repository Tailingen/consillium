Clinical MR Spectroscopy of Brain Metastases at 1,5T and 3T.
Increasing magnetic field is known to give improvements in signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. To investigate this, spectra from different subjects were examined using two clinical MR instruments operating at 1.5T and 3T respectively.
