Icotinib With Whole Brain Radiation Therapy in NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib in combination with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. The primary endpoint is objective response rate of intracranial lesions.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Icotinib plus WBRT
Objective response rate of intracranial lesions, Number of participants with an objective response. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 8 weeks
Objective response rate of extracranial lesions, Number of participants with an objective response of extracranial lesions. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 8 weeks|Progression-free survival of intracranial lesions, All cause progress or mortality, 3-6 months|Safety and tolerability, All cause adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 6-12 months
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence of brain metastases. Patients with multiple brain metastasis showed poor prognosis and displayed an untreated median survival of only 3-6 months, and most patients died due to the progression of brain metastases. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib combined with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate .
