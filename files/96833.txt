BIBF 1120 in Bevacizumab Resistant, Persistent, or Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to see if BIBF 1120 can increase the number of women with bevacizumab resistant, persistent, or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who do not progress for at least six months.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: BIBF 1120
Percentage of Patients Who Survive Progression-free, Measure of Progression Free Survival (PFS) by the percentage of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating study therapy in patients with bevacizumab-resistant, persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma., 6 months
Objective Tumor Response Via RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1, Evaluating the percentage of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 1 year|Duration of Progression-Free Survival, The duration of progression-free survival and overall survival measured in months; Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Through study completion, on average 2 years|Objective Tumor Response Based on GCIG CA-125 Criteria, The proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) based on Gynaecologic Cancer InterGroup(GCIG) CA-125 criteria which is: "A response according to CA 125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days."., 1 year|Adverse Event Frequency and Severity, To determine frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4., 1 year
Concentration of Select Growth Factors Reported Measured in Picograms Per Milliliter as a Function of Treatment Response, Correlating baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors measured in picograms per milliliter that may be co- or counter- regulated with VEGF with response to treatment, 1 year|Coagulation and Endothelial Cell Activation Markers, To measure baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors that may be co- or counter- regulated with VEGF and correlate with response to treatment., 1 year|VEGF Levels Correlated With Treatment Outcome, Baseline levels of VEGF were correlated with treatment outcome. Results are stratified in groups: "Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD)" and "Progressive Disease (PD)", 1 year|Concentration of Select Growth Factors Measured in Nanograms Per Milliliter Reported as a Function of Treatment Response, Correlating baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors measured in nanograms per milliliter that may be co- or counter- regulated with VEGF with response to treatment, 1 year|Concentration of VCAM-1 Reported as a Function of Treatment Response, Correlating baseline and on treatment levels of VCAM-1 measured in micrograms per milliliter that may be co- or counter- regulated with VEGF with response to treatment, 1 year
Ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant and refractory disease have the lowest response rates to relapse chemotherapy: various chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, docetaxel, platinum, etoposide, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine are available but result in response rates of 7-40%. Unfortunately, relapse therapy is not curative and treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials demonstrated that anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 16-24% with an acceptable toxicity profile. However, resistance can develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore other novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as BIBF 1120, should be evaluated in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
