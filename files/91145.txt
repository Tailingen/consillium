Therapeutic Targeting of Sex Differences in Pediatric Brain Tumor Glycolysis
The investigators will develop the concept of a sex-specific therapeutic intervention for gliomas that is based upon dietary carbohydrate restriction. The investigators will integrate metabolomics tools and FDG-PET imaging to validate the ketogenic diet on a sex-specific basis.
Pediatric Brain Tumor
PROCEDURE: Ketogenic diet|DRUG: BCNU
Feasibility of combining a ketogenic diet with chemotherapy in children with relapsed brain tumors as measured by the number of patients who can recruited with 3 years, * The study will be defined as being feasible if all 15 patients can be recruited within 3 years
* Please note that feasibility of the study is dependent on both primary outcome measures, Through completion of enrollment of all participants (estimated to be 3 years)|Feasibility of combining a ketogenic diet with chemotherapy in children with relapsed brain tumors as measured by if at least 80% of the patients comply with the intervention, -The study will be defined as being feasible if at least 80% of the patients comply with the intervention as defined as achieving 80% of the targeted level of ketosis as assessed from laboratory measures and 80% of the planned BCNU doses

--Please note that feasibility of the study is dependent on both primary outcome measures, Up to 2 years
Tolerability of combining a ketogenic diet with chemotherapy in male children with relapsed brain tumors versus female children with relapsed brain tumors as measured by toxicity, * All toxicities will be summarized by noting the count of participants who experience each toxicity
* The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., Up to 2 years|Tumor response of male children with relapsed brain tumors to a ketogenic diet combined with chemotherapy versus female children with relapsed brain tumors as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of radiographic progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
* Progression will be defined by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group guideline., Up to 10 years
