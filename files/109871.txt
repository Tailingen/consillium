Effectiveness of well planned health education programs and low-cost screening methods (e.g., clinical breast exam and visual inspection of the cervix) in reducing the incidence of and mortality due to breast and cervical cancer
OBJECTIVES:

* To investigate the effectiveness of well planned health education programs (HEP) and low-cost screening methods (e.g., clinical breast examination \[CBE\] and visual inspection of the cervix painted with 4% acetic acid \[VIA\]) in down-staging and reducing the incidence of and mortality due to breast and cervical cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

* Arm I (intervention): Participants undergo intervention comprising health education programs (HEP), clinical breast examination (CBE), and visual inspection of the cervix painted with 4% acetic acid (VIA) every 2 years for up to 8 years. Participants also undergo active surveillance over 8 years.
* Arm II (control): Participants receive one HEP. Participants also undergo active surveillance over 8 years.
