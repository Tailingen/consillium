Phase I / Dose Expansion Study of Enadenotucirev in Ovarian Cancer Patients
This study is a Phase I / Dose Expansion open label clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. The Phase Ia part of the study will determine the dose of enadenotucirev to be recommended for further studies and will examine primarily the safety and tolerability but also the pharmacokinetics of administering enadenotucirev intraperitoneally. In Phase Ib, the safety and tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of administering enadenotucirev intravenously in combination with weekly paclitaxel will be determined. The Dose Expansion Phase will begin as an open label dose expansion of that regimen and aims to determine whether intravenous enadenotucirev in combination with weekly paclitaxel has a risk benefit profile that supports further investigation in the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.
