A Study to Compare Ociperlimab Plus Tislelizumab Versus Durvalumab Following Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) in Participants With Stage III Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab compared to durvalumab in adults with stage III unresectable PD-L1-selected non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after cCRT.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by the IRC per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1 or death, whichever occurred first., From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause, From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by both the IRC and investigators per RECIST v1.1., From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months|Duration of Response (DOR), defined as the time from the first determination of a confirmed objective response assessed by both the IRC and investigators per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months|Time to Death or Distant Metastasis (TTDM) as Assessed by the Investigator, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of distant metastasis assessed by both the IRC and investigators, or death. Distant metastasis is defined as any new lesion that is outside of the radiation field per RECIST v1.1 or proven by biopsy., From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months|Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization to the disease progression after next line of treatment, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From randomization through to the end of study, planned duration was 20 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), From first dose to 30 days after the last dose or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occured first; through study completion data cut-off date of October 17th, 2023 (maximum time on treatment was 16 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status, Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life score. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of participants with cancer. It includes global health status and quality of life questions related to overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline and Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13), Change from baseline in QLQ-CL13 scores for coughing, dyspnea, and chest pain. The QLQ-LC13 is a questionnaire that measures lung cancer-specific disease and treatment symptoms. It includes questions about specific symptoms in which participants respond based on a 4-point scale, where 1 is "not at all" and 4 is "very much". Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A lower score indicates an improvement in symptoms., Baseline and Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L), The EuroQol 5D-5L a descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state., Baseline and Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Serum Concentration of Ociperlimab, Serum concentrations of ociperlimab were measured for participants in the Ociperlimab + Tislelizumab + cCRT treatment group at predose (within 60 minutes before starting infusion) and postdose (within 30 minutes after the end of infusion). End of Treatment (EOT) visits occurred within 7 days after the date the investigator determined that study treatment would no longer be used, or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurred first., Predose at Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9, and 17; postdose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 5 and EOT visit (Each Cycle was 21 days)|Serum Concentration of Tislelizumab for Participants in the Ociperlimab + Tislelizumab + cCRT Treatment Group, Serum concentrations of tislelizumab were collected for participants in the Ociperlimab + Tislelizumab + cCRT treatment group at predose (within 60 minutes before starting infusion) and postdose (within 30 minutes after the end of infusion).

The study initiated with Protocol Amendment 1.0 (PA 1; dated on 16 April 2021). In April 2022 Protocol Amendment 2 (PA 2) was implemented. In PA 1, participants with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced NSCLC and evaluable PD-L1 expression all comers were enrolled; cCRT was given within the study. In PA 2, the enrollment of the target population was revised into participants with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after definitive, platinum-based cCRT and with PD-L1 expression on â‰¥ 1% of tumor cells as assessed by the central lab; cCRT was given outside of the study.

After implementation of PA 2, participants who were randomized under PA 1 were given the option to continue assigned study treatment or to discontinue assigned treatment and begin standard of care treatment outside of the study. Participants enrolled under PA 1 were excluded from the primary and secondary analysis specified by PA 2.

This study was subsequently terminated by the Sponsor prior to enrollment of any participants under PA 2.
