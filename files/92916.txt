Radiation Major Hepatectomy to Selectively Treat Large Unifocal Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The RESCUE trial is a prospective, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ablative radioembolization using Yttrium-90. This treatment is being investigated as a potential curative approach, as well as a bridging or downstaging strategy for surgery, in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (greater than 8 cm) who maintain good liver function.

Patients presenting with large hepatocellular carcinoma (greater than 8 cm), whether accompanied by satellite nodules or not, but retaining good liver function, will undergo ablative radioembolization utilizing Yttrium-90 resin microspheres. This approach is designed to deliver an ablative dose to both tumors and the surrounding liver (i.e., margin) with curative intent, while preserving over 30% of the non-tumorous liver volume. The efficacy and safety of this treatment will be evaluated over a period of two years and 90 days, respectively.
