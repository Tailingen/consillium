Study of ADXS-503 With or Without Pembro in Subjects With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
A Phase 1/2, Open-Label Study of ADXS-503 Alone and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Metastatic Squamous or Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell|Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Metastatic Non-Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: ADXS-503|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Safety/Tolerability of ADXS-503 Monotherapy in Part A and ADXS-503 With Pembrolizumab in Part B: Graded Per Comment Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, The safety/tolerability of ADXS-503 monotherapy in Part A and in combination pembrolizumab in Part B was assessed by the number of patients with treatment-related adverse events., 12 Months|Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of ADXS-503 + Pembrolizumab in Part C as Assessed by the Objective Response Rate (ORR), The anti-tumor activity of ADXS-503 + pembrolizumab was assessed by the objective response rate (ORR). The ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 was defined as the number of participants with objective evidence of radiologic complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions) and partial response (PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions compared with baseline, in absence of new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions) as determined from investigator response assessments. Disease Control Rates are based upon confirmed events only., 3 years
Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of ADXS-503 Alone in Part A and ADXS-503 With Pembrolizumab in Part B as Assessed by the Objective Response Rate (ORR), The anti-tumor activity of ADXS-503 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab was assessed by the objective response rate (ORR). The ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 was defined as the number of participants with objective evidence of radiologic complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions) and partial response (PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions compared with baseline, in absence of new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions) as determined from investigator response assessments. Disease Control Rates are based upon confirmed events only., 3 years|Safety/Tolerability of ADXS-503 With Pembrolizumab in Part C: Graded Per Comment Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, The safety/tolerability of ADXS-503 in combination with pembrolizumab in Part C was assessed by the number of patients with treatment-related adverse events., 3 years
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADXS-503, administered as monotherapy in Part A and in combination with pembrolizumab in Part B, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD). As well, to characterize the preliminary anti-tumor activity of ADXS-503, administered in combination with pembrolizumab in Part C, per RECIST v1.1.
