Physical Activity as Self-Management Approach to Improve Health Outcomes in AML
Physical Activity as a Self-Management Approach to Improve Health Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Leukemia|Myeloid|Monocytic
BEHAVIORAL: BSMA
Rates of recruitment, refusal, retention, and attrition will be aggregated to determine the feasibility of the BSMA program for patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML., These aggregated rates will help determine the feasibility of the biobehavioral self-management approach (BSMA) program involving physical activity (PA) in patients receiving consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary aim of this study rates of recruitment, refusal, retention, and attrition in the BSMA program for patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML will be reported rates of recruitment (number enrolled, refused), retention, and adherence (trends in exercise capacity as measured by 6minute walk test, strength test and chair to stand test; completed physical activity log; and accelerometer data)., 3 months
Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills model and using a quasi-experimental cohort control research design, the primary aim of this study is to: Determine the feasibility of the biobehavioral self management approach (BSMA) program involving physical activity (PA) in patients receiving consolidation treatment for AML. The primary feasibility outcomes for this aim will be rates of recruitment, refusal, retention and attrition; in addition investigators will test methods and procedures of the prescribed BSMA PA program, including assessing adherence, participant acceptance and perceived benefit.
