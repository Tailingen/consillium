Predicting Outcomes of Breast-Conserving Surgery in Breast Cancer Patients Using the Modified 5-Item Frailty Index
Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide, with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) being a key treatment. The modified 5-item frailty index (mFI-5), a well-validated tool for assessing frailty, has shown predictive utility in other surgical contexts but remains under-explored in BCS.

Methods: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2008-2021), the investigators identified adult female breast cancer patients who underwent BCS. Frailty was assessed using the mFI-5, scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater frailty. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to evaluate associations between mFI-5 scores and postoperative outcomes.

Main question: Can the mFI-5 predict adverse postoperative outcomes in breast-conserving surgery patients?
