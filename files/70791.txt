Clinical Study of Vorinostat in Combination With Etoposide in Pediatric Patients < 21 Years at Diagnosis With Refractory Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out how safe and effective treatment with a new combination of drugs, vorinostat and etoposide, is in treating cancer. The medication etoposide is a standard medication used in the treatment of cancer in children. Vorinostat is an experimental drug which targets a protein(s) that control the way cancer cells grow and divide. Vorinostat is approved by the FDA in adults with certain cancers but not approved yet in children.

There are two parts to this study. In the first part of this study, the phase I portion, a safe dose of the combination, vorinostat and etoposide. The goal of second part of this study, the phase II portion, is to see how effective the combination of vorinostat and etoposide is in treating cancer.
Solid Tumors|Relapsed/Refractory Sarcomas
DRUG: Vorinostat and Etoposide
To Establish the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), of the novel combination vorinostat and etoposide in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous system. The Toxicity will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0., Patients will be assessed in 3-week cycles.|To Establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), of the novel combination vorinostat and etoposide in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous system., 1 year|To Establish the Efficacy (CR (Complete Response) + PR (Partial Response) Rate), of the novel combination vorinostat and etoposide in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma. Evaluation for response will be determined by Revised RECIST guideline, 1 year
