Personalized Cancer Vaccine in Egyptian Cancer Patients
Evaluate safety and immunogenicity of peptide cancer vaccine in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed recurrence after surgical resection and refractory to the available institutional standard of care lines of treatment .
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Peptide cancer vaccine
Assessment of the safety of the personalized cancer vaccine, Percentage of patients who developed adverse events (AEs), 4 weeks|Assessment of immunological response, Percentage of change in CD20 +B-cells, CD16+CD56+NK cells,CD4 + cells,CD8+ cells,CD25+regulatory cells, 12 weeks
Progression free survival and overall survival time, Progression free survival (PFS) time and overall survival (OS)time will be analysed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation method and log-rank test., 144 week
Ten patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed recurrence after surgical resection are refractory to the available institutional standard of care lines of treatment will be recruited to received the peptide cancer vaccine.

Tumour antigen peptides will be identified and separated from each patient and then reinjected with an adjuvant (autologous activated monocytes with autologous tumour derived heat shock protein 70) by subcutaneous route monthly for 6 months preceded by 300 mg cyclophosphamide one week before start of the vaccine.

A follow up for all cases will be performed clinically, laboratorial, and immunologically for one year.
