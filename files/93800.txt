New Biomarkers in the Intracystic Liquid of Inflammatory and Non-inflammatory Pancreatic Cysts
Due to the advances made in the field of the imaging techniques and their common use, pancreatic cysts are more and more incidentally found.

Pancreatic pseudocysts can be misdiagnosed as cystic neoplasms, in particular when there is no clinical history of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms on the other hand are rare, but are difficult to diagnose accurately.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) , interleukin 1 Beta (IL1beta) and High Mobility Group AT-Hook 2 (HmgA2) are molecules implicated in the process of inflammation and tumour development. The diagnostic value of their concentration in pancreatic cysts is not established yet.

Study aim to asses the significance of NGAL,IL1Beta and HMGA2 concentration in cystic fluid obtained by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and serum level for discriminating between inflammatory and non-inflammatory pancreatic cyst.
