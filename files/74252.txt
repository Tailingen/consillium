Online Stress Management and Coping Skills Training for Women With Breast Cancer
Stress Management interventions have been shown to decrease cancer-related distress, foster emotional growth and improve immune functioning during treatment for breast cancer.

This study will evaluate an online version of a stress management intervention for women with early stage breast cancer. Each chapter of the 10-week intervention include self-assessment and targeted feedback, education, interactive learning exercises -- all tailored to the needs of women with early stage breast cancer. In addition, guided writing exercises will promote emotional expression and a discussion board will encourage group support.

The web-based intervention is being evaluated in a randomized clinical trial with a sample of 120 women with early stage breast cancer. Women will be randomly assigned to use the 10-week intervention with biweekly telephone assessments or to the telephone assessments alone.
