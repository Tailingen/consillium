Fluid Optimization in Liver Surgery
The purpose of this study is to analyze hemodynamic changes, in patients undergoing liver resection, through the Vigileo/FloTrac system.
Cancer of Liver
Stroke volume variation, Evaluation of changes in Stroke Volume Variation from Vigileo/FloTrac system during liver resection., at time of surgery
Stroke volume variation, Evaluation of changes in Stroke Volume Variation at the end of liver resection, during fluid optimization., at the end of surgery
To reduce bleeding, hepatectomies are performed with low central pressure (CVP) combined with extrahepatic control flow.

This management can lead hemodynamic instability and reduction in oxygen delivery so an advanced monitoring should be used.
