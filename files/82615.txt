Evaluation of Cemiplimab in Combination With Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy in First-Line (1L) Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Adult United States (US) Patients
This multi-year cohort study will assess the real-world safety and effectiveness of 1L treatment with cemiplimab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy across advanced NSCLC patient subgroups defined by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Patients will be retrospectively identified from at least two US electronic health record (EHR)-based databases.
