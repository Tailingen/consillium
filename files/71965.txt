Fast-Track Rehabilitation
This study is a prospective observational study which aim to evaluate the feasibility of a total and systematic home respiratory rehabilitation training program in patients who will undergo thoracic surgery, and otherwise tend to define failure reasons.

OTHER: Home-based rehabilitation
Completion (yes/no) of the home-training program based on 4 items: tobacco, dietary, physical activity and physiotherapy before thoracic surgery, Completion (yes/no) of the home-training program based on 4 items: tobacco, dietary, physical activity and physiotherapy before thoracic surgery :

* Tobacco: measure of tobacco consumption (self-report)
* Dietary: body mass
* Physical activity: number of physical activity sessions
* Physiotherapy: number of physical therapy sessions, from date of inclusion until the end of hospitalisation for thoracic surgery, assessed up to 6 months

The aim of this clinical trial is to identify the determining factors which impact a preoperative home respiratory rehabilitation training program success. This success is determined by complete achievement of the program (100%) by the patient.

This rehabilitation program is composed by 4 items:

* Adapted physical activity : 3 averaging cyclo ergometer or physical activity seances per week (25%)
* Physiotherapy sessions : 8 seances with a physical therapist (25%)
* Smokers : Set up of a program to help give up smoking if active smoker (25%)
* Dietetics : If unintentionally weight loss (\>5% total weight in 1 month or \>10% in 6 months) or BMI\<21 , nutritional assessment is conducted and dietetic program is initiated(25%)

Secondary objectives are :

* Assessment of postoperative event onset (30 days) (atelectasis, fibro-aspiration, time spent in resuscitation unit, intubation, revision surgery).
* Link assessment of 100% program success and at least one complication onset.
* Cost assessment of preoperative rehabilitation program
* Evaluation of mean hospitalisation duration post surgery (30 days)
* Average cost assessment of hospitalisation stay per patient.

This study will include 50 patients over 18 years old, addressed to the home heath care provider AGIR à Dom, for rehabilitation before pulmonary parenchyma exeresis.

Patients must perform at least 2 items of rehabilitation program previously described.

This program is an initiative of a pulmonologist or a thoracic surgeon, who include the patient when the date of surgery is scheduled.
