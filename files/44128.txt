Anlotinib Plus Penpulimab in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors
Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase # study, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore, the combination of Anlotinib and Penpulimab (a new PD-1 inhibitor) is attempted for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants who have progressed following prior PD-1 or PD-L1 Inhibitors treatment, to further improve the patient's PFS or OS.

This is a multicenter, single-arm, explorative clinical trial conducted in China to investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus docetaxel in advanced NSCLC patients (pts) who have progressed following prior PD-1 or PD-L1 Inhibitors treatment.
