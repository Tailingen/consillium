The Efficacy and Safety of Sintilimab Plus Anlotinib Combined With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in TNBC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab plus anlotinib combined with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants who have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will receive neoadjuvant study treatment (Sintilimab + anlotinib + chemotherapy) based on schedule for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each participant will then undergo definitive surgery 4-6 weeks after conclusion of the last cycle of the neoadjuvant study treatment. Following adjuvant study treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease recurrence. The primary outcome measure is pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 30-32 weeks
Residual cancer burden (RCB), Residual cancer burden (RCB), Up to approximately 30-32 weeks|Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Immune response biomarkers, PDL1, CD8, Tils, HRD..., Up to approximately 60 weeks|Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE., Up to approximately 60 weeks
