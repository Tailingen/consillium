Dabrafenib and Trametinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring V600E BRAF Mutation
This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dabrafenib and trametinib in stage IV disease to subjects with BRAF V600E mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Subjects will receive dabrafenib 150 mg bid and trametinib 2 mg once daily in combination therapy and continue on treatment until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event.

Objective response rate, ORR is a proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response or partial response by RECIST1.1, At Week 6 then every 6 weeks up to Week 36.and then every 12 weeks until discharge, for an average of 13.8 months
Duration of response, DOR is calculated as the time from the date of the first document of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to the first documented preogressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause for patients with PR or CR., At Week 6 then every 6 weeks up to Week 36.and then every 12 weeks until discharge, for an average of 13.8 months|Progression-free survival, . PFS is defined as time from the first dose of investigational products (IPs) to progression or death due to any cause.
