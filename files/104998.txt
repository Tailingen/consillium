Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Intermediate-Grade or High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin and topotecan in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride
Response rate, Up to 5 years
Time to progression, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin and topotecan.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and annually for the next 3 years.
