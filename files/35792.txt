A Prospective, Multi-center, Observational Study for Signal-C Test Evaluation
To evaluate the performance characteristics of Signal-C™ a plasma circulating free-DNA test, to detect colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous lesions (APL) in an average risk screening population for 45 and over.
Colorectal Cancer|Advanced Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: Signal-C™
Primary Objective, The primary objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity for CRC and specificity for advanced neoplasia (AN). Advance Neoplasia (AN) is defined as a final diagnosis of CRC or Advanced Precancerous Lesion (APL)., 1 year
Secondary Objective, To determine sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions (APL)., 1 year
