Multicenter Study of Pharmacokinetic-Guided Docetaxel in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide
The purpose of this study is to adjust the amount of docetaxel participants receive based on the level of docetaxel measured in their blood. This method of dose adjustment is called pharmacokinetic (PK)-adjusted docetaxel. The researchers believe that adjusting the dose of docetaxel using this method will lessen the side effects associated with docetaxel in cancer treatment.

Rate of Achieving Targeted Area Under the Curve (AUC), Rate of PK guided dosing of docetaxel chemotherapy improving the ability to achieve a targeted AUC ( 2.5-3.7 mg\*hr/L) within 4 cycles of therapy in patients \> 65 years of age with breast cancer receiving TC (docetaxel and cyclophosphamide) as compared with historical non-PK guided therapy from patients receiving a similar regimen., Cycle 4 - Up to 6 months
Incidence of Grade 3 and 4 Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia, The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in cycles following PK adjustment (cycles 2-4) will be compared with cycle 1 and historical non-PK guided therapy using the Wilcoxon-Rank sum assessment., Up to 6 months|Association Between Scores - Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients, The Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH) score will be reported as ordinal data (low, intermediate-low, intermediate-high, or high risk)., Baseline and Post Cycle 1|Association Between Scores - Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) total score will be reported as binomial data (greater or less than 26 based on how it is incorporated into the CRASH score)., Baseline and Post Cycle 1|Association Between Scores - Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics, The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) will be reported as discrete data out of a possible score of 65. The Wilcoxon-Rank sum and Chi-squared tests will be used as appropriate., Baseline and Post Cycle 1
Comparison of Patient Profiles and Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Scores, The relationship between PK-guided docetaxel patient PK profiles and the Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Taxane and Breast Cancer scores will be described., Up to 6 months
