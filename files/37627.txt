Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety of Rusfertide (PTG-300) in Subjects With Polycythemia Vera
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of rusfertide in subjects with polycythemia vera. Subjects who complete dosing with rusfertide until the end-of-treatment visit of a Phase 2 rusfertide study and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study, are eligible to participate in this open-label study and continue treatment with rusfertide.
Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: Open-label rusfertide
Hematocrit, Median hematocrit, 0-2 years|Phlebotomies, Number of phlebotomies, 0-2 years
This is an open-label study designed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of rusfertide. This study aims to provide long-term rusfertide treatment to subjects who complete dosing until the end-of-treatment of a previous Phase 2 rusfertide study and are likely to continue benefiting from treatment with rusfertide based on their improved control of hematocrit levels \<45% and reduced need for therapeutic phlebotomies. This study will provide long-term rusfertide treatment to these subjects and obtain data on safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with rusfertide.
