Observational Study to Evaluate the Use of Targeted Therapies in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in terms of overall survival, the benefit of monoclonal antibodies in the start time of the diagnosis of advanced disease or administer a deferred basis after progression to treatment with chemotherapy alone. Initially expected target population was 1950 patients (pts), in 2015 protocol was ammended to 1028 patients, because the size was sufficient to evaluate the superiority of the use of monoclonal antibodies the start time of the diagnosis against deferred use, with HR of 0.8, power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05. Finally in July 2018, recruitment was completed with a total of 1104 patients enrolled.
Metastatic Colon Cancer
DRUG: Chemotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: Chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibody
Overall survival, From date of inclusion until the date of death from any cause., From July 2018 (LPI), 24 months
Validate prognostic score GEMCAD, The two main prognostic scores for metastatic colorectal cancer (Kohne and GERCOR) do not account for resectability of liver-only metastasis (LiM) and thus are limited as treatment guidance. We propose a classification of patients based on LiM resectability, performance status (PS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and compare its discrimination capacity against Kohne and GERCOR scores.

GEMCAD score: patients are classified as stage 1 if LiM are considered resectable (\<4 nodules and \<5 cm diameter) or potentially resectable (\>4 and \<10 nodules or \>5 cm diameter), PS 0-1 and LDH \< 1.5 ULN; stage 2 if LiM are not resectable or with extrahepatic spread, PS 0-1 and LDH \< 1.5 ULN; stage3 if PS 2 or LDH \> 1.5 ULN.

This score, Kohne, and GERCOR scores will be tested for discrimination using Harrel's C index (HCI, higher is better) and calibration using Akaike information criterion (AIC, smaller is better) of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)., From August 2014, up to 36 months|To compare GERCOR and KÃ¶hne classification with GEMCAD classification, The two main prognostic scores for metastatic colorectal cancer (Kohne and GERCOR) do not account for resectability of liver-only metastasis (LiM) and thus are limited as treatment guidance.
