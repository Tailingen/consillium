Study of SIR-Spheres Plus Sorafenib as 1st Line Treatment for Non-resectable Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This Phase I/II trial will evaluate the safety and activity of chemo-radiotherapy comprising a regimen of Sorafenib chemotherapy plus SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres (chemo-radiotherapy, also known as "chemo-SIRT"), for first-line treatment of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in whom surgical resection is not feasible.

This study is designed as a prelude to a planned future randomised comparative study that will compare the efficacy of Sorafenib plus SIR-Spheres versus Sorafenib alone, in this patient population.
