Sorafenib or Lenvatinib Plus HAIC of 130 mg/m² Oxaliplatin, and 5-fu vs Sorafenib or Lenvatinib Plus HAIC of 85mg/m² Oxaliplatin, and 5-fu for Unresectable Advanced HCC: a Randomised Phase 3 Trial
A randomized trial showed that sorafenib plus hepatic artery infusion of 85mg/m² oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil is more effective than sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a retrospective study showed that hepatic artery infusion of 130 mg/m² oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil is more effective than sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. It is unknown which oxaliplatin dose is better.
