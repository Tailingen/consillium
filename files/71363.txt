SRAM Study_Postate Cancer
This is a phase 2 randomized study for High risk localized prostate cancer (T3 to T4 disease and/or PSA \> 20 and/or Gleason score ≥ 8) without evidence of distant and nodal metastasis.

Patient will be randomized to:Arm 1

* Conventional IMRT RapidArc IMRT to prostate and pelvic nodes. 76Gy to prostate, 70Gy to proximal 2/3 of seminal vesicles, and 50Gy to pelvic nodes (up to bifurcation of common iliac nodes).
* 38 fractions of daily treatment, Monday to Friday

or Arm 2

SBRT

* RapidArc IMRT to prostate and pelvic nodes. 40Gy to prostate, 36.25Gy to proximal 2/3 of seminal vesicles, and 25Gy to pelvic nodes (up to bifurcation of common iliac nodes)
* 5 fractions of weekly treatment. Once fraction per week. All patients will be given neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (detail as below)
Advanced Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Conventional IMRT|DRUG: SBRT
To compare acute toxicities between SBRT and conventional IMRT, Toxicities will be assessed by AE CTC version 4 between 2 treatment arms, 4 years
To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between SBRT and conventional IMRT, Questionnaire EPIC will be used at pre-treatment, during treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post treatment, 4 years|To compare the biochemical-failure free survival at 5 years, 5 years|To compare the progression-free survival at 5 years, 5 years|To compare the overall survival at 5 years, 5 years|To compare the late toxicities between 2 treatment arms, Toxicities will be assessed by AE CTC version 4 between 2 treatment arms, 5 years
