SyB C-0501(Oral Bendamustine) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study of SyB C-0501 by continuous daily oral administration in patients with advanced solid tumors, who have previously received anticancer therapy and consists of two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study to evaluate tolerability of SyB C-0501 in the patients, and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD) and optimum dosing schedule. Part 2 is being done to evaluate safety and anti-tumor activity of SyB C-0501 preliminarily at RD, and to assess its target cancer exploratory.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SyB C-0501
Identification of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Number of Subjects with DLT in Each Cohort/Level, Based on the number of patients with DLT and administration dose in each cohort, recommended dosage will be defined for the following clinical phase. A DLT is defined as an adverse event that occurred during the Cycle 1, for which a causality with the investigational products (IP) cannot be ruled out and meets the DLT criteria of this study., Cycle 1 (Approximately 3 weeks)|Adverse Events (Types, Incidence, severity, Relationship to SyB C-0501), Approximately 2 years
Adverse Events (Types, Incidence, Severity, Relationship to SyB C-0501), Approximately 4 years|Change of laboratory test values and clinical laboratory abnormal values (Incidence, Severity), Approximately 4 years|Maximum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to maximum concentration (tmax) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Area under the concentration-time curve up to the last time point with detectable plasma concentration (AUC0-last) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Area under the concentration-time curve up to infinity (AUC0-inf) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Elimination half-life (t1/2) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Oral clearance (CL/F) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of unchanged bendamustine in plasma, Day 1, and Day 8 or Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Approximately 4 years|Change of laboratory test values and clinical laboratory abnormal values (Incidence, Severity), Approximately 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Approximately 2 years
