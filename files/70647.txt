Vitreous Level Of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha In Patients With Retinal Vein Occlusion
To assess the levels of TNF- α in vitreous samples of patients with retinal vein occlusion prior to administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF and compare them to levels in vitreous samples of normal subjects so as to investigate the association of vitreous tumor necrosis factor with the pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion.
