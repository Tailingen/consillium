Study on the Safety and Efficacy of MR-Linac Technique in Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Colon Cancer
In this phase I single-arm clinical study, 20 patients with T4b unresectable locally advanced colon cancer are proposed to be enrolled, who will be treated with MR-Linac with short course radiotherapy (25Gy/5F), followed by 4 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 3 cycles of XELOX chemotherapy, then radical surgical resection, and then postoperatively with 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 5 cycles of XELOX. The study will assess patients' surgical R0 resection rate, pCR or cCR rate, PFS, OS, and related adverse effects of treatment, aiming to explore the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of MR-Linac in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced colon cancer.
Safety and Efficacy
RADIATION: MR-linac
MRI-linac Treatment Completion Rate, Is adaptive radiotherapy guided by MRI feasible for patients with locally advanced unresectable colon cancer? The feasibility of each patient will be recorded as a binary variable (1=feasible; 0=not feasible)., 2 years|Clinical complete response (cCR), Clinical complete response refers to the absence of detectable tumor clinically after treatment., 2 years|Pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological complete response is defined as the absence of any signs of cancer in tissue samples after treatment., 2 years
Toxicity reaction (CTC 4.0 standardï¼‰, CTC 4.0, also known as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, is an extensively used classification system for assessing drug toxicity. This system categorizes drug toxicity into five levels: Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4., long range|R0 resection rate, During surgery, the R0 resection rate refers to the complete removal of the entire tumor with no residual abnormalities present in the surrounding normal tissue., 2 years|Surgical complications, Surgical complications refers to adverse events or problems that arise during or after a surgical procedure. These complications can range from minor issues to serious complications that may have significant consequences for the patient., 2 years|Local control rate, Proportion of cases in remission and stable disease after treatment, i.e., proportion of patients who did not experience disease progression., 2 years|Disease-free survival, The time from the start of treatment to the first tumor recurrence/metastasis, or death of the subject due to any cause., 2 years|Overall survival, Time from the start of the patient's treatment to the patient's death from any cause, 2 years
