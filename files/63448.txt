Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN) are rare tumours whose incidence has increased during the years. However, referral centers specialized in diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are few. So, patients may be forced to travel long distances in order to reach a disease specialized center (ENETS certification) to plan the correct management and receive the better treatment. On the other hand, patients could research different clinical consulting by several medical specialists without clear indication. Moreover, today also advanced disease allows the patients a good prognosis with long survival. The resulting emotional and psychological burden may contribute to the worse quality of life. Therefore, patients with GEP-NEN have a deal with the financial consequences related to the diagnosis and treatment of their disease including out of pocket costs, loss of income and caregiver burden. Financial toxicity, defined as subjective financial concerns of cancer and objective financial consequences, has been investigated in this study in Italian patients affected by GEP-NEN
