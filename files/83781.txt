Imaging With [11C]Martinostat in Breast Cancer
This research study is studying a PET imaging tracer as a possible means of imaging breast cancer.

The imaging agent involved in this study is:

-\[11C\]Martinostat (called C-eleven-Martinostat)
Breast Cancer
DRUG: [11C]Martinostat|DEVICE: MR-PET scanner
PET-MRI Visualization and Quantification of Breast Tumor Uptake of [11C]Martinostat Above Background Uptake, as Assessed by SUV Measurements, Evaluate the ability of PET-MRI to visualize and quantify uptake of \[11C\]Martinostat in breast tumors above background tracer uptake. SUVmax will be collected from the primary breast tumor and the normal background breast tissue. The study is powered to detect a difference in mean background SUVmax of 0.4 in breast parenchyma uninvolved by tumor and breast parenchyma with breast tumor using a two-sample t-test., up to 2 years
Quantitative [11C]Martinostat-PET Uptake in Primary Breast Cancer, and Correlation with Expression of HDAC Isoforms, Expression levels of HDAC isoforms will be determined from the baseline breast tumor biopsy specimens via western blot analysis. SUV measurements will be collected from the primary breast tumors on PET-MRI., up to 2 years|Correlation of Total Volume of Distribution of Dynamic [11C]Martinostat Uptake with Expression of HDAC Isoforms, Expression levels of HDAC isoforms will be determined from the baseline breast tumor biopsy specimens via western blot analysis. The total volume of \[11C\]Martinostat distribution will be collected from each PET-MRI., up to 2 years|Comparison of HDAC Isoform Expression by Western Blot Across Breast Tumor Subtypes, Expression levels of HDAC isoforms will be determined from the baseline breast tumor biopsy specimens via western blot analysis and will be analyzed for an association with the tumor subtype as determined by expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor on clinical pathology., up to 2 years|HDAC Expression Levels in Breast Tumors Compared to HDAC Expression in Adjacent Normal Breast Parenchyma, Comparison of the expression of HDAC in breast tumors to the expression of HDAC in the adjacent normal breast parenchyma. Expression levels of HDAC isoforms will be determined from the baseline breast tumor biopsy specimens via western blot analysis. Expression of HDAC isoforms in the normal breast parenchyma will be determined from biopsy tissue that is collected from the same breast with the cancer, but in a region of healthy breast parenchyma not involved by tumor., up to 2 years
This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study imaging agent in patients who have breast cancer.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved \[11C\]Martinostat as an investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.

In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called \[11C\]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.

The purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.

In this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called \[11C\]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.

\[11C\]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous studies of \[11C\]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems). While this is not the first time \[11C\]Martinostat has been used in humans, it is the first study in which the investigators are using this tracer to study breast cancer.
