Blood Levels of Tumor Cells in Predicting Response in Patients Receiving First-Line Chemotherapy for Stage IV Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Measuring blood levels of tumor cells in patients with breast cancer may help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood levels of tumor cells in predicting response in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for stage IV breast cancer.

Correlation of circulating tumor cells with tumor markers, clinical response, and radiological response|Change in HER-2 status in patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Predict the overall and progression-free survival of patients with stage IV breast cancer by measuring the rate of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before the second course of chemotherapy.

Secondary

* Predict overall and progression-free survival of these patients by measuring the rate of CTC before the start of chemotherapy, at the first tumor evaluation, and after 2-3 courses of chemotherapy.
* Correlate the detection of CTC with tumor markers, clinical response, and radiological response.
* Study the changing status of HER-2 in CTC in patients receiving trastuzmab (Herceptin®).

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Blood samples are collected at baseline, before the second course of chemotherapy, before the third or fourth course of chemotherapy, and when progressive disease is diagnosed (before second-line treatment is initiated). Circulating tumor cells from the blood samples are examined by immunofluorescence.

Patients are followed periodically for up to 3 months.
