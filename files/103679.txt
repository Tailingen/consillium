Quality of Life After Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision Compared to Traditional Total Mesorectal Excision
The improvement in prognosis of rectal cancer through modern therapy modalities rises questions regarding quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes. Evidence for long-term QoL and functional outcomes of transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is not provided in current literature. This study will compare short-term and long-term QoL and functional outcomes after taTME compared to traditional abdominal TME (laparoscopic, robotic, and open approach)

PROCEDURE: Transanal total mesorectal excision
Quality of life (QoL), Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30):

* Overall QoL
* QLQ-total, 5 years after initial operation
Functional outcomes, Assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30):

* physical functioning
* role functioning
* cognitive functioning
* emotional functioning
* social functioning
* fatigue
* pain
* nausea and vomiting
* appetite loss
* dyspnea
* insomnia
* constipation
* diarrhea
* financial difficulties, 5 years after initial operation
Quality of life and functional outcomes of patients undergoing taTME or abTME for stage I-III rectal cancer will be analysed. A retrospective propensity score-adjusted analysis of prospectively conducted data will be performed. The primary endpoint QoL will be assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Secondary endpoints are the functional outcomes according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.
