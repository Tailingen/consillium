The Differences Between Gonadal and Extra-gonadal Malignant Teratomas
A tumor comprising of different types of tissues (such as hair, muscle, bone, etc.) is known as a teratoma. It is a type of germ cell (cells that make sperm or eggs) tumor. When these germ cells have rapid cancerous growth, then such a teratoma is called a malignant teratoma. We have studied the differences between gonadal and extra-gonadal malignant teratomas and the effects of chemotherapy in both genders.

Methods: The samples of 3799 male and 1832 female patients with malignant teratoma samples, between the ages of 1 and 85+ years, were selected from the years 1973 to 2014. Trends in incidence, estimated prevalence, incidence rates, and frequency were calculated in gonadal and extra-gonadal tumors with age adjustment. The fiveyear observed, expected, and relative survival rates were analyzed to study the prognosis.
