Feasibility Study of CBCT for IGRT in Cancer Patients
Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an imaging technology that is incorporated into many modern radiation therapy systems. The quality of conventional CBCT is good enough to align patients for their daily radiation therapy but CBCT images have poor contrast and are susceptible to imaging artefacts that limit their usability for other tasks in the radiation therapy workflow.

Varian Medical Systems, the sponsor of this study, has developed new CBCT imaging technology called HyperSight that so far has demonstrated increased image quality compared with conventional CBCT images. This new HyperSight CBCT imager has previously been built into Varian Halcyon and Ethos treatment machines, where the imager is enclosed in a ring that rotates around the patient. Now, HyperSight has been built into a Varian treatment machine, called TrueBeam, where the imager is mounted on a C-shaped arm that rotates around you to acquire an image.

This study is being done to evaluate the image quality of HyperSight CBCT compared to conventional CBCT images, and to determine whether HyperSight CBCT can improve the process of delivering radiation treatments.

The goal of this study is to collect images from this new HyperSight-TrueBeam CBCT imager from a variety of patients and locations in the body. The images will be analyzed to determine whether their quality is high enough to use for tasks other than positioning patients for treatment. For example, the study will determine whether the HyperSight images could be used to calculate a radiation plan.

DEVICE: Comparison of HyperSight CBCT imaging to conventional CBCT imaging.
Comparison of Image Contrast Resolution, The difference in contrast resolution will be evaluated between a standard CBCT image, a CBCT image acquired using HyperSight technology, and a standard fan-beam CT acquired as part of the treatment simulation and planning process, End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Comparison of Image Uniformity, The difference in image uniformity will be evaluated between a standard CBCT image, a CBCT image acquired using HyperSight technology, and a standard fan-beam CT acquired as part of the treatment simulation and planning process., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Qualitative Image Comparison, Qualitative comparison of HyperSight CBCT to conventional CBCT to determine preferred imaging for patient localization for daily treatment. Clinician observers will rank their preference using a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 represents strong preference of one imaging modality and 5 represents strong preference for the other modality., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.
Reduction of Metal Artifacts, In patients with a metal implant in the imaging field, the volume \[cubic centimeters\] of the metal artefact will be compared between a standard CBCT image, a CBCT image acquired using HyperSight technology, and a standard fan-beam CT acquired as part of the treatment simulation and planning process., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Imaging Time for Large Treatment Volumes, For participants where multiple conventional CBCTs must be acquired and stitched together to capture the entire treatment field, the time \[seconds\] required for the overall imaging session will be recorded and compared between HyperSight CBCT and conventional CBCT., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Imaging Time for Breath Hold Imaging, For participants who undergo breath-hold imaging, the time \[seconds\] required for the overall imaging session will be recorded and compared between HyperSight CBCT and conventional CBCT., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Patient Tolerance of Breath Hold Imaging, For participants who undergo breath-hold imaging, the total number of individual breath-holds required for a complete image acquisition will be recorded and compared between HyperSight CBCT and conventional CBCT., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.|Feasibility of HyperSight CBCT for Treatment Planning, For anatomical regions where there are limited anatomical deformations expected between image acquisitions, the radiation doses calculated for individual anatomical structures in a participant's treatment plan, which is based on their fan-beam simulation CT, will be compared to doses for the same structures after re-calculating the dose distribution for the same treatment plan using both the HyperSight CBCT and conventional standard CBCT., End of radiation treatment at 9 weeks.
