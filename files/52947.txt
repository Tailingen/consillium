Pembrolizumab and Axitinib as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab combined with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Major Pathologic Response (MPR), The residual tumor cells (% RVT) were calculated according to immune related pathologic response criteria (irPRC), MPR is defined as %RVT\<10%, 12 weeks
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), The residual tumor cells (% RVT) were calculated according to immune related pathologic response criteria (irPRC), pCR is defined as %RVT\<0%, 12 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), Rate of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and immune-related response criteria (IRC), 12 weeks|Disease-free survival(DFS), DFS is defined as the time from treatment to recurrence of tumor or death, Up to 24 months|Overall survival(OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment to death, Up to 24 months|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events(AEs), To be assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 24 months
Biomarker analysis, Paired t-test or Wilcoxon singed-rank test will be used to compare the biomarkers change before, during, and after treatment., Up to 24 months
This study is design to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab combined with axitinib in downsizing tumors in patients with nonmetastatic biopsy-proven clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Patients will receive axitinib 5 mg bid on days 1-21 combined with pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatments repeat every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Patients then will receive partial or radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant therapy.
