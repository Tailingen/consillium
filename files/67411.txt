BrUOG 355: Nivolumab to Tailored Radiation Therapy With Concomitant Cisplatin in the Treatment of Patients With Cervical Cancer
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug in combination with radiation to learn whether the drug(s) works in treating a specific disease. In this study, researchers are studying three treatment arms, each using standard chemotherapy, with the drug cisplatin and radiation and the drug Nivolumab. Each treatment Arm will test the addition of Nivolumab at a different time point
