Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of KITE-585 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KITE-585, an autologous engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product targeting a protein commonly found on myeloma cells called B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), as measured by the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Participants will be given a 3 day course of conditioning chemotherapy followed by a single infusion of KITE-585.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
GENETIC: KITE-585|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is a KITE-585-related event with onset in the first 28 days following infusion. DLTs are defined by events and duration of events, including:

* Any duration: Grade (GR) 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), KITE-585-related GR 5 adverse events (AE) and GR 4 nonhematologic AE with the exceptions of fever, nausea, hepatic toxicity that resolves to GR 3 or better in ≤ 72 hours, hypogammaglobulinemia, tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal toxicity requiring dialysis for ≤ 7 days, intubation for airway protection for ≤ 7 days and AE resolves to ≤ GR 1 within 2 weeks and baseline within 4 weeks
* ≥ 72 hours: GR 3 CRS and GR 3 nonhematologic AE with the exceptions of fever, nausea, hepatic toxicity that resolves to GR 2 or better in ≤ 14 days, hypogammaglobulinemia and tumor lysis syndrome
* ≥ 30 days: GR 4 hematologic AE with the exceptions of cytopenias attributable to ongoing or recurrent multiple myeloma, From KITE-585 infusion until 28 days after KITE-585 infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Study Investigators According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Consensus Panel 1 Criteria, ORR: Percentage of participants who achieved a stringent CR (sCR), complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or very good PR (VGPR), as determined by IMWG Consensus Panel 1 Criteria. sCR: CR+normal free light chain (FLC) ratio, no clonal cells in BM by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence; CR: negative immunofixation (IFX) on serum and urine, no soft tissue plasmacytomas (STP), \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM); PR: ≥50% decrease of serum M-protein + 24hr urinary M-protein decrease by ≥90% or \<200 mg/24hr. If unmeasurable serum and urine M-protein; and serum-free light assay; requires ≥ 50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels / ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells (PC), provided baseline BM PC percentage was ≥ 30%, respectively. If present at baseline, ≥ 50% reduction in the size of STP is also required; VGPR: serum and urine M-protein detected by IFX but not electrophoresis, \>90% in serum M-protein+urine, M-protein level \<100 mg/24hr., From KITE-585 infusion to the earlier date of data cutoff and first administration of other anti-cancer therapies including stem cell transplant (maximum: 17.6 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Study Investigators According to the IMWG Consensus Panel 1, PFS: Interval from first study drug dose date to the earlier of first documentation of definitive progressive disease (PD) per IMWG Consensus Panel 1 Criteria or death from any cause. PD: an increase of 25% from the lowest response value in 1 of the following: Serum and urine M-protein (absolute increase ≥ 0.5 g/dL and ≥ 200 mg/24 hours, respectively); In participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels, the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase \> 10 mg/dL); In participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein and without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow PC percentage (absolute percentage ≥ 10%). Definite development of new bone lesions or STP or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or STPs; Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder. Analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate., From KITE-585 infusion to the earlier date of data cutoff and first administration of other anti-cancer therapies including stem cell transplant (maximum: 17.6 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the first dose date of study drug to the date of death from any cause. Analysis was done using KM estimate. Participants who have not died by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last date known to be alive or cutoff date, whichever is earlier., From KITE-585 infusion to date of data cutoff (maximum: 17.6 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Enrollment through 24 months after treatment with KITE-585 or up to disease progression or initiation of another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first (maximum: 2.9 months)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities, Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were defined as per investigator's discretion., Enrollment through 24 months after treatment with KITE-585 or up to disease progression or initiation of another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first (maximum: 2.9 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by Study Investigators According to the IMWG Consensus Panel 1, DOR is defined for participants who experience an objective response and is defined as the time from the date of their first objective response (which is subsequently confirmed) to PD per IMWG Consensus Panel 1 Criteria or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. Objective response is defined in Outcome measure 2., From first response to the earlier date of data cutoff and first administration of other anti-cancer therapies including stem cell transplant (maximum: 17.6 months)|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the length of time between the date of KITE-585 infusion to the date of initiation of the next therapy or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier., From KITE-585 infusion to the earlier date of data cutoff and first administration of other anti-cancer therapies including stem cell transplant (maximum: 17.6 months)
Participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma can participate if all eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility include disease assessments, a physical exam, ECG and echocardiogram of the heart, brain MRI, and blood draws. Eligible participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-585. Participants receive conditioning chemotherapy prior to the KITE-585 infusion. After the KITE-585 infusion, participants will be followed for side effects and effect of KITE-585 on their myeloma. Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting. Participants who received an infusion of KITE-585 will complete the remainder of the 15 year follow-up assessments in a separate long-term follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968
