Study of Anlotinib in Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC Patients in the Elderly Without Systemic Chemotherapy (ALTER-L006)
Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and tumor celltebiz related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase III study, Patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib (12mg, po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months.
Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride
PFS, Progress free survival (PFS), Time Frame: each 42 days up to PD or death(up to 24 months)
OS, Overall Survival (OS), From randomization until death (up to 24 months)|DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR), each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR), each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 30 day safety follow-up visit|EORTC QLQ-C30, use EORTC QLQ-C30(version 3) questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life, each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)
It is an open, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to Recruiting 72 patients in the elderly without systemic chemotherapy. Patents receive 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to 14 of a 21-day cycle until progression of disease, assess safety and efficacy of the drug.
