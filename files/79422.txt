Assessment of a New Fluorescence Imaging Technique Using Biopsies From Prostate Resection
In this study, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of anti-PSMA labelling to detect post-operative prostatic tissues by two ex vivo fluorescence techniques. We will evaluate the feasibility and detection of anti-PSMA labelling by:

1. / the FEMTO-ST institute medical device,
2. / the confocal microscope that will be used to measure fluorescence spectra of biological samples.

OTHER: Fluorescence assessment
Comparison of the fluorescence obtained using the FEMTO-ST device and the confocal microscope of anti-PSMA marked fresh prostate biopsies, for prostatic and non-prostatic tissue, as identified by anatomo-pathology (gold standard)., Fluorescence measurements obtained using the FEMTO-ST medical device and the confocal microscope., 14 months
Comparison of the fluorescence obtained using the FEMTO-ST device and the confocal microscope of anti-PSMA marked fresh prostate biopsies, for cancerous and non-cancerous tissue, as identified by anatomo-pathology (gold standard)., Fluorescence measurements obtained using the FEMTO-ST medical device and the confocal microscope., 14 months
For this protocol, 12 patients will be included.
