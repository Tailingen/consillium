QuantifyHER: Quantitative Immunofluorescence and/or RT-qPCR for Measuring HER2 in HER2-low Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study will assess whether a quantitative, HER2 assay can accurately and reliably discriminate between responders and non-responders among patients with HER2 IHCI+ metastatic breast cancer who are receiving T-Dxd.
HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CE-10-IVD
Real-World Objective Response Rate, Association between quantitative HER2 expression (as a continuous variable) and real-world objective response rate, from date of first dose of T-DXd to date of last dose of T-DXd for each. Up to 100 months
Real-World Progression Free Survival, Association between quantitative HER2 expression (as a continuous variable) and real world Progression Free Survival, from date of first dose of T-DXd to date of last dose of T-DXd for each.Up to 100 months|Real-World Progression Free Survival and Objective Response Rate by estrogen receptor expression, Association between HER2 expression by quantitative immunofluorescence and mRNA in HER2 IHC 1+ tumors and both rwORR and rwPFS, stratified by mRNA ER expression, from date of first dose of T-DXd to date of last dose of T-DXd for each. Up to 100 months|Threshold for HER2 QIF and/or mRNA levels, cut-off value for HER2 QIF, mRNA and the combination below which patients will not respond to T-DXd.", from date of first dose of T-DXd to date of last dose of T-DXd for each. Up to 100 months|Association between combined mRNA + QIF and real-world Objective Response Rate, Comparison, based on rwORR, of a linear combination of HER2 QIF and mRNA, versus either alone in ability to discriminate T-DXd responders from non- responders, from date of first dose of T-DXd to date of last dose of T-DXd for each. Up to 100 months
