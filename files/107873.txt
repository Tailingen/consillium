Randomized, open-label, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy of rituximab maintenance therapy in patients aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive undergoing first-line treatment for mantle cell lymphoma and exhibiting a response after autologous transplantation.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|OTHER: Watch and wait
event-free survival (EFS) post Rituximab maintenance therapy, EFS post 4 years after maintenance
duration of PFS of the entire group of patients., Safety/efficacy of maintenance treatment|duration of OS of the entire group of patients, safety/efficacy of treatment|complete, partial and overall response rate after induction with R-DHAP and after ASCT., safety/efficacy of all the treatment
Demonstration of the superiority in terms of 4-year event-free survival (EFS) of Rituximab maintenance therapy compared to post-autograft surveillance in patients aged 18-65 years inclusive, treated with R-DHAP then autologous transplantation for MCL as first-line therapy.
