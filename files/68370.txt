Assessing Durvalumab and FLOT Chemotherapy in Resectable Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
This is a Global Study of Neoadjuvant-Adjuvant Durvalumab or Placebo and FLOT Chemotherapy Followed by Adjuvant Durvalumab or Placebo in Patients with Resectable Gastric and Gastroesophageal Cancer (GC/GEJC) (MATTERHORN).
Gastrointestinal Neoplasms|Esophagogastric Junction
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: FLOT chemotherapy
Event-free survival (EFS), EFS is the time from date of randomization until the date of disease progression or death., Up to 5 years
To compare Arm A relative to Arm B on overall survival (OS), Overall survival is length of time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|To compare Arm A relative to Arm B on pathological complete response (pCR) rate, pCR rate is the proportion of patients who have no residual viable tumor in the resected specimens., Up to 5 years
This study investigates treatment of durvalumab or placebo therapy combined with FLOT chemotherapy (flurouroacil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin + docetaxel) given before surgery (neoadjuvant) and durvalumab or placebo therapy combined with FLOT chemotherapy after surgery (adjuvant), will work and be safe for the treatment of resectable (removable by surgery) gastric or gastroesophageal cancer, and also to better understand the studied disease and associated health problems.
