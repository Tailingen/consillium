Spearhead 1 Study in Subjects With Advanced Synovial Sarcoma or Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma
This is a study to investigate the efficacy and safety of ADP-A2M4 in HLA-A\*02 eligible and MAGE-A4 positive subjects with metastatic or inoperable (advanced) Synovial Sarcoma (Cohort 1, 2 and 3 ) or MRCLS (Cohort 1) .
Synovial Sarcoma|Myxoid Liposarcoma
GENETIC: afamitresgene autoleucel (previously ADP-A2M4)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Cohort 1), Percentage of participants with confirmed tumor response (complete \[CR\] or partial \[PR\] response) to treatment as assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by Independent Radiologist review (Cohort 1), From T-cell infusion until disease progression/recurrence as of data cut off (up to 2 years). Response was assessed at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24, and every 2 months +/- 28 days until confirmed disease progression.
Adverse Events (AE) Including Serious Adverse Events (SAE), SAE, and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) (Cohort 1), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study participant temporally associated with the use of the study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Therefore, an AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. The number of participants with AEs (including SAE), SAE and AESI including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, ICANS, prolonged cytopenia are presented., AEs, SAEs, and AESIs were collected at each visit from the start of lymphodepletion of the first subject until the last subject discontinued the interventional phase in cohort 1 as of the safety cut off (up to 3.2 years).|The Number of Participants With Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL), The presence of RCL was assessed by qPCR targeting a segment of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) coding sequence., From T-cell infusion to months 3, 6, and 12 post-infusion, then annually post-infusion (up to 2.8 years as of the data cut off).|Insertional Oncogenesis (IO), Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from participants peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples was subjected to lentiviral vector integration site analysis by next-generation sequencing, thus evaluating both the clonality status of the transduced cell population and the genomic localization of individual integration sites. The count of participants with integration sites representing more than 5% of all unique sites is presented., From 10 months post T-cell infusion up to 20 months post T-cell infusion (as of the data cut off)|Best Overall Response (BOR) (Cohort 1), BOR is the best response recorded from the start of T-cell infusion until disease progression/recurrence as assessed by Independent Radiologist review. Response categories are confirmed CR, confirmed PR, stable disease and confirmed progressive disease (PD). Best overall response is a stable disease, if CR or PR are unconfirmed., From T-cell infusion until disease progression/recurrence as of data cut off (up to 2.6 years). Response was assessed at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24, and every 2 months +/- 28 days until confirmed disease progression.|Time to Response (TTR) (Cohort 1), TTR was defined as the interval (weeks) from the date of T-cell infusion to the earliest date of the first documented confirmed CR or confirmed PR as assessed by Independent Radiologist review. TTR (in weeks) = \[date of initial confirmed CR or PR - date of T-cell infusion + 1\]/7., From T-cell infusion until first documented confirmed CR or confirmed PR. Response was assessed at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24, and every 2 months +/- 28 days until confirmed disease progression.|Duration of Response (DoR) (Cohort 1), DoR (in months) is defined as ((date of PD (or censoring) - date of initial confirmed CR/PR + 1)/365.25)\*12 as assessed by Independent Radiologist review.

Outcome Measure not yet reached as participants are ongoing in study, From initial confirmed response (CR or PR) until PD (or censored date) as of data cut off.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Cohort 1), PFS is defined as the time from T-cell infusion to the date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by Independent Radiologist review. PFS (in weeks) was calculated as (date of PD/death \[or censored date\] - first T-cell infusion date + 1)/7., From T-cell infusion until first documented PD or death due to any cause (or censored date), whichever occurs first, as of data cut off (up to 2.6 years). Response was assessed at Week 4, 8,12,16, 24, and every 2 months until confirmed PD|Overall Survival (OS) (Cohort 1), OS is defined as the time from the date of T-cell infusion to the date of death (due to any reason) or censored date. OS in months was calculated as ((death date - first T-cell infusion date + 1)/365.25)\*12.

Outcome Measure not yet reached as participants are ongoing in study, From T-cell infusion to death due to any reason (or censored date) as of data cut off (up to 2.6 years).|Peak Persistence (Cohort 1), Peak persistence of afamitresgene autoleucel cells was reported as vector copy numbers per microgram of genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)., From T-cell infusion to 3.2 years (as of data cut off).|Time Taken to Achieve Peak Expansion of Genetically Engineered T-cells in PBMCs, Time taken to achieve peak expansion of genetically engineered T-cells in PBMCs by flow cytometry, 2.5 years|Quantitation of Genetically Engineered T-cells in PBMCs, Quantitation of genetically engineered T-cells in PBMCs by flow cytometry, 2.5 years|Time Taken to Achieve Peak Expansion of Genetically Engineered T-cells in PBMCs, Time taken to achieve peak expansion of genetically engineered T-cells in PBMCs by qPCR, 2.5 years|In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Assay for Screening, Development and validation of the MAGE-A4 antigen expression companion diagnostic assay, 2.5 years
