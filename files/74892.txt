Study of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) & Heart Failure (HF) Risk in Prostate Cancer Patients, Taking Casodex or Not
A retrospective cohort study performed in the GPRD,UK. All patients with incident prostate cancer identified between 1 Jan 1999 and 31 Dec 2005 and a frequency-matched cohort of the general population will be followed- up for two outcomes; CHD including acute myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease and HF until Dec 31, 2006. Outcomes will be validated through requests to primary care physicians. Incidence rate´ratios of CHD and HF in the two cohorts will be calculated. In the cohort of prostate cancer the relative risk of CHD and HF associated with the use of bicalutamide compared to non-use will be estimated.
