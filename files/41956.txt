Effect of Fasting on the Size of Abdominal Lymphatic Tumors in Women
This study will examine the effect of fasting on lymphangioleiomyomas abdominal tumors formed from enlarged lymph nodes containing lymphatic fluid. Previous studies have determined that these tumors increase in size in the evening, but this result could stem from the fact that previous study participants were tested after eating lunch. The purpose of the study is to help researchers understand the factors that produce changes in size of lymphangioleiomyomas, as well as to improve the ability of medical professionals to diagnose lymphangioleiomyomas and avoid confusing these tumors with other malignant tumors.

Volunteers must be women who are at least 18 years of age and who have been diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomas in the abdominal or pelvic areas. Candidates who have had lung or kidney transplants or who have type 1 diabetes will be excluded. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and medical history.

During the study, participants will be admitted to a National Institutes of Health clinical center for three days to undergo a number of tests. Tests will include routine blood and urine tests, and electrocardiogram, research blood testing, and abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds....
Lymphangioleiomyomas|Tuberous Sclerosis|Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease of women that is characterized by a proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, which leads to cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma, in the axial lymphatics, resulting in lymphangioleiomyomas, and in abdominal angiomyolipomas, primarily in the kidneys. Lymphangioleiomyomas may cause abdominal distension and compress abdominal organs, producing obstipation, bladder obstruction and neurological deficits. Leakage of chyle may be responsible for ascites and pleural effusions. The lymphangioleiomyomas may change in size during the day. This variation in tumor size may be due to increased chyle formation or alterations in lymphatic flow. These studies however, were not performed with research subjects who were fasting. Our hypothesis is that the ingestion of food increases chyle formation and lymphatic flow, which in turn increases the size of the lymphangioleiomyomas. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis. We propose to conduct a study in 30 LAM patients who have lymphangioleiomyomas to determine whether the ingestion of food, by increasing chyle formation and lymphatic flow, increases the size of the lymphangioleiomyomas.
