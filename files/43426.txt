Safety and Effectiveness of BNT327, an Investigational Therapy in Combination With Chemotherapy for Patients With Untreated Small-cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, multisite, randomized, double-blinded study to investigate BNT327 combined with chemotherapy (etoposide/carboplatin) compared to atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy (etoposide/carboplatin) for the treatment of participants with previously untreated extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BNT327|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Carboplatin
Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to approximately 39 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization to first objective tumor progression (progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \[RECIST v1.1\]), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 39 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of participants in whom a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (based on investigator's assessment per RECIST v1.1) is observed as best overall response with confirmation., Up to approximately 39 months|PFS rate based on investigator's assessment, At 6, 12, and 18 months|OS rate, At 6, 12, 18, and 24 months|Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including Grade â‰¥3, serious, and fatal TEAEs by relationship, TEAEs graded according to (US) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), From the first dose of study treatment to the 90-Day Follow-up Visit|Occurrence of dose delay, infusion interruption and discontinuation of study treatment due to TEAEs (including related TEAEs), From first to last dose of study treatment, i.e., up to 2 years|Change from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life Core 30 questionnaire (QLQ-C30) Global Health status/Quality-of-Life score (Items 29 and 30), Global health status/QoL scale ranges in score from 0 to 100 with a high scale score representing a higher response level (e.g., high score for global health status/QoL is high QoL: high score for symptom scale/item is high symptomatology or problems)., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning, Physical functioning scale ranges in score from 0 to 100 with a high scale score representing a higher response level (e.g., high score for functional scale is high/healthy level of functioning)., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in coughing scale of the EORTC quality-of-life-Lung cancer 29 questionnaire (QLQ-LC29), Multi-item coughing scale ranges in score from 0 to 100 with a high score representing a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in shortness of breath scale of the EORTC QLQ-LC29, Multi-item shortness of breath scale ranges in score from 0 to 100 with a high score representing a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in coughed up blood item of the EORTC QLQ-LC29, Single item coughing up blood ranges in score from 0 to 100 with a high score representing a high level of symptomatology or problems., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in fatigue domain score scale of the NSCLC-SAQ, NSCLC-SAQ consists of seven items assessing 5 NSCLC symptom concepts: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and poor appetite. All items have a recall period of past 7 days and a 5-point response scale ranging from 0: "No symptom at all" to 4: "Very severe symptom" or from 0: "Never" to 4: "Always" to measure attributes of symptom intensity or frequency, respectively.

Two fatigue items form a single "Fatigue" domain by calculating their mean. Higher scores indicate more severe symptomatology., Up to approximately 39 months|Change from baseline in pain domain score of the Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ), NSCLC-SAQ consists of seven items assessing 5 NSCLC symptom concepts: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and poor appetite. All items have a recall period of past 7 days and a 5-point response scale ranging from 0: "No symptom at all" to 4: "Very severe symptom" or from 0: "Never" to 4: "Always" to measure attributes of symptom intensity or frequency, respectively.

Two pain items form a single "Pain" domain representing the most severe response of the two items. Higher scores indicate more severe symptomatology., Up to approximately 39 months
The study consists of a screening period (up to 21 days), an induction period followed by a maintenance period (until confirmed disease progression, intolerable toxicity, participant withdrawal, study termination or up to 2 years \[whichever occurs first\]), and a follow-up (FU) period for all participants (2 safety FU visits and survival FU visits).

Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to the treatment arms (Arm 1, Arm 2, and Arm 3), until one arm stops accrual. Participants will then be randomized (1:1) in the remaining two treatment arms (Arm 1 and Arm 2 or Arm 3). The randomization will be stratified based on the following factors:

1. Brain metastases per investigator assessment;
2. Liver metastases per investigator assessment; and
3. Geography.
