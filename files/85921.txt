A Trial of Photodynamic Therapy With HPPH for Treatment of Dysplasia, Carcinoma in Situ and T1 Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity and/or Oropharynx
Recent literature suggests that certain patients with squamous cell cancers of the head and neck region may benefit from photodynamic therapy whether or not they may have received prior therapy, e.g. radiation therapy
Dysplasia|Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity|Carcinoma of the Oropharynx
DRUG: HPPH
Toxicity, To determine the maximally tolerated dose in the oral cavity and/or oropharynx of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using HPPH (2-1 (hexyloxyethyl)-2- devinylpyropheophorbide-a) and 665 nm light., 6 weeks
Tumor response, 3 months|Response of dysplasia, CiS and selected patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx using photodynamic therapy (PDT) with HPPH (2-1 (hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinylpyropheophorbide-a) and 665 nm light., 3 months|Amount of HPPH in the blood prior to light treatment., 3 months|Biomarkers, i.e. STAT3 crosslinks and/or activation status of pro-survival signaling molecules before and after PDT treatment., 3 months|To determine non-invasively HPPH fluorescence and blood flow in To determine non-invasively HPPH fluorescence and blood flow in tumor and surrounding normal tissue before and after PDT, 3 months
We propose to initiate a Phase 1 a clinical trial using HPPH and 665 nm light in patients with cancer of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx, including lesions of moderate to severe dysplasia, squamous carcinoma in situ and T1 squamous cells carcinoma. The study will employ a fixed HPPH dose of 4 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour, and 24 hours later light doses escalating from 100 J/cm2 to 125 and 140 J/cm2, respectively. The primary goal is the determination of the maximally tolerated PDT dose. Preliminary evidence for PDT efficacy wil also be obtained.
