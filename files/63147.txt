Since the advent of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the incidence of blast crises has significantly decreased. Nevertheless, about 5% of patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) will evolve into a blast phase at some point during the course of their disease. Furthermore, despite the advances made in CML treatment, outcome of patients with blast crises are still dismal. Due to the rarity of this condition clinical trials are challenging, and collaboration between researchers both at national and international level is needed to collect a meaningful number of data.
