KEYMAKER-U01 Umbrella Master Study: Studies of Investigational Agents With Either Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Alone or With Pembrolizumab PLUS Chemotherapy in Participants With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-U01/KEYMAKER-U01)
This study is referred to as the "umbrella master protocol" for pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This pembrolizumab NSCLC umbrella master protocol uses a platform design and consists of this master screening study and seven substudies. Each substudy will enroll a different population of NSCLC participants.

The goal of this umbrella master protocol is to screen potential participants with NSCLC for enrollment into 1 of 7 substudies. Participants must first enroll in this pembrolizumab master protocol study and undergo screening for NSCLC that will be used to assign them to participation in 1 of 7 pembrolizumab substudies.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Tumor Imaging|PROCEDURE: Tumor Tissue Collection|PROCEDURE: Blood Sample Collection
Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Expression Level: Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) <1% vs. TPS =1%, Participants' tumors will be evaluated for their PD-L1 tumor expression level using archival tumor tissue samples or newly obtained tumor tissue. The percentage of participants who have a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) \<1% vs. a TPS =1% will be presented., Up to approximately 1 month|Tumor Histology Status: Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) vs. Nonsquamous NSCLC, Participants' tumors will be evaluated for their tumor histology status as being either squamous vs. nonsquamous NSCLC using archival or newly obtained tumor tissue samples. The percentage of participants who have squamous vs. nonsquamous NSCLC will be presented., Up to approximately 1 month
The following 7 pembrolizumab substudies will evaluate the efficacy of different investigational agents in combination with pembrolizumab given in sequence or in combination with pembrolizumab PLUS chemotherapy:
