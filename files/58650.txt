Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit. Sintilimab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), thereby blocking the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands (PD-L1 and PL-L2) and consequently helping to restore the endogenous antitumour T-cell response. In the present study, we design a single-arm, single center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of Anlotinib and Sintilimab in advanced colorectal cancer as first-line treatment.
