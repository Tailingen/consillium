Study of ASTX727 vs IV Decitabine in Participants With MDS, CMML, and AML
Multicenter PK study of ASTX727 versus IV decitabine. Adult participants who were candidates to receive IV decitabine were randomized 1:1 to receive the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5 in Cycle 1 followed by IV decitabine 20 mg/m\^2 Daily×5 in Cycle 2, or the converse order. After completion of PK studies during the first 2 treatment cycles, participants continued to receive treatment with ASTX727 from Cycle 3 onward (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the participants discontinued treatment or withdrew from the study.

This Phase 3 study established PK equivalence of ASTX727 to IV decitabine in approximately 227 evaluable participants. Eligible participants were randomized to receive both study treatments: oral investigational drug ASTX727, and IV decitabine, as follows: participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ASTX727 or IV decitabine in Cycle 1 and then cross over to the other therapy in Cycle 2.

In the ASTX727 cycle, participants received the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5. Serial PK measurements (blood draws) were done on Days 1, 2, and 5, along with pre-dose PK assessments on Days 1-5 and an assessment at 3 hours post-dose on Day 3. Participants were required to fast from food for 4 hours on days when receiving ASTX727: at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after dosing.

In the IV decitabine cycle, participants received a 1-hour infusion of IV decitabine 20 mg/m\^2 Daily×5. Serial PK measurements were done on Days 1 and 5, along with pre-dose and 1-hour post-infusion assessments on Day 3.

In Cycles ≥3, participants received the ASTX727 tablet Daily×5 in 28-day cycles. (No PK assessments were done from Cycle 3 onward.)
