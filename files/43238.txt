Neoadjuvant FOLFOX Therapy With Short Course Radiation and Active Surveillance in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer for complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy without the use of radiation and surgery.
Advanced Rectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOX
Proportion of Patients With a Complete Clinical Response., * A complete response will consist of a digital rectal exam with normal appearing mucosa and sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy with scarring but no nodularity or ulcerations.
* A near complete response will consist of digital rectal exam with smooth or minor mucosal abnormalities, and sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy with small mucosal abnormalities, or superficial ulceration or erythematous scarring.
* Partial response, in our study, will be those tumors read with RECIST version 1.1 criteria with a â‰¥20% decrease in size without obtaining near or complete response.
* Stable disease, in our study, will be those tumors read with RECIST criteria with a \<20% decrease in size without obtaining near or complete response.
* Progressive disease will be those tumors with \>20% increase in size by RECIST version 1.1 criteria on imaging., 1 year
Proportion of Patients With Survival, Will be measured by physical exams, 5 years|Proportion of Patients With Survival, Will be measured by laboratory testing, 5 years|Proportion of Patients With Survival, Will be measured by proctoscopy, 5 years|Proportion of Patients With Survival, Will be measured by sigmoidoscopy, 5 years
These patients will be evaluated for complete clinical response (cCR) after completing 10 cycles of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) chemotherapy, with interval analysis after six cycles. Patients who have stable or progressive disease will be treated per discretion of the treating physician following multidisciplinary discussion. Those determined to have partial or complete response will complete full neoadjuvant treatment and undergo close surveillance with watchful waiting for local recurrence without immediate surgery. The primary endpoint of this study will be the rate of cCR, which is to include complete and near complete clinical response, with secondary endpoints of disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QOL), as well as evaluation of safety and toxicity.
