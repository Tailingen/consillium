T-DM1 and Palbociclib for Metastatic HER2 Breast Cancer
This is a single arm, phase II study to evaluate if the combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib improves progression-free survival in patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. All patients will be treated with T-DM1 with palbociclib.

Estimate Progression-free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of first treatment to the date of investigator-determined objective disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) 1.1 or death from any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Patients who have neither progressed nor died will be censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment (if available) or date of randomization if no post initiation (that is post baseline) radiographic assessment is available., Up to 4 years
Number of Participants With Response, Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR per RECIST 1.1. Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD per RECIST 1.1. The data shown is the number of participants with ORR, DCR, CR, PR, PD, and SD., Up to 4 years|Estimate Overall Survival, Estimate overall survival of T-DM1+Palbociclib treatment regimen. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first treatment to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive are censored at their last contact date., Up to 4 years
This is a multi-center, single arm, phase II study of T-DM1 with palbociclib in the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.

Hypotheses: Combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib improves progression free survival

Primary objective: Progression free survival of the combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib

Secondary objectives i) Response rates ii) Overall survival

Correlative objectives i) Investigate predictive biomarkers of response in blood and archived tumor tissue ii) Investigate mechanisms of resistance for palbociclib in blood and tumor tissue
