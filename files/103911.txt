Assessment of the Impact of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome on Women's Sexuality
This study, titled SexOPK, aims to evaluate the impact of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on women's sexual health. PCOS is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5-20% of women of reproductive age, often leading to hormonal imbalances, metabolic issues, and psychological distress. Despite existing studies on the subject, the level of sexual distress associated with PCOS-related sexual dysfunction remains unclear.

The study will compare sexual function and distress levels between women diagnosed with PCOS and a control group without PCOS. Participants will complete an online questionnaire assessing various aspects of sexual health, body image, anxiety, and depression. The findings may help healthcare professionals better understand and address sexual dysfunction in women with PCOS.
