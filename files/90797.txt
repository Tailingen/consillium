Individualized Elective Neck Irradiation Based on MRI in NPC Patients
Currently, most protocols of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) of various research bodies such as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group require routine elective irradiation to the retropharyngeal area and to levels II-V lymph nodal areas regardless of the status of nodal metastasis. Previous studies had confirmed that the pattern of cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis in NPC followed an orderly manner. Retropharyngeal LNs were the most commonly involved, followed by upper neck levels II, III, or VA nodes, and finally to the lower neck nodes including level IV and VB nodes; and the incidence of LN skip metastasis is rare, ranging from 0.5% to 7.9%. It was rare for NPC patients without neck LN metastases to experience neck failure after elective irradiation to levels II, III and VA. It was also confirmed that with unilateral LN metastases of higher-level LNs usually spread down ipsilateral LNs. Thus, the investigators conduct the non-inferior randomized trial to determine the value of elective neck irradiation in NPC patients with unilateral or bilateral uninvolved neck.

RADIATION: Elective neck irradiation|RADIATION: Whole neck irradiation
Regional relapse-free survival, The regional relapse-free survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for each arm from the date of randomization to the date of nodal relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Their differences will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test., 3 year
Radiation-related toxicity, Acute and late toxicity will be documented according to RTOG/EORTC System and the CTCAE(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). Toxicity will be summarized using descriptive statistics., Within 1 month after radiotherapy for acute toxicity; long term for late toxicity|Overall survival, The overall survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for each arm from the date of randomization to death from any cause. Their differences will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test., 3 year|Local relapse-free survival, The local relapse-free survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for each arm from the date of randomization to documented local relapse or death from any cause. Their differences will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test., 3 year|Distant metastasis-free survival, The distant metastasis-free survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for each arm from the date of randomization to documented distant metastasis or death from any cause. Their differences will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test., 3 year|Patient's quality-of-life: global health status, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Core 30 items (QLQ-C30) version 1.0 questionnaires will be used to assess quality-of-life.
