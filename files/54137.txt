A Trial of TQB2868 Plus Platinum-based Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in the First-line Treatment of Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This study used a single-arm, open phase II multicenter trial design. All eligible subjects received TQB2868 plus platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. A total of 39 subjects will be enrolled.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: TQB2868 injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel injection|DRUG: Cisplatin injection|DRUG: Carboplatin injection|DRUG: Bevacizumab injection
Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieve a prespecified reduction in tumor volume and maintain the minimum time requirement, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., Baseline to CR or PR ,about 12 months
Progression free survival (PFS), The time between the first dose of medication and disease progression (PD) or death before PD; If there was no PD or death before PD, the date of the last imaging assessment was used as the cutoff date., Baseline up to PD or death, about 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period of time, including CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) cases., Baseline up to PD or death, about 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), It refers to the time between the first assessment of the tumor as CR or PR to PD or death before PD in subjects with CR or PR; If subjects with CR or PR did not present with PD or die before PD, the date of the last imaging assessment was used as the cutoff date., Baseline up to PD or death, about 24 months|Overall survival (OS), The time from the first treatment to death from any cause., Baseline up to die, about 36 months|PFS rate (≥6 months), The proportion of patients alive and free of disease progression from the beginning of the first treatment to 6 months., Baseline up to PD or death, about 24 months|Adverse event rate, Occurrence of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs), and immune-related adverse events (IRaes)., Baseline to the end of the study, about 2 years|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ -C30), For questions 1 to 28, choose a number from 1 to 4, where 1 means no and 4 means very good. For questions 29 and 30, choose a number from 1 to 7, where 1 means very poor and 7 means very good., Baseline to the end of the study, about 2 years|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ -CX24), EORTC QLQ-CX24 is a questionnaire for measuring the quality of life of patients with cervical cancer. It has 24 items, including 3 multi-dimensional dimensions of symptoms, body image and sexual/vaginal function, and 6 single-dimensional dimensions of sexual activity, sexual enjoyment, sexual anxiety, lymphedema, menopausal symptoms and peripheral neuropathy. "None" to "very" were scored from 1 to 4, and the score was inversely proportional to the quality of life., Baseline to the end of the study, about 2 years|EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health questionnaire, EQ-5D is a simple health measure developed by the European Society for Quality of Life. The EQ-5D mainly consists of two parts: the EQ-5D description system and the EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D description system describes the health status in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-VAS is to record the self-rated health status of the respondents. The scale is 0-100, with 0 being "worst imagined health" and 100 being "best imagined health.", Baseline to the end of the study, about 2 years|PD-L1 and TGF-β expression, PD-1/TGF-β double antibody can increase Leukocyte differentiation antigen 8 (CD8+) T cells in the tumor, reduce immunosuppressive myeloid cells, and inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on the basis of targeting and neutralizing TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment, which can restore the activity of T cells, enhance the immune response, and more effectively improve the inhibition of tumor., At baseline|Human papillomavirus (HPV) expression, The relationship between human papillomavirus and cervical cancer is very close. Persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus is one of the high risk factors for cervical cancer., At baseline
