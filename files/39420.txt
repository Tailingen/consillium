Predicting Risk for Post-polypectomy Colorectal Cancer
This originated as an observational study of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) patients with a history of adenoma diagnosed by colonoscopy who received a subsequent surveillance colonoscopy between 2014 and 2019. The original goal of the study was to develop a risk prediction model that would help identify patients at highest risk for a diagnosis of advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer and/or advanced adenoma) at or within 6 months following their surveillance colonoscopy. Candidate predictors of interest included patient demographics, medical history, and details related to the index colonoscopy. The investigators are now at the implementation stage and applying the risk prediction model to patients awaiting surveillance colonoscopy at select KPNC service areas to help identify those at highest risk for colorectal cancer based on their risk scores.

DEVICE: Logistic regression risk model
Rates of colorectal neoplasia per number of colonoscopies performed, The investigators anticipate observing changed rates of colorectal neoplasia per number of colonoscopies performed on account of prioritizing higher risk patients., 1 year
In the implementation stage, the risk prediction model is being applied to patients who are awaiting surveillance colonoscopy at select KPNC service areas to help identify those at highest risk for colorectal cancer based on their risk scores. The prediction model is being used in 2-3 service area to identify about 60-80 patients per month who are at highest risk for colorectal cancer based on their risk scores. Risk scores represent one of a number of factors being considered for prioritizing patients for colonoscopy.
