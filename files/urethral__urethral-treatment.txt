Incidence and Mortality
Urethral cancer is rare.  The annual incidence rate for urethral cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database from 1973 to 2002 in the United States was 4.3 per million for men and 1.5 per million for women,  with downward trends over the three decades.[
1
] The incidence was twice as high in African American individuals as in White individuals (5 per million vs. 2.5 per million).  Urethral cancers appear to be associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly HPV16, a strain known to cause cervical cancer.[
2
,
3
]
Because urethral cancer is rare, nearly all information about its treatment and the outcomes of therapy is derived from retrospective, single-center case series, which represents a very low
Level of evidence C3
.   Most information comes from cases accumulated over many decades at major academic centers.
Anatomy
The female urethra is largely contained within the anterior vaginal wall.  In adults, it is about 4 cm in length.
The male urethra, which averages about 20 cm in length, is divided into distal and proximal portions. The distal urethra, which extends from the tip of the penis to just before the prostate, includes the meatus, the fossa navicularis, the penile or pendulous urethra, and the bulbar urethra. The proximal  urethra, which extends from the bulbar urethra to the bladder neck, includes the membranous urethra and the prostatic urethra.

An inset shows the renal tubules and urine. Also shown are the prostate and penis (left panel) and the uterus (right panel). Urine is made in the renal tubules and collects in the renal pelvis of each kidney. The urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters to the bladder. The urine is stored in the bladder until it leaves the body through the urethra.
Prognosis
The prognosis of urethral cancer depends on the following factors:[
4
-
6
]
Anatomical location.
Size.
Stage.
Depth of invasion.
Superficial tumors in the distal urethra in both women and men are generally curable.  However, deeply invasive lesions are rarely curable by any combination of therapies.
In men, the prognosis of tumors in the distal (pendulous) urethra is better than for tumors of the proximal (bulbomembranous) and prostatic urethra, which tend to present at more advanced stages.[

] Likewise, distal urethral tumors tend to occur at earlier stages in women and to have a better prognosis than proximal tumors.[

Cellular Classification of Urethral Cancer
In an analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data from 1973 to 2002, the most common histological types of urethral cancer were the following:[
1
]
Transitional cell (55%).
Squamous cell (21.5%).
Adenocarcinoma (16.4%).
Other cell types, such as melanoma, were extremely rare.[
1
]
The female urethra is lined by transitional cell mucosa proximally and
stratified squamous cells distally.  Therefore, transitional cell carcinoma is most common in the proximal urethra, and squamous cell carcinoma predominates
in the distal urethra.  Adenocarcinoma may occur in both locations and arises
from metaplasia of the numerous periurethral glands.
The male urethra is lined by transitional cells in its prostatic and membranous
portion and stratified columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium in
the bulbous and penile portions.  The submucosa of the urethra contains
numerous glands.  Therefore, urethral cancer in men can manifest the
histological characteristics of transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.
Except for the prostatic urethra, where transitional cell carcinoma is most
common, squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histology of urethral
neoplasms.  Because transitional cell carcinoma of the prostatic urethra may be associated with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and/or
transitional cell carcinoma arising in prostatic ducts, it is often treated similarly to these primaries and should be separated from
the more distal carcinomas of the urethra.

Treatment Option Overview for Urethral Cancer
In This Section
Surgery
Radiation Therapy
Chemotherapy
Fluorouracil dosing
Information about the treatment of urethral cancer and the outcomes of therapy is derived from retrospective, single-center case series and represents a very low
Level of evidence C3
.  Most of this information comes from the small numbers of cases accumulated over many decades at major academic centers.  Therefore, the treatment in these reports is usually not standardized and spans eras of shifting supportive care practices.  Because urethral cancer is rare, its treatment may also reflect extrapolation from the management of other urothelial malignancies, such as bladder cancer in the case of transitional cancers and anal cancer in the case of squamous cell carcinomas.
Surgery
Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for urethral cancers in both women and men.[
Level of evidence C3
]  The surgical approach depends on tumor stage and anatomic location, and tumor grade plays a less important role in treatment decisions.[
1
,
2
] Although the traditional recommendation has been to achieve a 2-cm tumor-free margin, the optimal surgical margin has not been rigorously studied and is not well defined.  The role of lymph node dissection is not clear in the absence of clinical involvement, and the role of prophylactic dissection is controversial.[
2
]  Radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may be added in some cases in patients with extensive disease or in an attempt at organ preservation. However, there are no clear guidelines for patient selection, and the low level of evidence precludes confident conclusions about their incremental benefit.[
2
,
3
]
Ablative techniques, such as transurethral resection, electroresection and fulguration, or laser vaporization-coagulation, are used to preserve organ function in cases of superficial anterior tumors, although the supporting literature is scant.[
2
]
Radiation Therapy
External-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or a combination is sometimes used as the primary therapy for early-stage proximal urethral cancers, particularly in women.[
Level of evidence C3
]  Brachytherapy may be delivered with low-dose-rate iridium Ir 192 sources using a template or urethral catheter.  Definitive radiation is also sometimes used for advanced-stage tumors, but because monotherapy of large tumors has shown poor tumor control, it is more frequently incorporated into combined modality therapy after surgery or with chemotherapy.[
4
]  There are no head-to-head comparisons of these various approaches, and patient selection may explain differences in outcomes among the regimens.[
Level of evidence C3
]
The most commonly used tumor doses are in the range of 60 Gy to 70 Gy.  Severe complication rates for definitive radiation therapy are about 16% to 20% and include fistula development, especially for large tumors invading the vagina, bladder, or rectum.  Urethral strictures also occur in the setting of urethral-sparing treatment.  Toxicity rates increase at doses greater than 65 Gy to 70 Gy.  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy has become more common in an attempt to decrease local morbidity of the radiation.[
4
]
Chemotherapy
The literature on chemotherapy for urethral carcinoma is anecdotal in nature and restricted to retrospective, single-center case series or case reports.[
5
][
Level of evidence C3
]  A wide variety of agents used alone or in combination have been reported over the years, and their use has  largely been extrapolated from experience with other urinary tract tumors.
For squamous cell cancers, agents that have been used in penile cancer or anal carcinoma include the following:[
3
,
5
]
Cisplatin.
Fluorouracil.
Bleomycin.
Methotrexate.
Irinotecan.
Gemcitabine.
Paclitaxel.
Docetaxel.
Mitomycin.
Chemotherapy for transitional cell urethral tumors is extrapolated from experience with transitional cell bladder tumors and, therefore, usually contains the following:[
1
,
4
-
7
]
Methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.
Paclitaxel.
Carboplatin.
Ifosfamide, with occasional complete responses.
Chemotherapy has been used alone for metastatic disease or in combination with radiation therapy and/or surgery for locally advanced urethral cancer.  It may be used in the neoadjuvant setting with radiation therapy in an attempt to increase the resectability rate or to preserve organs.[
3
]  However, the impact of any of these regimens on survival is not known for any stage or setting.
Fluorouracil dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
8
,
9
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
8
-
10
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
11
-
13
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
14
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Female Distal Urethral Cancer
If the malignancy is at or just within the meatus and superficial parameters (stage 0/Tis,
Ta), open excision or electroresection and fulguration may be possible.  Tumor
destruction using neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) or CO
2
laser vaporization-coagulation represents an
alternative option.  For large lesions (T1) and more invasive lesions (T2), brachytherapy or a combination of brachytherapy and
external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) are  alternatives to surgical resection of the distal third of
the urethra.  Patients with T3 distal urethral lesions or lesions that recur after treatment with
local excision or radiation therapy require anterior
exenteration and urinary diversion.
If inguinal lymph nodes are palpable, frozen section confirmation of a tumor should be
obtained.  If positive for malignancy, ipsilateral lymph node dissection is indicated.  If no
inguinal adenopathy exists, lymph node dissection is not generally performed, and the nodes are monitored clinically.
Treatment options for female distal urethral cancer include the following:
Open excision and organ-sparing conservative surgical therapy.[
1
]
Ablative techniques, such as transurethral resection,  electroresection and fulguration, or laser vaporization-coagulation (Tis, Ta, T1 lesions).[
2
,

]
EBRT, brachytherapy, or a combination of  the two (T1, T2 lesions).[
4
]
Anterior exenteration with or without preoperative radiation and diversion
(T3 lesions or recurrent lesions).[

,
3
]
The level of evidence for these treatment options is
Level of evidence C3
.
Treatment Options for Male Distal Urethral Cancer
If the malignancy is in the pendulous urethra and is superficial, there is  potential
for long-term disease-free survival.  In the rare cases that involve mucosa only (Tis, Ta),
resection and fulguration may be used.  For infiltrating
lesions in the fossa navicularis, amputation of the glans penis may be adequate
treatment.  For lesions involving more proximal portions of the distal urethra,
excision of the involved segment of the urethra, preserving the penile corpora,
may be feasible for superficial tumors.  Penile amputation is used for infiltrating lesions. Traditionally, a 2-cm margin proximal to the tumor is used, but the optimal margin has not been well studied. Local recurrences after amputation
are rare.
The role of radiation therapy in the treatment of anterior urethral
carcinoma in men is not well defined.  Some anterior urethral cancers have
been cured with radiation alone or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[
4
,
5
]
If inguinal lymph nodes are palpable, ipsilateral node dissection is indicated after
frozen section confirmation of a tumor because a cure is still achievable with limited
regional nodal metastases.  If no inguinal adenopathy exists, lymph node dissection
is not generally performed, and the nodes are monitored clinically.
Treatment options for male distal urethral cancer include the following:
Open-excision and organ-sparing conservative surgery.[

Ablative techniques, such as transurethral resection, electroresection and fulguration, or laser vaporization-coagulation (Tis, Ta, T1 lesions).[

Amputation of the penis (T1, T2, T3 lesions).
Radiation (T1, T2, T3 lesions, if amputation is refused).[

Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Female Proximal Urethral Cancer
Lesions of the proximal urethra or the entire length of the urethra are usually associated with invasion
and a high incidence of pelvic nodal metastases.  The prospects for cure are
limited except in the case of small tumors.  The best results have been
achieved with exenterative surgery and urinary diversion, with 5-year survival rates
ranging from 10% to 20%.
In an effort to shrink tumor margins, increase the resectability rate of gross tumor, and decrease local recurrence,  adjunctive preoperative radiation
therapy is a reasonable option.  Pelvic
lymphadenectomy is performed concomitantly.  Ipsilateral inguinal lymph node dissection is
indicated only if biopsy specimens of ipsilateral palpable adenopathy are positive on a
frozen section.  For tumors that do not exceed 2 cm in greatest
dimension, radiation alone, nonexenterative surgery alone, or a combination
of the two may be sufficient to provide an excellent outcome.
It is reasonable to consider removal of
part of the pubic symphysis and the inferior pubic rami to maximize the
surgical margin and reduce local recurrence.  The perineal closure
and vaginal reconstruction can be accomplished with the use of myocutaneous
flaps.
The prognosis of female urethral cancer is related to the size of the
lesion at presentation.  For lesions smaller  than 2 cm in diameter, a 5-year survival rate of 60% can be anticipated. For lesions larger than 4 cm in
diameter, the 5-year survival rate falls to 13%.
Treatment options for female proximal urethral cancer include the following:
Preoperative radiation followed by anterior exenteration and urinary
diversion with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, with or without inguinal lymph node
dissection.[
1
]
For tumors that do not exceed 2 cm in greatest dimension,
radiation alone, nonexenterative surgery alone, or a combination of the two may be
sufficient to provide an excellent outcome.[

Treatment Options for Male Proximal Urethral Cancer
Lesions of the bulbomembranous urethra require radical cystoprostatectomy and
en bloc penectomy to achieve adequate margins of resection, minimize local
recurrence, and achieve long-term, disease-free survival.  Pelvic lymphadenectomy is also performed because  of the high incidence of positive lymph nodes and the limited added
morbidity.
Despite extensive surgery, local recurrence is common,  and this event is invariably associated with eventual death from
the disease.  Five-year survival rates are only 15% to 20%. 
In an effort to shrink tumor margins, the use of preoperative adjunctive
radiation therapy may be considered.  In an effort to increase the surgical
margins of dissection, resection of the inferior pubic rami and the lower
portion of the pubic symphysis has been used.  Urinary diversion is
required.[

]
Ipsilateral inguinal lymph node dissection is indicated if palpable ipsilateral
inguinal adenopathy is found on physical examination and confirmed to be
neoplasm by frozen section.
Treatment options for male proximal urethral cancer include the following:
Preoperative radiation or combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by cystoprostatectomy, urinary diversion, and
penectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, with or without inguinal lymph node
dissection.[

Treatment of Urethral Cancer Associated With Invasive Bladder Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Approximately 10% (range, 4%–17%) of patients who undergo cystectomy for bladder cancer can be
expected to have or to later develop clinical neoplasm of the urethra distal to
the urogenital diaphragm.
Factors associated with the risk of urethral recurrence after cystectomy include the following:[
1
,
2
]
Tumor multiplicity.
Papillary pattern.
Carcinoma
in situ
.
Tumor location at the bladder neck.
Prostatic urethral mucosal or stromal involvement.
The benefits of urethrectomy at the time of cystectomy need to be weighed
against the morbidity factors, which include added operating time, hemorrhage, and the
potential for perineal hernia.  Tumors found incidentally on
pathological examination are much more likely to be superficial or
in situ
in
contrast to those that present with clinical symptoms at a later date, when 
the likelihood of invasion within the corporal bodies is high.  The former
lesions are often curable, and the latter are only rarely so.  Indications for
urethrectomy in continuity with cystoprostatectomy are the following:
Visible tumor in the urethra.
Positive swab cytology of the urethra.
Positive margins of the membranous urethra on frozen section taken at the
time of cystoprostatectomy.
Multiple
in situ
bladder tumors that extend onto the bladder
neck and proximal prostatic urethra.
If the urethra is not removed at the time of cystectomy, follow-up
includes periodic cytologic evaluation of saline urethral washings.[

Treatment options for urethral cancer associated with invasive bladder cancer include the following:
In continuity cystourethrectomy.
Monitor urethral cytology and delayed urethrectomy, if necessary.

Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent Urethral Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Local recurrences of urethral cancer may be amenable to local modality therapy with radiation or surgery, with or without chemotherapy.  For more information, see the
Treatment Option Overview for Urethral Cancer
section. Metastatic disease may be treated with regimens in common use for other urothelial transitional cell or squamous cell carcinomas, or anal carcinomas, depending on the histology.[

Treatment options for metastatic or recurrent urethral cancer include the following:
Surgical excision of locally recurrent urethral cancer after radiation therapy should be considered, if feasible.
Combination radiation therapy and wider surgical resection should be considered for locally recurrent urethral cancer after surgery alone.
Clinical trials using chemotherapy should be considered for metastatic urethral cancer. Transitional cell cancer of the urethra may respond favorably to the same chemotherapy regimens used for advanced transitional cell cancer of the bladder.[
