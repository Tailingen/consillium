Study of Boserolimab (MK-5890) as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-5890-001)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of boserolimab (MK-5890) when administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced solid tumors. The initial course of boserolimab monotherapy or boserolimab plus pembrolizumab combination therapy will be for up to 35 administrations (approximately 2 years). The safety and pharmacokinetics of boserolimab when administered with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin in adults with non squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and boserolimab when administered with pembrolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in adults with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will also be assessed.
