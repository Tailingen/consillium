Study About Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Non Cutaneous Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
This is a multicenter randomized trial evaluating induction treatment with VIP-reinforced-ABVD (VIP-rABVD) versus CHOP/21 in patients with newly diagnosed peripheral T cell lymphoma.
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: CHOP21|DRUG: VIP/ABVD|RADIATION: Radiotherapy consolidation
Comparison between EFS rate of CHOP/21 versus VIP-rABVD in newly diagnosed PTCL., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), 6 years|response rate at the end of the treatment, 6-8 months|progression free survival (PFS), 6 years|hematotoxicity, 6 months
Induction therapy:

ARM 1: 6 Chemotherapy courses = 3 VIP alternated with 3 ABVD ARM 2: 8 Chemotherapy courses = CHOP every 21 days

Consolidation therapy:

For all patients if CR = radiotherapy 40GY / 5X1,8 GY per week
