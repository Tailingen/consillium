A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Camrelizumab Plus Radiotherapy for Patients With Early Triple-Negative Breast
This is a open-labeled, single-arm, Investigator-initiated clinical trial of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with radiotherapy in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer. We will enroll 60 subjects. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of early TNBCã€‚
Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab|RADIATION: radiotherapy
Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), time from surgery to the first documented occurrence of an event, defined as: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, Distant recurrence, Contralateral invasive breast cancer, Death from any cause, 3 years|Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), time from surgery to the first documented occurrence of an event, defined as: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, Distant recurrence, Contralateral invasive breast cancer, Death from any cause, 5years
Overall survival (OS), time from randomization to death from any cause, 5years|disease-free survival (DFS), The time between randomization and recurrence of disease or (for any reason) death., 5 years
This trial is a prospective, multi-center, and exploratory clinical study, taking the Cancer Hospital of Jiangxi province as the lead unit, combined with breast cancer diagnosis and treatment norms, multi-center collaborative research to explore the iDFS of radiotherapy combined with carilizumab for triple-negative breast cancer of different subtypes and provide optimal personalized treatment options.
