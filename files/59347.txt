Stereotactic Radiation & Abemaciclib in the Management of HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer Brain Metastases
This is a single arm study of abemaciclib and endocrine therapy with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) among patients with hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer brain metastases.
Brain Metastases|HR+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)|DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Endocrine therapy
Intracranial Progression Free Survival (PFS), Intracranial Progression Free Survival: defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to investigator-determined date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Progression will be determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) Criteria., Up to 12 months
Intracranial local brain tumor control, Intracranial local brain tumor control following SRS and abemaciclib will be determined from irradiated lesions according to RANO-BM criteria., Up to 12 months|Intracranial distant brain tumor control, Intracranial distant brain tumor control following SRS and abemaciclib will determined by the development of new lesions outside of the irradiated area., Up to 12 months|Extracranial Progression Free Survival, Extracranial Progression Free Survival: Time from the date of start of treatment to the investigator determined date of progression (determined by RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment to death due to any cause., Up to 12 months
The study is designed as a prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I/II trial of abemaciclib and endocrine therapy with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) among patients with hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer brain metastases. Treatment will be initiated with one week of abemaciclib followed by stereotactic radiation to sites of brain metastases or post-operative cavities with continued abemaciclib. Safety will be monitored initially by a 3+3 design. This will be followed by a phase 2 study to evaluate intracranial progression free survival (PFS). If unexpected neurologic toxicities are noted, the dose of radiation therapy will be modified.
