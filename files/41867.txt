Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy With Transrectal Specimen Extraction for Colon Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the preliminary surgical outcomes of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with transrectal specimen extraction. The hypothesis is that this type of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) could achieve good short-term and oncological outcomes for right colon cancer patients.
Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with transrectal specimen extraction
The rate of postoperative complications, The rate of postoperative complications = patients with any postoperative complications/all cases., up to 30 days
Operating time, Operating time = The Operative time was defined as the time first skin incision was made to final skin closure, up to 1 days|Estimated blood loss, Estimated blood loss = The sum of the blood in the suction canister (the total volume after subtracting the amount of irrigation fluid used) and the segment of increased weight of swabs used during operation phase (1 ml of blood is about weighs 1g), up to 1 days|The time of first flatus, The time of first flatus = The time of first flatus reported by patients, up to 5 days|Postoperative hospitalization, Postoperative hospitalization = the number of nights from surgery to discharge, up to 30 days
This study is a prospective single-arm clinical study. 37 patients with right colon cancer undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with transrectal specimen extraction are planned to be included in the study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the preliminary surgical outcomes of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with transrectal specimen extraction. The primary endpoint is the postoperative complications of this type of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES). The primary hypothesis is that NOSES could reduce postoperative complications. In addition, operating time, intraoperative bleeding, post-operative recovery and quality of life (QoL) are secondary endpoints.
