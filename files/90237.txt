Study of Magrolimab in Combination With Azacitidine Versus Physician's Choice of Venetoclax in Combination With Azacitidine or Intensive Chemotherapy in Patients With TP53 Mutant Acute Myeloid Leukemia That Have Not Been Treated
The goal of this clinical study is to compare the effectiveness of the study drugs, magrolimab in combination with azacitidine, versus venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in participants with previously untreated TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Magrolimab|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin|DRUG: Idarubicin|DRUG: Steroidal Eye Drops
Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Appropriate for Non-intensive Therapy, OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Deaths which were not observed during the study were censored at their last known alive date.

Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years
Overall Survival in All Participants, OS was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Deaths which were not observed during the study were censored at their last known alive date.

KM estimates were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Event-Free Survival (EFS) in All Participants, EFS: time from randomization to earliest relapse from CR (CR without minimal residual disease (CRMRD-) and CR with MRD positive/MRD unknown (CRMRD+/unk)), treatment failure (failure to achieve CR in 6 months of magrolimab/venetoclax+azacitidine; 2 months after chemotherapy), or death within the response window. CRMRD- and CRMRD+/unk: neutrophils \>1.0 ×10\^9/L, platelets \>100 ×10\^9/L, \<5% bone marrow blasts, no circulating blasts or extramedullary disease (confirmed by flow cytometry \<0.1% sensitivity for CRMRD-). Post-SCT assessments or new AML therapies were included. Date of randomization was assigned as event date for participants with treatment failure. Participants without events were censored at their last assessment. KM estimates were used for analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Rate of Complete Remission (CR) in All Participants, The rate of CR was the percentage of participants who achieved a CR, including CR without minimal residual disease (CR MRD-) and CR with positive or unknown minimal residual disease (CR MRD+/unk) within 6 months of treatment with magrolimab + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine, or within 2 months of treatment with 7 + 3 chemotherapy, as defined by investigators based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) 2017 AML (ELN 2017 AML) with modifications, while on study prior to initiation of any new anti-AML therapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) within the response assessment window of 2.1 years. CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk are defined in Outcome Measure#3 (EFS). Percentages were rounded-off.

Clopper-Pearson method were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Rate of CR Without Minimal Residual Disease (CR MRD-) in All Participants, Rate of CR MRD- was the percentage of participants who achieve a CR MRD- within 6 months treatment with magrolimab + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine, or within 2 months of treatment with 7 + 3 chemotherapy, as defined by investigators based on ELN 2017 AML with modifications, while on study prior to initiation of any new anti-AML therapy or SCT within the response assessment window of 2.1 years. CR MRD- is defined in Outcome Measure #3 (EFS). Percentages were rounded-off.

Clopper-Pearson method were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Rate of CR and CR With Partial Hematologic Recovery (CR+CRh) in All Participants, The CR+CRh rate was the percentage of participants who achieved a CR (including CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk) or CRh as defined by CR with partial platelet and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within 6 months of treatment with magrolimab + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine, or within 2 months of treatment with 7 + 3 chemotherapy while on study prior to initiation of any new anti-AML therapy or SCT up to the response assessment window of 2.1 years. CRh is defined as neutrophils \> 0.5 x 10\^9/L; platelets \> 50 x 10\^9/L; bone marrow blasts \< 5%; Absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease. CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk are defined in Outcome Measure#3 (EFS). Percentages were rounded-off.

Clopper-Pearson method were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Duration of CR (DCR), DCR was measured from the time the assessment criteria were first met for CR (including CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk) within 6 months of treatment with magrolimab + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine, or within 2 months of treatment with 7 + 3 chemotherapy, until the first date of AML relapse or death (including assessments post SCT). Participants who were not observed to have relapsed disease or death while on study were censored at the date of their last response assessment with no evidence of relapse. Participants who started taking new anti-AML therapies (excluding post-SCT maintenance therapy) before relapse, the DCR were censored at the last response assessment before the initiation of the new anti-AML therapies. CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk are defined in Outcome Measure#3 (EFS).

KM estimates were used in outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Duration of CR+CRh, Duration of CR+CRh was measured from the time the assessment criteria were first met for CR (including CR MRD- and CR MRD+/unk) or CRh within 6 months of treatment with magrolimab + azacitidine or venetoclax + azacitidine, or within 2 months of treatment with 7 + 3 chemotherapy, until the first date of AML relapse or death (including assessments post SCT). Participants who were not observed to have relapsed disease or death while on study were censored at the date of their last response assessment with no evidence of relapse. Participants who started taking new anti-AML therapies (excluding post-SCT maintenance therapy) before relapse, the duration of CR + CRh were censored at the last response assessment before the initiation of the new anti-AML therapies. CR MRD- and CR MRD+/un are defined in Outcome Measure #3. CRh is defined in Outcome Measure #6.

KM estimates were used for outcome measure analysis., Up to 2.1 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Grade ≥ 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs were defined as any AE that began on or after the date of first dose of study treatment up to the date of last dose of study treatment plus 70 days or the day before initiation of new anti-AML therapy including SCT, whichever occurred first. Percentages were rounded-off., First dose date up to 1.3 years plus 70 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Grade 3 or 4 Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increased at least 1 toxicity grade from baseline at any postbaseline time point, up to and including the date of last dose of study treatment plus 70 days or the day before initiation of any new anti-AML therapy including SCT, whichever occurred first. Percentages were rounded-off., First dose date up to 1.3 years plus 70 days|Serum Concentration of Magrolimab, Predose on Days 1, 4, 8, 11; Days 29 and 57 Predose and 1 hour Postdose; Predose on Days 113, 169, 253, 281 and 337|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Magrolimab Antibodies, Percentages were rounded-off., Up to 2 years
