A Study of Epacadostat and Nivolumab in Combination With Immune Therapies in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies (ECHO-208)
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of epacadostat when given in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and in combination with nivolumab and lirilumab, in participant with advanced or metastatic malignancies.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Epacadostat|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Lirilumab
Phase 1: Percentage of Participants With At Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study treatment. AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a participant provides informed consent., Screening through up to 100 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed objective response (OR). Confirmed OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of treatment (Up to Month 24)

Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline; or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of treatment (Up to Month 24)|Phase 1: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of combination therapy until the earliest date at which progression criteria are met as determined by investigator evaluation of radiographic disease assessment per RECIST v1.1, or date of death due to any cause. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study including baseline; or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of treatment (Up to Month 24)|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the earliest date of CR or PR until the earliest date at which progression criteria are met as determined by investigator evaluation of radiographic disease assessment per RECIST v1.1, or date of death due to any cause.

AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a participant provides informed consent., Screening through up to 100 days for treatment Group A and 150 days for treatment Group B after end of treatment, up to approximately 24 months
