Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With PISOXO for Locally-invaded-gastric Cancer (LIGC)
The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of PIPAC+SOX+OLAPARIB for locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC) patients in China. To obtain preliminary results for designing a new phase II/III randomized controlled trial.

Peritoneal metastases is the main cause of relapse and death after surgery in patients with serosa positive or locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC). Recent researches showed that PIPAC and Olaparib are effective to control peritoneal metastases in different malignant diseases but it has not been tested for gastric cancer patients. The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of PIPAC+SOX+OLAPARIB for locally-invaded-gastric cancer (LIGC) patients in China. To obtain preliminary results for designing a new phase II/III randomized controlled trial.
