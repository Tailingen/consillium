Patient-physician communication, The communication between patient and physician will be assessed with EORTC QLQ-COMU26. Presumably some patients have privacy concerns with electronic questionnaires. The EORTC-COMU26 is the most important questionnaire in this study because it is needed for the primary endpoint. It contains sensitive questions about how the patient experiences the communication during the visit. In order to avoid patients not filling out the questionnaire due to privacy concerns or being afraid of giving an honest opinion and the physician could read it electronically, the EORTC QLQ-COMU26 is paper-based and the patients can hand them in in the study office., Up to six months
