A Study of A166 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I study evaluating A166 in patients with HER2-expressing locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: A166
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with CR and PR assessed by investigators according to RECIST v 1.1, up to 24 month
Duration of Response (DOR), From the date that response criteria are first met to the first occurrence of PD as determined by the investigators according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 24 month|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS, defined as the active comparator arm frist dosing of A166 injection to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigators according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 24 month|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from randomization to death or lose of follow, whichever occurs first, up to 24 month
The first stage will determine the recommended stage 2 dose (RS2D) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing solid tumors based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and antitumor activity. The second stage will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and antitumor activity in dose-expansion cohorts (RS2D:3.6 mg/kg, 4.8 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg dose groups).
