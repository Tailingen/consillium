INJECT: A Pilot Study of Intra-tumoral Injections in Metastatic Urological Cancers
The purpose of this study is to plan for future clinical trials in patients with metastatic urological cancers. Diluted iodinated contrast will be injected intra-tumorally under CT fluoroscopy guidance into bone, lymph node, soft tissue and liver metastases in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer, urothelial carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma. Pre- and post-injection CT images will be obtained to determine the injection parameters needed for optimal distribution throughout metastases of a given size. A biopsy of the metastatic site will also be obtained to validate expression of the receptor CD155.
