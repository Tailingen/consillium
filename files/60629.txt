Phase I Study of HBT-708 for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and inital efficacy of HBT-708 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HBT-708
Number of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and dose-limiting toxicities, Adverse event were defined as the appearance of undesirable signs, symptoms, or medical conditions that occurred after informed consent., up to 24 months (every cycle visit, each cycle is 21 days)|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the maximum administration dose, Adverse events were defined as the appearance of undesirable signs, symptoms, or medical conditions that occurred after a participant provided informed consent., up to 24 months (every cycle visit, each cycle is 21 days)
the plasma concentration of HBT-708, PK parameters will be calculated from the blood plasma concentrations of HBT-708 using standard noncompartmental PK methods., Cycle1Day1, Cycle1Day2, Cycle1Day4, Cycle1Day8, Cycle1Day15; Cycle2 Day1; Cycle3 Day1, Cycle3Day2, Cycle3Day4, Cycle3Day8, Cycle3Day15; then Day 1 of every 2 cycles ( each cycle is 21 days)
This study is a study of HBT-708 monotherapy in advanced solid tumors. This study includes dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohort, with the accelerated titration combined 3+3 dose escalation method. The administration frequencies of HBT-708 is Q3W i.v. All cohorts will assess the efficacy and safety of the preset several dose levels of HBT-708 in advanced solid tumors.
