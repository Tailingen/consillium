A Study of ARRY-382 in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARRY-382 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Part A/Phase 1b); and to estimate the efficacy of the combination in three separate cohorts: 1) patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed on prior PD-1/PD-L1inhibitors, 2) patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and 3) patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).
