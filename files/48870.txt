Online Adaptive Radiotherapy for Postoperative Treatment of Endometrial and Cervical Cancer
Online adaptive radiotherapy (oART) has demonstrated to be feasible to reduce planning target volume (PTV) margins for postoperative treatment of endometrial and cervical cancer. To explore the value of reduced margins in oART for postoperative treatment of endometrial and cervical cancer, we conducted a prospective clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy and toxicity of reduced margins.

This is an investigator-initiated efficacious, single-center, open-label clinical trial study. This study hypothesizes that the use of reduced PTV margins in oART for postoperative treatment of endometrial and cervical cancer could decrease toxicity and achieve more accurate dosimetric coverage. A dose of 45 or 50.4 Gy is delivered to clinical target volume (CTV) with reduced margin oART. Patients receive cisplatin based concurrent chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is acute toxicity. The first 10 patients were included in the study that have demonstrated the feasibility of reducing the margin (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05682950).
