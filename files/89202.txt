Irinotecan/Cisplatin, Potentially Curative Surgery With or Without Floxuridine, Followed by Capecitabine for Stomach and Gastro-esophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancers
This study is to determine whether intraperitoneal (IP) Floxuridine is effective in the patients with advanced stomach or gastro-esophageal junction cancers in the treatment consisting of pre- and post-surgery chemotherapies.

Number of Patients With One-year Recurrence-free Survival, This is defined as the patients who did not have recurrence of cancer at 1 year since the start of induction chemotherapy., 1 year
Overall Survival Rate; Toxicity; Evaluation of Sites of Relapse of Failing Patients, Secondary outcome measure was not analyzed as study was terminated, every 4 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, then every 12 months for up to 10 years
A previous Phase-II trial conducted by the same principle investigator(s), utilizing preoperative chemotherapy and intraperitoneal consolidation, was conducted in patients with locally advanced, potentially resectable gastric cancer or cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), both staged as T3N0, T4N0, any TN1 or TN2 disease. The data suggest that for patients with locally advanced gastric or GEJ cancer, systemic induction therapy, curative surgery with high Ro resection rates, and IP adjuvant therapy, has acceptable toxicity and encouraging survival outcome. The Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial has also shown that perioperative chemotherapy - chemotherapy given both before and after surgery - can provide a significant survival benefit.

The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant intraperitoneal salvage of cancer micrometastatic residues after surgery contributes to disease-free survival. The goal of this trial is to determine whether IP Floxuridine, added to adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy, prolongs patient's survival. This will be tested during the randomized open-label trial.
