A Single-Arm Study of Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) Plus Nivolumab in Cisplatin Ineligible Patients Who Have Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) in combination with nivolumab by assessing the objective response rate (ORR) in cisplatin ineligible, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer patients.

BIOLOGICAL: Bempegaldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Patients Whose Tumors Have Low Programmed Cell Death Ligand (PD-L1) Expression, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab by assessing the ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) per blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients whose tumors have low programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed objective response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) on or before the first progressive disease and any subsequent anticancer therapy.

CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 9 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 for the first 12 months, and then every 12 weeks as indicated in the Schedule of Events, up to approximately 27 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in All Treated Patients, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab by assessing the ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) per blinded independent central review (BICR) in all treated patients. ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed objective response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) on or before the first progressive disease and any subsequent anticancer therapy.

DOR is defined for patients who have a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as the date from first documented CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 to the date of documentation of disease progression as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier. Patients who do not have disease progression or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment., Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 9 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 for the first 12 months, and then every 12 weeks as indicated in the Schedule of Events, up to approximately 27 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by Investigator in All Treated Patients and Patients Whose Tumors Have Low Programmed Cell Death Ligand (PD-L1) Expression, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab by assessing the ORR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by Investigator Assessment in All Treated Patients and Patients Whose Tumors Have Low Programmed Cell Death Ligand (PD-L1) Expression.
