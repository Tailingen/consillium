Safety, Immune and Tumor Response to a Multi-component Immune Based Therapy (MKC1106-MT) for Patients With Melanoma
The clinical trial is evaluating a multi-component active immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are highly expressed on melanoma
Stage III Melanoma|Stage IV Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: MKC1106-MT
To evaluate the objective response, where response is defined as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 12 weeks or longer (CR, PR, and SD are defined according to RECIST 1.1 criteria), 12 Months
To assess clinical efficacy of MKC1106-MT in subjects with advanced melanoma measured at 6 months and 1 year by (1) time to progression, progression-free survival, 12 Months|To identify and characterize correlations between biological activity (immune response), target antigen expression and clinical efficacy., 12 months|To further assess the safety profile and tolerability, 12 months
The multi-component active immunotherapy, MKC1106-MT, consists of 1 plasmid dose and 2 peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1, 4, 15 and 18 of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into non-diseased superficial inguinal lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance
