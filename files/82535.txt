High-quality CRC screening interventions and approaches should be delivered to a large proportion of target population.

To our knowledge, there is no interactive video been developed, that can be used as educational tool for CRC screening in Malaysia. By developing an educational video, we hope that it can be used by health professionals to promote CRC screening, favoring their empowerment for prevention and control of disease.
