Precision Medicine for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis Guided by Multi-omics Data Under the Umbrella Theory
In order to more accurately discover the cause of drug resistance in tumor treatment, and to provide a new basis for precise treatment.

Therefore, based on the umbrella theory of precision medicine, we carried out this single-center, prospective, and observational study to include patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. By combining genome, transcriptome, and proteomic sequencing data, we established a basis for colorectal cancer liver Transfer the multi-omics data of the sample, describe the reason for the resistance of the first-line treatment, and search for new therapeutic targets.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multi-omics
Objective response rate, Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and maintained for a certain period of time, including complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) cases, 1 year
progression-free survival, Refers to the date from initial diagnosis to tumor progression, 1 year|Overall survival, Refers to the date from initial diagnosis to last follow-up or death date, 3 years
