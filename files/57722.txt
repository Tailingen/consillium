A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of LBL-007 in Combination With Toripalimab in Treatment of Advanced Malignant Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter Phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity and efficacy of LBL-007 in combination with Toripalimab in Treatment of Advanced Malignant Tumors.
Advanced Malignant Tumors
DRUG: LBL-007 Injection|DRUG: Toripalimab Injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), According to the evaluation criteria of RECIST V1.1 (solid tumour) or Lugano 2014 (lymphoma),Proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).It was used to evaluate the efficacy in Phase II, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment.DLT is defined as toxicity (possible adverse events related to LBL-007) during the DLT observation period (3 weeks after the first dose).It was used to evaluate the safety in Phase Ib., During the first Cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles. It was used to evaluate the tolerability in Phase Ib ., During the first Cycles(each cycle is 21 days)
Number of subjcects with adverse events and serious adverse events, Adverse event (AE) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0.The safety profile of LBL-007 and Toripalimab will be assessed by monitoring the Adverse event (AE)., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Percentage of participants achieving CR, PR, iCR, iPR and stable disease (SD) after treatment., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Duration of Response(DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from earliest date of disease response (CR、PR 、iCR or iPR) until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause(if occurring sooner than progression)., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Cmax, Maximum drug concentration in plasma after administration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|Tmax, After administration,Time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects.Immunogenicity refers to the performance that can elicit an immune response., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30+7 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy)
This trial is divided into combination dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) and combination dose expansion phase (Phase II), as follows:

1. In the Phase Ib study, patients with advanced neoplasm malignant who have no standard treatment or have treatment failure of standard treatment or are not suitable for standard treatment at present stage are planned to be enrolled,including patients with advanced neoplasm malignant who have not been treated with anti-PD- (L) 1 antibody or have progressed or not tolerated after treatment with anti-PD- (L) 1 antibody.LBL-007 is administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W),intravenous infusion.The dosing regimen of toripalimab in combination was once every 3 weeks (Q3W),Intravenous infusion.
2. According to the LBL-007 global research and development data and the safety, tolerability and PK data of the phase Ib clinical study, the recommended dose of phase II clinical study (RP2D) was obtained for the expansion of target indications.This study is designed to enroll patients with advanced neoplasm malignant, including patients who have not been treated with anti-PD- (L) 1 antibody or patients who have progressed or intolerant after treatment with anti-PD- (L) 1 antibody.Subjects need to undergo relevant examinations or observations during the screening period,and subjects who meet the screening requirements will enter the treatment period.
3. Biological samples will be collected from subjects in Phase Ib/II for relevant testing in this trial.Phase Ib is expected to enroll approximately 9-12 subjects.Phase II is expected to enroll approximately 200 subjects.The number of subjects to be enrolled was determined by actual conditions.
