Study of Talazoparib, a PARP Inhibitor, in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of talazoparib in patients with advanced tumors with DNA-repair pathway deficiencies. There will be 2 parts to the study: a dose escalation phase in which the maximum tolerated dose will be defined, and a dose expansion phase.

DRUG: Talazoparib
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response in participants was defined as the number of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment with talazoparib and maintained for at least 4 weeks (28 days) as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions were recorded with a length of 0 millimeter \[mm\] on the case report form \[CRF\]) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to less than \[\<\] 10 mm. PR was defined by a 30% or more decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) + sum of shortest diameters (SSD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD+SSD., From Baseline until disease progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response, Best overall response: best response (in the order of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, stable disease \[SD\] and progressive disease \[PD\]) among all overall response as RECIST 1.1, recorded from date of first dose of talazoparib until participant withdrew from study/data cut-off date, whichever earlier. CR defined as disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions (where all target lesions recorded with a length of 0 mm on the CRF) and the reduction of the shortest diameter of all nodal lesions to \< 10 mm. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions, reference to baseline sum diameters. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference to the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study)., From Baseline until disease progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of first dose of study drug to the earlier date of the documented PD or death due to any cause. PD as per RECIST 1.1 defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, reference to the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study)., Baseline, until PD or death due to any cause (maximum duration:1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of the first documented objective response confirmed at least 28 days later to the date of the first documented PD or date of death, whichever occurred first. PD as per RECIST version 1.1 defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, reference to the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study)., Baseline until PD or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)|Number of Participants With Stable Disease, SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference to the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study)., Baseline, until PD or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1071 days for Part 1; 834 days for Part 2)|Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). DLT defined as any of the following occurring during cycle 1 of part 1 of study, Hematologic toxicity: Any grade 4 or higher hematologic adverse event, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with grade 2 or higher haemorrhage, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that led to interruption of dosing for 5 or more days. Nonhematologic toxicity: grade 3 or higher laboratory AE which was asymptomatic and rapidly reversible adverse events (returned to baseline or to grade 1 or lower within 7 days), Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that could be medically managed to grade 2 or lower with anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals within 24 hours, Grade 3 fatigue that improved to grade 2 or lower in 5 days or less, Alopecia.
