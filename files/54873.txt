What Are we Missing? Diagnosing Uterine Adenomyosis Using Ultrasound Elastography
To improve the clinical care of women with pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding due to benign uterine conditions including leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) and adenomyosis by evaluating the accuracy of radiology diagnostic exams (MRI(magnetic resonance imaging), ultrasound and ultrasound with elastography).
Uterine Bleeding|Uterine Fibroids|Adenomyosis
PROCEDURE: Evaluation of MRI, US for pelvic and uterine conditions|PROCEDURE: Patient preference between MRI and Ultrasound
Diagnostic accuracy of MRI and ultrasound elastography for distinguishing adenomyosis and fibroids, Arm 1 patients will undergo hysterectomy (per previously defined clinical decision unrelated to the study) 4-6 weeks after enrollment and imaging tests, allowing us to correlate imaging and pathologic findings, 1-2 months per patient
Patient preference between ultrasound and MRI, Patients will take a survey to assess their experiences and preferences for pelvic imaging tests within 6 months after having those tests, 6 months per patient
Currently benign conditions of the uterus are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This project will help determine which diagnostic radiology exams are most helpful to the clinician in providing accurate diagnosis. In addition, this study will evaluate which exam (MRI vs. Ultrasound) patients prefer over another exam.
