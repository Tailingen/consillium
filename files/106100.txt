Safety,Tolerability,Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CFZ533 in Moderate to Severe Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and efficacy of CFZ533 as an add-on therapy to standard of care in patients with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis (MG).
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: CFZ533
Mean Change From Baseline in the Quantitative Myastenia Gravis (QMG) Score at Week 25. Posterior Median Was Used as Measure Type., QMG score is an established validated measure of disease severity used in MG trials (Jaretzki et al 2000). The scoring system is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups by means of a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb function, grading each finding, and the total score ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits) (Sharshar et al 2000, Bedlack et al 2005)., week 25
Mean Changes From Baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) Score. Posterior Median Was Used as Measure Type., The Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score is another key efficacy outcome measure, ranging from 0 to 50. It is reliable and demonstrates concurrent and longitudinal construct validity in the MG practice care setting (Burns et al 2010). The MGC scale covers 10 important functional domains most frequently involved in patients with MG. The proportion of bulbar and respiratory items reflect the clinical importance of these domains in the disease, and are appropriately weighted.

The assessment of each of the 10 test items provides immediate insight into the status of that particular functional domain. A decrease in this score shows an improvement., From baseline to week 49|Proportion of Patients With Improvement or Worsening by â‰¥ 3 Points in the QMG Score, QMG score is an established validated measure of disease severity used in MG trials (Jaretzki et al 2000). The scoring system is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups by means of a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb function, grading each finding, and the total score ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits) (Sharshar et al 2000, Bedlack et al 2005)., at week 49|Proportion of Patients Intolerant to Steroid Taper, week 49|Number of Patients Who Discontinued Due to Inefficacy or Worsening, week 49|Mean Change From Baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis-specific Activities of Daily Living Scale (MG-ADL), The MG-ADL is an 8-item survey to assess functional performance of daily activities that are sometimes impaired by MG e.g. talking, breathing, swallowing etc. (Muppidi et al 2011). The higher score on MG-ADL scale (0-24 points) indicates worse functional performance of daily activities., week 25|Mean Changes From Baseline in the QMG Score at Week 49, QMG (quantitative myasthenia gravis) score is an established validated measure of disease severity used in MG trials (Jaretzki et al 2000). The scoring system is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups by means of a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The scale measures ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb function, grading each finding, and the total score ranges from 0 (no myasthenic findings) to 39 (maximal myasthenic deficits) (Sharshar et al 2000, Bedlack et al 2005). A decrease in the QMG score indicated an improvement. Results given as a change in the score as compared from baseline, week 49|Mean Change From Baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life (MG QOL-15), The MG-QOL15 is a 15-item survey, completed by MG patients and it is designed to assess some aspects of quality of life (QoL) related to MG (Burns et al 2011) e.g. assesment of mood, eating, speaking, driving a car etc.. The higher score on MG-QOL15 scale (0-60 points) indicates worse QoL., week 25|Free CD40 on B Cells, CD40 receptor occupancy by CFZ533 in peripheral blood was assessed by flow cytometry analysis, measuring free or total CD40 receptors on whole blood B cells. Free CD40 on CD19-positive B cells, using PE-conjugated CFZ533 whose binding was prevented by bound, unconjugated CFZ533 (drug bound to CD40 on peripheral blood B cells). The more CD40 was occupied by unlabeled CFZ533, the less binding of labeled CFZ533, manifest as a lower mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD40 on B cells. MFI from free CD40 on B cells was converted into Molecules of Equivalent Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF) using PE-MESF beads., week 1, week 25|Total Soluble CD40 (sCD40) in Plasma, PD, week1, week 25|Plasma CFZ533 Concentration at Steady State Conditions (Week 17), week 17
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and efficacy of CFZ533 as an add-on therapy to standard of care in patients with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis (MG).
