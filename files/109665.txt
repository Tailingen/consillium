Electrical Impedance Scanning of Thyroid Nodules Prior to Thyroid Surgery: a Prospective Study
Patients over the age of 18 with thyroid nodules scheduled for surgery will undergo EIS scan. Each node will be scanned and graded form 1-5 (1=benign, 5=malignant). Results will be compared with final histopathology.
