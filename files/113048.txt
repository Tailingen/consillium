A Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of BPT567 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum adminstered dose (MAD) of BPT567 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and establish the recommended dose for expansion cohorts.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: BPT567
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD), The MTD will be the highest tested dose of BPT567 at which protocol specified number of patients experience DLT or the MAD, highest administered dose in the absence of DLTs, Duration of first cycle (28 Days) for each cohort evaluated|Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Rate of subjects reporting adverse events or serious adverse events including abnormalities in safety laboratory results, Through end of study (up to 2 years)
