EBRT and HDR Brachytherapy for Unfavorable-intermediate, High, and Very High-risk Prostate Cancer
This study is trying to find out if the combination of Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), MRI guided high dose radiation (HDR) brachytherapy treatment (internal radiation implant procedure) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatments lead to less side effects. This study is also looking at patient outcomes, quality of life, and overall survival for patients receiving this treatment.
