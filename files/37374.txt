Study of Autoimmune Disease Complications Following Ipilimumab Treatment Among Melanoma Patients With Underlying Autoimmune Diseases
The research questions to be addressed by this study are as follows:

1. What is the prevalence of ipilimumab use among adults with a history of autoimmune disease that received treatment with ipilimumab for advanced melanoma?
2. Do melanoma patients with a history of autoimmune disease experience complications that require hospitalization related to their underlying autoimmune disease following treatment with ipilimumab?

BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab
Incidence of ipilimumab treatment among adult melanoma patients with a prior or existing autoimmune disease/condition, Approximately 40 months|Incidence of hospitalizations related to the pre-existing autoimmune disease/condition following treatment with ipilimumab, Approximately 40 months
Incidence rate of hospitalization related to a complication of the underlying autoimmune condition before exposure to ipilimumab treatment, Approximately 40 months|Incidence rate of hospitalization related to a complication of the underlying autoimmune condition after exposure to ipilimumab treatment, Approximately 40 months
