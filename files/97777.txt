BCMA-CAR-T in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma

There are no effective regimens for relapsed/refractory myeloma. BCMA express extensively in mature B cells and plasma cells. Myeloma cells express BCMA universally. BCMA signal pathway can induce plasma cell proliferation and survival, down-regulation of BCMA could control the progression of myeloma. The BCMA CAR used in this study consists of BCMA nanobody, CD8 hinge, transmembrane region and 4-1bb co-stimulation domain.
