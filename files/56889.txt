An Open-label Study Investigating the Disposition and QT/QTc Interval Effects of 400 mg [14C]-Iniparib(3.7 MBq, 100 ÂµCi)
This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study.

During Segment 1, patients are administered a single IV administration of \[14C\]-iniparib.

During Segment 2, patients are administered iniparib with or without additional chemotherapy. Acceptable chemotherapy regimens is limited to those for which previous experience with iniparib exists.
