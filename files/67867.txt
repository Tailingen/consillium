Phase II Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of CB-103 With Venetoclax in Adolescent and Young Adult Patients With Relapsed/Refractory T-ALL or T-LBL
To learn if the combination of 2 study drugs, CB-103 and venetoclax, can help to control T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL) in adolescent and young adult patients
Leukemia, Lymphoblastic|Leukemia
DRUG: CB-103|DRUG: Venetoclax
The safety and tolerability of CB-103 in combination with Venetoclax in adolescent and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) ., Participants will be studied by assessing the number of participants with With Treatment-Related Adverse Events Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, through completion of study or average of 1 year|The efficacy of CB-103 in combination with venetoclax will be determined by studying the overall response rate (ORR) of the participants, Defined as complete remission (CR), plus CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) \[1\] plus partial remission (PR) \[2\], in adolescent, and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL., through completion of study or average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

* To characterize the safety and tolerability of CB-103 in combination with Venetoclax in adolescent (12 to 18 years) and adult (19 to 60 years) patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL).
* To assess the efficacy of CB-103 in combination with venetoclax by the overall response rate (ORR), defined as complete remission (CR), plus CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) \[1\] plus partial remission (PR) \[2\], in adolescent, and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess whether the ORR to CB-103 in combination with Venetoclax is dependent on pre-treatment expression of Notch and/or BCL2 pathway.
* To determine the preliminary assessment of CB-103 in combination with Venetoclax by other efficacy parameters such as minimal residual disease (MRD), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in adolescent and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/T-LBL.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To explore potential correlations of ORR to treatment and additional pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, i.e., other oncogenic pathway activations that may co-occur at the start of treatment.
* To evaluate how many patients are able to transition to Hematopoietic Stem Cell

Transplant (HSCT):

* Either in the patients achieving CR after the induction and reinduction cycles;
* Or in the patients with PR or stable disease (SD) after the induction and reinduction.
