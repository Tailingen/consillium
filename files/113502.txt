Bronchoscopic Navigation Robot-guided Dye Marking-assisted Thoracoscopic Pulmonary Nodule Resection
With the widespread use of low-dose spiral CT screening for the lungs, an increasing number of small nodules are being detected, and surgical resection is the preferred method for clinical intervention of pulmonary nodules. Staining localization can assist surgeons in accurately locating pulmonary nodules during surgery, achieving complete resection of the nodules while minimizing the resection area, thereby optimizing surgical outcomes.

The study will include individuals with pulmonary nodules detected by CT scans who require color localization assistance for thoracoscopic pulmonary nodule resection, randomly divided into two groups: one group will receive bronchoscopic navigation-assisted staining localization, while the other group will receive staining localization guided by an electromagnetic navigation system. The primary outcome is to evaluate the success rate of staining localization between the two groups.

This study aims to assess, through a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial, whether the success rate of staining localization guided by bronchoscopic navigation robots (experimental group) is not lower than that of staining localization guided by the electromagnetic navigation system (control group), while potentially offering advantages such as a shorter learning curve, ease of operation, and reduced surgical time. This will provide a new efficient and safe method for the localization of pulmonary nodules clinically, greatly supporting accurate treatment of pulmonary nodules.

Success rate of staining localization, The success rate of staining localization is defined as the number of cases with successful staining divided by the total number of cases undergoing surgery (100%). Successful staining is defined as the staining marker being clearly visible during thoracoscopy, with the staining point being less than 1 centimeter away from the nodule on the pleural projection., During surgical procedure
Re-excision rate, The re-excision rate is defined as the number of patients requiring repeat surgery due to positive margins or inability to localize the nodule in the resected specimen, divided by the total number of patients undergoing surgery (100%)., During surgical procedure|Surgery duration, Surgery duration is defined as the time starting from the catheter's advancement through the tracheal tube or laryngeal mask to the carina until the completion of staining localization., During surgical procedure|Length of hospital stay, The length of hospital stay is defined as the time from patient admission to discharge., From hospital admission to discharge, assessed daily throughout the hospitalization period (expected range: 1 to 30 days)|Incidence of complications related to staining localization, During surgical procedure
