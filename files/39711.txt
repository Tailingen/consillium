Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Patients With Abnormal HER2 Signaling
This is a prospective, single arm, open label, multicenter interventional study designed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anti-HER2 antibodies in patients with HER2-negative invasive breast cancer who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity determined by the Celcuity CELx HER2 Signaling Function (HSF) testing.
HER2-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Weekly Paclitaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Celcuity CELx HSF
Pathologic complete response (PCR) to study therapy (both breast and lymph node-combined; ypT0/Tis ypN0), Percentage of patients with absence of residual invasive cancer in H\&E slides of resected breast specimens and all sampled regional lymph nodes following the completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, From initiation of study therapy to time of surgery, which is usually performed 3 to 4 weeks after completion of study therapy
Pathologic complete response to study therapy (breast), Percentage of patients with absence of residual invasive cancer in H\&E slides of resected breast specimens following the completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, From initiation of study therapy to time of surgery, which is usually performed 3 to 4 weeks after completion of study therapy|Clinical complete response (both breast and axilla), Percentage of patients with clinical complete response (cCR) measured by physical examination of the breast and axilla, From initiation of study therapy to 2-4 weeks after completion of study therapy|Residual cancer burden (RCB), Combined index of pathologic measurements of residual tumor size and cellularity and number and size of regional lymph nodes, From initiation of study therapy to time of surgery, which is usually performed 3 to 4 weeks after completion of study therapy|Logistic regression, Regression of quantitative CELx scores by pCR outcome, From prior to study entry (time of CELx score assay) to 4-6 weeks after surgery (pCR outcome determination)|Frequency of adverse events assessed by CTCAE 4.0, Frequency of adverse events categorized using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, From beginning of study therapy to 4-6 weeks after surgery
Patients will be required to have a prescreening research core needle biopsy to procure a fresh tumor specimen that will be sent to Celcuity for CELx HSF testing, in order to assess the status of their HER2 signaling activity (abnormally or normally active).

Patients who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity will receive weekly paclitaxel plus the anti-HER2 therapy regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab following completion of initial doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate whether patients with HER2-negative breast cancers based on standard American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) testing criteria, but with abnormal HER2-driven signaling pathways determined by the Celcuity HSF assay and receive HER2-targeted therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, will have a higher rate of pathological complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (pCR breast and lymph nodes) than has been found historically in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Secondary endpoints include pathologic complete response (breast), clinical complete response (cCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) 0-1 index, and relationship between quantitative CELx score and pCR rate.

It is expected that approximately 270 patients will need to be prescreened in order to enroll 54 patients (26 ER-positive/HER2-negative and 28 ER-negative/HER2-negative) who have abnormal HER2 signaling activity.
