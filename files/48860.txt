Change in quality of life over 16 weeks, The investigators will use the EORTC QLQ C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) 68 in conjunction with a breast cancer-specific subscale, BR23, to collect data on quality of life and cancer-related symptoms., Baseline, End of week 8, End of week 16
Cancer associated symptoms and impaired quality of life remain significant problems for patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however, few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. We aim to perform a prospective single arm clinical study of a manualized Ayurvedic approach in breast cancer survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, we aim to develop the manualized Ayurvedic intervention; to assess feasibility; and to determine whether clinically meaningful effects can be achieved with the intervention.
