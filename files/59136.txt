Doxorubicin With or Without Sildenafil, With Analysis of Cardiac Markers
Sildenafil increases the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin used as treatment for cancers of solid tumors through both an increase in anti-tumor effects and protection from cardiac toxicity.

DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Sildenafil
Safety of concurrent sildenafil with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, Sildenafil will be administered at least 7 days prior to scheduled first dose of doxorubicin and continue daily dosing through 2 weeks after last doxorubicin dose. Multiple biomarkers as candidate early markers of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity will be tested., 25 months|The difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between arms, A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare the LVEF between Arm 1 and Arm 2 over all visits. A pooled t-test will also be performed to determine the change in LVEF between first and last visits., 4 years
Comparison of candidate early markers of cardiac injury, The fluctuation in the levels of biomarkers including novel ultra sensitive troponins and BNP, as well as tissue doppler imaging studies with echocardiography will analyzed., 37 months
Definitive study of sildenafil enhancement of anthracycline anticancer effects and cardioprotection would require a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving large numbers of patients and many years of follow-up. It is appropriate to demonstrate that concurrent administration of sildenafil and doxorubicin is safe and tolerable. Second, in definitive studies it might be helpful to incorporate early markers of cardiac injury in order to gain early insight into cardioprotective effects, but there are no such established markers. As a correlative study, multiple intermediate markers will be tested. In order to investigate these candidate markers it is appropriate to study patients receiving doxorubicin alone, as early markers of injury may not be apparent in patients treated with the combination. In order to accomplish these two goals the trial is a randomized trial involving a sildenafil/doxorubicin group and a doxorubicin group.
