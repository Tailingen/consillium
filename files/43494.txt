Disulfiram-Copper Gluconate in Met Pancreas Cancer w Rising CA19-9 on Abraxane-Gemzar, FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine
This is an open-label Phase 2 Pilot study to evaluate Disulfiram + Copper Gluconate in patients metastatic pancreatic cancer whose CA-19-9 levels rise while receiving nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) plus gemcitabine (Gemzar) or FOLFIRINOX or single-agent gemcitabine (Gemzar). Patient must have received a minimum of 8 weeks of treatment and have rising CA-19-9 levels in the absence of radiographic evidence of progression.

Disulfiram/Copper Gluconate Serum Levels - Area Under the Curve (AUC), Optional Day 0 (pre-Cycle 1 Day 1) at pre-dose, 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours and 4 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 7, Day 0 (pre-Cycle 1 Day 1) at pre-dose, 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours and 4 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 7
This study has 3 arms with 5 patients enrolled in each of the three arms. The three treatment arms are based upon whether the patient has previously received Abraxane-Gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX or single-agent Gemcitabine without radiographic evidence of disease progression for a minimum of 8 weeks , based on the investigator's opinion, but with a rising Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) levels. Rising CA 19-9 is defined as an increased over baseline of \> 20% in two consecutive time points within 8 days of each other. Study sites will provide all chemotherapy for patients participating in the study as a "standard of care". DSF/Cu (Disulfiram + Copper Gluconate) will be provided by the Sponsor and shipped from the Sponsor's central depot to the study sites. Sufficient amounts of DSF/Cu will be available at the study site prior to enrolling patients in the study.
