Sugammadex v.s. Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate
The aim of study is to clarify the role of sugammadex in head and neck surgery patients with a prior history of urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or a history of prostate cancer, to prevent postoperative urinary retention. The main question it aims to answer are:

* Anticholinergic agent interferes the postoperative urination
* Sugammadex does not interfere postoperative urination Sugammadex can be recommended for these patients with high risk in postoperative urinary retention in the future.
Head and Neck Neoplasms|Chronic Sinusitis|Chronic Otitis Media
DRUG: Group S: sugammadex injection|DRUG: Group N: neostigmine/glycopyrrolate
postoperative urinary retention, self-voiding more than 8 hours after surgery, up to 48 hours
Investigators will evaluate the benefit of sugammadex in reducing postoperative urinary retention for these head and neck surgery patients with high-risk for dysuria. The definition of high-risk of dysuria is patient with a prior history of urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or a history of prostate cancer.

Patients scheduled to undergo head and neck surgery within two hours of expected surgical time are enrolled. These patients are associated with high-risk of postoperative urinary retention, including prior history of urinary retention, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or a history of prostate cancer. They are randomly divided these patients into sugammadex group (S group) and neostigmine/glycopyrrolate group (Group N), sugammadex or neostigmine/glycopyrrolate are used during recovery period of anesthesia, to compare the incidences of postoperative urinary retention, nausea/vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension, and dry mouth in these patients after head and neck surgery. Sugammadex can be recommended for these high-risk patients in the future.
