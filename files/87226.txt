Cyclophosphamide Plus T-Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of abnormal blood cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cyclophosphamide together with donor lymphocytes that have been treated in the laboratory may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the best dose of donor lymphocytes when given together with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.
Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: Donor T cells
Maximum tolerated dose of haploidentical donor lymphocytes, Maximum dose in cells per kilogram that did not cause dose-limiting toxicity (defined as grade 3-5 non-hematologic toxicity, death within 60 days related to protocol treatment, aplasia related to treatment, or grade 3-4 graft-vs-host-disease)., 60 days
Disease response, Percentage of participants who had a complete remission after protocol treatment., Up to 6 months|Duration of response, Median length of response (in months) of participants who had a complete remission after protocol treatment., Up to 6 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of allogeneic CD8-positive T-cell-depleted, haploidentical donor lymphocytes when given after cyclophosphamide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.

OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 2. Patients then undergo infusion of allogeneic T-cell depleted donor lymphocytes on day 3.

Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of CD8-positive T-cell-depleted haploidentical donor lymphocytes until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
