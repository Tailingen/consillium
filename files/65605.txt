Neoadjuvant Nivolumab with CCR2/5-inhibitor or Anti-IL-8) for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
The purpose of this research study is to study the effect of giving nivolumab with CCR2/5-inhibitor or anti-IL-8 before surgery, and after surgery, with the goal of determining if this medicine results in:

1. A significant immune response against their tumor (which the study team will see in the tumor that is taken out at the time of surgery)
2. Improvement in long term survival rates
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: BMS-813160|DRUG: BMS-986253
Major Pathologic Response (MPR), MPR is defined as \<10% viable tumor within resection, at time of surgery., 2 Years|Significant Tumor Necrosis (STN), STN is defined as necrosis of \>70% of tumor base on pathologic analysis of gross tumor resection at time of surgery., 2 Years
Time to Surgery, Measured as the time in days that elapses between the first dose of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection., 2 Years|Percent of individuals who experience adverse events, Safety and Tolerability defined by the percent of individuals who experience adverse events at any point during the neoadjuvant period, or within 30 days following the final dose of nivolumab received., 2 Years|Percent of individuals who experience radiographic response, As per RECIST v1.1 as determined by pre-surgical imaging, following receipt of the neoadjuvant therapy. For NSCLC this will be based on CT imaging, while for HCC this imaging will be based on MRI radiographic post-contract subtraction., 2 Years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time, in days, between treatment initiation and when the patient is found to have recurrent and/or metastatic disease on imaging, or death for any reason., 2 Years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time, in days, between treatment initiation and when the patient dies from any cause regardless of etiology., 2 Years
Objectives:

Cohorts A,B (NSCLC):

Primary Objective: Major Pathologic Response (MPR) Secondary Objectives: Time to surgery, tolerability and safety, radiographic response

Cohorts C,D,E (HCC):

Primary Objective: Significant tumor necrosis (STN) Secondary Objectives: Time to surgery, tolerability and safety, radiographic response

Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:

Patients must have disease deemed resectable before enrollment.
