Patients will be randomized to receive six 4-week cycles of either A) MabThera (375mg/m2 iv day 1 of cycle 1, 500mg/m2 iv cycles 2-6) plus bendamustine (90mg/m2 as first-line or 70mg/m2 as second-line therapy, iv on days 1 and 2, cycles 1-6), or B)MabThera plus chlorambucil (10mg/m2 po daily, days 1-7, cycles 1-6). Patients in group B can receive up to 6 further cycles of chlorambucil as monotherapy. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6-12 months, and target sample size is 600-700 individuals.
