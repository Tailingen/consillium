Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma Receiving Doxorubicin
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, may help doctors detect early changes in the heart caused by chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well cardiac magnetic resonance imaging works in patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma receiving doxorubicin.

PROCEDURE: contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and Global Strain Decrease After Doxorubicin Chemotherapy, A reduction of 10% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between the two cMRI studies was considered a subclinical functional event. New or progressive myocardial delayed enhancement within â‰¥1 segment was deemed as a subclinical structural event. Global left ventricle (LV) radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strain data for each patient were compared between cMRI-1 and cMRI-2.

The study had a fixed endpoint (3 months post-treatment), cMRI will be done prior to induction of doxorubicin based chemotherapy and at three months after completion of the doxorubicin based chemotherapy regimen.
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine whether early myocardial structural and functional changes can be detected using cardiac MRI in patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma receiving doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy and 3 months after completion of six courses of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and twelve courses of chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.
