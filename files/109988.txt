Evaluation of Intravenous Ascorbic Acid
This Phase I study will be conducted in 2 parts to examine safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of intravenous ascorbic acid (AA) first in healthy volunteers followed by evaluation in oncology subjects. The study will be conducted in the Program in Integrative Medicine Infusion Clinic at the University of Kansas Medical Center in conjunction with the Program in Integrative Medicine, Kansas Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pharmacy, Department of Medical Oncology, the Division of Surgical Oncology,and with consultants from the NIH, and FDA.
Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous Ascorbate
DRUG: IV Vitamin C|DRUG: IV Vitamin C
identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), This will be accomplished by obtaining the following evaluations: toxicity graded by the NCI CTC, urinalysis pre- and post-infusion, ECG, basic metabolic panel, bicarbonate (pH surrogate marker), CBC, and osmolality., Change from infusion to 24 hours past infusion
measure how the body absorbs, distributes and excretes intravenous ascorbic acid, The pro-drug ascorbic acid will be administered intravenously in escalating doses of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 grams and infused over 120 minutes with sampling pre, during, and post infusion up to 24 hours in 21 healthy adults and 12 oncology participants who unable or unwilling to receive further cytoreductive therapy., 0,.5,1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 24 hours post-dose|measure the biochemical and physiological effects of intravenous ascorbic, The pro-drug ascorbic acid will be administered intravenously in escalating doses of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 grams and infused over 120 minutes with sampling pre, during, and post infusion up to 24 hours in 21 healthy adults and 12 oncology participants who unable or unwilling to receive further cytoreductive therapy., 0,.5,1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 24 hours post-dose
The purpose of this study is to examine what happens when Vitamin C enters into the body, and the speed and ways it travels through the body, and the rate at which it exits the body in the urine. It is also necessary to determine if it is safe to give Intravenous Vitamin C at high doses.
