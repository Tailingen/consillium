Comparison of PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to Conventional Imaging in the Evaluation of Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
We intend to validate 18F-DCFPyL for imaging patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC), so that it may be used to full advantage in supporting existing and emerging therapies for a spectrum of patients suffering from PCa. In this study we will image patients with CRPC undergoing second-line anti-androgen therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone) using 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT for detection of metastases and therapeutic monitoring, with correlation to standard-of-care conventional imaging modalities (CIM) (CT, bone scan) and clinical follow-up.

Change in number of metastatic lesions detected on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, Change in number of metastatic lesions detected from baseline standard of care conventional imaging (CT and Bone Scan) to 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT at 8-12 weeks post- anti-androgen therapy (standard of care), up to 2 years
