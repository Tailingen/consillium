Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of SCT-I10A in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of recombinant humanized anti- PD-1 monoclonal antibody（SCT-I10A）in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma treated after failure of standard therapy.

Safety/Tolerability, Incidence of adverse events and outlier of laboratory tests, positive rate of immunogenicity, 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 or Lugano 2014 criteria during trial treatment., 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from the date when a patient first meets the criteria for CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 or Lugano 2014 criteria, until the date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented or death, whichever occurs first., 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of SCT200 until the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first,according to RECIST v1.1 or Lugano 2014 criteria., 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of SCT200 until the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first,according to RECIST v1.1 or Lugano 2014 criteria., 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first dose of SCT200 until the date of death from any cause., 24 months
This open label, multicenter phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy in advanced solid tumors or lymphoma treated with anti- PD-1 monoclonal antibody SCT-I10A. The trial will be divided into two parts: dose-exploration and indication expansion.
