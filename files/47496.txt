Prospective Observation of Cardiac Safety With Proteasome Inhibition
The purpose of this study is to better define and understand potential cardiac toxicities of proteasome inhibitors and to understand optimal management strategies to treat and prevent cardiovascular events.
Heart Failure|Multiple Myeloma
Frequency of cardiac events of patients receiving PIs for MM., 18 months
Cancer treatments, using proteasome inhibitors, have the potential in induce cardiac toxicities including heart failure (HF), hypertension, arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease. While the presence of cardiac events may be a class effect of proteasome inhibitors (PI), the effect may be more profound with the irreversible inhibition of carfilzomib compared with reversible inhibition with bortezomib. Data available from currently published clinical trials may be inadequate to fully understand the incidence and severity of cardiac injury in patients treated with proteasome inhibitors because the trials were not designed to fully assess cardiac events. The purpose of this study is to better define and understand potential cardiac toxicity and begin to understand optimal management strategies.
