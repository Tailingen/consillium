Treatment With ATRA-IV and Depakote in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to find out the highest tolerated dose of Depakote in combination with liposome encapsulated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
Solid Tumor Malignancies
DRUG: ATRA-IV|DRUG: Depakote
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Depakote in combination with liposome encapsulated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.|To define the dose limiting and other toxicities of the combination therapy|To determine the dosing that should be used in future safety and efficacy (Phase II) trials
To study retinoic acid receptor expression and histone acetylation status to ascertain biologic effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissue obtained from selected patients who undergo tumor biopsies.|To assess for tumor responses to combination therapy.
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Depakote in combination with liposome encapsulated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA-IV) in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.

This will be a 2-step dose escalation study. Once the patient starts therapy at a designated dose level, it will not be escalated for that patient. Three patients at each dose level must complete 4 weeks of therapy before escalating to the next higher level. If none of the patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 3 new patients will be treated with the next higher dose level.
