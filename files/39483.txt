Local Radiotherapy in Combination With Immunotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients
This is a phase II study to observe efficacy of combining local radiotherapy with PD-1blockade in patients with advanced solid tumors. All patients will accept at least one site of radiotherapy together with PD-1 blockade. The study will evaluate changes of unirradiated and irradiated lesions.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: PD-1 blocking antibody
Objective response rate, The proportion of patients with a tumor volume reduction of 30% lasting for at least 4 weeks，and is the sum of the proportion of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed at least 4 weeks|non-irradiated lesion control rate(NRCR), The percentage of non-irradiated target lesions with CR/PR or SD, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
Progression free survival, The time from enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months|Overall survival, The time from enrollment to death from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months|Rate of side effects, ≥ grade 3 adverse effects, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
