BPM31510 Administered Intravenously With Gemcitabine in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Patients
This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and effectiveness of BPM31510 administered over 144-hours (two 72-hour 110mg/Kg doses) continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients as 2nd / 3rd line therapy. The study will enroll up to 25 patients in the US and Europe.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: BPM31510 Nanosuspension Injection|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Treatment Response, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (the appearance of new lesions is also considered progression); Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 10 weeks (End of Cycle 2)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the number of months from the first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., Up to study completion, an average of 1 year|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to Progression is defined as tumor progression measured from the first dose of study drug to the first documentation of progression., Day 1, End of Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The number of months from the first dose of study drug to the first documentation of progression or death due to any cause., Up to study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and effectiveness of BPM31510 administered over 144-hours (two 72-hour 110mg/Kg doses) continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients as 2nd / 3rd line therapy.

Cycle 1 of therapy is 6 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 21, 28 and 35.

Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21. Response will be assessed after Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and patients who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

Patients will continue BPM31510 in combination with gemcitabine, for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence of intolerable toxicity and progression. If gemcitabine is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.

Patients who experience disease progression but are, in the opinion of the investigator, receiving clinical benefit may continue BPM31510 as a monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine or as a monotherapy pending approval from the Sponsor.
