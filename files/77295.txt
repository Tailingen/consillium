Pomalidomide, Dexamethasone, and Filgrastim-sndz in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of pomalidomide when given together with dexamethasone and filgrastim-sndz and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has returned or that does not respond to treatment. Pomalidomide may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and may stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim-sndz, may increase the production of red and white blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of pomalidomide and/or dexamethasone. Giving pomalidomide together with dexamethasone and filgrastim-sndz may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I), Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including dose limiting toxicities. Toxicity type and severity will be summarized by frequency tables. Maximum tolerated dose defined as the highest dose level in which patients have been treated with less than 2 instances of dose-limiting toxicity (Phase I), 28 days|Number of Participants Recommended Phase II Dose of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone, When Both Agents Are Administered Together With Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor (Filgrastim) (Phase I), Up to 28 days
Number of Participants With Best Overall Response Defined Using the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC), Per International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC): Complete Response (CR), Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow; Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or â‰¥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein with urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hours; Partial Response (PR), \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by \>90% or to \< 200 mg/24 h; Stable Disease (SD) = CR + PR., After 112 days (4 courses) of therapy|Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival, Up to 6 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide and dexamethasone when given with growth factor support in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide and dexamethasone at the MTD. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the anti-myeloma activity of higher doses of pomalidomide given with low dose dexamethasone and growth factor support in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

II. Activity will be defined by the overall response rate (ORR); (partial response \[PR\] or better) and clinical benefit response (CBR) rate (minor response \[MR\] or better), as well as by the response durability (duration of response \[DOR\], progression-free survival \[PFS\], and time to progression \[TTP\]).

III. To further evaluate the safety of pomalidomide and dexamethasone at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To examine the influence of cereblon expression and activation of the wingless-type (Wnt)/beta-catenin pathway on the activity of high dose pomalidomide with low dose dexamethasone.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide followed by a phase II study.

INDUCTION: Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and filgrastim-sndz subcutaneously (SC) on days 22-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

MAINTENANCE: Patients receive lower-dose pomalidomide PO daily on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
