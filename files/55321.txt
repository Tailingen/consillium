Parkinsonism-Related Oscillations in the Cortico-Basal Ganglia-Thalamic Network During Movement: Beyond the Frequency Range
Expression of hypokinetic and hyperkinetic motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with pathological synchronous oscillations of neuronal activity (local field potential/LFP) in the cortico-subcortical network with a wide frequency range. In the present project, we propose to study cortico-subcortical oscillations and their synchronization in patients operated for PD (subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS)) during distinct pharmacological and stimulation conditions (hypokinetic and hyperkinetic), using a simple motor task.

To define the link between the characteristics of neuronal oscillations (frequency, amplitude, phase relationship) within the cortico-subcortical network and the movement, we designed a simple motor task of gripping/pulling a lever. The LFPs will be collected at the cortical and subcortical levels (STN) during the motor task using a high-resolution EEG (HR-EEG) and the Perceptâ„¢ system (Medtronic). Recordings will be realized in four conditions: without pharmacological treatment and without stimulation (Off condition), without pharmacological treatment and during stimulation (DBS condition), during pharmacological treatment and without stimulation (DOPA condition) and during pharmacological treatment and stimulation (DOPA+DBS condition).
