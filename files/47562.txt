Cisplatin and Gemcitabine Chemotherapy and Lenvatinib for Patients With Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
We aim to explore the effects and safety of GC (Cisplatin and gemcitabine) chemotherapy combined with Lenvatinib as first-line therapy in advanced or unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
Cholangiocarcinoma, Intrahepatic
DRUG: GC combined Lenvatinib
Objective response rate, Objective response rate of advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 12 months
Safety: the potential side effects, The potential side effects, 12 months|Overall survival, From the beginning date of combined therapy to the date of death, 12 months|Progression free survival, From the beginning date of combined therapy to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months
For advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that cannot be surgically removed or accompanied by metastasis, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN guidelines hepatobiliary cancer, 2019) recommend that the current treatment options are limited, mainly recommending gemcitabine combined with platinum based antitumor drugs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.) chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Adding targeted drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effect. GC chemotherapy (Cisplatin + gemcitabine) has been used in the treatment of advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but the efficacy is still not satisfactory. Lenvatinib is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that is currently approved for first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib combined with chemotherapy may have a better effect than single use for advanced ICC. At present, lenvatinib combined with GC chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced ICC has not been reported.
