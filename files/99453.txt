An Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate Subcutaneous Zilucoplan in Pediatric Participants With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of an additional 52 weeks of Zilucoplan treatment administered by subcutaneous injection once daily in pediatric study participants
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: Zilucoplan
Occurence of treatment emergent adverse events during the course of the study, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurence in a patient or clinical investigation where the study participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., Baseline (Day 1) to Safety Follow-up (up to Week 60)|Occurence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:

Results in death Is life-threatening Requires inpatient hospitalization Results in persistent disability/incapacity Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical event., Baseline (Day 1) to Safety Follow-up (up to Week 60)|Occurence of treatment-emergent advserse events leading to permanent withdrawal of investigational medicinal product, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurence in a participant or clinical investigation administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs leading to permanent withdrawal of study medication., Baseline (Day 1) to Safety Follow-up (up to Week 60)|Occurence of treatment-emergent infections, Percentage of participants who experienced treatment-emergent infections as adverse events.

An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Baseline (Day 1) to Safety Follow-up (up to Week 60)
Plasma concentration of Zilucoplan at Week 52, Blood samples for the measurement of plasma concentrations of Zilucoplan will be collected at Week 52., Week 52|Sheep red blood cell (sRBC) lysis activity at Week 52, Blood samples for measurement of sRBC lysis will be collected at Week 52., Week 52|Blood complement component 5 (C5) levels at Week 52, Blood samples for measurement of C5 will be collected at Week 52., Week 52|Myasthenia Gravis Activity of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score at Week 52, The MG-ADL score is an 8-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument. The MG-ADL targets symptoms and disability across ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and axial symptoms. The item responses are scored from 0 to 3, and the total score of MG-ADL is the sum of the 8 items and ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more disability., Week 52|Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score at Week 52, QMG score is a standardized and validated quantitative strength scoring system that was developed specifically for MG. The QMG total score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (13 items; Responses: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3). The score ranges from 0 to 39, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity., Week 52
