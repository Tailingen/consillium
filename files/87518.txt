Total 102 Natural Orifice Specimen Extractions Following Laparoscopic Colorectal Resections
In the development of surgical technique, laparoscopic surgery has created a major breaking point. Although laparoscopy (decreased hospital stay, decreased incisional hernia and wound infection rate...) provides a remarkable advantage compared to open surgery, the need for the extraction site incision could not bring the incision-related morbidity rates to the desired level. That's why SILS and natural hole surgery came to the fore. Colorectal surgery was also affected by this process, and the laparoscopic colectomy procedure combined with transrectal colon extraction was first performed in 1993 (1). Although its use increased gradually after this period, it could not reach the expected levels and this could not resolve the concerns on natural hole surgery.

In this article, our aim is to present the single center results of the patients who performed the extraction with the NOSE method after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
