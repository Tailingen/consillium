A Study of TQB2450 Injection Plus Chemotherapy Followed by TQB2450 Plus Anlotinib Versus Tislelizumab Plus Chemotherapy Followed by Tislelizumab in the Treatment of First-line Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC).
This is Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of TQB2450 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by TQB2450 plus Anlotinib versus tislelizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by tislelizumab in locally advanced (stage ⅢB/ⅢC), metastatic or recurrent ( Stage IV) non-squamous NSCLC cancer. The primary endpoint is Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by IRC.
