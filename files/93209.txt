A Study of PLX2853 in Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of the investigational drug PLX2853 in subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: PLX2853
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, First dose of study drug through at least 30 days after end of treatment|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of PLX2853, From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of PLX2853, From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Time to peak concentration (Tmax) of PLX2853, From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Half life (t1/2) of PLX2853, From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Terminal elimination rate constant (Kel), From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Number of participants who experience dose limiting toxicity as defined in the protocol, Dose escalation will be guided by a modified continuous reassessment method (mCRM) using a Bayesian logistic regression model that follows the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle. In this method, a decision to escalate to the next dose level is based on a review of all subjects who have completed the DLT observation period., up to 18 months
Overall complete remission (OCR) rate, AML - Complete Remission (CR) + CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi); MDS - CR, From the first dose of study drug until the date of documented best response to treatment, assessed up to 18 months|Overall response rate (ORR), AML - Complete Remission (CR) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) + Partial Remission (PR); MDS - CR + PR, From the first dose of study drug until the date of documented response to treatment, assessed up to 18 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the initial objective response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 18 months|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS time is defined as the time from the first dose of PLX2853 to treatment failure, relapse after initial response or death from any cause, assessed up to 18 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the first dose of PLX2853 to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 18 months.|Overall survival (OS), From the first dose of study drug until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 18 months.
