Optical Coherence Tomography of Nerve Fiber Layer and Ganglion Cell Complex After Cataract Extraction
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) for retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) is done before and after cataract extraction in patients with or without primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)
Cataract|Primary Open-angle Glaucoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Oct scans
RNFL and GCC thickness, Assessment of RNFL and GCC thickness change after cataract extraction, Oct scans before and 6 weeks after surgery
Final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Assessment of the final BCVA recorded according to the Snellen chart and converted to logMAR for statistical analysis, Six weeks after cataract surgery
Intraocular pressure (IOP) change and central foveal thickness (CFT) change, Assessment of the IOP and CFT change after cataract extraction, Six weeks after cataract surgery
The investigator's study includes two groups of patients, each consists of 25 eyes, group 1 (cataract group)includes patients who are planned for cataract extraction without any other preexisting retinal or optic nerve pathology that may affect the RNFL thickness, while group 2 (combined cataract and glaucoma group) includes patients who are diagnosed with POAG controlled on medical treatment with cataract and planned for cataract extraction only.

The OCT scans with complete ophthalmological examination are done before surgery and 6 weeks after uneventful cataract extraction (phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation)
