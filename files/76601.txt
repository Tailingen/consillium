Study of Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex (HSPPC-96) Versus IL-2/DTIC for Stage IV Melanoma
The primary goal of this study is to determine if people with metastatic melanoma who receive Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex - 96 (HSPPC-96 or Oncophage) after surgery live longer than people who may or may not have surgery but who receive conventional chemotherapy including IL-2/DTIC. A second goal is to determine the safety and frequency of side effects in subjects who receive therapy with HSPPC-96.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: HSPPC-96 or Oncophage
Primary Objective:

* To determine whether subjects with stage IV melanoma randomized to HSPPC-96 have longer survival than subjects randomized to physician's choice including interleukin-2 and/or dacarbazine/temozolomide and/or complete tumor resection.

Secondary Objective:

* To determine frequency of adverse events in subjects randomized to HSPPC-96.
