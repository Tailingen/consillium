A Study of Sotorasib (AMG 510) in Participants With Stage IV NSCLC Whose Tumors Harbor a KRAS p.G12C Mutation in Need of First-line Treatment
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tumor objective response rate (ORR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in participants who receive sotorasib at either 960 mg daily or 240 mg daily whose tumors are programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) \< 1% and/or harbor a serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) co-mutation, in a subgroup of participants with PD-L1 \< 1% and in a subgroup of participants with STK11 co-mutation.
