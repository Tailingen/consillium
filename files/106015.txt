A Study of Chemoimmunotherapy for the Treatment of Men With Neuroendocrine or Aggressive Variant Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab, cabazitaxel and carboplatin in men with neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) or other aggressive variants of prostate cancer (AVPC). This study will also investigate biomarkers to gain a better understanding of how the drug combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab, cabazitaxel and carboplatin affects these types of prostate cancer and the immune system. Eligible subjects will receive up to 10 cycles of nivolumab, ipilimumab, carboplatin and cabazitaxel followed by maintenance nivolumab and ipilimumab. Subjects may continue receiving study drugs until cancer progression, severe toxicity, withdrawal of consent, 3 years from the initial dose of study drugs or study termination, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects will be followed for 3 years from the initial dose of study drugs.
