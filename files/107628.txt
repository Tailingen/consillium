A Study of GQ1005 in Subjects With HER2-Expressing Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of GQ1005 and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy in HER2 expressing or mutated advanced malignant solid tumor subjects.
HER2 Expressing or Mutated Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
DRUG: GQ1005
Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of Treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events, according to NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0 (The number of participants who had treatment-related side effects in population who had received one therapy at least)., Up to 2 years|Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Adverse events will be assessed using NCI CTCAE version 5.0 and will be evaluated by the investigator and the sponsor for the eligibility of DLT., From first dose to the end of Cycle 1, 21 days|Maximal Tolerance Dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), The SRC will also determine the MTD/RP2D based on the totality of data for all tested dose levels., After each cohort completes the DLT observation period (Day 1 to Day 21 after the first dose of study treatment) or has a DLT or becomes not DLT-evaluable
Maximum concentration (Cmax) of GQ1005, The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GQ1005, Up to2 years|Time of peak plasma concentration (Tmax), The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GQ1005, Up to2 years|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of GQ1005, The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of GQ1005, Up to 2 years|Overall response rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be analyzed according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation, Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the rate of the sum of CR, PR and SD according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation., Up to 2 years|Time-to-response (TTR), To preliminarily evaluate TTR in patients with advanced solid tumors, Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of first administration to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard, Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of first administration to (for any reason) death. The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard, Up to 2 years|Immunogenicity (anti-drug antibody ADA), Percentage of subjects producing detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Up to 2 years
This is an open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of GQ1005 and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy in HER2 expressing or mutated advanced malignant solid tumor subjects.
