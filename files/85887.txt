Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Brain Tumors
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have brain tumors.

PROCEDURE: Sterotactic radiosurgery
OBJECTIVES: I. Establish stereotaxic radiosurgery as a treatment technique at the National Institute of Health in patients with intracranial neoplasms.

II. Assess the response rate, local control, time to progression, pattern of failure, and magnetic resonance spectrographic data following this therapy in these patients.

PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients undergo stereotaxic head frame placement, followed by stereotaxic radiosurgery on day 1. The dosage of radiation therapy administered is dependent on the tumor diameter.

Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months.
