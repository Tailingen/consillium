NOX-A12 in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOX A12 alone and in combination with a background therapy of bortezomib and dexamethasone (VD) chemotherapy in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: NOX-A12
Overall response rate (ORR = best response at least partial response (PR)), Assessment of the overall tumor response after cycle 4 and 8 will be the primary efficacy endpoint. The recommendations for the uniform reporting of clinical trials as published by the International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 1 in 2011 will be applied., 6 months|Safety and tolerability of NOX A12 alone and in combination with VD, The safety evaluation will be based on the following assessments:

* Adverse events
* Vital signs
* 12 lead ECGs
* Laboratory parameters
* Abdominal ultrasound
* Immunogenicity, 18 months
Effect of NOX A12 alone and combined with VD on the mobilization of peripheral blood CD34+ cells, plasma cells and myeloma cells, 6 months|Additional response criteria such as Minor Response (MR), immunophenotypic Complete Response and molecular Complete Response, 6 months|Time to event endpoints such as Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time To Progression (TTP) and Duration Of Response (DOR) following treatment with NOX A12 in combination with VD, 18 months|Plasma concentration of SDF-1 after treatment with NOX-A12 alone (pilot group only) and in combination with VD, 6 months|Pharmacokinetics of NOX A12 alone (pilot group only) and combined with VD, 6 months
Malignant plasma cells express high levels of CXCR4 chemokine receptors, which cause cell migration and adhesion to stromal cells secreting the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (SDF-1). NOX A12 is a specific CXCL12 antagonist and may improve chemotherapy by disrupting CXCR4-CXCL12 interactions, thereby mobilizing plasma cells from protective tissue microenvironments to the blood. Furthermore, SDF-1 inhibition may alter the activation status of plasma cells, thereby triggering apoptosis or sensitization of plasma cells towards chemotherapy.
