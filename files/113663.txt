TCRαβ-depleted Progenitor Cell Graft With Additional Memory T-cell DLI, Plus Selected Use of Blinatumomab, in Naive T-cell Depleted Haploidentical Donor Hematopoietc Cell Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies
Patients less than or equal to 21 years old with high-risk hematologic malignancies who would likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients with a suitable HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor identified will be eligible for participation ONLY if the donor is not available in the necessary time.

The purpose of the study is to learn more about the effects (good and bad) of transplanting blood cells donated by a family member, and that have been modified in a laboratory to remove the type of T cells known to cause graft-vs.-host disease, to children and young adults with a high risk cancer that is in remission but is at high risk of relapse. This study will give donor cells that have been TCRαβ-depleted. The TCR (T-cell receptor) is a molecule that is found only on T cells. These T-cell receptors are made up of two proteins that are linked together. About 95% of all T-cells have a TCR that is composed of an alpha protein linked to a beta protein, and these will be removed. This leaves only the T cells that have a TCR made up of a gamma protein linked to a delta protein. This donor cell infusion will be followed by an additional infusion of donor memory cells (CD45RA-depleted) after donor cell engraftment.

This study will be testing the safety and effects of the chemotherapy and the donor blood cell infusions on the transplant recipient's disease and overall survival.

Maximum effective dose for prophylactic CD45RA-depleted DLI, Description: A maximum effective dose of CD45RA-depleted DLI is defined as the maximum value of doses that satisfy the proportion of patients with their memory T cell count measured at week 4 post-DLI more than 300/uL is more than 50% and the toxicity of grade 3-4 aGVHD is less than 20%., 90 days after the transplant date of the last enrolled patient.|One-year Event Free Survival (EFS) after completion of the protocol, Proportion of patients who are alive and relapse free one year after the date of transplant. (Events=relapse, death), One year after the transplant date of the last enrolled patient
The number of patients experiencing Blinatumomab permanent discontinuation due to toxicity, If the drug is held for more than 2 weeks due to toxicity, it will be permanently discontinued, 120 days after transplant date of the last enrolled patient|The estimate of cumulative incidence of relapse, The cumulative incidence of relapse will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Death is the competing risk event. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of Overall Survival (OS) and Event Free Survival (EFS) along with their standard errors will be calculated. OS is defined as time from transplantation to death or last follow-up, whichever comes first. EFS is defined as time from transplantation to events including relapse, graft failure, death due to any cause and last follow-up, whichever comes first. The participants are alive at the time of analysis without events will be censored., One year after the transplant date of the last enrolled patient|The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic (GVHD) will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Death is the competing risk event. The severity of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be described., One year after the transplant date of the last enrolled patient|The cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality, The cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Death before day 100 of other reasons are the competing risk events., 100 days after the transplant date of the last enrolled patient
In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), who lack an available suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related/sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD), will receive a TCRαβ-depleted haploidentical donor HCT with additional memory cell DLI. One course of blinatumomab will be empirically added for patients with CD19+ malignancy.

Primary Objectives

* Determine the maximum effective dose for prophylactic CD45RA-depleted DLI when given in the early post-engraftment period.
* Assess the efficacy of TCRαβ-depleted progenitor cell graft with additional memory T-cell DLI, plus selected use of blinatumomab, in haploidentical donor hematopoietic cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies as measured by 1 year EFS (events = relapse, death)

Secondary Objectives

* Assess the safety and feasibility of the addition of blinatumomab in the early post- engraftment period in patients with CD19+ malignancy
* Estimate the incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, malignant relapse,event-free survival per disease subgroups (e.g. ALL vs AML), and overall survival at one-year post-transplantation.
* Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).
* Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after transplantation.
* To measure and describe the pharmacokinetics of rabbit ATG in HCT recipients on this study.

Exploratory Objectives

* Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, V-beta spectratyping, and lymphocyte phenotype and function.
* Describe the use of additional CD45RA-depleted DLI for recipients who have severe viral infections, disease recurrence or progression, or poor immune reconstitution. Assess and record efficacy of CD45RA-depleted DLI for these conditions, and all adverse events that are related to CD45RA-depleted DLI.

Blinatumomab will be given to patients with a history of CD19+ malignancy as determined by St. Jude hematopathologist review of current and historical specimens and reports. Blinatumomab dosing will begin no sooner than 1 week after CD45RA-depleted DLI and no later than Day +90. There must be no acute GVHD or it must be quiescent. ALT must be less than 5x ULN, bili less than or equal to 1.5x ULN, and creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x ULN.

If more than one family member donor is suitable, then donor selection will be based on several factors including: degree of KIR mismatching, donor-recipient matching of CMV serology, donor-recipient red blood cell compatibility, degree of HLA matching, size of the potential donor, previous use as a donor, presence of donor-specific antibody, and overall health and availability of the potential donor.

A G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell product (identified as HPC,A) is the preferred progenitor cell graft source. Our desired target goal will be 5 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg. This number of cells will be necessary to provide an adequate graft, following the various ex vivo manipulations, for prompt reconstitution. More than one collection may be needed to achieve this goal. Donors will undergo a standard hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization regimen consisting of 5 days of GSF given subcutaneously at 10 micrograms/kilogram. The graft will be collected by leukapheresis on day 5 (and 6 if needed) of G-CSF. The HPC product will typically be collected and infused fresh, however there may be patients or logistical situations that require the HPC product to be collected early, processed, and stored frozen.
