Pemetrexed in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Present study is aimed at investigating potential molecular predictors of sensitivity or resistance to single-agent pemetrexed in the ≥ second line setting in a large cohort of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The following biomarkers will be investigated with either immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization or genotyping: thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase (GARFT), aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (ATIC/AICARFT), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Association of each biomarker with treatment outcome in terms of response rate, time to progression, overall survival., one year
Association of each biomarker with clinico-pathological features: histology, gender, age, smoking status, response to previous chemotherapy., one year
