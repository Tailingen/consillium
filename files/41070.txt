BC008-1A Injection for Recurrent CNS WHO G4 Glioma
The purpose of this Phase I clinical study is to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic characteristics of BC008-1A injection in subjects with recurrent CNS WHO grade 4 glioma. This is a randomized and open-label study, with two dose groups set up, and 10 to 20 subjects will be enrolled in each group.

BC008-1A is an innovative bispecific antibody targeting TIGIT and PD-1, which is developed by Sichuan Luzhou Buchang Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. . BC008-1A targets PD-1 and TIGIT to block the relevant signaling pathways, relieve the inhibition on T lymphocytes, thereby facilitating the activation of T cells and achieving the functions of immune surveillance, recognition and killing of tumor cells. Subjects with recurrent CNS WHO grade 4 glioma will be randomly assigned to dose group A (900 mg) or B (1200 mg) at a ratio of 1:1. BC008-1A will be administered once every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, initiation of new anti-tumor treatment, the decision of the investigator for the subject to withdraw based on the subject's benefit situation, death or other circumstances, whichever occurs first.
