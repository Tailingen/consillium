A Randomised Trial With Irinotecan, Cetuximab and Everolimus (ICE)Compared to Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin (CapOx) for Patients With Gemcitabin Resistant Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open multicenter randomized phase I/II study. The main purpose with this study is to investigate dose and efficacy of a combination of Irinotecan, Cetuximab and Everolimus given biweekly to patients with local advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer AFTER progression from 1. line treatment with Gemcitabine.
