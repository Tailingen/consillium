A Clinical Trial of Paclitaxel Loaded Polymeric Micelle in Patients With Taxane-Pretreated Recurrent Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate in patients with taxane-pretreated recurrent breast cancer receiving paclitaxel loaded polymeric micelle (Genexol-PM).
Recurrent Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel loaded Polymeric micelle
Response rate was assessed by imaging using the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor) guideline, 1 year
Toxicity, 1 year|Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Tumor control rate, 1 year
Genexol-PM is a novel Cremophor EL-free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel. This single arm, multicenter phase IV study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free survival and tumor control rate of Genexol-PM in patients with Taxane-pretreated recurrence breast cancer.
