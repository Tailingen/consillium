Adaptive Design Study for Safety and Efficacy of Treatment Regimens With SM-020 in Subjects With Seborrheic Keratosis
This is a first-in-humans adaptive design open label trial to explore the safety and efficacy of SM-020. Multiple dosing cohorts will be enrolled. The first cohort will have a two-week treatment period of twice daily applications followed by a four-week follow-up period. Based on the results at any time from the first and subsequent cohorts, additional cohorts will explore different dosing regimens.

This is a first-in-humans adaptive design open label trial to explore the safety and efficacy of SM-020. Multiple dosing cohorts will be enrolled. The first cohort will have a two-week treatment period of twice daily applications followed by a four-week follow-up period. Based on the results at any time from the first and subsequent cohorts, additional cohorts will explore different dosing regimens.

Variables to be considered in the design of cohorts include frequency of application and duration of application.

The maximum duration of a treatment period is 12 weeks for any subject.

35 Subjects have been enrolled to date in the following 7 cohorts:

Cohort 1: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID (Bis in die) for 14 days

Cohort 2: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID for 28 days

Cohort 3: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID pulsed dosing 4 days on/4 days off

Cohort 4: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID for 28 days to facial SKs

Cohort 5: SM-020 gel 1.0% TIW (Three times a week) under occlusion for 28 days

Cohort 6: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID for 28 days with intertriginous SKs

Cohort 7: SM-020 gel 0.1% BID for 28 days to facial SKs

Anticipated subsequent cohorts to be enrolled:

Cohort 8: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID for 56 days

Cohort 9: SM-020 gel 1.0% BID for 28 days

Cohort 10: SM-020 gel 1.0% QD (Quaque die) for 28 days

Cohort 11: SM-020 gel 0.1% BID for 28 days
