Liver Resection for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension
Clinically significant portal hypertension limits the therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is closely associated with patient prognosis. HCC patients with CPSH are heterogeneous and treatment allocation remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the survival benefits of liver resection (LR) and transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in these populations.
