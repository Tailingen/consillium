Treatment of Port Wine Stains in Children With Pulsed Dye Laser and Timolol Gel
Pulsed dye laser (PDL)is the gold standard treatment of port wine stains (PWS). However, many sessions are required and failure or relapses are not uncommon. It has been demonstrated that a neoangiogenesis occurs after PDL, explaining at least partially those failure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of a topical beta-blocker (timolol 1% gel) as a combination treatment with PDL for treating PWS.

Methods. Prospective multicenter study comparing PDL alone to PDL + timolol. Sessions of PDL will be performed once a month for 3 months. One group will be treated with PDL alone and the other will also applied timolol 1% gel twice a day during treatment. The evaluation will be done one month after the third session.
