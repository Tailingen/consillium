Venous Thromboembolism Prevention in Outpatients With Glioma
This is an open label study of apixaban for venous thromboembolism prevention in patients with newly diagnosed grade 4 glioma.
Glioblastoma|Astrocytoma|Venous Thromboembolism
DRUG: Apixaban
Safety of apixaban as determined by bleeding risk, CTCAE 5 reporting of grade 2 non-Central Nervous System (CNS) hemorrhage or grade 2 new CNS hemorrhage., 6 months
Efficacy in prevention of venous thromboembolism, Incidence of VTE, 6 months
Patients with primary brain tumors, including glioblastoma and astrocytoma, are at high risk of developing venous thromboemboli (VTE) as a comorbid condition. Prior studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy of primary pharmacological prevention of VTE using blood thinning medications, including apixaban. These studies have included a small cohort of patients with grade 4 glioma. The purpose of this study is to gather additional safety data regarding the use of apixaban for primary prevention of VTE in patients with newly diagnosed grade 4 glioma.
