Effect of Whole Body Vibration on Insulin Resistance in Females With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of whole body vibration on insulin resistance in females with polycystic ovarian syndrome
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome|Insulin Resistance
DEVICE: whole body vibration|DEVICE: Treadmill
Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), Estimate insulin resistance (IR), it will be calculated according to the formula: fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (nmol/L)/22.5., eight weeks
Waist circumference, by a tape measurement around the waist, eight weeks|waist hip ratio, The formula = waist circumference / hip circumference., eight weeks|LH/FSH ratio, To assess the severity of PCOS, Eight weeks
polycystic ovarian syndrome is a complex endocrine condition characterized by metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, excess weight or obesity, diabetes, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.Despite previous studies reported that physical exercise improves insulin resistance in females with polycystic ovarian syndrome, there is no study yet investigate the effect of whole body vibration on insulin resistance
