Study of Apatinib as the Maintenance Therapy in Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of Apatinib plus Pemetrexed as the Maintenance Therapy in Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 2 year
Overall survival(OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 2 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 1 year
Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common NSCLC,most patient were diagnosed to advanced stage. Maintenance treatment is the continuation of treatment after first-line treatment and before the disease progresses. We consider to add apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients. We designed the study to explore the possibility of apatinib for maintenance.
