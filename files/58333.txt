Solid Tumor|Bladder Cancer|Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Lerapolturev|OTHER: 5% DDM
Number of Participants Who Underwent TURBT or Cystectomy as Scheduled, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lerapolturev monotherapy administered by intravesical instillation to patients with recurrent NMIBC intended for TURBT or cystectomy, 1 month
Patients with recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) intended for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or cystectomy will receive lerapolturev by intravesical instillation. Approximately 12-15 patients will be enrolled.
