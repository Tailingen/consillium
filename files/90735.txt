Safety of AMG 706 Plus Panitumumab Plus Gemcitabine-Cisplatin in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of AMG 706 plus panitumumab when administered with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy. This is a Phase 1b clinical study.

Participant Incidence of Adverse Events, The number of participants who experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Additional details regarding specfic adverse events are provided in the Adverse Event section of this posting., From the first dose of any study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to a maximum of 509 days.
Number of Participants With an Objective Tumor Response, The number of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response, defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) throughout based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Any CR or PR was to be confirmed 4 to 6 weeks after the initial CR or PR., From enrollment until date of last follow-up visit. The median follow-up time was 24 weeks, with a range of 3 to 73 weeks.|Tmax, Time after dosing when maximum plasma concentration was observed for AMG 706, Day 1, pre-dose and at 1, 3, 6,12 (BID cohort only) and 24 hours post-dose.|Cmax, The maximum observed plasma concentration after AMG 706 dosing, Day 1, pre-dose and at 1, 3, 6,12 (BID cohort only) and 24 hours post-dose.|AUC0-24, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC0-24) with AMG 706. AUC0-24 was estimated using the linear/log trapezoidal method. For the BID cohort, AUC0 24 was estimated as 2 times the AUC from time 0 to 12 hours post the first daily dose (AUC0-12) using the linear/log trapezoidal method., Day 1, pre-dose and at 1, 3, 6,12 (BID cohort only) and 24 hours post-dose.|AUC0-inf, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinite time (AUC0-inf) postdose with AMG 706. AUC0-inf was estimated using the linear/log trapezoidal method. AUC0-inf was not calculated for the BID cohort., Day 1, pre-dose and at 1, 3, 6,12 (BID cohort only) and 24 hours post-dose.
