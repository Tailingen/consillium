Xenografts Development from Surgical Tumor Samples of Patients with Triple Negative or Luminal B Breast Cancer
Patient derived xenografts (PDX) from mammary tumors are usually made from metastatic tumors. Indeed, PDX from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant treatment are still rare. However, the realization of such PDX (from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant treatment) would make it possible to have a better knowledge of the tumor heterogeneity to the therapeutic response, to explore the models of tumor evolution during metastatic progression and also observe the mechanisms of tumor resistance in the case of non-metastatic tumors. It therefore seems necessary to develop PDX from primitive tumors in order to observe firstly the success rate of PDX; on the other hand, the drift of the initial heterogeneity, measured by comparison of the histomolecular profile of the tumors with that of the PDXs. It aims to develop xenografts from tumor samples from surgical specimens of patients with triple negative or luminal B breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Female
BIOLOGICAL: blood samples collection
Percentage of successfull PDX, PDX will be realized from patient tumor by transplanting a small fragment in a nude mouse. Once the tumor is enough grown up, the tumor is extracted to repeat this step 3 times until we get the fourth PDX with a successful tumor growth., 2 years
