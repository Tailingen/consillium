Prospective Trial for the Evaluation of Radiogenomics in Advanced Rectal Cancer
In patients with advanced rectal cancer, molecular subtypes will be identified by preoperative biopsy, CT, MRI / PET radiomics analysis, clinical features, and clinical features will be confirmed and compared.

Also, we want to confirm the relationship between these factors and the treatment response after chemoradiotherapy before surgery. The prognosis will be then assessed through 5-year overall survival and 3-year disease free survival.

A prospective clinical trial, recruiting 210 persons (approximately 53 per year) that meet the selection criteria for approximately four years from the IRB approval date in 2019 (about 53 per year) We will analyze the data and then collect and analyze the data and report the results.
