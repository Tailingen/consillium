A Study of CLSP-1025 in Adult Patients With Solid Tumors That Harbor the p53 R175H Mutation
Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of CLSP-1025, a first-in-class HLA-A\*02:01 specific T cell engager (TCE) targeting solid tumors that harbor the p53 R175H mutation.

This Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of CLSP-1025 when administered to HLA-A\*02:01-positive adult patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor the p53 R175H mutation. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A Monotherapy Dose Escalation to determine the recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDE\[s\]) and Part B Monotherapy Expansion to explore the preliminary antitumor activity as well as further characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of CLSP-1025 at the RDE(s).
