Clinical Study of MNC-168 Enteric-coated Capsule in the Treatment of Advanced Intestinal Solid Tumor
This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of live bacterium MNC-168 as a single oral agent in subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors. To explore the changes of biomarkers and intestinal flora related to curative effect, mechanism of action, safety and/or pathological mechanism.
