Explore the Mechanisms Underlying Disease Resistance and Potential Primary Resistance Mechanism of Induction Therapy Lorlatinib in Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Harboring ALK Positive Mutation Revealed by Single-cell RNA Sequencing and Spatial Transcriptomics
This is an open-label, randomized, single-center study. This translational study aims to explore tumor microenvironment remodelling after induction therapy lorlatinib and identify mechanisms of disease persistence and potential primary resistance mechanisms of lorlatinib as induction therapy treatment in surgically resectable ALK-rearranged NSCLC by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Spatial transcriptomics.
NSCLC
DRUG: lorlatinib|DRUG: lorlatinib plus chemotherapy
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), use the Singleron Matrix® Single Cell Processing System (Singeleron) according to the manufacturer's instructions to conduct the single-cell experiment and sequencing. It will be performed by an authorized, qualified independent laboratory., Obtain the primary tumor tissue before drug administration; after the end of cycle 3（each cycle is 28 days) of induction therapy, the fresh tumor tissues will be collected immediately by surgical resection.
