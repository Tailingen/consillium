A Phase 1 Study of SH1573 Capsules in Subjects With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
An open label single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of SH1573 in subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory acute myelogenous leukemia that harbor an IDH2 mutation.

Each cycle is 28 days.|α-Hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), Plasma 2-HG was measured using qualified LC-MS/MS in order to characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SH1573., 0, 24, 48 hours post-dose on single dose; Day1, Day15 pre-dose on cycle 1 and cycle 2; Day 1 pre-dose on cycle 3 and every 2 cycles afterwards. Each cycle is 28 days.
SH1573 is an IDH2 mutation inhibitor.

This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of SH1573 capsules in treatment of subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemias (AML) that harbor an IDH2 mutation.

The study consists of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Phase Ia) and a dose-expansion part (Phase Ib). The dose-escalation part will determine the MTD/R2PD. The dose-expansion part will administer the MTD/RP2D to subjects with mIDH2-positive AML.
