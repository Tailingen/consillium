HTMC0435 and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer
The Phase 1b part of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of HTMC0435 tablets combined with temozolomide in patients with various advanced solid tumors (recurrent small cell lung cancer is preferred). The Phase 2 part of the study is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm trial to investigate the preliminary efficacy of HTMC0435 and temozolomide in patients with recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC) at the recommended phase 2 dose.
