Study to Evaluate Motesanib With or Without Carboplatin/Paclitaxel or Panitumumab in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this trial is: - To characterize the safety profile of motesanib when used in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (CP), with panitumumab or with CP and panitumumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). - To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of motesanib when it is used in combination with CP, with panitumumab, or with CP and panitumumab. - To compare the paclitaxel and motesanib PK profiles when the medications are administered 30 minutes (min) or approximately 48 hours (hrs) apart. - To characterize the panitumumab and paclitaxel exposure in the combination regimens of motesanib with CP, motesanib with panitumumab, or motesanib with CP and panitumumab. - To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in each dose cohort. - To measure the immunogenicity of panitumumab in patients administered motesanib with panitumumab and motesanib with CP and panitumumab.

For the 75 mg BID cohorts, t1/2,z is reported for the first daily dose., Cycle 1, Day 3 at predose, 15 and 30 min, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 (QD cohorts only), and 24 hours postdose.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve for Motesanib in Cycle 1, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve for motesanib in Cycle 1 calculated using the using the linear/log trapezoidal method. AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) is reported for the 50 and 125 mg QD cohorts and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-24) is reported for the 75 mg BID cohort, where AUC0-24 is the sum of AUC0-12 for the first and second daily dose., Cycle 1, Day 3 at predose, 15 and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 (QD cohorts only), and 24 hours post-dose.|Trough Plasma Concentration at 24 Hours Post-dose (C24) for Motesanib in Cycle 1, The trough plasma concentration for motesanib at 24 hours postdose in Cycle 1. For the 75 BID cohort, C24 is the observed concentration at 24 hours (ie, after the second daily dose)., Cycle 1, Day 3, 24 hours post-dose|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration of Motesanib (Tmax) in Cycle 2, The time after dosing that the maximal plasma concentration of motesanib was observed in Cycle 2.

Percentage of Participants With an Overall Objective Response, Confirmed objective tumor response defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Tumor response was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Responding disease (CR or PR) was confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. A complete response defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, no new lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response defined as either the disappearance of all target lesions and the persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diamer (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD and no new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., After 9 weeks of treatment (at the end of Cycle 3)
This was a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding clinical trial examining the safety and PK of once or twice daily motesanib administered with CP or with CP and panitumumab in chemotherapy naïve patients, and with panitumumab in patients with no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC.

Participants were enrolled into the Panitumumab + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Motesanib once a safe and tolerable dose of AMG 706 was established in the other treatment arms.
