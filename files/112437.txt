Body Image Issues in Boys Being Treated at the Royal Marsden
In adolescence, the effects of cancer and its treatment can lead to bodily changes such as hair loss, weight loss or gain, amputations, scars and developmental delay. As treatments for childhood cancers improve and life expectancy increases, more adolescents have to deal with the effects of cancer and the treatment on their bodies throughout their lives.

Body image can be defined as "The mental image we hold of our bodies". There are two aspects to this, how we "see" our size/shape/weight etc, and then how we feel about this. Often the actual change in body does not always predict how people cope with it, or how they feel about it.

Prior research suggests, and clinical experiences suggests that body image issues arise for at least some adolescents with cancer, however it is unknown whether a disturbance in body image is seen as distressing for the adolescent, or how this affects them psychologically.

Body image problems were always seen as a typically female problem, and therefore researchers have often neglected to look at the issues for men. There is currently no research specifically addressing the impact of body image in adolescent boys with cancer.

This research will involve interviewing adolescent males with cancer with the aims to find out;

1. What the body image issues are, if any for this group.
2. How any body image issues might affect them, particularly psychologically.
3. What helps or hinders this group maintain a positive body image, or stop it having a negative impact on them psychologically.

It is hoped that this will help to inform psychological treatments for body image difficulties in the future.
