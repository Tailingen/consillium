Stool-based SDC2 DNA Methylation Test for the Detection of Colorectal Advanced Adenomatous Polyps and Cancer
The primary objective is to compare the performance of Stool-based SDC2 DNA Methylation Test and commercially available Fecal Immunochemical Test(FIT) , on the detection rate of advanced adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer in Chinese population. Subjects with positive results in either test will receive colonoscopy. Lesions will be confirmed as malignant or precancerous by colonoscopy and histopathologic examination.

The Detection Rate of Colorectal Polyps, Advanced Adenomatous Polyps and Cancer by Two Screening Methods, The stool-based SDC2 DNA methylation test CT values of 38 or less compared to beta-actin considered to be positive. Fecal immunochemical test values of more than 100 ng of hemoglobin per milliliter of buffer were considered as positive. An optical colonoscopy is used as diagnostic method. Lesions will be confirmed by histopathologic examination., One year
A large cohort of participants will be asked to collect stool sample for either Stool-based SDC2 DNA Methylation Test or Fecal Immunochemical Test. Subjects who have positive results will undergo colonoscopy within 6 months.

Representative histopathology slides from tissue biopsied or excised during colonoscopy and those from subsequent definitive surgery may be retrieved in order to be evaluated by pathologists to confirm the diagnosis and staging.
