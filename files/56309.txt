A Clinical Study Testing The Safety And Efficacy Of Crizotinib In East Asian Patients With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label multi-center Phase 2 efficacy and safety study of crizotinib in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC harboring a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus who have received only one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC and this regimen must have been platinum-based. Primary objective of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of crizotinib. Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy including median progression-free survival (PFS) and 1-year PFS rate, overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) at 6 and 12 weeks, time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DR).
