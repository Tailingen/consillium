Three parallel cohort, multicenter, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial to analyze the safety and feasibility of PD-1 inhibition with Nivolumab given concomitantly with standard radiotherapy regimens in the treatment of esophageal cancer.

Cohort A: Advanced/inoperable esophageal cancer, eligible for palliative radiotherapy of the primary tumor.

Cohort B: Inoperable esophageal cancer without metastases, eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy Cohort C: Operable esophageal cancer eligible for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
