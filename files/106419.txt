Monitoring and Managing Glucose Levels in People With Pancreatic Cancer
This study will investigate whether or not it is feasible to closely monitor and manage glucose levels in people with pancreatic cancer. It will also investigate what impact glucose management may have on pancreatic cancer.

This is a pilot study that will use continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to monitor glucose levels in approximately 50 participants with pancreatic cancer. Participants will receive standard chemotherapy with a combination of up to four drugs to treat their pancreatic cancer: oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX). To treat high glucose levels, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive anti-hyperglycemic treatment as guided by an endocrinologist with the aim of maintaining glucose levels between 4 and 10 mmol/L; Group 2 will receive anti-hyperglycemic treatment if their glucose levels are above 15 mmol/L, which is standard care. Participants in both Groups 1 and 2 will receive standard anti-hyperglycemic treatments: metformin, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

After 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, the CGM will be removed but any anti-hyperglycemic treatments will continue as needed. If participants discontinue treatment with FOLFIRINOX, they will continue to be followed for survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapy and will continue follow-up for glucose-related concerns at the discretion of their endocrinologist and/or medical oncologist.
