Oregovomab and PLD in PARP Inhibitor Resistant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Patients Not Candidate for Platinum Retreatment
This study is phase II, open label, clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Oregovomab and non-platinum chemotherapy in PARP inhibitor resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients who were not suitable for platinum retreatment.

Patients who have received one to three prior lines of chemotherapy are to be assigned to Cohort 1 (oregovamab 2 mg \[C1,2,3,5,7 for five doses\] + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin \[PLD\] 40 mg/m2 q4w, n=28), while patients who have received more than three prior lines of chemotherapy are to be assigned to Cohort 2 (oregovamab 2 mg \[C1,2,3,5,7 for five doses\] + weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 \[D1,8,15 q4w\], n=28). A total of 56 patients will be recruited and treated with oregovomab + PLD / weekly paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of patient consent. The primary endpoint is objective response rate by RECIST 1.1.

This study is a two-cohort, single arm phase II study in patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The efficacy and safety of five administrations of Oregovomab 2mg IV in combination with non-platinum chemotherapy will be evaluated with recurrent ovarian cancer who have progressed with prior PARP inhibitor treatment.

Patients with disease under study will be screened for eligibility during the period 28 days immediately prior to starting study drug on Day 1. Laboratory and radiological assessments performed as part of standard of care before signing informed consent may be used if performed within the screening/baseline time window.

During this time, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed and all screening assessments, laboratory tests, and procedures will be performed.
