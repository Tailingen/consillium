Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of UCART123v1.2 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (UCART) targeting the Cluster of Differentiation 123 (CD123) in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells targeting CD123 (UCART123v1.2) and determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
