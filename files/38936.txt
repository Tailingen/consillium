Markers and Calculation of Cardiovascular Risk in the Distinct Phenotypes of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder and cause of anovulatory infertility among reproductive aged women. According to the revised criteria of 2003, four distinct phenotypes of PCOS can be diagnosed. However, there are emerging evidence supporting the existence of different levels of cardiometabolic risk between the four phenotypic groups of the syndrome. The purpose of this study is to determine the cardiovascular risk of i) normoweight and ii)overweight plus obese women of every one of the four phenotypes of the syndrome as well as the levels of low inflammation serum markers and the possible correlations of the between the outcomes.
