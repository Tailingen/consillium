PankoMab-GEX™ Versus Placebo as Maintenance Therapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Efficacy of PankoMab-GEX vs Placebo in maintaining a response to chemotherapy in advanced ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Recurrent|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: PankoMab-GEX|DRUG: Placebo
Progression free survival, PFS will be determined by radiographic progression based on modified RECIST 1.1 or death of any cause., from baseline till progression of disease or death
To assess the safety and tolerability of maintenance therapy with single-agent PankoMab-GEX™ compared to placebo in patients with metastatic or recurrent ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma., Safety will be determined on the occurrence of infusion-related reactions (IRR), treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAE)., from randomization until end of treatment|Patient reported outcome, To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and other health and health-economy related outcomes, from randomization until end of treatment
The study is to evaluate the efficacy of PankoMab-GEX vs Placebo in maintaining response after 2nd to 5th line of chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients must have responded to platinum based chemotherapy in a previous line, while the response to the most recent Pt-based chemotherapy must not have lasted more than 12 months. In addition the response between most recent 2 lines of chemotherapy prior start of study medication must not have lasted more than 12 months.
