Rate of Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), pCR is defined as the absence of any residual viable tumour in the surgical specimen., Up to 4 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 4 months.|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from surgery to the first occurrence of disease relapse or death from any cause., Up to 5 years from surgery.|Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Graded using NCI CTCAE toxicity grading v5.0, From screening to 30 days after last day of study participation.
This clinical trial aims to enrol patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer. At least 16, and up to 20 patients will be recruited. Patients will be given two cycles of neoadjuvant immunotherapy (ADG 126 and pembrolizumab). They will be assessed for response at 4 weeks or if they develop clinical symptoms of progression.
