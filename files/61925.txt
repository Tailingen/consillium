Trial for the Evaluation of the Effect of Systemic Low-dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the Immunogenicity of a Vaccine Comprising Synthetic Melanoma Peptides Administered With Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)-In-Adjuvant, in Patients With High Risk Melanoma
This clinical pilot study will test the hypothesis that systemic low-dose IL-2 therapy significantly enhances the immunologic efficacy of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides plus GM-CSF-in-adjuvant.
Melanoma
DRUG: low-dose IL-2|BIOLOGICAL: melanoma vaccine
To evaluate the effect of systemic low-dose IL-2 on the immunogenicity of a vaccine comprising synthetic melanoma peptides plus GM-CSF-in-adjuvant.
Changes in disease, analysis of melanoma antigen (gp100, tyrosinase, MART-1) expression on melanoma cells from metastatic sites, Vitiligo.
This clinical pilot study will test the hypothesis that systemic low-dose IL-2 therapy significantly enhances the immunologic efficacy of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides plus GM-CSF-in-adjuvant.
