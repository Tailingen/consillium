Evaluating Renal Masses Using Ultrasound Intravenous Microbubble Contrast
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood flow in kidney masses by using ultrasound microbubble contrast material, and to see if results from ultrasound contrast studies can predict if a kidney mass is benign or malignant. Patterns of blood flow in the kidney mass will be examined to see if:

1. benign kidney masses can be distinguished from kidney cancers and
2. if slow growing, lower risk cancers have different blood flow compared to clear cell cancer which is the most common type of kidney cancer.

To determine the accuracy of contrast enhanced ultrasound of renal masses to predict benign vs. malignant histology, conclusion of study
To determine if clear cell renal malignancies can be predicted, or differentiated, from other less aggressive malignant subtypes, based on analysis of the data., conclusion of study|To determine if contrast enhanced ultrasound of renal masses provides added value in predicting benign vs. malignant histology, when compared to the current routine evaluation of CT or MRI, and standard grey scale and Doppler US, conclusion of the study
