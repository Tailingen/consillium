Safety and Efficacy of Bevacizumab in Combination With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel for Metastatic, Recurrent or Persistent Cervical Cancer
This study is to assess safety as defined by the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation/fistula, GI-vaginal fistula and genitourinary (GU) fistula in participants treated with bevacizumab 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, all repeated every 3 weeks, for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer. In addition, this study will include evaluation of the overall safety profile of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in this setting, assessment of GI perforation/fistula, GI-vaginal fistula and GU fistula events over time, and evaluation of efficacy.
