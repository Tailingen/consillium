The RolE of Prolonged Nightly faSTing to Improve Sleep and cOgnition in bREast Cancer Survivors
The investigators are interested in finding out how Prolonged Nightly Fasting (PNF) and/or health education may impact health and cancer recovery for breast cancer patients and survivors.

Examine PNF-induced changes in cognitive function as compared to the HED-Only control condition., The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) will be used to assess subjective cognitive function using a scale of 0-156, Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Examine PNF-induced changes in cognitive function as compared to the HED-Only control condition., The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) will be used to assess objective cognitive assessment using a scale of 0-22, Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection
Examine PNF-induced changes in sleep (i.e., duration, quality) and insomnia as compared to the HED-Only Control condition., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used to assess sleep using a scale of 0-21, Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Examine PNF-induced changes in sleep (i.e., duration, quality) and insomnia as compared to the HED-Only Control condition., Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be used to assess insomnia using a scale of 0-28, Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Examine PNF-induced changes in quality of life as compared to the HED-Only Control condition., Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global 10 (PROMIS Global-10) questionnaire will be used to measure health-related quality of life (i.e., mental health, physical health). It uses a scale of 0-20., Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection.
Exploratory Aim: Explore acceptability of the PNF intervention, participant adherence to protocol, 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Exploratory Aim: Explore acceptability of the PNF intervention, participant retention, 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Exploratory Aim: Explore acceptability of the PNF intervention, qualitative interviews, 8-week end point (T2) data collection|Covariate Measure: eating behaviors, Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants -- Shortened Version (REAPS) will be used to assess food intake quantity and quality changes. This uses a scale of 13-39, Baseline (T1) and 8-week end point (T2) data collection.
The purpose of this innovative, remotely-delivered pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to explore the use of an 8-week prolonged nightly fasting (PNF) intervention, as compared to a Health Education-Only (HED-Only) control condition, among ethnically and racially diverse (â‰¥50% Black, Hispanic, and/or Native American) breast cancer survivors (BCSs) with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) to examine changes in cognitive function, sleep, insomnia and health-related quality of life (i.e., mental and physical). Additionally, intervention feasibility will be assessed among the PNF participants. All participants will receive health education (HED) throughout. BCSs living with CRCI (N=60) will be recruited nationwide and randomized 1:1 into the PNF or HED-Only groups. Linear mixed models will be used to compare outcome changes in the PNF group compared to HED-Only group (Aims 1-3); descriptive and qualitative analyses will be used in the Exploratory Aim.
