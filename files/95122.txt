A Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Maintenance Treatment With Fluoropyrimidine + Bevacizumab Versus Fluoropyrimidine After Induction Chemotherapy for a Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The aim of BEVAMAINT is to improve benefic effect of maintenance therapy after a first line of induction chemotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fluoropyrimidine|DRUG: Bevacizumab
The Time-to-Treatment Failure (TTF), Will be calculated from date of randomization (after the end of induction chemotherapy) to first radiological progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death or start of a new chemotherapy (induction regimen or second line) or end of maintenance treatment without further chemotherapy, even if there is no radiological progression. Patients alive with no radiological progression and under maintenance treatment will be censored at the date of last news., 8 months
Progression-free survival (PFS1), Defined as the time between randomization and the first radiological progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death (whatever occurs first). Patients alive and without progression will be censored at the date of last news., 16 months|Progression-free survival (PFS2), Defined as the time between the end of maintenance treatment (whatever the reason is) and the radiological progression after this end of maintenance treatment or death whatever the cause. Patients alive and without progression will be censored at the date of last news., 16 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time between randomization and death (any cause). Patients alive will be censored at the date of last news., 3 years|Safety, Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI-CTC v 4.0 criteria before each cycle., 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL), Assessed at each evaluation with a questionnaire, 3 years
