Efficacy Study of Robotic Surgery for Rectal Cancer
After introducing minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery has been increasingly used in colorectal cancer. However, there is a few prospective study for robotic surgery. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of robotic surgery in mid or low rectal cancer.
Rectal Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Robotic surgery|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic surgery
Quality of mesorectal excision, Evaluating the quality of mesorectal excision in rectal specimen according to the criteria suggested by Nagtegaal ID, et al. (J Clin Oncol. 2002;20:1729-34), 7days after surgery (Pathologic report)
Short-term postoperative outcome, Within postoperative 30 days|Sexual and urinary function, Quality of life, Anorectal function, IIEF, FSFI, IPSS, EORTC C30, CR38, FISI, MSKCC bowel fuction tool, Manometry, Baseline, postop 3 weeks, 3months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months|Long-term outcome, 3 year disese-free survival, Postoperative 36 months
This study was designed as randomized phase II trial (laparoscopic versus robotic). The primary end point is quality of mesorectal excision.
