ctDNA Detection of MRD in Predicting Postoperative Recurrence in Biliary Tract Cancersï¼šA Multicenter Prospective Trial
A substantial proporation of patients with biliary tract malignancies still experience disease recurrence after curative resection. ctDNA-based minimal residual disease (MRD) method has been widely used to monitor postoperative recurrence in solid cancers, but few studies have been reported in biliary tract cancers.

The present clinical trial aims to elucidate the correlation between the postoperative ctDNA status and the prognosis of patients with biliary tract cancers, and evaluate whether ctDNA could better predict patients' recurrence and guide clinical practice.

PROCEDURE: No intervention
Relapse-free survival, The primary endpoint for this study is Relapse-free survival (RFS), which will be assessed using RECIST version 1.1., through study completion, an average of 2 years
