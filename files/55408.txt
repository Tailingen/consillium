Management of Oxaliplatin-related Gastroesophageal Variceal Bleeding
In this randomized controlled study, we aim to compare the efficacy and safety of these two interventions in patients with oxaliplatin-induced gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.
Gastroesophageal Varices Hemorrhage|Gastrointestinal Cancer|Received Oxaliplatin-based Chemotherapy
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic treatment|PROCEDURE: TIPS
24-week re-bleeding, Hematemesis ,melena, or hemoglobin level decreased by 10 g/L within 6 hours, 24 weeks
8-week re-bleeding, Hematemesis ,melena, or hemoglobin level decreased by 10 g/L within 6 hours, 8 weeks|8-week mortality, death, 8 weeks|8-week adverse events, Other complications of portal hypertension such as the progression of ascites, liver failure, etc., 8 weeks|24-week mortality, death, 24 weeks|24-week adverse events, Other complications of portal hypertension such as the progression of ascites, liver failure, etc., 24 weeks
Oxaliplatin is used as the first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. However, oxaliplatin-induced hepatotoxicity could lead to sinusoidal injury and portal hypertension in the long term. Variceal bleeding, as the most common complication of portal hypertension, threaten these patents' life. Endoscopic treatment and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) are both recommended management of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. In this randomized controlled study, we aim to compare the efficacy and safety of these two interventions in patients with oxaliplatin-induced gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.
