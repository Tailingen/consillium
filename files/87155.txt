Low-dose Chemotherapy Under Hypoglycaemia for the Treatment of Relapsed Refractory Advanced Solid Tumours
By controlling the patient's blood sugar, small doses of chemotherapy are used in a hypoglycemic state. Some necrotic tumor cells produced by chemotherapy can maintain their immunogenicity, further activate innate immunity, and produce very strong anticancer effects without the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.
