Efficacy and Safety of Aprotinin on Transfusion Requirements in Patients Undergoing Radical or Total Cystectomy
The purpose of this study is to assess if aprotinin (BAYA0128), given intravenously during your surgery, is safe and can help reduce the need for a blood transfusion during bladder surgery.
Blood Loss, Surgical|Postoperative Hemorrhage
DRUG: Trasylol (Aprotinin, BAYA0128)|DRUG: Placebo
The primary criterion for efficacy is the percent of patients requiring a blood transfusion anytime in the intra-operative or post-operative period (up to the earlier of Day 7 or discharge), Anytime in the intra-operative or post-operative period (up to the earlier of Day 7 or discharge)
