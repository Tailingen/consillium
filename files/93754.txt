* Cohort 1: Phase 2 evaluation of PF-06747775 as a single agent in previously untreated patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC,
* Cohort 2: Phase 1b single arm evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib (Cohort 2A) followed by Phase 2 randomized evaluation of PF 06747775 in combination with palbociclib vs PF-06747775 single agent (Cohort 2B) in previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M), and
* Cohort 3: Phase 1b evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with avelumab in previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M).

There remains an unmet medical need to develop EGFR TKI agents that effectively target both the single activating mutations of del 19 and L858R, and the secondary resistance mutation T790M, while sparing WT EGFR. Drugs active against the resistance mutation will enable molecularly targeted therapy with a more favorable toxicity profile than the current standard of cytotoxic chemotherapy platinum based doublets. Furthermore, by having a wide margin of selectivity favoring the EGFR mutants versus WT EGFR, PF 06747775 is likely to be positioned to improve patient outcomes from an efficacy and safety perspective.
