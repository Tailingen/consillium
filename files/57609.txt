Circulating Tumor Cell Capture for Early Diagnosis and Postoperative Tumor Recurrence Monitoring of Liver Cancer
Through the screening of CTCs in patients with suspected liver cancer and liver tumor resection or liver transplantation, the number of CTCs in the blood of liver cancer patients before and after surgery is monitored, and the clinical application significance of CTCs in liver cancer screening and postoperative recurrence monitoring in liver cancer patients is evaluated.
Circulating Tumor Cell
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Circulating tumor cell capture technology
Clinical detection of circulating tumor cells, To evaluate the specificity of CTCs for liver cancer screening and the feasibility of early recurrence after interventional therapy, tumor resection or liver transplantation, 2020.01.20-2021.02.28
Circulating tumor cell function detection and verification, Analyze the correlation between circulating tumor cells and clinical prognosis after liver cancer surgery and further mechanism exploration, 2020.03.01-2021.05.20
1. Screen patients with suspected liver cancer Long-term exposure to liver cancer risk factors (hepatitis B carriers, past history of schistosomiasis, long-term diet of Aspergillus food, history of liver cirrhosis, etc.), patients with liver cancer are initially suspected.
2. Monitor the number of CTCs in the blood of patients with liver cancer before and after surgery Imaging examinations show that liver space is occupied by patients with suspected liver cancer. Use CTCBIOPSYÂ® technology to monitor patients' surgical operations (including interventional therapy, tumor resection, or liver cancer liver transplantation) at different times 1-3 days before, 1 month after surgery, and 6 months after surgery The number of CTCs in peripheral blood.
3. To evaluate the clinical application significance of CTCs in liver cancer screening and postoperative recurrence monitoring in patients with liver cancer Combined with clinicopathology, tumor marker examination and imaging examination, clinical follow-up and follow-up, analyze the clinical significance of CTCs detection in liver cancer patients, and focus on evaluating the relationship between circulating tumor cells in liver cancer screening and postoperative recurrence, and establish a new The liver cancer prediction model improves the prognosis of liver cancer patients.
