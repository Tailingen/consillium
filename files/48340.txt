The Efficacy of Salvage BGD With autoSCT Consolidation in Advanced Classical HL Patients Not Responding to ABVD
The objective of the study is evaluation of efficacy of Bendamustine, Gemcytabine, Dexamethasone (BGD) salvage therapy with autologus stem cell transplantation (ASCT) consolidation in advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients not responding to ABVD therapy.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT|PROCEDURE: Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
ORR (overall response rate), CR (complete response) + PR (partial response), Evaluated at the end of Cycle 2 of BGD (every cycle is 21-28 days)|PFS (progression-free survival), Staying free of disease progression., Time measured from date of of Cycle 2 of BGD treatment (every cycle is 21-28 days) until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
OS (overall survival), The length of time from the start of treatment, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., Time measured from Day 1 of Cycle 1 of BGD treatment (every cycle is 21-28 days) until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months (measured for patients that have undergone ASCT after BGD tratment).|OMRR (overall metabolic response rate), OMRR= CMR (complete metabolic response) + PMR (partial metabolic response), Evaluated a the end of Cycle 2 of BGD treatment (every cycle is 21-28 days) and after ASCT (up to 150 days after Day 1 of Cycle 1 of BGD treatment).|BGD tolerability assessment., Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events., 24 months from the start of BGD treatment|MR (mobilization rate), Evaluation of stem cells mobilization efficacy in patients on BGD regimen., Evaluated after the end of Cycle 2 of BGD (every cycle is 21-28 days), before tranplantation (up to Day 150 of treatment).
Treatment regimen:

Bendamustine (B) 90 mg/m2 iv day 1, 2 Gemcytabine (G) 800 mg/m2 iv day 1, 4 Dexamethasone (D) 40 mg iv/po day 1,2,3,4

Course of treatment every 21-28 days, 4 courses of treatment max; next round of treatment may be given if ANC\>1000/μl and PLT\>75000/μl. Up to 7-day delay is permitted.
