PERformance of Multi-Cancer Early-detectIon Based on Various Biomarkers in fEmale Cancers, PERCEIVE-II
This study is a prospective study aimed to validate the performance of combined multi-omitcs assays for early detection of gynecologic cancers. Biomarkers of cfDNA methylation, ctDNA mutation and blood miRNA markers will be evaluated. The study will enroll approximately 2935 female participants, including participants with gynecologic cancers patients and healthy participants.
