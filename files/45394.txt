Front-line VenObi Combination Followed by Ven or VenZan Combination in Patients With Residual Disease: a MRD Tailored Treatment for Young Patients With High-risk CLL
Multicentric phase 2 study for previously untreated high-risk CLL patients. Patients will receive 6 courses of the Venetoclax + Obinutuzumab combination.

* Patients with stable disease or a response (CR/PR) with uMRD in the PB and BM at cycle 9 will continue treatment with Venetoclax single agent until cycle 13 and then stop treatment.
* Patients with stable disease or a response (CR/PR) with evidence of residual disease in the PB and/or BM at cycle 9 will continue treatment with Venetoclax and Zanubrutinib combination until cycle 21.

then, Patients with uMRD in the PB and BM at cycle 21 will stop treatment whereas patients with residual disease in the PB and/or BM at cycle 21 will discontinue Venetoclax and continue Zanubrutinib until disease progression.
High Risk CLL|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: VenObi+Ven or VenObi+VenZan
Front-line VenObi efficacy in terms of MRD negativity, Evaluation of front-line treatment (VenObi) efficacy in terms of percentage of patients who achieve Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease at the end of combination therapy, at month 9|VenZan efficacy in terms of MRD negativity, Evaluation of treatment (VenZan) efficacy in terms of percentage of patients who achieve Undetectable Minimal Residual Disease in patients with residual disease at the end of combination therapy with VenObi, at month 21
This is a multicentric phase 2 study for previously untreated high-risk CLL patients.

A. The study treatment will consist of 6 courses of the Venetoclax + Obinutuzumab combination.

B. Patients with stable disease or a response (CR/PR) with undetectable MRD (uMRD) in the PB and BM at cycle 9 will continue treatment with Venetoclax single agent until cycle 13 and then stop treatment.

C. Patients with stable disease or a response (CR/PR) with evidence of residual disease in the PB and/or BM at cycle 9 will continue treatment with Venetoclax and Zanubrutinib (VenZan) combination until cycle 21.

c1. Patients with uMRD in the PB and BM at cycle 21 will stop treatment. c2. Patients with residual disease in the PB and/or BM at cycle 21 will discontinue Venetoclax and continue Zanubrutinib until disease progression.

In all patients with uMRD, MRD will be monitored during the follow-up. Patients with a response with uMRD in the PB and BM who subsequently develop an MRD positivity will not be treated. A new treatment will start at the time of clinical disease progression according to the iwCLL criteria.
