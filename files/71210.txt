Circulating EV Long RNA Profiles in SCLC
To identify the circulating extracellular vesicle long RNA (exLR) profiles in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and explore the potential of exLR as biomarkers to predict the therapeutic effect of SCLC.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood sample collection
Establish a model to predict curative effect, To detect the difference of exLR profiles of SCLC patients before and after treatment, and the difference of baseline exLR profiles between responders and non-responders., At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)
