Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site
In this phase II trial, we will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the oxaliplatin/capecitabine combination in patients who have had one previous chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of carcinoma of unknown primary site. Patients who are relapsed after a previous response to treatment will be eligible, as well as those who were refractory to first-line therapy.
