A Crossover Study to Assess the Effects of Vorinostat (MK0683, SAHA) in Patients With Advanced Cancer (0683-070)(COMPLETED)
A 2-period, crossover study to assess the effects of MK0683 (vorinostat) on the QTc interval in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced cancer.
Advanced Cancer Relapsed|Advanced Cancer Refractory
DRUG: vorinostat|DRUG: Comparator: placebo (unspecified)
Change From Baseline in QTcF at 0.5 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 0.5 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 1 Hour, Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 1 hour|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 2 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 2 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 3 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 3 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 4 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The placebo-corrected change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF change from baseline for placebo at each timepoint from the QTcF change from baseline for vorinostat at each timepoint., Baseline and 4 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 8 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 8 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 12 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 12 hours|Change From Baseline in QTcF at 24 Hours, The Fridericia correction of the QT interval (QTcF) was determined at each time point from five replicate measurements. The change from baseline in QTcF was calculated by subtracting the QTcF value at each timepoint from the QTcF baseline (predose) value., Baseline and 24 hours
