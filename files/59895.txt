These factors include: patient attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived control over participation in clinical studies; doctor-patient relationship; study awareness; evaluation of their own decision to participate in the study, 1 year|The characterization of enrolled patients based on therapeutic compliance., The evaluation of compliance with protocol procedures unrelated to the administration of the experimental drug, such as pharmacokinetic sampling and study biopsies, 1 year|The protocol prescriptions in relation to socioeconomic and geographical determinants., The correlations with metrics of geographic accessibility and income per area of origin will be explored in accordance with ISTAT (Italian National Statistics Institute) data, where applicable., 1 year
The study focuses on defining the problem of geographical accessibility of patients to the Phase 1 facility of the European Institute of Oncology, based on an anonymized extraction of data from the enrolled patient database, to assess national territorial disparities in access to innovative experimental therapies, in relation to various socioeconomic determinants. Finally, information on relevant psychological factors for participation in clinical trials will also be collected.
