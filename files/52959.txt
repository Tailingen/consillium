Study of RP-3500, Camonsertib, in Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of orally-administered RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, or Gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors with ATR inhibitor-sensitizing mutations. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine, examine both the pharmacokinetics (PK)and pharmacodynamics (PD)and investigate its anti-tumor activity in solid tumors.

This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2a, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to:

* Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 (camonsertib) when administered orally, alone and in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine, to establish the dose and schedule recommended for the Phase 2
* Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine
* Identify anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 (camonsertib) given alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine
* Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 (camonsertib) exposure and clinical outcomes.

The initial cohorts will test RP-3500 (camonsertib) as monotherapy. Additional cohorts will enroll with RP-3500 (camonsertib) in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine.

After the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 (camonsertib) will be enrolled to study the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety and PK of RP-3500 (camonsertib) at the RP2D
