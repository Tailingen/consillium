Rapid First Contact Using Virtual Visits to Improve Time-To-Treatment for Uterine Cancer
This project aims to evaluate whether rapid first contact with the oncologist the same day or the next day after pathologic diagnosis contributes to a decreased time to treatment, decreased patient anxiety and increased patient satisfaction.

Time to treatment (time from disease diagnosis to initiation of treatment) impacts outcomes in uterine cancer. When controlled for stage, patients with longer time to treatment tend to have less favorable outcomes. Similarly, longer time to treatment has a negative impact on patients' quality of life and markers for anxiety. Our experience at this institution suggests that the time to referral (time from uterine cancer diagnosis and the patients' first encounter with the oncologist) is variable and presents the greatest opportunity for decreasing time to treatment. Among the factors that contribute to the time to referral are the time taken by the referring provider to relay the diagnosis to the patient, time taken to schedule an appointment with the specialist, and the patient's availability to keep an appointment.

Virtual visits provide an opportunity to expedite consultation with the treating oncologist by removing some of the barriers that delay face-to-face visits. Among these barriers are patients' availability for a short notice face-to-face visit based on their work or family obligations, access to transportation, and mental preparedness.
