Exercise Prehabilitation for Patients With NSCLC Before Surgery
To explore the safety and compliance of a wearable telemedicine device that can receive basic vital signs in real time, and its active supervision mode with real-time adjustment of exercise prescription for preoperative prehabilitation exercises in patients at home; and to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative prehabilitation exercises in a telemedicine active supervision mode in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung tumour resection, taking into account the patient's cardiopulmonary exercise test, postoperative complications and quality of life scores.
