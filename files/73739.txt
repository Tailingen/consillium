Reflectance Confocal Microscopy to Diagnose BCC
It is proposed to undertake a study to determine the diagnostic utility of using RCM for the diagnosis of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) in a tertiary referral centre as outlined by the recent NICE report (Nov 2015). This will allow an assessment of the potential to avoid diagnostic biopsy within the treatment pathway.

Sensitivity and Specificity, Specificity \& Sensitivity of RCM in diagnosing Basal Cell Carcinoma in non-pigmented lesions compared to standard histology, During exam (biopsy results typically available within one week).
intra- & inter-observer agreement for interpreting the RCM images, A measure of how consistently readers can diagnose from confocal images., 6 months
Study Design This is an observational, non-randomised, non-controlled, prospective cohort study to look at the efficacy of in vivo RCM as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of BCC.

Study Hypothesis The hypothesis of this study is that the use of RCM is would enable a reduction in the number of diagnostic biopsies taken before definitive treatment of BCC by at least 50%.

The secondary hypothesis is that the intra- \& inter-observer agreement for interpreting the RCM images will have kappa scores 0.6 or greater (indicating good agreement).

Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of Skin Care Network London.
