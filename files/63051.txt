Dose Escalation of BIBF 1120 Combined With Pemetrexed in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed. Secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of BIBF 1120 and pemetrexed and to obtain preliminary anti-tumour efficacy information.
