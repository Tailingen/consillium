Multiparametric Imaging in Multiple Myeloma
Patients with Multiple Myeloma will undergo single timepoint Positron Emission Tomography imaging with intravenously injected C11 Methionine to detect viable lesions.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: C11 Methionine positron emission tomography
Quantitative measure of C11 Methionine uptake, Standardized uptake value (a semiquantitative, unit less measure of radioactivity normalized for injected activity and body weight) will be measured for individual C11 Methionine uptake abnormalities (defined as focally increased uptake higher than background levels in a similar tissue type). All abnormal uptake not in locations common for benign etiologies, such as fracture and degenerative change, will be measured., 12 months
