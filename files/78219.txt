HAIC Versus TACE for Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma Staged BCLC A/B.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B especially for those with tumor larger than 10 cm. Our previous prospective study also revealed similar results of large HCC patients treated with TACE. Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for HCC with large HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control to demonstrate the superiority of HAIC over TACE.
