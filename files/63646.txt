68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Imaging in Assessment of Prostate Cancer
Dual-time point 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT could increase the lesion detection in PCa patients, it remains difficult to perform in clinical practice. The possibility of one-time point 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging could be achieved using a total-body PET/CT.

DEVICE: total-body PET/CT
Only one-time point scan is possible for PSMA PET/CT, By the use of total- body PET/CT scanner, the imaging quality between the 1 h p.i. and 3 h p.i. imaging acquisition are compared. And the different lesion detection rates at 3 h p.i. and 1 h p.i. are also discussed. The uptake value differences of all lesions are compared., 8 months
