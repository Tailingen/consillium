Previously Untreated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Avastin is a novel antiangiogenic agent that has recently been shown to improve response rates and survival of patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer when added to front-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, and is now being routinely incorporated into the treatment of these patients. Alimta is a recently approved chemotherapeutic that has shown activity against non-small cell lung cancer when given alone and in combination with carboplatin, has a favorable toxicity profile andrequires only a brief (10 minute) infusion time. Therefore we propose to study the combination of Avasin, Alimta, and Carboplatin administered as front-line therapy to patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.
