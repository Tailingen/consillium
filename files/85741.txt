Randomized Phase 2 Study With Gemcitabine Alone and Combination Therapy for Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
To investigate efficacy and safety of gemcitabine combined with cisplatin and of gemcitabine alone by comparison in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin
Percentage of Patients Alive at 1 Year (1-Year Survival Rate), Percentage of patients alive at 1 year., 1 year
Tumor Response, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors - define when cancer patients improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stabilize"), or worsen ("progression") during treatments. Complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) = small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 2 years)|Progression Free Survival, The period from study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact., baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 2 years)
Survival Time, Data of patients lost to follow-up were censored at the last date of confirmation of their survival., baseline to date of death due to any cause (up to 2 years)
