Perioperative Hemodynamic Optimization Using the Photoplethysmography in Colorectal Surgery
The purpose of this study is to determine whether hemodynamic optimization with photoplethysmography (ClearSight, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) during colorectal surgery could decrease the incidence of perioperative complications.
Polyp of Large Intestine|Colorectal Neoplasms|Crohn Disease
DEVICE: Photoplethysmography
Incidence of patients presenting at least one complication after colorectal surgery, Two independent experts defined the presence of complication using an a priori classification., Up to 28 days after surgery (length of hospital stay)
All complications happening after colorectal surgery, Up to 28 days after surgery (length of hospital stay)|Real length of hospital stay, Up to 28 days after surgery (length of hospital stay)|Perioperative mortality, 28 days after surgery
Medico economic evaluation of cost of treatment, Medico economic evaluation of photoplethysmography use will be assessed with a specific unit of measure, using cost of treatment., Up to 28 days after surgery (length of hospital stay)
All patients received the photoplethysmography monitoring, but the monitor was blinded in the control group.
