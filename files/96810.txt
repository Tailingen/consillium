Demonstration of the Medical Interest of the VisioCyt® Artificial Intelligence Test
European, multicenter clinical trial with VisioCyt®, an in vitro diagnostic medical device. VisioCyt® is an innovative solution for the early diagnosis of bladder cancer.
Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
DEVICE: VisioCyt®
Performance of VisioCyt® test vs conventional cytology, Sensibility of the cytological examination of urine with the VisioCyt® test and conventional cytology, all grades and stages combined, 24 months
Specificity, positive and negative predictive value for VisioCyt® test and conventional cytology, Specificity of the cytological examination of urine with the VisioCyt® test and conventional cytology, all grades and stages combined, 24 months
VisioCyt® is based on a patented technology, combining bright-field imaging and artificial intelligence, from a simple urine sample from which the cells are extracted .

The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the medical superiority of the VisioCyt® test versus conventional cytology for detecting recurrence of bladder tumors, in patients monitoring non-muscle infiltrating bladder tumors at high and very high risk of progression
