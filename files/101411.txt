Cadonilimab(AK104) Plus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced, Unresectable, Stage III NSCLC
The goal of this single arm, phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab (AK104) as induction and consolidation therapy in locally advanced/unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Participants will receive 2 cycles of induction therapy with cadonilimab combined with carboplatin/cisplatin plus etoposide, followed by standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (thoracic radiotherapy + carboplatin/cisplatin plus etoposide regimen chemotherapy), and finally consolidation therapy with cadonilimab (AK104) for 1 year.
