Serum and Peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 for Gastric Adenocarcinoma
For preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma, usage of serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may be helpful. Additionally, the prognosis of the patients with gastric adenocarcinoma treated with gastrectrectomy may be associated with serum and peritoneal levels of tumor markers.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: sampling of peritoneal washing aspirate
TNM stage, TNM stage based on the 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer tumor, node, metastasis system., through pathologic report completion, an average of 1 month
peritoneal washing cytology, detection of positive free peritoneal gastric adenocarcinoma cells., through pathologic report completion, an average of 1 month|recurrence/death, detection of recurrence or development of death, through follow-up period, an average of 24 months
Clinical usage of tumor markers on preoperative staging and prediction of peritoneal dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma is a controversial issue. It has been thought that there is a positive correlation between serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 and pathologic features of gastric tumors and peritoneal dissemination.

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum and peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 to predict TNM stages and peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma after curative gastrectomy, and to determine predictive value of these measurements to the development of recurrence and death.
