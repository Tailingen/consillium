Everolimus, Temozolomide, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving everolimus together with temozolomide and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

DRUG: concurrent RAD001 10 mg/day|DRUG: concurrent temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: concurrent RAD001 2.5 mg/day|DRUG: concurrent RAD001 5 mg/day|DRUG: post-radiation RAD001 10 mg/day|DRUG: post-radiation temozolomide
Phase I: Number of Patients With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as any of the following events occurring during the first 8 weeks of treatment with RAD001 and temozolomide and attributable to the study drugs: any grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 4 anemia, or grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days; any non-hematologic grade 3 or greater adverse event (AE), excluding alopecia, despite maximal medical therapy; any grade 4 radiation-induced skin changes; failure to recover from adverse events to be eligible for re-treatment with RAD001 and temozolomide within 14 days of the last dose of either drug; or any episode of non-infectious pneumonitis grade 2, 3, or 4 of any duration. Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE, From start of treatment to eight weeks.|Phase II: Progression-free Survival (PFS), Using the Response Assessment in Neuro- Oncology (RANO) criteria, the progression is defined by any of the following: \> 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids; Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co-morbid events; Any new lesion; Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor or changes in corticosteroid dose; Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition; Clear progression of non-measurable disease. PFS time is defined as time from registration to date of progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). PFS rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Analysis occured after 134 events (progression or death) were reported. Patients were followed from randomization to death or study termination whichever occurs first, up to 36.7 months.
Phase II: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival time is defined as time from/randomization to the date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact., Analysis occured after 134 events (progression or death) were reported. Patients were followed from randomization to death or study termination whichever occurs first, up to 36.7 months.|Phase I: Distribution of Worst Adverse Event Grade, AE reporting in Phase I was split up by treatment timing: concurrent treatment (RT, TMZ, RAD001); post-RT treatment (TMZ, RAD001) along with all AE's reported in follow-up.

The worst/highest grade of any adverse event reported in each time period was determined for each patient. The percentage of patients in each grade level is reported. Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., Analysis occured after 134 events (progression or death) were reported. Patients were followed from randomization to death or study termination whichever occurs first, up to 36.7 months.|Phase II: Distribution of Worst Adverse Event Grade, The worst/highest grade of any adverse event reported was determined for each patient. The percentage of patients in each grade level is reported. Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., Analysis occured after 134 events (progression or death) were reported. Patients were followed from randomization to death or study termination whichever occurs first, up to 36.7 months.
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To define the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus (up to an established dose of 10 mg/day) when combined with concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I)
* To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by adjuvant everolimus in combination with temozolomide, as measured by progression-free survival, in these patients. (Phase II)

Secondary

* To characterize the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide in these patients. (Phase I)
* To determine the overall survival of these patients. (Phase II)
* To further evaluate the safety profile of everolimus in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide in these patients. (Phase II)
* To determine if activation of the Akt/mTOR axis predicts response to everolimus. (Phase II)
* To determine if there is an association between tumor MGMT gene methylation status and response to everolimus. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a phase II, randomized study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
