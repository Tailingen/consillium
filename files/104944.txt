Randomized Study Comparing Local Tumor Control After Post-Operative Single-Fraction or Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery in the Treatment of Spinal Metastases
The purpose of this study is to find out whether giving one higher dose of radiation is as good at treating the tumor in the patient's spine after surgery as giving three lower doses of radiation.
Spinal Metastases
RADIATION: single-fraction SRS|RADIATION: high-dose hypofractionated SRS|BEHAVIORAL: Quality of Life Measures
Local Tumor Control Using MRI or CT, will be radiographically determined according to routine standard of care post-surgical and post-treatment imaging (MRI or CT) of the spine. Local tumor control will be defined as the lack of local tumor progression at the irradiated site on follow-up imaging., 2 years
Treatment-related Toxicity Using CTCAE v4.0, Adverse events will be assessed by the investigators according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, 2 years|Quality of Life Between the Two Cohorts Determined Through Patient-reported Responses of the BPI, will be determined through patient-reported responses of the BPI. Pain severity at its worst (question #5) and the average of the pain interference (average of question #9), 2 years
