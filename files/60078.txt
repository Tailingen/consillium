Early Evaluation of Chemosensitivity for Low/Intermediated-risk Mid-low Stage II/III Rectal Cancer
Chemosensitivity of rectal cancer is not discussed clearly. With previous study, the investigators design this phase II trial to explore the effect of 2 cycles Xelox chemotherapy,so as to explore the early detection of sensitivity of tumor. With inclusion of early,intermediate,and bad stage II/III rectal cancer patients, four cycle of Xelox chemotherapy was given. After the second cycle, MRI,TRUS,DE,endoscopy,and blood DNA test was down to compare with these characteristics of four cycles.so that to detect the data about the chemosensitivity of tumor in the early stage.
