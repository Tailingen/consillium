Daratumumab (HuMax®-CD38) Safety Study in Multiple Myeloma
Establishment of safety profile of HuMax-CD38 when given as monotherapy in participants with multiple myeloma relapsed from or refractory to at least 2 different cytoreductive therapies and without further established treatment options.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Part 1: Daratumumab|DRUG: Part 2: Daratumumab|OTHER: Methylprednisolone|OTHER: Dexamethasone
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Up to Week 28 (for Part 1) and up to approximately 2.5 years (for Part 2)
Overall Response Rate, Overall response defined as percentage of participants who achieved stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR). Per IMWG criteria, sCR: is defined as normal free light chain (FLC) ratio, and absence of clonal plasma cells (PCs) by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2- to 4-color flow cytometry; CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5 % plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or \>= 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100mg/24 hours; PR: \>= 50 % reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein by \>= 90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours; if the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria., Up to Week 28 (for Part 1) and Week 27 (for Part 2)|Part 1: Time to Response, Time to first response was defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better). Time to best response was defined as the time between the date of first dose of daratumumab and the date of the initial evaluation of the best response (PR or better) to treatment. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of time to response and time to best response., Up to Week 28|Part 2: Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the number of days from the date of first infusion (Day 1) to the date of first record of disease progression. Disease progression (IMWG criteria): increase of 25 percent (%) from lowest response level in Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \>=0.5 g/dL); urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24 hour; only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels (absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dL); Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder. Median TTP was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to Week 27|Part 2: Duration of Response as Assessed Using the Method of Kaplan-Meier, Duration of response was calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Up to Week 27|Part 2: Progression-Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the date of first dose of daratumumab and either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to Week 27|Part 2: Time to Response, Time to first response was defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better). Time to best response was defined as the time between the date of first dose of daratumumab and the date of the initial evaluation of the best response (PR or better) to treatment. Time to VGPR (very good partial response) was defined as the time from the date of first dose of daratumumab to the date of initial documentation of VGPR response. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to response., Up to Week 27|Part 2: Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the number of days from administration of the first infusion (Day 1) to date of death. Median Overall Survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Approximately 3 years
This study is conducted in two parts. In part I, participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels. Participant safety and efficacy during part I will determine the doses used for Part II. In part II participants will be enrolled into one of two sequential treatment arms using two of the doses defined in part 1 of the study. Part II was 5 cohorts, 3 with 8 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and 2 with 16 mg/kg. Part I and all but the last cohort in Part II were dosed with Phase 1/ 2 drug product. The last cohort in Part II was dosed with Phase 3 drug product. Both Part I and Part II are open-label/unmasked.
