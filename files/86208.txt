A Phase I Study Evaluating SCB-313 for the Treatment of Subjects With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SCB-313 in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosisa, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or extended study recommended dose (RDE) for SCB-313 intraperitoneal injection, providing a basis for dosing regimen and dose choosing in clinical trial subsequently.
