Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab and IO102-103 for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN).
This research is being done to see if it is safe to give investigational combination of study drugs (Pembrolizumab and IO102-103) before surgery to people with surgically resectable (removable) newly diagnosed or recurrent metastatic SCCHN. This will be done by watching participants closely for possible side effects from Pembrolizumab and IO102-103. In addition, participants will be monitored for any delays to their surgery due to the study drugs.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: IO102-103
Pathologic Treatment Response rate, To determine rate of pathologic treatment response ≥50% (pTR-2) / immune-related pathologic response criteria (irPRC) ≥ 50% rate to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus IO102-IO103 in SCCHN, From neoadjuvant therapy to surgical resection, up to 6 weeks
Major Pathologic Response, To determine the rate of major pathologic response with the neoadjuvant treatment approach, From neoadjuvant therapy to surgical resection, up to 6 weeks|Disease progression, To determine progression-free survival in patients treated with immunotherapy-based neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection, From neoadjuvant therapy to surgical resection, up to 6 weeks|Overall survival, To determine overall survival in patients treated with immunotherapy-based neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection, From neoadjuvant therapy to surgical resection, up to 6 weeks|Overall Safety, To determine the safety and feasibility of the proposed treatment approach including severe adverse events (SAEs), AEs related treatment/surgery delays, and treatment related mortality. AEs and other toxicities will be graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0 (CTCAE), Up to 100 days after the last dose of study drug|ctDNA in comparison to other neoadjuvant treatments, To determine circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) ≥50% response rate compared to another anti-Programed Cell Death protein 1 (PD-1) treated neoadjuvant cohort, 5 years
