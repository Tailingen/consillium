Volrustomig Priming Regimens Exploratory Phase II Platform Study
Purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of volrustomig in combination with other anticancer drugs in participants with specified solid tumors.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Volrustomig|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The safety and tolerability of volrustomig in combination with other anticancer drugs in participants with specified solid tumors will be assessed., From screening (Days -28 to Day -1) up to 2.4 years|Objective Response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Up to 2.4 years
Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a CR or PR or who have stable disease (SD) after the date of randomization or first dose., Up to 2.4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to 2.4 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization or first dose until radiological progression or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to 2.4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization or first dose until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 2.4 years|Serum Concentration of Volrustomig, The serum concentrations volrustomig alone and when used in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with pre-specified solid tumors will be assessed., Up to 2.4 years|Trough concentration (Ctrough), The trough concentrations volrustomig alone and when used in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with pre-specified solid tumors will be assessed., Up to 2.4 years|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), The serum concentrations volrustomig alone and when used in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with pre-specified solid tumors will be assessed., Up to 2.4 years|Area Under the Curve (AUC), The AUC concentrations of volrustomig alone and when used in combination with other anticancer agents in participants with pre-specified solid tumors will be assessed., Up to 2.4 years|Number of Participants with Positive Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs), The incidence of ADAs against volrustomig or other anticancer agents in serum will be assessed., Up to 2.4 years
This is a platform, randomized, open-label, multicenter, global study.

Enrolled participants with Stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSQ NSCLC) who are treatment-na√Øve and have not received previous treatment for advanced or metastatic disease.

These participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: Arm 1A and Arm 1B.

Both arms will test a volrustomig dosing in combination with chemotherapy.
