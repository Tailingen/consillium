VELVET, a Dose Range Finding Trial of Veltuzumab in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis
This is a multi-national, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, 4-arm parallel group trial, comparing three different dose levels (80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg) of veltuzumab to placebo, administered weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) by subcutaneous (sc) injection to subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (cumulative veltuzumab doses 320 mg, 640 mg, and 1280 mg, respectively). All subjects will be on continued stable co-medication with methotrexate (MTX).
Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: Veltuzumab
American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response rate at completion of week 24, ACR20 response rate is defined as improvement from baseline to endpoint fulfilling the following criteria:

* ≥ 20 percent reduction in the Tender joint count (TJC) (66/68 joint count system)
* ≥ 20 percent reduction in the Swollen joint count (SJC) (66/68 joint count system)
* ≥ 20 percent reduction in three of the following additional measures:

  * Patient's assessment of pain
  * Patient's global assessment of disease activity
  * Physician's global assessment of disease activity
  * Degree of disability
  * Level of acute-phase reactant (CRP), 24 weeks
ACR50/70 response rate, ACR50/70 response rate is defined as improvement from baseline to endpoint fulfilling the following criteria:

* 50/70 percent reduction in the TJC (66/68 joint count system)
* 50/70 percent reduction in the SJC (66/68 joint count system)
* 50/70 percent in three of the following additional measures:

  * Patient's assessment of pain
  * Patient's global assessment of disease activity
  * Physician's global assessment of disease activity
  * Degree of disability
  * Level of acute-phase reactant (CRP), 24 and 48 weeks|ACR20 response rate, ACR20 response rate is defined as improvement from baseline to endpoint fulfilling the following criteria:

The trial comprises a screening phase (4 to 12 weeks prior to first administration of veltuzumab), a 4-week treatment phase (weeks 1 to 4), a core phase from week 4 to week 24, and a follow-up phase from week 24 to week 48. The primary end-point, the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) response rate, will be evaluated at week 24.

The objectives of this trial are:

* To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability at week 24 of three different sc dose levels of the humanized anti-CD20 antibody veltuzumab as an add-on treatment to MTX compared to MTX alone in subjects with moderate to severe RA
* To evaluate the durability of the clinical response and safety of veltuzumab over 48 weeks
* To identify the dosage(s) of veltuzumab with the most favourable benefit-risk profile to be further evaluated in the subsequent phase II/III clinical program in subjects with moderate to severe RA.

Current status of the trial: Following the voluntary temporary halt of the VELVET dose range finding trial, the sponsor has decided to redesign the protocol and start a new trial as soon as possible.

All patients treated prior to the voluntary halt have completed their safety assessments. It was decided to terminate the VELVET trial and consequently not to recommence enrollment.

In the VELVET trial, a total of 11 patients received trial medication prior to the voluntary temporary halt. No efficacy conclusions according to protocol can be drawn from the 11 patients treated. Based on the collected clinical data from this trial, there is no clinical safety signal and no increased clinical safety risk observed to date that precludes continued clinical investigation of veltuzumab.
