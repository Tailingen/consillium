Evaluation of IGM-7354 in Adults With Relapsed and/or Refractory Cancer
This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of IGM-7354 in participants with relapsed and/or refractory tumors. The study design consists of a dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage. Study participation will consist of a 28-day screening period, a treatment period, and a safety follow-up period 90-days after the last dose.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: IGM-7354

Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage. The escalation stage will investigate single agent IGM-7354 safety and tolerability in patients with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors. The dose expansion serial biopsy cohort will assess the intra-tumoral PD changes related to the activity of IGM-7354.

IGM-7354 will be administered intravenously (IV).
