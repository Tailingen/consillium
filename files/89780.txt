Designing an Implementation Strategy for Lung Screening and Smoking Cessation Treatment in Community Health Centers
Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the US and a major driver of health disparities. Among our tools for reducing the harms of tobacco is lung cancer screening (LCS). This study will combine a review of existing qualitative and quantitative data on barriers to lung cancer screening and smoking cessation in underserved populations, a quantitative analysis of predictors of lung cancer screening and smoking cessation treatment use among Massachusetts Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC)s, and a stakeholder advisory group to synthesize these data and select implementation strategies that reflects the critical determinants and the strengths and resource constraints of the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) context.

Aim 1) To design an implementation strategy that targets critical components in the delivery of SCT or LCS services for patients who smoke.

Aim 2) To assess the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the implementation strategy among community health center staff.
