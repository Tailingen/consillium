Tolerability of 532 nm Laser Treatment of Port Wine Stains
The goal of this study is to learn about treatment of port wine birthmarks treated with an FDA-approved 532 nm laser.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* How well are the treatments tolerated?
* Are there differences in tolerability of the treatment when a single high fluence laser pulse is used (the standard treatment) versus using multiple low fluence pulses?
* Are there differences in results when using a single high fluence pulse versus multiple low fluence pulses?

type of study: Clinical Trial

Participants will undergo 3 monthly laser treatments with the 532 nm DermaV laser. Part of their birthmark will be treated with the standard single-pulse high fluence approach, and other parts will be treated with the multiple-pulse low fluence approach.
Port-Wine Stain
DEVICE: 532 nm laser treatment
Degree of improvement, For each treatment area within the port wine stain, a blinded investigator will assess improvement (0 - 25%, 26 - 50%, 51 - 75%, 76 - 100%), 6 months
Subject satisfaction, For each treatment area within the port wine stain, subject will assess satisfaction on a 1-4 scale, 6 months|Side effects, subject and treating physician will assess side effects of treatment including pain, swelling, skin discoloration, scar, 6 months
