Intralesional Versus Intramuscular Methotrexate for Non-melanoma Skin Cancers
to compare the effectiveness and safety of intralesional vs. systemic MTX in NMSC management
Non-melanoma Skin Cancers
DRUG: Methotrexate
Reduction in size and number of tumors, Patients were divided into 3 groups: responders (if the tumor has regressed by \> 50%), partial responders (tumor regression \< 50%), and non- responders (no improvement at all or worsening)., up to 1 month after the last session
Adverse effects, Starting from the first session and up to 6-months after the last session|Recurrence, after achieving response greater than 50% of the tumor, till the end of follow up duration (6 months)|New NMSC lesions elsewhere, from the start of the study and till the end of follow up period (6 months)
Intralesional methotrexate (MTX) could to be promising conservative alternative for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Systemic MTX was attempted as adjuvant for locally-advanced NMSC.
