Development and Implementation of Electronic Decision Aids for Genetic Testing in Inherited Cancer Syndromes
An electronic decision aid will be used to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical oncologist instead of a genetic counselor. A decision aid may facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel without a genetic counselor. Upon completion of the decision aid, participants will be asked to indicate their decision about whether to pursue genetic testing and which specific multi-gene panel to pursue. A survey will then be administered to assess participants' opinions on the decision aid.

The average completion time of the decision aid is 14 minutes.
