Clinical Validation of Nutritional Supplements Developed for Pancreaticobiliary Cancer Patients
Decreased bowel function and loss of appetite in patients who underwent pancreaticobiliary surgery contribute impaired nutritional status in postoperative period. It can also affect perioperative and oncologic outcomes negatively. Therefore it is important to improve nutritional status in postoperative period by supply tailor-made optimal diets. The investigators have developed customized postoperative diets and products for pancreaticobiliary cancer patients. The investigators expect that nutritional supplement for pancreaticobiliary patients will increase the food intake rate and contribute a improvement of perioperative outcomes and even oncologic outcomes.
