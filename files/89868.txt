Long-term Safety Study of Paricalcitol Injection in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients With Hemodialysis (HD)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of paricalcitol injection. Subjects will administer clinical supplies 3 times a week, 40 weeks at dialysis session in dose-titration manner, following 12 weeks of treatment in the dose-response study, M10-309 (NCT00667576).

The Percentage of Participants With Hypercalcemia, The percentage of participants with an event of hypercalcemia, defined as at least 1 adjusted calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL or at least 2 consecutive adjusted calcium \>= 11.0 mg/dL during Study M10-312 (Weeks 13 through 53), Anytime from Week 13 through Week 53
The first 12-week period in this study was a dose-response study reported as Study M10-309 (NCT00667576). Only subjects who completed 12 weeks in NCT00667576 were enrolled into this study (M10-312). Baseline in this study was the same as Baseline in NCT00667576. The duration of treatment in Study M10-312 was 40 weeks (for a total of 52 weeks, including NCT00667576).
