Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction After Lymphadenectomy in Melanoma Patients: a Parallel Cohort Pilot Study
To learn if LBP can help to prevent lymphedema when it is performed at the time of surgery rather than after a patient has already developed the disease.
Lymphatic Reconstruction|Lymphadenectomy
PROCEDURE: Lymphovenous bypass (LVB)
Safety and adverse events, Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
To examine if performing lymphovenous bypass (LVB) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) in the melanoma participant population impacts the period prevalence of lymphedema occurrence one year from surgery. To assess wound complications rates occurring in first 30-days post operatively from the time of surgery. To estimate time to drain removal. To estimate the point prevalence of LE following surgery at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following surgery. To estimate the cumulative incidence associated with the first appearance of LE. To assess quality of life and survivorship, using Lymphedema Quality of Life (LYMQOL) questionnaire over the study follow-up domain.
