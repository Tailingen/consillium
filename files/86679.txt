The Impact of Adverse Events, Produced by Antibodies Conjugates, on Quality of Life in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: Multicentric, Observational Study (EVA).
The study stems from the need to detect adverse events arising after the administration of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in a real life context and to correlate the same with the quality of life reported by patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
Adverse events (AEs) arising during treatment and degree of toxicity, Frequency adverse events (AEs) arising during treatment with TDM-1, T-DXd and SG, up to 1 year|Adverse events (AEs) arising during treatment and degree of toxicity, description of degree of toxicity of AEs classified using the international classification system CTCAE (version 5.0), up to 1 year|Quality of life of patients during treatment, To assess the quality of life of patients treated with TDM-1, T-DXd, and SG through the administration of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Results will be reported as median and quartiles, up to 1 year

The study stems from the need to detect adverse events arising after the administration of ADCs used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in a real life context and to correlate the same with the quality of life reported by patients.Through the findings of toxicities related to the ADCs, it will be possible to highlight which are the issues that most affect patients undergoing these cancer treatments. The analysis of the data collected will also make it possible to highlight any toxicities not yet considered or/and of new onset. In addition useful elements may emerge from responses to the quality of life questionnaire, to cope with the difficulties expressed by patients regarding daily life activities, social relations, work and family. Such contributions will be fundamental to the construction of integrated care pathways, the aim of which is to involve a specialized nurse as part of a multidisciplinary team.
