Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for Alisertib in Combination With Paclitaxel, The MTD is defined as the dose range at which ≤ 1 of 6 evaluable participants experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT). DLT was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.02 and was defined as any of the following events: 1. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lasting ≥7 consecutive days; 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; 3. Platelet count \<10,000/mm\^3; 4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; 5. Any other ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, with following exceptions: ≥Grade 3 nausea/emesis, ≥Grade 3 diarrhoea, Grade 3 fatigue, Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that could be controlled to ≤Grade 2 with appropriate treatment; 6.

Banked Tumor Specimens for Candidate Markers of Response to Alisertib and Taxanes, Up to 24 Months
The drug tested in this study was called alisertib. Alisertib was tested to treat people who have ovarian and breast cancer. This study looked at safety, any anti-tumor effect, and it also determined a recommended dose of alisertib plus paclitaxel to take into further studies. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were studied to characterize any effects on the concentration of each of the drugs when administered together.

The study enrolled 191 patients. Participants with Breast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer received one of the following escalating doses of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel in the Phase 1 lead-in portion of the study:

* Alisertib 10 mg BID + Paclitaxel 80 mg/m\^2
* Alisertib 20 mg BID + Paclitaxel 80 mg/m\^2
* Alisertib 20 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2
* Alisertib 30 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2
* Alisertib 40 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2
* Alisertib 50 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2

Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined, participants were randomized to receive the following treatments in the Phase 2 portion of the study:

* Alisertib 40 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m\^2
* Paclitaxel 80 mg/m\^2

This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States, Poland and France. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 5 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and who did not experience disease progression (PD) were followed off-treatment once every 8 weeks until the occurrence of 110 progression-free survival (PFS) events.
