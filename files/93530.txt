Pelvic Exenteration in Treating Patients With Recurrent Cervical Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well pelvic exenteration works in treating patients with recurrent cervical cancer. Pelvic exenteration may be effective in treating recurrent cervical cancer.
Cervical Adenocarcinoma|Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma|Cervical Small Cell Carcinoma|Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Conventional Surgery
Overall survival, From entry to protocol to death; or for living patients, the date of last contact, up to 93 years|Progression-free survival, From study entry to date of reappearance or increasing parameters of disease or death, or to date of last contact for patients without disease progression, up to 93 years
Impact of surgery therapy (exenteration and reconstructive surgery type) on quality of life assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-CX), At baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months post exenteration
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Correlate progression-free survival and overall survival with tumor size, time interval between primary cancer management and pelvic exenteration, and presence or absence of pelvic sidewall fixation by clinical examination in patients with recurrent cervical cancer treated with pelvic exenteration.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine quality of life of patients treated with this procedure. II. Correlate quality of life with reconstructive technique (e.g., no ostomy or â‰¥ 1 ostomy) in patients treated with this procedure.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo pelvic exenteration within 14 days after study entry. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
