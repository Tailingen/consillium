MiVideo - Video Visit Summary for Cancer Patients
Cancer patients about to begin chemotherapy receive large amounts of information regarding their prognosis, how chemotherapy improves their prognosis, and the usual side effects of the chemotherapy during their first visit to the oncologist. Prior studies have documented that less than half of this information is retained after the visit, making it difficult for patients to participate in their care and difficult for them to enlist the help of their social support. The MiVideo project allows the physician to create a custom 5-minute summary video summary of a pre-chemotherapy clinic visit and upload it to a secure web site. The video will emphasize the major points of the forty-five minute office discussion, allowing patients to review the physicians' recommendations and share the information and recommendations with others. By providing the patient with this re-cap of their visit, the investigators hope to engage them more actively in their cancer treatment. Making the information available to friends and family can also help a patient receive both intellectual and emotional support during the course of treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is improvement of patient care, not research activity.

Primary Hypothesis: Creating a 5-minute video summarizing information about diagnosis, stage, chemotherapy treatment plan, and anticipated side effects for patients starting chemotherapy for colon cancer will not significantly lengthen the pre-chemotherapy clinic visit as compared to visits that do not include video production.
