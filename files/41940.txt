Study to Assess AFM24 in Advanced Solid Cancers
AFM24-101 is a first in human Phase 1/2a open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, multiple ascending dose escalation/expansion study evaluating AFM24 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.

AFM24 is a tetravalent bispecific (anti-human EGFR x anti-human CD16A) innate immune cell engaging recombinant antibody being developed to target EGFR-expressing solid tumors and has been designed to specifically utilize the cytotoxic potential of the innate immune system, in particular natural killer cells and macrophages for the specific and efficient elimination of EGFR expressing cancer cells.

Partial or complete response needs to be confirmed with repeated assessment at least 4 weeks after the initial assessment by local reader., From the start of first infusion till the last infusion + 30 days, up to approximately 43 weeks.|Phase 1: Duration of Response Rate (DOR), The DOR defined as time from first assessment of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to follow-on first assessment of progressive disease will be summarized by descriptive statistics including median DOR and where appropriate the respective 95% CIs., through study completion (estimated up to 24 weeks)|Phase 1: Disease Control Rate (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) +Stable Disease (SD)), Disease control at months 3, 6, and 9, as defined by achieving CR and/or PR and/or SD assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., From the start of first infusion till the last infusion + 30 days, up to approximately 43 weeks.
There will be two parts to this study: a dose escalation phase (1) and a dose expansion phase (2a).

The aim of the dose escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and establish the recommended Phase 2a dose (RP2D).

The dose escalation phase will be followed by the dose expansion phase once the MTD/RP2D of AFM24 monotherapy has been determined. The dose expansion phase of the study using the MTD/P2D is intended to collect preliminary evidence of efficacy and to further confirm the safety of AFM24 as a monotherapy. The expansion phase will have 3 arms based on tumor type.

* Renal cell carcinoma(clear cell), failing standard of care (SoC) that includes TKIs and PD1 targeted therapy
* Non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR-mut), failing SoC TKIs
* Colorectal cancer, failing SOC chemotherapy, VEGF(R) and EGFR targeted antibodies
