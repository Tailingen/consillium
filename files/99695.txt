Almonertinib With Bevacizumab for EGFR-Mutant NSCLC Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastasis
A prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm study of Almonertinib combined With Bevacizumab for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with leptomeningeal metastasis.
NSCLC|Leptomeningeal Metastasis|EGFR Activating Mutation
DRUG: Almonertinib|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of enrollment until death due to any cause, From date of enrollment until the date of death, up to 2 years
Time to Symptom Resolution, Time to symptom resolution is the time from first drug dosage date (C1D1) until the date of symptom resolution, From baseline, then every 3 weeks, up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from date of enrollment until the date of PD (by investigator assessment) or death, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response (CR+PR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease(CR+PR+SD), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is the time from date of first documented response until the date of PD (by investigator assessment) or death, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Intracranial Progression Free Survival (iPFS), Intracranial progression-free survival, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Intracranial Objective Response Rate (iORR), Intracranial objective response rate, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Intracranial Disease Control Rate (iDCR), Intracranial disease control rate, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Intracranial Duration of Response (iDoR), Intracranial duration of response, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Extracranial Progression Free Survival (ePFS), Extracranial progression-free survival, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Extracranial Objective Response Rate (eORR), Extracranial objective response rate, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Extracranial Disease Control Rate (eDCR), Extracranial disease control rate, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Extracranial Duration of Response (eDoR), Extracranial duration of response, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, up to 2 years|Assess the safety of Almonertinib Combined With Bevacizumab, Number of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), From baseline, then every 3 weeks, up to 2 years
Evaluate the correlation between the results of CSF genetic testing and drug resistance mechanisms, Evaluate the correlation between the results of CSF genetic testing and drug resistance mechanisms, CSF samples will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 and within one week after disease progression (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib combined with Bevacizumab for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with leptomeningeal metastasis. ALL patients were treated with Almonertinib 110mg oral daily and Bevacizumab 15mg/kg intravenous every 3 weeks. Study therapy continued until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event, or withdrawal of consent.
