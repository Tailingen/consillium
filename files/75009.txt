Topical Remetinostat Gel as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)
The primary purpose of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of topical remetinostat applied three times daily will suppress Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Remetinostat
Overall Response (OR), Overall response (OR) will be assessed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Objective response (OR) will defined as the number of lesions with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) among all eligible and treated lesions, any time within 10 weeks.

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of target lesion
* Partial Response (PR) = â‰¥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesion
* Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 10 weeks
Adverse Events Contributing to Treatment Discontinuation or Interruption, Adverse events (AEs) contributing to treatment discontinuation or interruption are reported as the number of such events, a number without dispersion., 8 weeks|Participants Who Discontinued Treatment or Had Treatment Interruption, The number of participants who discontinued treatment or experienced treatment interruption within the first 8 weeks of treatment are reported as the number of such participants, a number without dispersion., 8 weeks
The primary purpose of this study is:

* to determine if 8 weeks of topical remetinostat gel applied 3 times daily (TID) under occlusion will suppress SCC growth
* to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of SCCs after 8 weeks of treatment with topical remetinostat gel 1%, as measured by at least 30% decrease in greatest area (in mm2).

  * Subjects with at least 1 biopsy-proven cutaneous SCC will be recruited for this study.
  * Subjects will apply remetinostat gel 1% to at least 1 SCC.
  * Non-invasive cutaneous SCC lesions, including Bowen's disease, are also eligible for this study
  * There is 1 treatment option: Topical remetinostat gel 1% applied 3 times daily.
  * The study is a single arm, open label design
  * For purposes of ClinicalTrials.gov, there is no secondary outcome.
