Gemcitabine With or Without CI-994 in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug or giving drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without CI-994 in treating patients who have advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: tacedinaline
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy and safety of CI-994 given in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

OUTLINE: Gemcitabine is the standard of care for pancreatic cancer and is administered by intravenous injection. Patients receive gemcitabine once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Patients take the capsules (placebo or investigational chemotherapy) daily for 21 consecutive days beginning with the first gemcitabine infusion. The duration of treatment is determined by the patient's tolerance of therapy and the assessment of disease response.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 172 patients will be enrolled in Canada, Europe, and the United States on a competitive basis.
