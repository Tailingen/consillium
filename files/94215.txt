Cervical Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Sarcoma|Thromboembolism|Vaginal Cancer|Vulvar Cancer
DRUG: fondaparinux sodium
Number of Patients With Venous Thromboembolism at Week 4, Venous thromboembolism is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system., Week 4 (Days 28-35)
Number of Patients Who Achieved Thromboembolism Prophylaxis at Week 4., This is a count of patients who did not have a clot (thromboembolism) occur during the 4 weeks of study - attributed to the use of Fondaparinux (study dry). Prophylaxis is a measure taken for the prevention of a disease or condition., Week 4
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the efficacy of prolonged (4 weeks) fondaparinux sodium administration in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients undergoing gynecologic oncology surgery.

Secondary

* Evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks).
* Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients (4 weeks).

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Beginning after surgery, patients receive fondaparinux sodium subcutaneously once daily on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremities between day 28-35.
