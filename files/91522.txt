Feasibility of Intratumoral Washing Fluid for Detecting EGFR Mutations in Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relevance of intratumoral washing for detection of EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|EGFR Gene Mutation
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ultarthin bronchoscopy with intratumoral washing
The DNA and EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) detection rate in intratumoral washing fluid, Defined as the number of DNA and EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) detection divided by the total attempts of intratumoral washing by ultrathin bronchoscopy., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The concordance rate of EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) detection rate among intratumoral washing fluid, plasma, and tissue, The concordance rate of EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) detection rate in intratumoral washing fluid, compared with plasma and tissue (gold standard)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|The EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) sensitivity and specificity in intratumoral washing fluid, The sensitivity and specificity of EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) in intratumoral washing fluid compared with tissue (gold standard)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) including rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR) including rate of CR, PR and stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) the time from first dose of the study drug until the date of progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 or death by any cause., through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label study to assess evaluate the relevance of intratumoral washing by ultrathin bronchoscopy (outer diameter; 3mm) for detection of EGFR mutation (including T790M positivity) using cobas real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR (DDPCR) in patients with NSCLC.
