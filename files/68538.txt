Universal- Versus Guidelines-Directed Genetic Testing for Germline Pathogenic Variants Utilizing a Multi-Gene Panel for Inherited Cancers in Non-Western Society.
The investigators aim to study the pattern and frequency of pathogenic variants among ALL newly diagnosed cancer patients in a genetically distinct population.

Additionally, the investigators will study the uptake rate of "cascade family screening", frequency of pathogenic variants and barriers against testing.
Genetic Predisposition
Prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants among newly diagnosed cancer patients tested by universal multigene panel testing, 2021-2023|Number of participants with variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as assessed by universal multigene panel testing, 2021-2023|To determine the reasons/ Barriers for refusal of genetic cascade testing among newly diagnosed cancer patients., 2021-2023
Rate of cascade of family member testing of the participants with positive pathogenic mutation, The family of tested patients with pathogenic mutations will be offered the genetic testing, 2021-2023|Prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations among tested family members of the participants with pathogenic mutations using the universal multigene panel, 2021-2023|Prevalence of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) among tested family members of participants with pathogenic mutations as assessed by universal multigene panel testing, 2021-2023|To determine the reasons/ Barriers for refusal of genetic cascade testing among family members of tested patients with pathogenic mutation, 2021-2023
