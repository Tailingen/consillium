A EUropean REgistry and Sample Sharing networK to Promote the Diagnosis and Management of Light Chain Amyloidosis (EUREKA)
A prospective patients' registry collecting all new cases of AL amyloidosis evaluated at referral Centers from across Europe and a sample sharing network will be created to study mechanisms of the disease through the use of advanced molecular technologies and big data analysis tools.
AL Amyloidosis
Mortality at 24 months by stage, Mortality at 24 months by stage will be evaluated, 24 months from diagnosis
Rate of hematologic relapse in Complete Response patients at 2 years by MRD status, Rate of hematologic relapse in Complete Response patients at 2 years by MRD status will be evaluated, 2 years from diagnosis
In the frame of the EUREKA Consortium, a patients' registry collecting all new cases of AL amyloidosis evaluated at referral Centers across Europe or at their satellite sites will be created, in association with a cross-border biorepository and sample sharing network for the study of both disease-causing light chains and plasma cells with advanced molecular technologies. A dedicated site will support the Consortium with big data analysis and artificial intelligence applied to health. The aims are: 1) Defining the impact of advanced molecular technologies to promote early diagnosis and guide therapeutic choices; 2) describing the natural history of the disease in a representative cohort of AL patients in the contemporary era of effective anti-plasma cell therapies; 3) investigating and refining novel advanced technologies to detect with high sensitivity residual disease-causing plasma cells/light chains in patients achieving a complete hematologic response to therapy (minimal residual disease, MRD).
