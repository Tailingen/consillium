Exploratory Study of the Microbiome of Upper Gastrointestinal in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Primary Lung Cancer
This is an exploratory, single-center, being conducted at Beijing Haidian Hospital in order to detect the relationship between microbiome of upper gastrointestinal and pathogenesis of multiple primary lung cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microbiome Profiling and Symptom Assessment
Microbial homology between upper gastrointestinal (UGI) microbiota and intratumoral microbiota, Based on 16S rDNA sequencing data, calculate the Bray-Curtis similarity index between the intratumoral microbiota and the patient's own upper gastrointestinal (UGI) microbiota. Use SourceTracker2 to quantify the contribution of UGI microbiota to the intratumoral microbiota. Apply PERMANOVA analysis to compare the differences in microbiota similarity between the MPLC and SPLC groups., Sequencing and analysis will be completed within 6 months after sample collection.
This study intends to analyze the bacterial community structure of respiratory tract, upper digestive tract, lesion and adjacent to cancer in patients with multiple primary lung cancer, and to explore the association between upper digestive tract bacterial community and lung microecology, in order to find the characteristics of upper digestive tract bacterial strains involved in regulating lung cancer microenvironment, and explore the possible interaction mechanism between upper digestive tract bacterial community and lung cancer gene mutation.
