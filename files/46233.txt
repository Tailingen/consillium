Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of Balstilimab in Combination With Botensilimab for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (IMMONC0008)
The goal of this study is to see if the combination of immunotherapy agents botensilimab and balstilimab is safe and effective in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a first-line treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Botensilimab + Balstilimab
12-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS), 12-Month PFS is defined as the proportion of patients who remain alive and progression-free at 12 months from the first dose of investigational drug, where tumor progression is documented per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST) as assessed by investigator., First dose to up to 12 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, as assessed by investigator., First dose to up to 6 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response or stable disease per the RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST criteria., First dose to up to 6 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from initial objective radiographic response per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by investigator until the first documentation of progression or death, whichever occurs first., First dose to up to 48 months|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from the first dose of investigational drug to the start date of a subsequent line of therapy., First dose to up to 48 months|Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS Time is defined as the time from the first dose of investigational drug until death to any cause., First dose to up to 48 months|Frequency, severity, and duration of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (Safety and tolerability), Adverse events (AEs) according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), serious adverse events, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or death., First dose to up to 27 months|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), HRQoL is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30., First dose to up to 25 months|Health-related quality of life according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer (EORTC QLQ-LC29), Patient-reported outcome assessed using EORTC QLQ-LC29, First dose to up to 25 months|Health-related quality of life according to the 5 Level EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, Patient-reported outcome assessed using EQ-5D-5L, First dose to up to 25 months|Correlation between baseline expression of PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 12-month progression-free survival, PD-L1 expression at baseline will be assessed via immunohistochemistry and categorized into negative (\<1%), low expression (1-49%), and high expression (\>50%), and its correlation with 12-month progression-free survival will be investigated., First dose to up to 24 months|Correlation between baseline expression of PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and objective response rate, PD-L1 expression at baseline will be assessed via immunohistochemistry and categorized into negative (\<1%), low expression (1-49%), and high expression (\>50%), and its correlation with objective response rate will be investigated., First dose to up to 24 months|Correlation between existence of liver metastases on imaging at baseline and 12-month progression-free survival, Presence of liver metastases at baseline will be assessed via imaging and its correlation with 12-month progression-free survival will be investigated., First dose to up to 24 months|Correlation between existence of liver metastases on imaging at baseline and objective response rate, Presence of liver metastases at baseline will be assessed via imaging and its correlation with objective response rate will be investigated., First dose to up to 24 months|Level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at baseline and at different time points after start of treatment, Level of ctDNA will be measured at screening, after start of treatment at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and at treatment discontinuation/disease progression., First dose to up to 24 months
This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of botensilimab and balstilimab in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will enroll participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC and without targetable EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement, while excluding those with untreated brain metastases or oligometastatic disease lacking targetable lesions.

The total estimated maximum time of study participation for each patient is approximately 49 months across 3 periods:

* Screening Period: approximately 28 days
* Treatment Period: up to 24 months, or until any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the study occurs
* Follow-up Period: up to 24 months from last dose of study treatment for every patient who is alive

Study Duration

* Recruitment: 2 years
* Treatment: 2 years
* Follow-up: 2 years
