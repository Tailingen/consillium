Psychological Factors Influencing Cancer Post-traumatic Growth
The study focuses on post-traumatic growth (positive changes linked to appreciation of life, personal strengths, social relationships...) in the context of different types of cancer and with a longitudinal approach to the care pathway. The aim of the study is to better understand whether psychological variables (emotional competence, psychological flexibility, psychological distress) and patients' care satisfaction, assessed at the start of the cancer treatment pathway, can influence their post-traumatic growth at the end of the chemotherapy protocol and 6 months later.
