Assessing Radio-hybrid Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (rhPSMA-7.3) (18F) in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects With Prostate Cancer
A Phase 1, Open-label Study to Assess Safety, Biodistribution, and Internal Radiation Dosimetry of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Injection in Healthy Volunteers, and to Assess Safety and Investigate the Imaging Characteristics in Subjects With Prostate Cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Injection
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as classified by MedDRA, Safety will be assessed from data on the occurrence of one or more treatment-emergent Adverse Events from the time of intravenous administration of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 throughout the study period, and changes in serum biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, vital signs, Electrocardiogram (ECG), injection site status, and physical examination findings., 1 month
