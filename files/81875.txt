Study of Bortezomib and Docetaxel for Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
This study is for patients who have been treated with surgical removal of the testes or hormone therapy (Lupron or Zoladex) and whose prostate cancer has worsened despite this treatment.

PS 341 is a type of drug known as a "proteasome inhibitor." By inhibiting the "proteasome" in cancer cells, PS-341 alters the way those cells divide). We hope to learn whether this combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests (prostate specific antigen, also called PSA), and to determine how frequently serious side effects might occur with this treatment for this stage of prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: PS 341|DRUG: Docetaxel
Number of patients with improved serum PSA response rate, Participants should be reevaluated for PSA response every 21 days. A confirmatory PSA level should be obtained 3-4 weeks following initial documentation of a PSA response., Every end of each cycle (21 days) up to 12 cycles
Pain response rate, Participants will be considered evaluable for a pain response if the baseline analgesic use was determined, and at least 4 weekly assessments of PPI and analgesic score are available from any 8-week period from the period after the initiation of therapy until discontinuation of study medication., At baseline, then weekly for 4 weeks up to 36 weeks
