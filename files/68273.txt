Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma With Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and IL-2 Following Lympho-depleting Chemotherapy
Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumors from patients with advanced melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with anti-tumor reactivity. These TIL can be expanded in the laboratory to large numbers, and reinfused to the patient. Using a chemotherapy regimen that selectively kills lymphocytes, a single institution Phase II study of 35 patients showed a 51% objective response rate to TIL and interleukin-2 injection. In the present trial we would like to investigate whether we can achieve similar results in a Hadassah Phase II study, and to determine the feasibility of applying this approach to patients with advanced melanoma who currently have few treatment options.
