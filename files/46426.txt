Pharmacodynamic Study to Assess the Anti-proliferative Activity of the PARP Inhibitor Olaparib in Patients With HPV Positive and HPV Negative HNSCC
This is an open label pilot study evaluating the pharmacodynamics and safety of single agent olaparib administered at 300mg bid (twice a day) for 14 days orally in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) -positive and human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Olaparib
Change in Level of IHC-Ki-67 expression, Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed for proliferation (IHC-Ki-67) Ki-67 is a nuclear non-histone protein that is present at low levels in quiescent cells but is increased in proliferating cells. Thus, Ki-67 reactivity, defined as percent tumor cells staining positive as measured by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, is a specific nuclear marker for cell proliferation., Baseline and 14 days
Change in Tissue apoptosis, Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed for apoptosis. For example using the IHC-cleaved caspase-3 assay., Baseline and 14 days|Change in DNA repair pathways, Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed to determine effect on DNA repair pathways (PARP activity). Specifically Poly(ADP-ribose) immunohistochemical staining of tissue biopsies will be performed and PAR intensity scored as 0 (no signal), 1 (weak), 2 (strong intensity in \>50% of tumor cells)., Baseline and 14 days
