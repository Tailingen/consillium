Comparing Pressure Versus Simple Adhesive Dressing After Mohs Reconstruction
The purpose of this study is to determine whether using a pressure- vs. simple adhesive dressing affects the postoperative course and wound healing outcomes following Mohs surgery.
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer
OTHER: Pressure Dressing|OTHER: Simple Adhesive Dressing
Patient Satisfaction, Patients are asked to complete a survey regarding their satisfaction with their post-operative dressing. Surveys will be distributed at their first clinical follow-up visit. They are asked to rate their overall satisfaction and difficulty sleeping, bathing, and returning to normal activity following their Mohs procedure., Assessed at the first clinical follow-up visit, 1-2 weeks following Mohs procedure|Complications, The number of complications requiring medical attention in each arm of the study. These complications include: infection, bleeding, wound dehiscence, splitting or retained stitches, pain, and cosmetic disfigurement., Assessed at the first clinical follow-up visit, 1-2 weeks following Mohs procedure
The investigators will randomize patients undergoing Mohs surgery to receive either a pressure or a simple adhesive dressing following their procedure. The hypothesis is that patients with the simple adhesive dressings will be more satisfied and comfortable with their wound care on follow-up. These patients are also expected to cite greater convenience managing the simple dressing at home. Finally, the investigators anticipate no difference in the number of postoperative complications between the two groups and expect that there will be a lower cost associated with the simple adhesive dressing as compared to the pressure dressing.
