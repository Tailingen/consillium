The PIONEER-01 Study of the Imagio Breast Imaging System
This is a prospective controlled multi-center study involving gray scale (B-mode) ultrasound vs OA/US (opto-acoustic and gray scale ultrasound) for the visualization of suspicious masses. Imagio gray scale and OA image sets will be collected on each enrolled mass and pushed to an Imaging Core Lab for processing and then to a set of Independent Readers who will read the Imagio gray-scale images vs the Imagio OA/US images.

DEVICE: Imagio OA/US (US and OA/US)|DEVICE: Imagio gray scale ultrasound
Specificity Difference Between Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) vs Imagio Gray-scale Ultrasound (IUS), Primary effectiveness endpoint was the difference in specificity for the Imagio OA/US relative to IUS, across all 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth), Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up
Sensitivity Difference Between Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) vs Imagio Gray-scale Ultrasound (IUS), Sensitivity difference for Imagio OA/US Imagio relative to IUS, across all 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth), Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up|Specificity for Each Imaging Modality Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale OA/US and Imagio Gray-scale Ultrasound (IUS), Specificity for each imaging modality, Imagio OA/US (Imagio) and IUS, across all 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth), Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up|Sensitivity for Each Imaging Modality Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) and Imagio Gray-scale Ultrasound (IUS), Sensitivity for each imaging modality, Imagio OA/US and IUS, across all 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth), Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up|Downgrade Benign Masses Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) vs Imagio Gray-scale Imaging (IUS), Percentage of reads where breast mass was downgraded from one BI-RADS (BR) category to a lower BR category on the basis of additional information from the Imagio OA/US imaging modality compared to IUS, includes reads of each of 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth). BR categories used in this study: 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up|Upgrade Cancer Masses - Imagio Optoacoustic Plus Gray-scale (OA/US) vs Imagio Gray-scale Imaging (IUS), Percentage of reads where breast mass was upgraded from one BI-RADS (BR) category to a higher BR category on the basis of additional information from the Imagio optoacoustic plus grayscale (OA/US) imaging modality compared to Imagio grayscale (IUS), includes reads of each of 7 independent readers; both imaging modalities used in each subject (subject as own control); results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth). BR categories used in this study: 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, Baseline to 12 months +/- 30 days follow-up
Imagio is a multi-modality device, comprised of one probe with the ability to image with diagnostic gray scale (B mode) ultrasound alone and gray scale in conjunction with OA together in a six up image.
