Genetic Profile on Predicting Sensibility of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy on Locally Advanced Rectal Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to find some genetic factors in predicting the sensibility of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal carcinoma.
Rectal Neoplasms
RADIATION: preoperative concurrent chemoradiation
gene expression in different response groups, 6 months after radical surgery
overall survival, disease free survival and local-regional free survival, 3 years after pre-operative chemoradiotherapy
toxicity, any G3/4 toxicities according to CTC 3.0, during concurrent chemoradiation
For locally advanced rectal carcinoma,preoperative chemoradiotherapy(CRT) achieved similar overall survival and better local control compared with postoperative therapy,so it was considered to be one of the standard therapy of these patients.But,not every one will be cured,the possible reason is the difference gene expression and mutation status among patients.So,we performed this trial to study the relationship between genetic factors and response of preoperative CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.
