A Phase I First in Human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of WGI-0301 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of a study medicine, WGI-0301 to find the best dose for treating solid tumors, and to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is for patients with solid tumors.

The study is also done to learn how the study drug is taken up by your body; this is called Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and how the study drug affects the body; this is called Pharmacodynamics (PD)
