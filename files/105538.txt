Near-Infrared Autofluorescence With PTH Test Strip as an SOP of Parathyroid in Thyroid Surgery
This is a prospective study aiming to establish near-infrared autofluorescence technology and PTH test strip as a standardized process for finding and identifying parathyroid glands in thyroid surgery.

Positive tissue identify by NIFRA, Surgical specimens were photographed with NIRAF, and the location and amount of positive tissue were recorded and marked on the neck map., During operation, Surgical specimens were photographed with NIRAF, and the location and amount of positive tissue were recorded and marked on the neck map.|Suspicious parathyroid tissue found by surgeons, Surgeons looked for suspicious parathyroid tissue with the naked eye and divided them into less than 10% confidence group, 10-90% confidence group, and greater than 90% confidence group. These tissues are tested with PTH strips to confirm that they are parathyroid tissue., During operation, Surgeons looked for suspicious parathyroid tissue with the naked eye and These tissues are tested with PTH strips to confirm that they are parathyroid.|number of strategic parathyroid transplantation, The parathyroid glands that had been discovered during the operation that could not be preserved in situ were excluded from the procedure comparison and classified as strategic parathyroid transplantation., During operation, The parathyroid glands that had been discovered during the operation that could not be preserved in situ were excluded from the procedure comparison and classified as strategic parathyroid transplantation.
inspect duration, inspect duration in difference method, During operation, From initial examination to finding suspicious parathyroid tissue, excluding subsequent PTH testing steps|The number of parathyroid glands in pathological report, The number of parathyroid glands in pathological report, Up to 4 weeks, The number of parathyroid glands in pathological report excludes fragments of parathyroid glands less than 3mm in diameter.
This is a prospective study aiming to establish near-infrared autofluorescence technology and PTH test strip as a standardized process for finding and identifying parathyroid glands in thyroid surgery.

NIFRA first photographed all specimens from thyroidectomy with or without central neck dissection, and positive tissues under near-infrared light were recorded in a neck map. Then, a senior surgeon examined the parathyroid glands with the naked eye. These suspicious tissues were then identified with the PTH test strip as a gold standard. Finally, the parathyroid glands discovered during the operation that could not be preserved in situ were excluded from the procedure comparison and classified as strategic parathyroid transplantation.
