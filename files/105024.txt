The Study of Automated Telephone Programs for the Maintenance of Dietary Change

This study will deliver a health program using an automated telephone system. The programs will be designed to help individuals maintain a healthy diet change for a lifetime.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Social Cognitive Theory|BEHAVIORAL: goal system theory
The study hypothesis is that the goal systems intervention will out perform the social cognitive intervention and that both of these interventions will outperform the control group for fruit and vegetable consumption., July 2006-July 2009
Intervention effects will be mediated by behavioral factors predicted by Social Cognitive Theory and Goal Systems Theory., July 2006-July 2009
RCT is completed. However, the eligibility was 18 y/o or greater and living in Greater Boston area. The participants used an evidenced based dietary intervention for 3 months and then were randomized to 1 of 3 arms. Those in the experimental arm received a 6 mo intervention based on social cognitive theory or goal systems theory. The intervention was designed to help the participants maintain previously achieved changes in the their diet, e.g., fruits and vegetables. The outcome measures are fruit and vegetable consumption as measured by servings on multiple dietary measures as well as a 24 hr dietary recall.
