Study of Mini-Chop Plus Ofatumumab To Treat Cd 20+ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma In Patients Aged Over 80 Years
This study is a multicentric, phase II, open-label, non-randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of O-miniCHOP in patients aged over 80 years with non previously treated CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (age-adjusted IPI=0 to3), stage I, II, III or IV with a performance status ECOG from 0 to 4.

The anticipated study dates (start / end) are: 2010 - 2013. The study will evaluate a cohort of 120 patients (approximately 95 in France, 15 in Belgium, 5 in Switzerland and 5 in Portugal).

Patients will be recruited over 30 months and followed at least one year after the last patient has been included.

The duration of the treatment period is approximately 20 weeks.
