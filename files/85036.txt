Two Different Schedules of Palbociclib + Second Line Endocrine Therapy in Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER2 Neg Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of endocrine therapy and Palbociclib at a daily dose of 100 mg will result in a better response to therapy with fewer dose interruptions than the proposed dosing regimen of 125 mg daily for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with endocrine therapy.

DRUG: Palbociclib 100mg|DRUG: Palbociclib 125mg|DRUG: Fulvestrant or Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitor
Progression Free Survival Using the RECIST 1.1 Criteria, progression free survival (PFS) is defined as time from randomization to progression or death from any cause. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 2 years
Number of Participants With Response or No Response, Response rate = Number of (Complete response + partial response) / total treated patients. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 2 years|Duration of Response, For patients with complete or partial response, duration of response is defined as days from first recorded response to the first date of recurrent or progression or death., 2 years|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death of any cause., 2 years
The standard or usual treatment of this type of breast cancer is endocrine therapy. Palbociclib is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests as well as studies in animals and people show that it may help slow the growth of breast cancer. The most widely tested regimen of Palbociclib for patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer is 125 mg every day for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy. This study explores if administering a lower dose of palbociclib - 100 mg given every day of a 28 day cycle in combination with standard endocrine (hormone) therapy - may result in more tumour shrinkage and be better tolerated.
