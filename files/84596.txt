The Effect of Isoquercetin on Thromboembolic Events in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy of isoquercetin as compared to the placebo in prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Venous Thromboembolism|Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Isoquercetin|DRUG: Placebo
Effectiveness of Isoquercetin, The primary endpoint is the time to the first positively adjudicated thromboembolic event (TE) over 16 weeks post randomization as compared to the placebo., 16 weeks|Effectiveness of Isoquercetin, The composite endpoint includes any proximal or distal lower extremity DVT, any pulmonary embolism, fatal pulmonary embolism diagnosed on autopsy, catheter-related thrombosis, visceral thrombosis or arterial thrombosis. Events will be classified as incidental or symptomatic: incidental TE will be so classified if the imaging was ordered primarily for staging or re-staging or conducted for reasons other than identification of a thrombosis as compared to the placebo., 16 weeks
To assess the risk of TE defined as proximal or distal lower extremity DVT, any pulmonary embolism, fatal pulmonary embolism diagnosed on autopsy, or arterial thrombosis, To assess the risk of TE defined as proximal or distal lower extremity DVT, any pulmonary embolism, fatal pulmonary embolism diagnosed on autopsy, or arterial thrombosis over 16 weeks post randomization in patients treated with isoquercetin compared with placebo., 16 weeks|To assess the risk of major hemorrhage, To assess the risk of major hemorrhage in patients treated with isoquercetin compared with placebo according to ISTH definition. The criteria for major hemorrhage in non-surgical patients is:

* Fatal bleeding, and/or
* Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or
* Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level ≥ 2 g/L or
* Bleeding leading to a transfusion ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, 16 weeks
Approximately one-third of all pancreatic cancer patients suffer from a venous thromboembolism (VTE). The greatest risk of thrombosis is observed in the first three months following the start of chemotherapy. The development of distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer increases the risk of VTE approximately 4-fold.

Isoquercetin is a more bioavailable form of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonol, intended to prevent thromboembolic events in cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of isoquercetin in prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

This trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, Phase 3 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who are initiating chemotherapy.
