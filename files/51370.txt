CellFX Comparison to Cryosurgery in Cutaneous Non-Genital Common Warts
This prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized comparison study is designed to compare the safety and effectiveness of the CellFX System to Cryosurgery for the clearance of cutaneous non-genital common warts on all areas of the body excluding the scalp, nose, within the orbital region of the face, plantar or periungual area in healthy adult subjects.

Percentage of Warts Resolved, The primary effectiveness endpoint is the percentage of warts resolved or cleared as assessed "live" by the blinded site investigator at 30 days after the last treatment with CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure., 30 days following the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure up to a maximum of 3 months|Percentage of Warts Treated With Skin Textural Changes, The safety endpoint is the percentage of warts with skin textural changes where the wart was originally treated and showed textual changes of the surrounding skin where the wart was treated and included; scabbing, swelling, crusting, blister, or ulceration when assessed by the blinded site investigator., 30 days from the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure up to a maximum of 3 months|Presence of Pigmentary and Scarring Skin Changes, The skin change safety event is defined as the presence of hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, or scarring as assessed by the blinded site investigator., 90 days from the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure up to a maximum of 6 months
The study will enroll healthy adult subjects with a minimum of two cutaneous non-genital warts, excluding the face, with each wart lesion not exceeding 10 x 10mm. Macrophotography of all study warts will be captured along with a blinded site Investigator to characterize wart healing, wart clearance and wart reduction. All subjects will be followed at 7, 30, 60, and 90-days following the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure. All wart lesions are eligible for up to a total of 3 treatments over the course of the study. Adverse events will be documented.
