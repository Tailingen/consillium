GastroIntestinal Cancer in Children and Adolescents
The goal of this observational population-based cohort study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children and adolescents with primary gastrointestinal malignancies registered in the publicly available Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 database during 2000-2019.

Overall survival, Defined as the time between the date of diagnosis and the date of death from any cause (event) or date of last follow-up., 2000-2019
Standardized incidence of second primary malignancies, Standardized incidence of second primary malignancies in patients who survived (i) two or more months, or (ii) five or more years after initial gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, relative to the general population., 2000-2019
The investigators aim to describe the patient and tumor characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of children and adolescents diagnosed with primary gastrointestinal malignancies, and to analyze these data for trends over time. In addition, the investigators want to explore independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Finally, the investigators want to describe subsequent primary malignancies diagnosed among patients from the study cohort, as well as to calculate their risk of developing a second primary cancer relative to the general population. Data on children (aged 0-17 years at diagnosis) and young people aged 18-24 years at diagnosis are analyzed separately. Special focus is laid on patients with primary carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract; particularly colorectal carcinoma.
