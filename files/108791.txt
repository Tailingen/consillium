Application-Assisted Weight Management in Endometrial Cancer Fertility Preservation
This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial targeting endometrial cancer (EC) patients undergoing fertility-sparing treatment at Peking University People's Hospital from March 2025 to March 2027. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of an intelligent mobile application (APP) based on the Adaptive Behavioral Intervention (ABI) framework in weight management for obese or overweight endometrial cancer patients receiving fertility preservation therapy. Additionally, the study seeks to explore its potential advantages in improving body mass index (BMI), tumor regression, and glucose and lipid metabolism profiles.

Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the female reproductive tract, with obesity being a closely associated factor in its development and progression. According to the American Cancer Society, 57% of endometrial cancer cases are linked to obesity, and a 5-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) elevates the risk of EC by 50%. Overweight or obesity adversely impacts treatment efficacy and reduces survival rates in EC patients. In recent years, the incidence of EC has shown a trend toward younger populations, posing significant threats to the health and quality of life of patients undergoing fertility-sparing treatment. The Adaptive Behavioral Intervention (ABI) framework emphasizes real-time adjustments based on individual feedback and progress to optimize behavioral change and health outcomes. Integrating smart application (APP) technology can provide more convenient and personalized weight management support for EC patients undergoing fertility preservation. By continuously collecting and analyzing behavioral data, the intervention strategy can be dynamically tailored, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention. Currently, there is a paucity of research on comprehensive weight management interventions incorporating intelligent APPs for obese or overweight EC patients in fertility-sparing treatment. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of an ABI-based smart APP in weight management for this population through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
