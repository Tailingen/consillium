Optical Coherence Tomography: An Adjunct to Flexible Bronchoscopy in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer
Optical coherence tomography will be a feasible adjunct to flexible bronchoscopy, and provide images with good sensitivity and specificity to determine the presence of endobronchial malignancies.

Feasibility and safety of obtaining OCT images during flexible bronchoscopy., Every 3 months
OCT could become a powerful tool in diagnostic pulmonary medicine, not only in the early recognition of lung cancer, but also in the evaluation and monitoring of microstructures in the lower respiratory tract that are affected by other inflammatory or invasive disease processes. Initially, OCT could be used to guide the location of biopsies which would likely provide increased specificity to traditional bronchoscopy. However, if the sensitivity and specificity of OCT images are comparable to histologic specimens, this technology may in the future provide a non-invasive "optical biopsy", which could potentially obviate the need for conventional biopsies in patients with high risks for complications, such as bleeding.
