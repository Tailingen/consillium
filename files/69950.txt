Evaluating Quality and Cost of (Partial) Oncological Home-Hospitalization
Oncological home-hospitalization might be a patient-centred, cost-effective approach to deal wiht the current challenges in cancer healthcare.

The primary aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate patient-reported quality of life of patients receiving (partial) oncological home-hospitalization and to compare this outcome with patients receiving standard ambulatory hospital care.

Secondary endpoints that will be evaluated and compared between both randomized groups are: Quality of life related endpoints (i.e. distress, depression \& anxiety and general health-related quality of life); Costs; Safety; patients' reported Satisfaction \& Preferences and Efficiency for the hospital day care unit.
