Study Comparing HAI Plus Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Unresectable CRLM
To date no prospective trials have been completed that demonstrated whether HAI is an effective adjunct to systemic chemotherapy (target therapy) with respect to advantages in conversional resection rates and survival compared with chemotherapy (target therapy) alone. The primary objective of this trial is to determine conversional resection rates and survival for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis are treated with HAI plus chemotherapy ± target therapy, compared to chemotherapy ± target therapy only.
