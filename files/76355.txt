Adriamycin and Ifosfamide Combined With Sintilimab
The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of adriamycin and ifosfamide combined with sintilimab versus chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma.

At present, there are a number of clinical trials of chemotherapy drugs combined with anti PD-1 antibody in the treatment of cancer, but the clinical research of chemotherapy containing adriamycin combined with anti-PD-1 antibody for advanced STS patients is almost blank. Regimen containing adriamycin is the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced STS approved by international guidelines. As an innovative PD-1 monoclonal antibody, more phase II clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in a variety of cancers. For patients who fail or cannot tolerate first-line treatment, treatment options are still limited. In view of the above problems, this study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy including adriamycin combined with sintilimab versus chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced STS, so as to provide more and better treatment options for patients with advanced STS.
