WB-DWI for Early Prediction of Therapy Response in Patients With Advanced Metastatic GIST Treated With Regorafenib
The purpose of this study is to evaluate WB DWI as early predictor of response to treatment with regorafenib or placebo in patients with advanced metastatic GIST.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
PROCEDURE: Whole body diffusion MRI
WB-DWI as early predictor for regorafenib treatment response, Primary aim of the study:

To assess whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI) for the assessment and early prediction of response of treatment with regorafenib or placebo in patients with advanced, metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST), jan 2011-dec 2011
Evaluation WB-DWI parameters in correlation with progression free survival (PFS), Evaluation of

* pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and b1000 signal intensity (SI)
* changes of high b-value SI and ADC early during treatment (2weeks after start of therapy; allowed optimal window 10-14 days)
* treatment follow-up 3 months after initiation of treatment

of GIST visualized on the WB-DWI as predictor of progression free survival (PFS), jan 2011-dec 2011
Aim of the study

- To assess whole body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI) for the assessment and early prediction of response of treatment with regorafenib or placebo in patients with advanced, metastatic gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST)

1. Evaluation of pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and b1000 signal intensity (SI) of GIST visualized on the WB-DWI as predictor of time to progression, determined by progression-free survival (PFS)
2. Evaluation of WB-DWI using changes of high b-value SI and ADC early during treatment (2weeks after start of therapy; allowed optimal window 10-14 days) as early predictor of time to progression or patient benefit according to RECIST (stable disease + partial response + complete response)
3. Evaluation of WB-DWI for treatment follow-up 3 months after initiation of treatment. Confirmation of prior published pilot study (Dunet V et al, J Nucl Med 2010)
4. Comparison of WB-DWI with conventional CT imaging for response assessment
