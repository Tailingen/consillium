Feasibility of Pet-scan at Day 1 of Brachytherapy for Patients With Cervical Cancer
Interventional, exploratory, prospective and monocentric study which aim to study the feasibility of brachytherapy using a PET-scan
Cervical Cancer
PROCEDURE: Brachytherapy|OTHER: PET-scan
Feasibility of "TEP-Curie" (Brachytherapy driven by PET-scan) in terms of realized exams, Concerning this outcome, the success in terms of feasibility will be the possibility of realizing the TEP-Curie exam, 4 months|Feasibility of "TEP-Curie" (Brachytherapy driven by PET-scan) regarding the possibility to define HR-CTV target volume (High-Risk Clinical Target Volume), Concerning this outcome, the success in terms of feasibility will be the possibility of defining a HR-CTV target volume for at least one of the 3 proposed approaches using the PET, 4 months|Feasibility of "TEP-Curie" (Brachytherapy driven by PET-scan) regarding the dicom medical image transfer, Concerning this outcome, the success in terms of feasibility will be the possibility of transfering image in a Dicom format, 4 months|Feasibility of "TEP-Curie" (Brachytherapy driven by PET-scan) regarding the contouring possibility, Using the possibility of defining the contouring for at least one of the 3 alternative treatment plans, 4 months
Impact of the "TEP-Curie" (Brachytherapy driven by PET-scan) on target volume definition, Comparison of the target volume obtained with TEP-curie to the target volume defined by the RMI alone, 4 months|Assessment of the HR-CTV coverage, Comparison of the HR-CTV obtained with TEP-curie to the HR-CTV obtained by the RMI alone, 4 months|Assessment of the dose received by the neighboring target organs, Comparison of the dose obtained with TEP-curie to the dose obtained by the RMI alone, 4 months|Time needed to design the different alternative treatment plans, 4 months|Toxicity linked to the standard treatment driven by RMI only, Graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4. scale, 4 months
The study will proceed as follow:

* Initial check-up before the brachytherapy, including a clinical exam, collect of disease history and other informations that can be required for a good execution of the trial, and a usual patient care (chemotherapy with concomitant radiotherapy, biopsy, RMI, PET-scan and paraaortic lymphadenectomy).
* additional PET-scan exam at day 1 of the brachytherapy (with collect of informations on toxicity, clinical morphology data and biomorphological data of RMI and PET-scan, and dosimetric study of the brachytherapy)
* 4 months after the brachytherapy, additional PET-scan monitoring metabolic volumes and standardized metabolic fixation parameters
