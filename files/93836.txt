Concordance of Inivata Liquid Biopsy With Standard Tissue Biopsy
This study aims to look at a comparison of liquid biopsy (blood sample) analysis compared with tissue biopsy in patients with advanced lung cancer
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Concordance in the detection of molecular abnormalities using Inivata liquid biopsy panel with detection using standard of care tissue biopsy analysis., The primary endpoint is concordance in detecting molecular abnormalities using Inivata liquid biopsy panel compared with detection using tissue biopsy analysis., 12 months
Sensitivity of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis relative to matched tissue analysis, Detection of sensitivity of molecular abnormalities using Inivata liquid biopsy panel relative to standard of care tissue biopsy analysis, 12 months|Specificity of Inivata liquid biopsy analysis relative to matched tissue analysis, Detection of specificity of molecular abnormalities using Inivata liquid biopsy panel relative to standard of care tissue biopsy analysis, 12 months|Description of the ctDNA profile of genomic alterations in patients where tumour tissue is limited versus that observed where tumour biopsy is achieved, Description of the ctDNA profile of genomic alterations in patients where tumour tissue is limited (Quantity Not Sufficient) versus that observed where tumour biopsy is achieved., 12 months
The primary aim of this study is to investigate the concordance of Inivata liquid biopsy panel with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detecting genomic alterations in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
