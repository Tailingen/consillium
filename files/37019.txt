Targeted Alpha Particle Radiotherapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
The primary aim of the study is to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac-MTI-201 in participants with metastatic uveal melanoma. The secondary aims are to describe the pharmacokinetics of 225Ac-MTI-201 and the toxic effects of 225Ac-MTI-201 in participants with metastatic uveal melanoma.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 225Ac-MTI-201, MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses up to 1327 microCi of 225Ac-MTI-201, administered as a single dose via IV on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 12 with 1 to 6 participants each. The MTD is reached when 6 patients receive the same highest tolerated dose of 225Ac-MTI-201. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) consistently occurs at the next higher dose of 225Ac-MTI-201, then 5 additional doses at the previous dose of 225Ac-MTI-201 will mark the end of clinical trial., Within 4 weeks after study drug administration|Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The following will constitute a DLT if the occurrence was within 4 weeks post-dose:

1. Any death not due to the underlying disease or extraneous cause
2. Absolute neutrophil count \< 0.5 X 10\^9/L or the development of febrile neutropenia.
3. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with significant bleeding, or any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia.
4. Laboratory abnormalities that satisfy Hy's law i.e., ALT or AST elevation \> 3X ULN, total bilirubin elevation \> 2X ULN, absence of initial findings of cholestasis, and no other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased ALT/AST and total bilirubin
5. Any grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to the study drug with the following exceptions: 1) Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (less than 72 hours with care). 2) Grade 3 fatigue (less than 1 week). 3) Grade \> 3 electrolyte abnormalities (less than 48 hours), not clinically complicated, and resolves with or without medical interventions, Within 4 weeks after study drug administration|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Serious or Non-Serious Adverse Events, Vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead EKG, and blood including toxicity on Days 8, 15, 22, and 29: Week 9, Follow-Up (Starting in Week 17) Adverse Event (AE), any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in Participant administered study drug and that may or may not have a causal relationship with drug treatment. All AEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE); an untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life-threatening; Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes; or, potential drug induced liver injury (DILI)., From time of signing the informed consent document until death, or lost to follow-up (approximately 3 years)
Observed Rate of Renal Elimination of 225Ac-MTI-201, Urine samples will be obtained post-dose as needed up to 24 hours, and renal concentrations (becquerel (Bq)) over time (minutes) determined using validated method that measures 225Ac-MTI-201 radioactivity with standard Wipe Gamma Counter or a specialized gamma spectrometer. The fraction of the injected activity of the 225Ac-MTI-201 which is ultimately excreted in the urine can be then calculated., 3 to 24 hours post-dose|Observed Rate of Elimination from Blood of 225Ac-MTI-201, Blood samples will be obtained, and plasma concentrations (becquerel (Bq)) over time (minutes) determined using validated method that measures 225Ac-MTI-201 radioactivity with standard Wipe Gamma Counter or a specialized gamma spectrometer. The 1-compartment model will be used for describing the pharmacokinetics of 225Ac-MTI-201. The blood is set as the central compartment; elimination of 225Ac-MTI-201 from this compartment is assumed to occur through a combination of renal and hepatic elimination., Prior to the initial dose on day 1; 0.042, 0.083, 0.167, 0.333, 0.667, 1.333, 2.333, 24, and 48 hours; day 8; and day 15 post-dose|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Progressive Disease (PD), or Stable Disease (SD) According to Tumor Lesion Measurement, Tumor will be measured (mm) at baseline and every 8 weeks in first year unless participant is taken off study; visit frequency is reduced in subsequent years. Follow-up visits past year-3 can be conducted via a review of clinic visit notes and/or telephone contact.

Measurable disease is the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion. At baseline, all lesions (up to five; maximum of two per organ) should be identified as target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions. A lesion identified on a follow-up study not previously observed is considered a new lesion and indicates disease progression.

CR is the loss of all target lesions. PR is at least a 30 percent decrease and PD is at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable Disease is defined as having neither sufficient shrinkage or increase to qualify for PR or PD, respectively., From time of signing the informed consent document until death, or lost to follow-up (approximately 3 years)
This study will enroll patients with metastatic uveal melanoma that have failed at least one form of therapy from a single academic medical center in the United States. All participants will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide written informed consent prior to undergoing study-related procedures. A continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used for this clinical trial. The study proposes single patient cohorts with dose escalation starting at 4.7 microCi of 225Ac-MTI-201 after each cohort in the absence of safety concerns (2-fold increases for doses and lower dose increases between higher doses). Dose Limiting Toxicities will be assessed using the CTCAE version 5.0 criteria.

The participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be administered a single intravenous dose of 225Ac-MTI-201. After study treatment, the study participants will stay overnight at the study center, undergo study procedures (i.e. vital signs, physical exam, multiple blood and urine sample collections) and will be scheduled to return to the clinic at 48 hours and for additional appointments weekly clinic visits the first month and on Week 9 for health status assessments, including physical exams, complete blood chemistry, and EKG. Tumor measurements every 8 weeks in first year post-injection; extended to 12 weeks in year 2; every 16 weeks in year 3, and 24 weeks in years 4 and 5. The clinic visits will involve seeing a study doctor plus radiological tests (such as MRI and/or CT scans) to see how the metastatic uveal melanoma has responded to the study drug. The protocol and informed consent documents have been reviewed and approved by the hospital human subjects review board and the study will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
