An Open Study Assessing the Safety and Tolerability of U3-1784
The main objectives of the trial are:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of U3-1784 in patients with advanced solid tumours
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and or establish the safety and tolerability of the maximum administered dose (MAD) of U3-1784
Advanced Solid Tumors|Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC)
DRUG: U3-1784
Number of Patients with Adverse Events, Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are systematically collected - clinically significant changes in laboratory values are recorded as TEAEs in system organ class: Investigations, within 1 year|Number of Patients with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), from start of treatment until trial termination (within 2 months)
Maximum Concentration (Cmax), within 2 months|Time to Cmax (Tmax), within 2 months|Area Under the Curve to the Last Quantifiable Measure (AUClast)[, within 2 months
The main objectives of the trial are:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of U3-1784 in patients with advanced solid tumours
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and or establish the safety and tolerability of the maximum administered dose (MAD) of U3-1784
