A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Initial Efficacy of IBI188 in Advanced Malignancies
This is an open-label, dose escalation, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced malignancies.
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: IBI188
Adverse events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAE)Number of patients with AEs and SAEs, Incidence, correlation with the study drug and severity of all adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)., 24 months
Preliminary anti-tumor activity of IBI188 (Objective Response Rate), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors and Lugano2014 criteria for lymphoma., 24 months|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax, Maximum concentration(Cmax) of the drug after administration, 24 months|Pharmacokinetics: AUC, The area under the curve (AUC) of serum concentration of the drug after the administration., 24 months|Immunogenicity, Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) will be tested and percentage of ADA positive patients will be calculated to evaluate immunogenicity of IBI188., 24 months
Phase Ia study is composed of two stages: Phase Ia Part A initial dose escalation and Phase Ia Part B maintenance dose escalation. Both parts will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose for phase Ia part A is 0.1 mg/kg QW, followed by 2 dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg QW and 1 mg/kg QW). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 14 days.

Phase Ia Part B will have 4 dose cohorts(3mg/kg QW#10mg/kg QW#20mg/kg QW #30mg/kg QW and 45mg/kg Q3W). DLT observation period is 28 days. The subject number for each cohort in Phase Ia Part B will be increased to 6 if the subject number enrolled in each cohort is less than 6
