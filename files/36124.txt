Feasibility of Prostatic Arterial Embolization in Low-risk Patients With Unilateral Prostate Cancer Under Active Surveillance: Monocentric Pilot Study
The authors hypothesize that, in patients with low volume tumors identified according to anatomo-pathological criteria and imaging, and under active surveillance focal, therapy by unilateral embolization of prostatic arteries will provide local control of the tumor via selective ischemia
