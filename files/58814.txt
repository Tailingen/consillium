Immunotherapy for Recurrent Ependymomas in Children Using Tumor Antigen Peptides with Imiquimod
The purpose of this study is to see if vaccination with HLA-A2 restricted peptides, combined with the immunoadjuvant imiquimod is safe and can induce immune responses in children with recurrent ependymomas. Eligible patients are stratiﬁed by primary tumor location.
