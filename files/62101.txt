Efficacy of RAD001 in Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastases
The purpose of this study is to determine wether RAD001 can inhibit growth of tumour cells and/or stop the formation and activity of bone degrading osteoclasts.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: RAD001|DRUG: Placebo
To determine the time to progression (TTP) in patients with no change in bone metastases after an 8 week run in treatment with RAD001 compared to placebo, 40 weeks
To determine the objective response rate after 8 weeks of RAD001, 8 weeks|To determine the TTP in patients with a response after 8 weeks of RAD001, 8 weeks|To determine the overall clinical benefit defined as CR, PR or stable disease > 24 weeks for patients continuing RAD001 after the 8 week run in phase, 40 weeks|To evaluate the safety and toxicity of RAD001, 40 weeks|To assess the frequency of bone related events, 40 weeks|To assess changes of pain intensity during treatment, 40 weeks
RAD001 is an orally bioavailable and well tolerated rapamycin ester analogue, which acts by selectively inhibiting mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTor is an intracellular protein kinase implicated in the control of cellular proliferation in neoplastic cells. Treatment with RAD001 has been shown to inhibit these signalling events and leads to growth retardation of tumour cells. In addition RAD001 in vitro stops the formation and activity of osteoclasts. Therefore a therapy of advanced breast cancer with progressive bone metastases seems to be reasonable with RAD001.

Comparison:

All patients receive RAD001 in an 8 week run in phase. Patients who show a response after 8 weeks will continue receiving RAD001. All patients with stable disease after the run in phase will be randomised to receive either RAD001 or placebo and will be followed up until progression of disease. Patients with progressive disease after the 8 week run in phase will be withdrawn from the trial.
