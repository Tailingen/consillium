BI 894999 First in Human Dose Finding Study in Advanced Malignancies
This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumours). The study is also open to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in whom previous treatment was not successful. In some countries, adolescents who are at least 15 years old and who are diagnosed with NUT carcinoma can also participate. No standard treatment exists for this rare and aggressive form of cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 894999 that people can tolerate.

BI 894999 is tested for the first time in humans. Participants take tablets once daily. The study also tests whether participants can tolerate BI 894999 better when taken continuously or with breaks in between.

Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from the treatment and can tolerate it.

The doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants.

* solid tumour patients and mCRPC patients with measurable disease: CT and/ or MRI according to RECIST v1.1, every 2 cycles;
* mCRPC patients without measurable disease: bone scan and PSA level according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3, every 4 cycles;

- PFS (censored) \[days\] = date of outcome - date of first treatment administration + 1.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the estimates., Up to 28 months.|Phase Ib: Best Overall Response, Best overall response (BOR) was determined from first treatment administration until the earliest of disease progression, death or last evaluable tumour assessment before start of subsequent anticancer therapy, loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent, according to the following criteria depending on the type of cancer:

* mCRPC patients without measurable disease: bone scan and PSA level according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3, every 4 cycles., Imaging and assessment performed every 2 cycles (solid tumours patients) or 4 cycles (mCRPC patients) for the entire treatment period, up to 28 months.|Phase Ib: Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first administration of BI 894999 until death from any cause in patients with NUT carcinoma.

For patients with 'event' as an outcome for OS:

- OS \[days\] = date of outcome - date of first treatment administration + 1.

For patients with 'censored' as an outcome for OS:

- OS (censored) \[days\] = date of outcome - date of first treatment administration + 1.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the estimates., Up to 28 months.|Phase Ib: Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), PSA response was defined as a decline in PSA value ≥50% from baseline (which is confirmed by a second value 3 to 4 weeks apart)., Up to 93 days.
