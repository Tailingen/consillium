Strain vs. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction-based Cardiotoxicity Prevention in Breast Cancer
Comparing preventive effect of myocardial global longitudinal strain-based cardioprotective stragety (angiotensin receptor blocker prophylaxis) with left ventricular ejection fraction-based strategy in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab.

Despite the left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) enables early prediction of trastuzumab-related cardiomyopathy, its clinical application has been hampered due to the lack of appropriate evaluation and treatment strategies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of early intervention strategy (GLS-based cardiotoxicity monitoring and administration of candesartan) by comparing with conventional intervention strategy (left ventricular ejection fraction-based cardiotoxicity monitoring and administration of candesartan) in breast cancer patients who treated with adjuvant trastuzumab.
