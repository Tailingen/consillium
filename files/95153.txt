Comparing PP and PVDF Meshes in Midline Laparotomy Closure for High-risk Colorectal Surgery. Impact on Incisional Hernia and Surgical Wound Infection.
In the latest guidelines for abdominal wall closure in emergency surgery published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery (WJES) in 2023, no specific recommendations are made in this regard.

Current literature does not provide any articles comparing these two types of mesh materials (PP vs PVDF) in emergency colorectal surgery. It is necessary to conduct a study comparing these two types of mesh materials, specifically in high-risk patients for incisional hernia and emergency colorectal surgery. This study aims to contribute to generating evidence regarding differences in wound infection incidence and potential subsequent complications, such as chronic pain.

It is essential to conduct a study comparing different methods of laparotomy closure, specifically in emergency colorectal surgery, to contribute valuable evidence regarding the incidence of incisional hernia and potential subsequent complications.
Colorectal Cancer|Wound Infection|Hernia Incisional
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Polyvinylidene fluoride mesh|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Prophylactic polypropylene mesh
Incidence of surgical wound infection, Compare the incidence of surgical wound infection between the two groups: Closure of midline laparotomy using the "small bites" technique associated with a suprafascial polypropylene mesh versus closure of midline laparotomy using the "small bites" technique associated with a suprafascial polyvinylidene fluoride mesh., 30 postoperative days
Rate of incisional hernia, Compare the rate of incisional hernia at one year post-surgery, postoperative complications, and abdominal pain at 6 and 12 months in both groups. Also, compare the rates of parastomal hernias., One year surgery|Morbidity and mortality rates, Comparison between the two groups on various aspects related to postoperative morbidity and mortality. Other aspects to be evaluated include the time of initiation of tolerance to solid oral diet, onset of ambulation, presence of anastomotic dehiscence, need for reinterventions, and occurrence of complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification at 30 and 90 days, as well as the mortality rate at 90 days. Additionally, the aim is to compare the rate of initiation of adjuvant treatment within the first 6 weeks post-surgery, if indicated., 90 postoperative days
