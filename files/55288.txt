Phase 1 Study to Evaluate MEDI4736 in Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study to assess the safety and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 as Monotherapy or in Combination with Tremelimumab with or without Azacitidine in Subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome after treatment with hypomethylating agents
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
BIOLOGICAL: MEDI4736 Evaluate MEDI4736 in MDS|DRUG: VIDAZA|BIOLOGICAL: tremelimumab
Subject's safety where no more than one out of six subjects experience DLTs at a given dose, DLT (MEDI4736 monotherapy only) assessment will be done by reviewing adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. For monotherapy or combo w/aza AEs, SAEs, lab evaluations, vital signs, physical exams, ECGs will be done., 180 days|Subject's safety overall (monotherapy and combination therapies), Overall safety assessments will be done by reviewing adverse events (AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations and electrocardiogram (ECG) results., 730 days
