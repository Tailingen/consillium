Changes in the MRI Signal in Patients With Benign Tumors of the Brain and Meninges Treated With Proton Therapy: Impact of TEL and the Biological Dose Received
The main objective is to detect with TESLA multiparametric 3 MRI, the MRI secondary changes to protontherapy irradiation and to correlate them with TEL mapping, physical dose and biological dose. A model should thus be able to be proposed at the end of the study.
Benign Brain Tumors|Proton Therapy
DEVICE: MRI 3 tesla
Evaluate by TESLA multiparametric 3 MRI the modifications of the MRI signal :Change from Baseline at 1, 3 and 6 months, modifications of the MRI signal on the various sequences carried out, during the study, Up to 6 months
