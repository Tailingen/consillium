Safety and Efficacy Study of Torisel and Liposomal Doxorubicin for Patients With Recurrent Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to identify a safe dosing regimen for the combination of Torisel and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent sarcoma. A secondary purpose of the study is to determine how effective this combination is for the treatment of recurrent sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin
Part 1: Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Dose limiting toxicities in each dose cohort., End of second 28-day cycle|Part 2: Median Overall Survival of Subjects Who Were Treated at the Temsirolimus MTD, 20 mg/m^2, Number of days from day 1 of treatment until date of death from any cause., up to 5 years
Median Progression-free Survival of Subjects Who Were Treated at the Temsirolimus MTD, 20 mg/m^2, Interval from Date of start of treatment to date of disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression is defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions or appearance of any new lesions. Subjective determination of significant worsening of disease-related symptoms was considered clinical disease progression., up to 3 years|Objective Response Rate, Number of participants who completed at least 2 treatment cycles with evidence of response. Response is defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, up to 5 years|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Whole blood temsirolimus and sirolimus levels were measured by LC/MS/MS, Prior to the initial dose on day 1, then 2, 6, and 24 hours post dose; prior to first dose of Cycle 2, then at 1, 2, 6, 24, 96, and 120 hours post dose in patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, Dose Level 4.|Area Under the Curve (AUC), AUC was calculated using a single compartment model., Prior to the initial dose on day 1, then 2, 6, and 24 hours post dose; prior to first dose of Cycle 2, then at 1, 2, 6, 24, 96, and 120 hours post dose in patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, Dose Level 4.|Drug Clearance, Whole blood temsirolimus and sirolimus levels were measured by LC/MS/MS., Prior to the initial dose on day 1, then 2, 6, and 24 hours post dose; prior to first dose of Cycle 2, then at 1, 2, 6, 24, 96, and 120 hours post dose in patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, Dose Level 4.|Mean Progression Free Survival of Subjects Who Were Treated at the Temsirolimus MTD, 20 mg/m^2, Interval from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression is defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions or appearance of any new lesions. Subjective determination of significant worsening of disease-related symptoms was considered clinical disease progression, up to 3 years|Mean Overall Survival of Subjects Who Were Treated at the Temsirolimus MTD, 20 mg/m^2, up to 5 years|Time to Response, Number of days after 2 cycles of treatment, until maximal response is observed., up to 5 years|Duration of Response, Number of days until documentation of disease progression or date of death from other cause, up to 5 years|Clinical Benefit Rate, Number of days from documented improvement to disease progression., up to 5 years
The effectiveness of treatments for recurrent sarcomas is quite limited. One hypothesis to explain the refractory nature of recurrent sarcomas is the existence of chemotherapy-resistant sarcoma stem cells.
