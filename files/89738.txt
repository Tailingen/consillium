Sintilimab, Pegaspargase Plus GemOx for Untreated Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma
This is a single-arm phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab, pegaspargase combined with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (P-P-GEMOX regimen) as first-line treatment for patients with ENKTL. The primary endpoint is the complete response rate (CRR) in the intention-to-treat population.The secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.

DRUG: Immunochemotherapy
Complete response rate (CRR), Treatment responses were assessed according to the 2014 Lugano classification criteria., Responses were evaluated after 3 cycles of induction and 1 month after the completion of study therapy (each cycle is 21 days)
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From date of enrollment until documented disease progression or death of any reason (up to 3 years).|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., From date of enrollment until documented death of any reason (up to 3 years).|Overall response rate, The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR., Responses were evaluated after 3 cycles of induction and 1 month after the completion of study therapy (each cycle is 21 days).|Adverse event, Graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From enrollment till 28 days post the last induction cycle.
