Effects of Red Ginseng on Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Microbiota After Surgery for Gastrointestinal Cancer
After surgery for gastrointestinal cancer (stomach cancer, pancreaticobiliary cancer, colorectal cancer), many patients experiences various symptoms such as weight loss, diarrhea, constipation and excessive gas due to structural and functional changes in the gastrointestinal tract. These changes are thought to be influenced by alterations in gut microbiota following surgery, but prospective studies are still lacking. It is anticipated that the prebiotic effects of red ginseng may lead to positive changes in total gut bactera after gastrointestinal caner surgery.

Through this study, Investigators aim to investigate the impact of red ginseng consumption on gut microbiota composition, gastrointestinal symptoms, and nutritional status improvement following surgery for gastrointestinal cancer.
