Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in III-IVA Resectable Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label II phase observation clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab immunoadjuvant therapy in patients with stage III-IVA oral squamous cell carcinoma. The primary end point is the pathological tumor remission rate of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant immunotherapy (pTR-2: the proportion of necrotic tumor cells, keratin fragments and giant cells in tissue sections \> 50%). The secondary endpoints are 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), 1-year overall survival (OS) and the incidence of adverse events, compared with historical data. In addition, we will check the relevant immune indicators, such as PD-L1 and CPS scores.
Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Rate of pathologic tumor response-2（pTR-2）, The proportion of participants with a pathologic tumor response-2（pTR-2）as assessed by the Central Pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. pTR-2 is defined as the proportion of necrotic tumor cells, keratin fragments and giant cells in tissue sections \> 50%, Up to 30 days post-sugery
Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS is the time from the date of randomization to the date of first record of any of the following events: disease progression; local or distant recurrence as assessed with imaging or biopsy as indicated; or death due to any cause, Up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from surgery to death due to any cause., Up to 1 year|Adverse Events (AEs), Participants experiencing any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy, From time of first dose of study treatment until the end of follow-up (up to 1 year)
