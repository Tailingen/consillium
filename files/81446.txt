Safety and Efficacy of SNX-5422 in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Cancers
Hsp90 is a chemical in the body that is involved in the promotion of cancer. SNX-5422 is an experimental drug that blocks Hsp90
Cancer

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone proteins stabilize well over 200 different known client proteins helping them to fold correctly as they take up their rightful positions in the cell. Hsp90 has a special fondness for oncoproteins whose structures shift according to functional state. Among Hsp90's clients, a surprising number are well recognized targets in oncology, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). SNX-5422 is a pro-drug of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Treatment of HER2-positive cell lines such as BT-474 with the Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-2112 results in cellular degradation, decreased levels of phospho-AKT/cyclin D1, and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with SNX-5542 caused tumor regression, including remission in a HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenograft model. SNX-5422 has demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of various human malignancies, including breast (BT474, MX-1), lung (H1975, H1650, EBC-1), colon (HT29), prostate (PC3), and melanoma (A375) with multiple oral dosing regimens.
