TPF Induction Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced and Resectable Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Induction chemotherapy is regarded as an effective way to reduce or downgrade the locally advanced or aggressive cancers, and to improve the chance of eradication of the locoregional lesions by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, there are still debates on the clinical value of induction chemotherapy for patients with advanced and resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma. The hypothesis of this study is that the induction chemotherapy of TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) protocol could benefit the patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma. The endpoints of this study are the survival rate, local control, and safety.
Stage III Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Stage IVA Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: TPF induction chemotherapy
Survival rate, To evaluate the survival rate after TPF induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy., Up to 5 years
local control, To evaluate the 1, 2, 3, 5-year local and regional control rate and distant metastasis rate after TPF indcution chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy, Up to 5 yeas|Number of participants with adverse events, All adverse events, including serious adverse events, exposure of all study drugs and radiation., Up to 5 years
The primary endpoint of this study is the survival rate (2, 3, 5 years) after induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The second endpoint of this study is locoregional control rates (1, 2 years), and the safety.
