Study of Patritumab Deruxtecan Plus Pembrolizumab With Other Anticancer Agents in Participants With High-Risk Early-Stage Triple-Negative or Hormone Receptor-Low Positive/HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer (MK-1022-010, HERTHENA-Breast-03)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR) low positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to learn:

* About the safety of the study treatments and if people tolerate them
* If people who receive patritumab deruxtecan, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy before surgery have fewer cancer cells removed during surgery compared to those who receive only pembrolizumab (pembro) and chemotherapy.

Part 1: Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented for Part 1., Up to ~43 weeks|Part 1: Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0, assessed by investigator as drug-related: Grade (gr) 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (with exceptions); gr 3 or gr 4 laboratory values (with exceptions); gr 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; prolonged delay (\>2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 (cycle length = 3 weeks) due to intervention-related toxicity; any intervention-related toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue intervention during Cycle 1; interstitial lung disease as per investigator; any other gr â‰¥3 pulmonary toxicity; or gr 5 toxicity., Up to 21 days|Part 1: Number of Participants who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be presented for Part 1., Up to ~30 weeks|Part 2: Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate Using the Definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0, pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy at the time of definitive surgery., Up to ~30 weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants Experiencing an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented for Part 2., Up to ~103 weeks|Part 2: Number of Participants who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be presented for Part 2., Up to ~90 weeks
Part 2: pCR-No Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) Rate Using the Definition of ypT0 ypN0, pCR-no DCIS (ypT0 ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy at the time of definitive surgery., Up to ~30 weeks|Part 2: Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~100 months|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to ~100 months|Part 2: Distant Progression or Distant Recurrence-Free Survival (DPDRFS), DPDRFS is defined as the time from randomization to first distant progression or distant recurrence event as assessed or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~100 months|Part 2: Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), RCB is defined as residual disease in either the breast or lymph node at the time of surgery. RCB score provides a continuous measurement of the extent of residual cancer. There are four RCB classes: RCB-0 (RCB score 0), RCB-1 (0\< RCB score \<1.36), RCB-2 (1.36 \<RCB score \<3.28), and RCB-3 (RCB score \>3.28)., Up to ~30 weeks
