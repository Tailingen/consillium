Safety of Autologous Humanized Anti-CD19 and Anti-CD20 Dual Specific CAR-T Cells in Adult Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose escalation, phase I study, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Autologous Humanized Anti-CD19 and Anti-CD20 Dual Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells in patient with relapsed or refractory diffuse B cell lymphoma.
Relapsed or Refractory DLBCL Patients With Either CD19 or CD20 Positive
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous humanized anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 dual specific CAR-T Cells
The types and Incidence of adverse events, Up to 12 months
Overall response rate, including CR and PR, Up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Up to 12 months|Response duration, Up to 12 months
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has made breakthroughs in the treatment of B cell lymphoma and leukemia, but 30% of patients still have antigen escape, which may be related to variants in tumor cells and the expansion of CD19-negative tumor cells after treatment with CD19 CAR-T cells. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR-T cell targeting multiple antigens can attack tumor cells while overcoming tumor antigen escape caused by a single target, maximizing efficacy and duration of treatment, and can also solve the problem of uneven distribution or low expression of single target on the tumor surface.
