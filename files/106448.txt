Flaxseed in Preventing Breast Cancer in Premenopausal Women at Risk of Developing Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Ground flaxseed may prevent breast cancer in premenopausal women at increased risk of developing primary breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well flaxseed works in preventing breast cancer in premenopausal women at risk of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Precancerous Condition
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Ground Flaxseed|OTHER: No Intervention
Alteration in intermediate biomarkers of breast cancer risk at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months, 6 months
Tolerability and compliance, 6 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary aims:

* Determine if 25 grams of flaxseed supplementation daily

  * modifies proliferation (ki-67) and apoptotic rates after six months
  * modifies expression of estrogen regulated genes: Cyclin D1, survivin, and VEGF at six months
  * modifies serum IGF-1 and serum binding protein (IGFBP)-3 levels from baseline to 6 months
  * and evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of flaxseed consumption, and determine factors that lead to decreased compliance

STUDY OUTLINE:

This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

* Arm I (intervention): Patients ingest 25 grams ground flaxseed daily, with already prepared foods, for 6 months. Patients are instructed to record the time and with what foods flaxseed is consumed, and the number of bowel movements daily. Throughout the 6-month intervention period, patients also complete unannounced telephone-administered surveys recounting all foods and beverages consumed within the previous 24 hours.
* Arm II (observation): Patients do not receive ground flaxseed. All patients complete a diary about menstrual cycle duration and presence or improvement of premenstrual symptoms (e.g., cramping, bloating, headache, insomnia, or other irregular symptoms). Patients also complete questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months to access changes in diet, physical activity, menstrual history, demographic characteristics, and medical history and a specimen questionnaire at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months.

Blood and first-void urine samples are collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months to measure levels of lignan metabolites, flaxseed compliance, serum thiocyanate, malondialdehyde, and for biomarker studies by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and ELISA.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly for up to 6 months.
