Trial of Oncaspar® and Three Doses of Pegylated Recombinant Asparaginase in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
This is an assessment of efficacy and safety of three different doses of pegylated recombinant asparaginase (PEG-rASNase) in comparison to Oncaspar® during treatment of adults with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This study will provide first data for determining specific asparaginase doses to yield various durations of L-asparagine (ASN) depletion which are required within different treatment phases of ALL therapy.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
DRUG: Oncaspar|DRUG: PEG-rASNase
