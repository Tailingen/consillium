A Study Comparing Savolitinib Plus Osimertinib vs Savolitinib Plus Placebo in Patients With EGFRm+ and MET Amplified Advanced NSCLC
This study will compare the activity of the combination of savolitinib and osimertinib against the combination of savolitinib with placebo to osimertinib in patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive and MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed following treatment with osimertinib.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib + Savolitinib|DRUG: Savolitinib + Placebo
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of evaluable patients with an Investigator-assessed visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new non-target lesions. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation up to 24 weeks, then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression (maximum of approximately 25 months)
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomised therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Progression (i.e., PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TLs) and an absolute increase of ≥5mm, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters since treatment started including the baseline sum of diameters., Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation up to 24 weeks, then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression (maximum of approximately 25 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator or death in the absence of disease progression., Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from randomisation up to 24 weeks, then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression (maximum of approximately 25 months)|Tumour Size Assessment (TSA), TSA is defined as the percentage change from baseline in TLs at 12 weeks per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Baseline and 12 weeks.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., From the date of randomisation until death due to any cause, assessed up to the data cut-off date (21 December 2022) (maximum of approximately 25 months)|Total Clearance in EGFR Mutations at 6-weeks After Therapy Initiation (Percentage Change From Baseline in EGFR Mutation Allele Frequencies)., To determine the prevalence of ctDNA clearance after savolitinib plus osimertinib or savolitinib plus placebo treatment in this patient population, 6-weeks after therapy initiation.|Total Clearance in EGFR Mutations at 6-weeks After Therapy Initiation (Absolute Change From Baseline in EGFR Mutation Allele Frequencies)., To determine the prevalence of ctDNA clearance after savolitinib plus osimertinib or savolitinib plus placebo treatment in this patient population, 6-weeks after therapy initiation.|PK Concentration Ratios on Multiple Dosing, The time dependency of the PK on multiple dosing is assessed by the ratio of mean concentrations at the timepoints identified in column one. For example, the Geometric mean ratio for "C3h Cycle2 Day 1 / C3h Cycle 1 Day 1" periods is the geometric mean value for C3h Cycle 2 Day 1 (Stage 2) divided by the geometric mean value for C3h Cycle 1 Day 1 (Stage 1). Because the measurement is a ratio of values, no measures of central tendency are appropriate., C3h Cycle 2 Day 1/C3h Cycle 1 Day 1; Cpre-dose Cycle 3 Day 1/Cpre-dose Cycle 2 Day 1; Cpre-dose Cycle 6 Day 1/Cpre-dose Cycle 2 Day 1; Cpre-dose Cycle 11 Day 1/Cpre-dose Cycle 2 Day 1.

Resistance to EGFR-TKIs is a clinical problem. One of the mechanisms for resistance to osimertinib is amplification of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates downstream intracellular signalling independent of EGFR. This study will explore the individual contribution of savolitinib to MET mediated osimertinib resistance, by assessing the response to dual pathway blockade of EGFRm and MET to overcome MET mediated resistance to osimertinib versus inhibition of the MET pathway alone by investigating the efficacy of savolitinib plus osimertinib versus savolitinib plus placebo to osimertinib (hereafter referred to as placebo) in patients with EGFRm+ and MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following treatment with osimertinib. This is a multi centre, Phase II, double blind, randomised study.

Patients will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to receive treatment with savolitinib once daily plus osimertinib once daily or savolitinib once daily plus placebo. Randomisation will be stratified according to the number ofprior lines of therapy (ie, osimertinib monotherapy as first line or ≥ second line \[which includes patients who received osimertinib monotherapy before or after chemotherapy\]). All patients confirmed as eligible will begin treatment on Day 1 with savolitinib plus osimertinib or savolitinib plus placebo. Treatment will continue once daily in 28 day cycles until either objective PD by RECIST 1.1 is assessed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

After progression, patients can be unblinded, and patients initially randomised to the savolitinib plus placebo arm may cross-over to open-label savolitinib plus osimertinib following investigator assessed objective PD to ensure that all patients enrolled may have the opportunity to receive the combination of savolitinib plus osimertinib.
