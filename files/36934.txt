A Study of MEDI9197 in Subjects With Solid Tumors or CTCL and in Combination With Durvalumab and/or Palliative Radiation in Subjects With Solid Tumors
To evaluate MEDI9197 when administered by intratumoral injection to subjects with solid tumors and in combination with durvalumab in subjects with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|CTCL|Cancer
DRUG: MEDI9197|BIOLOGICAL: durvalumab
Safety and tolerability as determined by assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose or maximal assessed dose per protocol of MEDI9197 when administered by intratumoral injection to subjects with solid tumor cancers, The primary endpoint will be the number (%) of subjects with dose-limiting toxicities, adverse and serious adverse events and other safety parameters., From time of informed consent through 4 weeks after last dose of investigational product|Safety and tolerability as determined by assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose or maximal assessed dose per protocol of MEDI9197 when administered by intratumoral injection to subjects with CTCL, The primary endpoint will be the number (%) of subjects with dose-limiting toxicities, adverse and serious adverse events and other safety parameters., From time of informed consent through 6 months after last dose of investigational product|Safety & tolerability as determined by dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated or assessed dose of MEDI9197 administered by IT injection in combo with durvalumab and durvalumab plus palliative radiation to subjects with solid tumor cancers., The primary endpoint will be the number (%) of subjects with dose-limiting toxicities, adverse and serious adverse events and other safety parameters., From time of informed consent through 90 days after last dose of investigational product

This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the TLR 7/8 agonist MEDI9197 delivered by IT injection to subjects with solid tumors and in combination with durvalumab in subjects with solid tumors. The study has a dose escalation design using mTPI-2 to evaluate a range of doses.
