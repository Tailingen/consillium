Safety and Efficacy Study of KX2-391 for Treatment of Bone-Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The standard of care for patients with bone-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer is chemotherapy. If a patient elects not to choose chemotherapy, 70% will progress within 6 months. KX2-391 given orally twice a day for 6 months will be evaluated for its ability to delay/prevent disease progression in patients who have not had prior chemotherapy.
Bone-Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: KX2-391
The proportion of patients who do not have clinical or radiographic progression, At screening/baseline, target lesions will be identified and measured by CT scan and bone lesions will be enumerated by bone scintigraphy. At 12 and 24 weeks after treatment with KX2-391, patients will be assessed by CT and bone scan to assess whether radiographic progression has occurred. At monthly visits and throughout the study, clinical progression will be evaluated., 24 weeks
Determine the proportion of patients who do not have PSA progression, PSA will be measure at baseline and at the start of each of 6, 28 day cycles, 24 weeks|Determine the pharmacokinetics of KX2-391, Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined in patients receiving 40 mg KX2-391, twice daily., 24 weeks
This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered KX2-391 in adult male patients with progressive bone-metastatic CRPC. Patients must have 1) documented bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 2) castrate levels of testosterone, 3) not received prior chemotherapy, and 4) documented disease progression based on rising PSA, progressive measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesions (one criteria is sufficient) as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines (Scher et al 2008).
