Efficacy Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Chemoradiation Therapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients(UICC7th stageIII to IVb) will receive either cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) or docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil(TPF) neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiation.
Chemoradiation|Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: PF (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) group|DRUG: TPF (docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) group
3-year progress free survival(PFS), PFS means assignment to the date of any local or distant progress of the disease using Kaplan-Meier calculate the progress free survival rates,and find out is there significant difference between these two groups., 3 years after the inception assignment
overall survival(OS), the overall survival denote to assignment to date of death from any cause. Using Kaplan-Meier to calculate the 2-year ,3-year,5-year overall survival rate,and find is there any significant difference between these two groups., 2 years ,3 years and 5 years after the inception of the assignment|Adverse events, observe and record the toxicity profile(including but not limit to mucositis,liver and kidney function,et al.)according NCI-CTCAE(3rd edition) during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy ,chemoradiation and follow-up., participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay,an expected average of 100 days and every 3 months thereafter for 5 years|local control rate (LCR), 1 year ,2 years,3 years and 5 years after the inception of the study
For locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients(UICC7th stageIII to IVb),the investigators randomised assign to either 3 cycles of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil plus (PF) or 3 cycles of docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil(TPF) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 21 days a cycle.

After the neoadjuvant chemotherapy ,the patients will receive the intensity modulated radiotherapy(IMRT) with 2 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy of cisplatin 80mg/m2.
