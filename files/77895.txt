Herpes Zoster|Herpes Zoster Vaccine
BIOLOGICAL: GSK 1437173A|DRUG: Placebo
Adjusted Geometric Means for Anti-glycoprotein E (gE) Antibodies in PreChemo Groups, Adjusted geometric means (GMC) of GSK1437173A over placebo for anti-glycoprotein E (gE) antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) concentrations in PreChemo Groups only., At Month 2|Anti-Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) gE Antibody Concentrations, Antibody concentrations as determined by ELISA are presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The seropositivity cut-off value was greater than or equal to (≥) 97 mIU//mL., At Month 2|Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms, Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal every day activities. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 100 millimeters (mm) of injection site., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose and across doses|Number of Days With Solicited Local Symptoms, The number of days with any local symptoms has been assessed during the post-vaccination period., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose|Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms, Assessed solicited general symptoms were fatigue, gastrointestinal \[symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain\], headache, myalgia, shivering and fever \[defined as oral, axillary or tympanic temperature equal to or above 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)\]. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 fever = fever \> 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose and across doses|Number of Days With Solicited General Symptoms, The number of days with any general symptoms has been assessed during the post-vaccination period., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose|Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs), An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination., During the 30-day (Days 0-29) post-vaccination period|Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Related SAE= SAE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination., From first dose up to 30 days post last vaccination|Number of Subjects With Any and Related Potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs), Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. Related = pIMDs assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination., From first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination
Anti-VZV gE Antibody Concentrations, Antibody concentrations as determined by ELISA are presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). The seropositivity cut-off value was greater than or equal to (≥) 97 mIU//mL., At Months 0, 1, 6 and 13|Number of Subjects With Vaccine Responses for Anti-gE Antibody ELISA Concentrations, Vaccine response defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4 fold the cut-off for Anti-gE (4x97 mIU/ml); For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration., At Months 1, 2, 6 and 13|Descriptive Statistics of the Frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells in PreChemo Groups, Descriptive statistics were tabulated for CD4\[2+\] cells, which are gE specific CD4+ T-cells with at least two activation markers (\[2+\]), expressed from the activation markers interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cluster of differentiation 40-ligand (CD40-L), as determined by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) method., At Months 0, 1, 2 and 13|Number of Subjects With Vaccine Responses for gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells in PreChemo Groups, Vaccine response defined as: For initially seronegative subjects with pre-vaccination T-cell frequencies below the threshold, at least a 2-fold increase as compared to the threshold (2x320 Events/10E6 CD4+ T cells); For initially seropositive subjects with pre-vaccination T-cell frequencies above the threshold, at least a 2-fold increase as compared to pre-vaccination T-cell frequencies., At Months 1, 2 and 13|Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Related SAE = SAE assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination., From 30 days post last vaccination up to study end (Month 13)|Number of Subjects With Any Potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs), Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology., From 30 days post last vaccination up to study end (Month 13)
The study will be randomised into two groups based on the vaccination schedule in relation to the start of a chemotherapy cycle:

* The OnChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at the start of a chemotherapy cycle,
* The PreChemo group receives their first HZ/su vaccination at least 10 days before the start of a chemotherapy cycle.

The protocol summary has been updated following Protocol Amendment 2, August 2014, leading to the increase of the enrolment.
