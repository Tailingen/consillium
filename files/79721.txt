A Multicenter, Prospective, Phase II Study of Zanubrutinib for Maintenance in Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This study aims to evaluate whether maintenance therapy with Zanubrutinib monotherapy could improve the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of patients with mantle cell lymphoma who had remission after first-line immunochemotherapy
Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Maintenance Therapy
DRUG: Zanubrutinib
2-year progression-free survival (PFS), the period from the date of patients sign informed consent to the observed progression of the disease or the occurrence of death for any reason, From date of patients sign informed consent until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
2-year event-free survival (EFS), the period from the date of patients sign informed consent to the observed event for any reason, From date of patients sign informed consent until the date of first documented event, progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|overall survival, time between the date of patients sign informed consent and the date of death or the date of last follow-up time, From date of patients sign informed consent until the date of death or the date of last follow-up time, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Hematology and non hematology toxicity, number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, up to 2 years.|Quality of life questionnaire, evaluate patients' quality of life by questionnaire., Up to 2 years
Exploratory biomarkers, Biomarkers for predictive factors of efficacy at baseline or during the treatment, Throughout the treatment period, up to 2 years
In this study, patients diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma who have achieved remission (CR or PR) by first-line immunochemotherapy, will be treated with Zanubrutinib monotherapy for 2 years (or until PD, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal, or study termination). This study aims to evaluate whether maintenance therapy with Zanubrutinib monotherapy could improve the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of those patients, and explore the efficiency and safety.
