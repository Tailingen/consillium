A Study of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Alone in Combination With Trans-arterial ChemoEmbolization (TACE) in Participants With Intermediate Stage Liver Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nivolumab with and without ipilimumab in combination with Trans-arterial ChemoEmbolization (TACE) to TACE alone in participants with intermediate liver cancer.

DRUG: nivolumab|DRUG: ipilimumab|PROCEDURE: TACE
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose and 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 25 months)|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose that results in death, Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) or requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event., From first dose and 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 25 months)|Number of Participants Who Died, Number of participants who died due to any cause are summarized., From first dose and 100 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 27 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose and 30 days after last dose of study therapy (up to approximately 25 months)|Number of Participants With Worst Grade (Grade 3/4) Laboratory Results, Laboratory results were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 (Grade 3 =Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening).
