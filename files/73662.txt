Olmutinib 600 mg QD in Patients With T790M-positive NSCLC After Treatment With an EGFR-TKI
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olmutinib 600 mg QD in patients with T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
