Effects of Preoperative Rehabilitation in Patients Resected for Lung Cancer
This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of a preoperative rehabilitation program at home in patients resected for lung cancer, comparing a control group (C group) receiving only chest physiotherapy and a rehabilitation group (R group) receiving both a training program at home and chest physiotherapy
