Use of 68Ga-dotatate PET Scan in Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the GI Tract
The purpose of the study is to understand the extent and degree of somatostatin receptor expression in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas . This may help to make a determination if a radiolabeled somatostatin analog therapy, also referred to as peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT), can be a potential alternative in the future. At this time, radiolabeled somatostatin analogs have not been tested in patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, and their efficacy in this disease is not well known Understanding the extent and degree of somatostatin receptor expression is important in order to evaluate the potential of radiolabeled somatostatin analog therapy for treatment of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas.
Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-DOTATATE|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan
Percentage of Participants with Uniformly Positive 68Ga-dotatate PET, Percentage of participants with uniformly positive 68Ga-dotatate PET (positivity defined as SUV uptake \> liver for all tumors at least 1cm in size). Note: Standard Uptake Value (SUV) is used to determine activity in PET imaging., Up to 10 months
Percentage of Participants with No Uptake to Very High Uptake on PET, Percentage of Participants with no uptake, heterogeneous uptake (tumors showing substantial differences in Somatostatin receptor \[SSTR\] uptake), low uptake (max SUV≤ liver), moderate uptake (liver\<max SUV ≤2x liver, high uptake (max SUV \> 2x liver), very high uptake (max SUV≥ kidney or spleen). Note: Standard Uptake Value (SUV) is used to determine activity in PET imaging., Up to 10 months
