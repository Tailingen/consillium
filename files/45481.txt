A Study of BBI503 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open label, single arm dose escalation study of BBI503 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.
Cancer, Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: BBI503
Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Assessment of safety of BBI503 by reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events., Adverse events will be assessed at baseline, while the participant is taking BBI503, and for 30 days after stopping therapy. The average length of this duration is expected to be approximately 4 months.|Determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, Up to treatment discontinuation + 30 days with an estimated treatment duration of 4 weeks
Pharmacokinetic profile (Area under the curve) of BBI503, Blood sampling to assess the pharmacokinetic profile (Area under the curve) of BBI503., During the first 28 days of treatment|Pharmacodynamic activity, Tumor Biopsy(s) to provide information on analysis of the targets and downstream genes/ effect of BBI503 on cancer stem cells through immunohistochemistry., During the first 28 days of treatment|Anti-tumor activity, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI503., Participants will be assessed every eight weeks for anti-tumor activity.
Progression Free Survival, The time the participant stays on study until progression will be measured and recorded. This is estimated to be approximately 4 months.|Overall Survival, The time of overall survival will be measured and recorded for each participant., Participant follow-up for overall survival will occur approximately quarterly for the first year the participant is off study, twice during the second year, and once per year thereafter for up to approximately 100 months.
