Dose Finding Study of TNO155 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this first in human (FIH) trial is to characterize the safety and tolerability of the SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 alone and in combination with EGF816 (nazartinib) and identify a recommended dose for future studies in adult patients with advanced solid tumors in selected indications.

DRUG: TNO155|DRUG: TNO155 in combination with EGF816 (nazartinib)
Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers, up to 5 years; at least once per treatment cycle|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Incidence and nature of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation part. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first treatment cycle (either 21 days or 28 days, depending on the cohort's treatment schedule) with TNO155 or with TNO155 in combination with EGF816 (nazartinib), up to 28-day cycle|Number of participants with dose interruptions and reductions, Assessment of tolerability. For patients who do not tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments may be permitted in order to allow patients to continue the study treatment, Up to 5 years|Dose intensity of study drugs, Dose intensity is computed as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received to actual duration of exposure, Up to 5 years
Overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial response (PR), From start of treatment for 60 months|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1, DCR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD), From start of treatment for 60 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1, PFS is the time from date start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause, Up to 5 years|Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1, DOR is the time from first documented response (PR or CR) to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, Up to 5 years|Change from baseline in DUSP6 in tumor samples, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) mRNA levels assessed in paired tumor biopsy samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), At screening and between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3. One cycle=either 21 days or 28 days, depending on the cohort's treatment schedule.|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of study drugs, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters calculated based on the plasma concentrations versus time profiles by using non-compartmental methods, From pre-dose up to 48 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 14. One cycle=21 days or 28 days, depending on the dosing schedule.|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of study drugs, PK parameters calculated based on the plasma concentrations versus time profiles by using non-compartmental methods, From pre-dose up to 48 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 14. One cycle=21 days or 28 days, depending on the dosing schedule.|Time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) of study drugs, PK parameters calculated based on the plasma concentrations versus time profiles by using non-compartmental methods, From pre-dose up to 48 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 14. One cycle=21 days or 28 days, depending on the dosing schedule.|Apparent terminal elimination half-life of study drugs, PK parameters calculated based on the plasma concentrations versus time profiles by using non-compartmental methods, From pre-dose up to 48 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and from pre-dose up to 24 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 14. One cycle=21 days or 28 days, depending on the dosing schedule.
This study has been designed as a Phase I, open-label, dose finding study with a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors. The study treatment, TNO155 alone or in combination with EGF816 (nazartinib), will be taken until the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient or due to withdrawal of consent.
