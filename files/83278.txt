This research study is evaluating the impact of early involvement of a palliative care team working with the transplant oncology team will have on the quality of life, symptoms, and mood of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation.

Patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL): Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), Compare patient QOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) scores at week 2 between the study groups Score range 0-164 with higher score indicating better quality of life, 2 weeks
Patients' Quality of Life (QOL) Longitudinally: FACT-BMT, Compare patients' QOL using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) longitudinally between the study groups Score range 0-164, with higher score indicating better quality of life, up to 6 months|Patients' Symptom Burden, Compare patients' symptoms using the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) scores between the study groups score range 0-100 with higher score indicating worse symptom burden, up to 6 months|Patients' Fatigue, Compare patients' fatigue using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Fatigue (FACT-fatigue) scores between the study groups score range from 0-52 with higher scores indicating lower fatigue symptoms, up to 6 months|Patients' Psychological Distress, Compare patients' depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) between the study groups The HADS consists of two subscales assessing depression and anxiety symptoms, with scores ranging from 0 (no distress) to 21 (maximum distress), up to 6 months|Patients' Depression, Compare patients' depression using Patient-Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) between the study groups the PHQ-9 score ranges from 0-27, with higher score indicative more depressive symptoms, up to 6 months|Patients' Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSD), Compare patients' post-traumatic stress symptoms using the PTSD Checklist- Civilian version (PCL-C) between the study groups PCL-C score ranges from 17-85 with higher scores indicating worse PTSD symptoms, up to 6 months|Caregiver QOL: CARGOQOL, Compare caregivers' QOL using caregiver oncology QOL questionnaire (CARGOQOL) scores between the study groups the caregiver oncology QOL questionnaire ranges from 0-116 with higher scores indicating better caregiver QOL., up to 6 months|Caregiver Psychological Distress, Compare caregivers' psychological distress using hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) between the study groups the HADS consists of two subscales assessing depression and anxiety symptoms, with scores ranging from 0 (no distress) to 21 (maximum distress), up to 6 months|Caregiver Depression, Compare caregivers' depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) between the study groups the PHQ-9 score ranges from 0-27 with higher scores indicating worse depression symptoms., up to 6 months
Patient Coping, Compare patient coping using the Brief Cope questionnaire between the study groups We will administer 14 items of the Brief COPE comprising seven subscales (active coping, use of emotional support, positive reframing, acceptance, behavioral disengagement, denial, and self-blame). Higher scores on each subscale indicate more use of that particular coping strategy., up to 1 year|Caregiver Coping, compare caregiver coping (Brief Cope) between the study groups. We will administer 14 items of the Brief COPE comprising seven subscales (active coping, use of emotional support, positive reframing, acceptance, behavioral disengagement, denial, and self-blame). Higher scores on each subscale indicate more use of that particular coping strategy., up to 1 year|Mediation Analysis (Symptom Burden and Coping) as Mediators of Improvement in Patient-reported QOL, mediation analysis (mediation analyses are common in these types of studies, there is no novel new outcome measure here, but rather examining mediation), 2 week|Moderation Analysis to Examine Whether Patient or Transplant Related Characteristics Are Moderators of the Effect of the Intervention on Patient-reported QOL, moderation analysis (moderation analyses are common in these types of studies. there is no new novel outcome measure here, bur rather examining moderation), 2 week
The Participant has a type of blood cancer and will be undergoing stem cell transplantation. Frequently people undergoing stem cell transplantation experience physical and emotional symptoms during the course of their hospitalization for stem cell transplantation. These can be very distressing to both patient and the family members. The study doctors want to know if the early introduction of a team of clinicians that specialize in the lessening (palliation) of many of these distressing symptoms may improve the participant overall care.

This team of clinicians is called the palliative care team and they focus on ways to improve the participant pain and other symptom management (nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, anxiety, etc.) and to assist the participant and the participant's family in coping with the emotional and social issues associated with your diagnosis. The team consists of physicians and advance practice nurses who have been specially trained in the care of patients facing serious illness.

The main purpose of this study is to compare two types of care - standard transplant oncology care and standard transplant oncology care with early involvement of palliative care clinicians to see which is better for improving the experience of patients and families with blood cancers undergoing stem cell transplantation.

The purpose of this research study is to find out whether introducing patients and families undergoing stem cell transplantation to the palliative care team that specializes in symptom management can improve the physical and psychological symptoms that patients and families experience during hospitalization for stem cell transplantation.

The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure the participant and the participant 's caregivers' quality of life, physical symptoms, and mood. Study questionnaires will be completed in the hospital or clinic with assistance provided as need.
