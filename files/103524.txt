A Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of Process Variants of Selumetinib in Healthy Male Volunteers
A Study to assess, against a reference selumetinib capsule, if the drug levels of a variant of selumetinib capsule are comparable, and to assess how drug levels differed in another variant of Selumetinib in Healthy Male Volunteers.
Healthy Volunteers Bioequivalence or Bioavailability Study
DRUG: selumetinib 75mg single dose|DRUG: selumetinib 75mg single dose|DRUG: selumetinib 75mg single dose
Bioequivalence of the Free Base Variant of Selumetinib (Treatment B) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib Cmax], The bioequivalence of the free base variant of selumetinib (Treatment B) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|Bioequivalence of the Free Base Variant of Selumetinib (Treatment B) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib AUC], The bioequivalence of the free base variant of selumetinib (Treatment B) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC) of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|Bioequivalence of the Free Base Variant of Selumetinib (Treatment B) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib AUC(0-t)], The bioequivalence of the free base variant of selumetinib (Treatment B) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the AUC from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC\[0-t\]) of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).
Relative Bioavailability of the TPGS Capsule Variant (Treatment C) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib Cmax], The relative bioavailability of the TPGS capsule variant of selumetinib (Treatment C) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the Cmax of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|Relative Bioavailability of the TPGS Capsule Variant (Treatment C) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib AUC], The relative bioavailability of the TPGS capsules variant of selumetinib (Treatment C) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the AUC of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|Relative Bioavailability of the TPGS Capsule Variant (Treatment C) Compared to the Blue Reference Capsule (Treatment A) [Selumetinib AUC(0-t)], The relative bioavailability of the TPGS capsule variant of selumetinib (Treatment C) as compared to the blue reference capsule (Treatment A) was evaluated by comparing the AUC\[0-t\] of selumetinib in healthy volunteers., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|The PK of the Metabolite N-desmethyl Selumetinib by Assessment of Cmax, The PK of the metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib was evaluated by assessing the Cmax of the metabolite in healthy volunteers after oral administration of single doses of the blue reference capsule (Treatment A), the free base variant capsule (Treatment B) and the TPGS variant capsule (Treatment C)., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).|The PK of N-desmethyl Selumetinib by Assessment of the AUC(0-t), The PK of the metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib was evaluated by assessing the AUC(0-t) of the metabolite in healthy volunteers after oral administration of single doses of the blue reference capsule (Treatment A), the free base variant capsule (Treatment B) and the TPGS variant capsule (Treatment C)., Blood samples were collected pre-dose, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for each of the separate treatment periods (Visits 2, 3 and 4).
