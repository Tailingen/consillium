CAPEcitabine eXtension of Adjuvant Therapy for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: (CAPE-X)
* This study is being done to find out if extending adjuvant chemotherapy for patients by giving additional chemotherapy can lengthen the amount of time before their cancer comes back. The additional chemotherapy is called capecitabine.
* Capecitabine is an oral drug (taken by mouth). It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant treatment of adults with pancreatic cancer and also for the treatment of other types of cancer

Relapse-free survival (RFS), Relapse-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of disease relapse or death, defined as radiographic evidence of local or distant primary tumor relapse, whichever occurs first; participants alive without relapse will be censored at the date of last disease assessment., Assessed every 3 months from the date of randomization until the first documentation of disease relapse or death, up to 24 months, and then every 6 months after the initial 24 months up to 4 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause; participants still living will be censored at the date last known to be alive., Assessed every 3 months from the date of randomization until the first documentation of disease relapse or death, up to 24 months, and then every 6 months after the initial 24 months up to 4 years
- Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains one of the deadliest common solid tumor malignancies with an overall survival of 11% at 5 years for all comers. Approximately 50% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 20% of patients have localized disease at diagnosis and are candidates for surgical resection, which is necessary but not sufficient for long-term survival, and the most optimal survival outcomes are seen with multimodal therapy. The recently published SWOG S1505 study demonstrated that participants with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with either of the two most active multi-agent regimens (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel) in the perioperative setting had a median recurrence-free survival of 10.9-14.2 months, and 2-year overall survival of 47-48% (median: 23.2 vs. 23.6 months), which is similar to outcomes observed in older studies examining the efficacy of gemcitabine monotherapy or 5-FU monotherapy.

Currently, there are no guideline recommendations for extension of adjuvant therapy upon completion of all standard therapy (defined as surgery, multi-agent chemotherapy, + radiotherapy) for localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma. EA2192 (APOLLO; https:// clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT04858334), a phase II randomized controlled trial, is currently accruing and investigating the efficacy of twelve months of olaparib on relapse-free survival in participants with germline BRCA- or PALB2-mutated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which accounts for a small minority (4-7%) of cases. Olaparib was found to improve progression-free survival in participants with germline-mutated BRCA or PALB2 metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There are no trials examining extension of adjuvant therapy after completion of all standard therapy in the non-genomically selected patients with localized disease, who comprise 93-96% of these pancreas cancer patients.

- This study will be a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, with a 2:1 merged blocked, stratified randomization to the treatment arm to test the efficacy of extended adjuvant therapy in delaying disease relapse following completion of all standard therapy for localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as compared to the standard of care, which is active surveillance.
