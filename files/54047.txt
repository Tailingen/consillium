Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab/Nivolumab for Patients With Recurrent, High Risk, Resectable Melanoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the impact of Neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab for melanoma patients that had recurrence during or after adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy.

Participants will receive 2 cycles of treatment prior to their standard of care surgery. After surgery participants will receive standard of care adjuvant therapy and be followed for response.
Melanoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Rate of pathologic response rate (pCR, mCR/nCR, or pPR) at the time of surgery., Assess the pathologic response rate (pRR) at the time of surgery after two doses of neoadjuvant Ipilimumab and Nivolumab for patients that have recurred while receiving/recently completed adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy., 2 months
Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) characterized by type, severity (as defined by the NIH CTCAE, version 5.0), seriousness, duration, and relationship to study treatment., Assess the safety and tolerability of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in the study population., 2 months|Rate of adverse events that occur within 30 days post-surgery., Assess the impact of neoadjuvant ipi/nivo on morbidity of definitive surgery., 30 days|Rate of Event Free Survival (EFS)., Assess EFS in the study population., 11 years|Rate of Overall Survival (OS)., Assess OS in this study population., 11 years|Objective response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a confirmed PR and CR as defined by RECIST 1.1 prior to surgical resection., Determine RECIST 1.1 response rate (confirmed CR and PR) before surgical resection and to evaluate associations between radiographic and pathologic response rate and event free survival/overall survival., 11 years
