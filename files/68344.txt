Clinical Trial of SYS6010±SYH2051 Versus Chemotherapy in Advanced Breast Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
The study consists of two phases. Phase 1b and Phase 2. Phase 1b aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of SYS6010 as a monotherapy and in combination with SYH2051, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for subsequent Phase 2 studies. Phase 2 aims to assess the efficacy and safety of SYS6010 monotherapy or in combination with SYH2051 compared to investigator-selected chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-expressing, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic advanced breast cancer.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Breast Cancer
DRUG: SYS6010 jnjection|DRUG: monotherapy chemotherapy|DRUG: SYH2051 tablets
Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) occurrence and incidence, The occurrence and incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed based on predefined criteria during the first 28 days after the initial dose. DLTs are defined as adverse events related to the study drug that meet the protocol-specified criteria for dose limitation., Up to approximately 3 months after the first participant is enrolled|Adverse events (AE) occurrence and incidence, The occurrence and incidence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. AEs will be monitored from the first dose until the safety follow-up period., Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, The objective response rate (ORR) will be assessed based on RECIST v1.1 criteria. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best overall response., Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled
Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|Duration of response (DoR) per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|Overall survival(OS), Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|PK parameters of toxin-bound antibody, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|Description :total antibody and free toxin (JS-1) after single and continuous administration of SYS6010, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled|PK parameters after single and multiple administrations of SYH2051, Up to approximately 36 months after the first participant is enrolled
Phase Ⅰb Design:

Group A (SYS6010 3.2 mg/kg, Q2W):

Monotherapy Cohort: Planned enrollment of 8-12 breast cancer patients to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of SYS6010 monotherapy.

Combination Cohort: Includes dose-escalation and expansion phases. Dose-escalation phase: A "3+3" design will be used to explore the safety of SYS6010 combined with SYH2051, with SYH2051 doses ranging from 60-80 mg.

Expansion phase: Upon completion of dose-escalation and confirmation of safety, breast cancer patients may be enrolled in the expansion phase.

Group B (SYS6010 3.6 mg/kg, Q2W):

Monotherapy Cohort: Planned enrollment of 8-12 breast cancer patients. Combination Cohort: Similar to Group A, with SYH2051 doses ranging from 40-60 mg.

Group C (SYS6010 3.6 mg/kg, Q2W): Enroll 40 EGFR-expressing HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients to further evaluate the safety and efficacy in this specific population.

Phase Ⅱ Design:

Based on molecular subtypes of breast cancer, cohort studies will be conducted.

Each cohort will enroll 125 patients, randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio into three groups:

SYS6010 + SYH2051 SYS6010 monotherapy Chemotherapy control.
