Glucobrassicin-Brussel Sprout Effect on D10 Phe Metabolism
To determine whether glucobrassicin-rich Brussels sprouts can favorably modify the metabolism of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon deuterated phenanthrene (\[D10\]phe) in current and former smokers

Change in [D10]phenanthrene tetraol, Compare level of urinary \[D10\]phenanthrene tetraol before and after 7 days of Brussels sprout consumption., 7 days
Change in [D10]phenanthrols, Compare level of urinary \[D10\]phenanthrene phenanthrols before and after 7 days of Brussels sprout consumption., 7 days|Change in [D10]phenanthrene tetraol:[D10]phenanthrol ratio, Compare level of urinary \[D10\]phenanthrene phenanthrols before and after 7 days of Brussels sprout consumption., 7 days
Urinary 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), Urinary DIM will be quantified after Brussels sprout consumption on day 3 and day 6 of the feeding intervention for urinary DIM quantification, Day 3 and Day 6
Subjects will be given 1 microgram of \[D10\]phe, and all urine will be collected for 6 h afterwards to quantify baseline levels of \[D10\]phenanthrene tetraol (\[D10\]pheT) and \[D10\]phenanthrols (\[D10\]HOP). Within 3 days of this baseline measurement, subjects will consume 200 micromoles of glucobrassicin in the form of raw Brussels sprouts (\~200-300 grams) at the study center once daily for 7 consecutive days. Urine will be collected for 24 h after vegetable consumption on days 3 Â± 1 and 6 of the feeding intervention for 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) quantification. On day 7 of the feeding intervention, a second dose of 1 microgram of \[D10\]phe will be administered at the study center after vegetable consumption, followed by another 6 h urine collection.
