Efavirenz as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Efavirenz may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well efavirenz works as second-line therapy in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: efavirenz|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment
Non-morphological progression as defined by RECIST criteria
Non-biological progression, defined as 2-month CA 19-9 concentration < 1.5 times the baseline CA 19-9 concentration|Quality of life|Overall survival|Progression-free survival|Event-free survival|Tolerability and safety as assessed by NCI CTCAE v 3.0
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the efficacy of efavirenz as second-line monotherapy, in terms of non-morphological progression at 2 months, in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

Secondary

* Evaluate non-morphological progression in these patients at 4 months.
* Evaluate non-biological progression in these patients at 2 and 4 months.
* Evaluate the quality of life of these patients at 2 and 4 months.
* Evaluate the overall, progression-free, and event-free survival of these patients.
* Evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of efavirenz in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral efavirenz once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the QLQ-C30 at baseline and at 2 and 4 months.

After completion of study therapy patients are followed up every 2 months.
