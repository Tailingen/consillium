Cisplatin + RT for Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a Phase I dose escalation study of cisplatin and concurrent radiation in patients with ER negative, PR negative and HER2 negative breast cancer who have undergone breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.

Primary objective: To assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin when given concurrently with radiation therapy for participants with Stage II or III breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery or mastectomy

RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Cisplatin
Safety of Cisplatin w/ Radiation, To determine the maximum tolerated dose of cisplatin when given concurrently with radiation therapy for participants with Stage II or III breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery or mastectomy., 2 years
Local recurrence at 5 years, To assess local recurrence at 5-years in participants receiving cisplatin concurrently with radiation, as compared with historic controls receiving radiation without concurrent chemotherapy., 5 years|Long term toxicity, To assess long-term toxicity in participants receiving cisplatin concurrently with radiation, 2 years
This is a phase I dose escalation study of cisplatin and radiation to determine the toxicity of this combined treatment and establish an MTD.
