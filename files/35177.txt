Benmelstobart-Anlotinib-Chemo for Neoadjuvant Oral Cancer
Exploring the Safety and Efficacy of Benmelstobart Combined with Anlotinib and Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy Followed by Surgery and Postoperative Radiotherapy in Patients with Locally Advanced Oral Cancer

This is a single-center, Phase II study targeting patients with stage III-IVb locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The neoadjuvant therapy consists of Benmelstobart combined with Anlotinib and chemotherapy for 3 cycles (21 days per cycle). Surgery is performed within 2 weeks after completing neoadjuvant therapy. Postoperative adjuvant treatment is selected based on pathological grading:

Group A (Pathological Complete Response, pCR): Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) alone: 40Gy/5 weeks.

Group B (Major Pathological Response, MPR): Postoperative radiotherapy (RT) alone: 50Gy/5 weeks.

Group C (Partial Pathological Response/No Pathological Response):

Low-to-intermediate risk patients (no extracapsular nodal extension and negative margins): RT: 60Gy/6 weeks.

High-risk patients (extracapsular nodal extension and/or positive margins): Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT): 60-66Gy/6-6.6 weeks + Cisplatin: 60mg/m² every 3 weeks, 2-3 cycles.

Additionally, all patients will receive adjuvant Benmelstobart 3-4 weeks after surgery, followed by Benmelstobart maintenance therapy (total treatment duration of 1 year).
