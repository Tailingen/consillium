Blinatumomab Bridging Therapy for BALL
The investigator is testing the ability of a biologically active therapy in blinatumomab, an anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, to further reduce residual leukemia immediately prior to HCT to improve post-HCT outcomes.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Refractory B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Relapsed B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab
Percentage of Subjects in Complete Remission (CR), The primary efficacy variable is the percent of subjects that remain in Complete Remission (CR) after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of blinatumomab. Complete remission was defined as \<5% blasts in the bone marrow. Complete remission was further defined as minimal residual disease (MRD) positive (\>/= to 0.01%) or MRD negative (\<0.01%) as measured by flow cytometry of the bone marrow., 1 or 2 Months depending on the number of cycles of blinatumomab|Percentage of Subjects Flow Cytometry (FC) -Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Defined as <0.01% Leukemia, The primary efficacy variable is the percent of subjects that become Flow Cytometry-MRD negative (FC-MRD negative) \< 0.01% after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of blinatumomab., 1 to 2 Months depending on the number of cycles of blinatumomab
Percentage of Subjects That Are High-Throughput Deep Sequencing (HTS)-Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Defined as Undetectable, The percent of subjects that achieve MRD negative by molecular High-Throughput Deep Sequencing (HTS-MRD negative) (MRD undetectable) after completion of Blinatumomab bridging therapy, which may consist of 1 to 2 cycles of Blinatumomab., After completion of Blinatumomab bridging therapy (1 participant's course consisted of 1 cycle, the other participant's course consisted of 2 cycles)
The investigator is testing the ability of a biologically active therapy in blinatumomab, an anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, to further reduce residual leukemia immediately prior to HCT to improve post-HCT outcomes. This Phase 2 study will determine the effectiveness of delivering 1 to 2 cycles of blinatumomab (Days 1-28) as bridging therapy in children, adolescent and young adults with relapse or persistent MRD B-ALL. Eligible subjects will receive 1 or 2, 28-day cycles of blinatumomab prior to proceeding to HCT. Centralized MRD assessment will be performed after completion of the 28-days of blinatumomab using both flow cytometry (University of Washington, Brent Wood, MD) and High-Throughput Deep Sequencing (HTS) MRD technologies (Adaptive Technologies, Seattle, WA). Subjects who achieve flow cytometry negative MRD (\<0.01%) after a single cycle of blinatumomab can proceed directly to HCT whereas subjects who remain MRD positive by flow cytometry may receive a 2nd cycle of blinatumomab. Subjects who remain MRD positive by flow cytometry after a 2nd cycle of blinatumomab will come off study.
