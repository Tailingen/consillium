CALM Psychotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Cancer in Chile
Patients with metastatic cancer experience multidimensional challenges that increase the risk of emotional distress, which must be addressed by the health team. Chile lacks evidence on effective therapeutic interventions in this population. CALM is a brief, individual (with the presence of a caregiver in one or more sessions) and evidence-based psychotherapy developed at The Princess Margaret Cancer Center. It consists of an intervention of 3 to 6 psychotherapy sessions over a period of 3 to 6 months. The Global CALM program aims to expand CALM research around the world, a program to which FALP has subscribed. Objective: To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CALM in a sample of patients with metastatic cancer in Chile.

Phase 2 study of preliminary, pseudo-experimental efficacy, without a control group. The study will be carried out in Falp and Corporación Valientes.
