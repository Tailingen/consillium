Severe Neutropenia After HIPEC Using Mitomycin-C
Mitomycin-C (MMC) is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) to treat colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal metastases. However, MMC has a side effect of myelosuppression. Particularly, severe neutropenia after CRS with HIPEC can be a life-threatening condition. Despite the postoperative risks of this side effect, the causes and risk factors for severe neutropenia after CRS followed by HIPEC is not identified so far. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate to evaluate clinical risk factors and pharmacologic properties after CRS with HIPEC using MMC in patients with colorectal cancer or appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with peritoneal metastases.

PROCEDURE: Intraoperative blood and peritoneal fluid samplings during HIPEC
Association between the concentration of intraoperative mitomycin-C absoprtion and severe neutropenia after CRS/HIPEC, Comparison of the pharmacologic association between occurrence of postoperative severe neutropenia, and blood absoprtion rates of MMC and the area-under-the curve (AUC) ratios during HIPEC, 2 weeks after the discharge
Incidence of severe neutropenia, Incidence (rates), During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC|Postoperative complications, Assessment from Clavien-Dindo classification, During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC|Patterns of perioperative changes of WBC, Hemoglobin, platelet, lymphocyte, neutrophil counts, Records for serologic tests, During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC|Frequency of postoperative uses for G-CSF, Numbers of G-CSF uses, During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC|Changes of CEA level, ng/mL, During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC|Quality of Life: QoR-40 questionnaire, Answer of questionnarie, During 2 weeks after CRS/HIPEC
Evaluation parameters

1. Preoperative period

   * Obtaining informed consent
   * Assessment of baseline clinical characteristics: vital sign, BMI, BSA, ASA classification, ECOG, CBC, CEA level
   * Before 1 day of surgery, assessment of QoR-40 questionnaires
2. Intra-operative period

   * CRS / HIPEC
   * Assessment for peritoneal cancer index, complete cytoreduction score
   * HIPEC procedures: HIPEC was performed using MMC 35 mg/m2 at 41-43â„ƒ for 90 min. Following the HIPEC triple method, MMC 35 mg/m2 was mixed with 3L of Physioneal PD-2 1.5% peritoneal dialysis solution and administered into the intraperitoneal cavity at 50% of the dose at the beginning of HIPEC, 25% of the dose at 30 min, and 25% of the dose at 60 min.
   * Intraoperative samplings of blood and peritoneal fluids during HIPEC :

     * Blood sampling of 5 ml at each time point (baseline, 0 (HIPEC starting point), 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 min)
     * Peritoneal fluid sampling of 5 ml at each time point (baseline, 0 (HIPEC starting point), 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 min)
3. Postoperative period : Postoperative assessment until the discharge date or postoperative 14th days.

   * Daily assessment before discharge : vital sign, transfusion, neutropenia occurrence, adverse events, hematologic blood test (CBC, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), postoperative complications, use of G-CSF, ICU admission (If severe neutropenia occurs in the postoperative period, the patient assigns in arm I.)
   * CEA level: postoperative 5th day
   * QoR-40 questionnaires: postoperative 4th and 7th days
