A Study of Second-line Treatment With Apatinib After TACE in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with apatinib in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), 3-month PFS, 6-month PFS and 1-year PFS.

DRUG: Apatinib
Progression free survival, A duration from the date of initial treatment with apatinib to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death., 6 months
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of initial treatment with apatinib to the date of death due to any cause, 2 years|Objective response rates, Number of participants who achieve complete response or partial response.
