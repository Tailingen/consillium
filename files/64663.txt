Dalpiciclib Isethionate Tablets Combined With Abiraterone Acetate Tablets (I) and Prednisone Tablets (AA-P) Versus Placebo Combined With AA-P in Treatment of High-volume, Metastatic, Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC)
This study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dalcilide tablets in combination with AA-P in the treatment of subjects with high tumor burden mHSPC and to determine the second stage starting dose and progression-free survival（rPFS） based on BICR assessment
