Study of PIVKA-II and AFP Measurement in Surveillance Program for Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
There is no prospective study on the test intervals of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or on the role of prothrombin induced vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in surveillance program for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). The goal of this study is to compare if the testing of AFP + PIVKA-II in intervals of 3 months is more effective in diagnosing early stages of HCC than the 6 month interval of AFP that is commonly used
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: tumor maker interval shortly
the difference of curative treatments & survival rates, 4 years
the difference of early detection rates of HCC between both groups, 4 years
