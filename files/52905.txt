Dovitinib Combined With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label phase I study in which dovitinib is given in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Dovitinib dose escalation is planned in order to determine its maximum tolerated dose when given in this combination.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Dovitinib|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Evaluate the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of treatment with dovitinib in combination with bortezomib/ dexamethasone., Determination of the maximum tolerated dose of dovitinib will be based on Treatment Cycle 1 safety data for all subjects for whom all safety assessments during Treatment Cycle 1, as well as the pre-dosing safety assessments performed on Study Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 2, are completed and who do not receive alternate anti-neoplastic therapies during that period., Treatment Cycle 1 (three weeks) for each participant.
To assess the overall response rate for the combination dovitinib/bortezomib/ dexamethasone in patients receiving at least 4 cycles of therapy., Starting with Treatment Cycle 2, response to treatment will be determined during each treatment cycle (Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD))., Participants will be followed for up to one year.
Other Secondary Efficacy Objectives, Participants will be evaluated for time to first response, duration of response, time to best response, and time to disease progression., Up to 10 years
