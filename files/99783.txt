A Study to Evaluate the Safety and PK of CRN04894 for the Treatment of Cushing's Syndrome
A Phase 1b/2a, first-in-disease, open-label, multiple-ascending dose exploratory study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic biomarker responses associated with CRN04894 (an adrenocorticotropic hormone \[ACTH\] receptor antagonist) in participants with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome (Cushing's disease or Ectopic ACTH Syndrome \[EAS\])

This is a Phase 1b/2a, first-in-disease, open-label, multiple-ascending dose exploratory study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic biomarker responses associated with atumelnant (also known as CRN04894) (an adrenocorticotropic hormone \[ACTH\] receptor antagonist) over a 10-day or 14-day treatment period in participants with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome (Cushing's disease or Ectopic ACTH Syndrome \[EAS\]). Participants will receive oral atumelnant once daily for 10 days followed by monitoring during 4 'wash-out' days, or for 14 days.
