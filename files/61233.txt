Mechanistic Evaluation on Sorafenib Induced Hypophosphatemia.
The purpose of this study is to:

1. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the sorafenib-induced hypophosphatemia and possible early effect of hypophosphatemia on bone mineral density
2. A secondary objective to assess the effect sorafenib treatment on evaluate left ventricular function (LVEF) and Beta-type natriuretic peptide in plasma.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
To evaluate a potential mechanism of hypophosphatemia related to sorafenib treatment based on measurement of phosphate regulating factors, peptides, and related laboratory variables, Occur when the last query is resolved
