Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Relapsed Cancer|Refractory Cancer
DRUG: CFI-400945 Fumarate
Evaluation of the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events in patients, This will be done to assess safety and tolerability of CFI-400945 fumarate, 5 years|Highest tolerated dose of CFI-400945 fumarate, The Maximum Tolerated Dose MTD is defined as the highest dose level that does not lead to unacceptable toxicity in two or more patients in a dosing cohort., 5 years|Recommended phase 2 dose of CFI-400945 fumarate, Following completion of dosing of at least 1 cycle for all patients enrolled the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be determined.It will be based upon the MTD established during dose escalation and its comprehensive outcome, 5 years
Number of participants with response to treatment, Patients responses will be assess using the International Working Group response criteria for AML and MDS., 5 years
Participants will be screened prior to the start of the study drug for eligibility.

Eligible participants will take CFI-400945 by mouth, once a day, every day of each 28 day cycle. Participants will be asked to keep a study drug diary.

While receiving the study drug, participants will have standard tests and procedures done for safety purposes.

Procedures for research purposes include bone marrow aspirate and additional blood collection for biomarker research, and additional blood samples for pharmacokinetic research.

When participants stop the study drug permanently for any reason, they will be asked to have an End of Treatment Visit and be followed for safety purposes.
