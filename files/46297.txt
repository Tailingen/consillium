Cardiovascular Events From Trifluridine/Tipiracil +/- Oxaliplatin in Colorectal/Oesogastric Adenocarcinoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with esophageal/stomach or colorectal cancer treated by trifluridine/tipiracil +/- oxaliplatin after an episode of cardiac angina-related thoracic pain due to fluoropyrimidines in the adjuvant or metastatic setting .
Colorectal Adenocarcinoma|Oesogastric
DRUG: Trifluridine/Tipiracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Rate of cardiovascular events at 3 months., Assessment of the rate of cardiovascular events in patients treated by trifluridine/tipiracil +/- oxaliplatin over a 3-month period., At 3 months
Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events by CTCAE 5.0, Safety profile of the trifluridine/tipiracil and oxaliplatin combination, Assessed up to 48 months|Number of patients with disease control rate (DCR), DCR defined as partial response, complete response (CR), or stable disease (SD)., Assessed up to 48 months|The 3-month drop-out rate of limiting toxicity, Drop-out rate defined as the number of patients who left the study due to limiting toxicity between treatment initiation and 3 months., At 3 months
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a 14-day screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. Patient who meet the eligibility requirement will be included in the study and will be treated by trifluridine/tipiracil +/- oxaliplatin.
