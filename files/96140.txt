The ct DNA R0 study is a prospective, open labelled, monocentric trial. The aim is to evaluate the circulating tumor DNA rate in the blood, before and after curative resection of hepatic metastasis of uveal melanoma (HMUM) and during post-surgery follow-up.

The patient will have a blood sample before and after the surgery and during the post-surgery follow-up. The patient will have a maximum of 10 blood samples during the 2 years of his follow-up of the study.
