Study Of MK-0752 In Combination With Tamoxifen Or Letrozole to Treat Early Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of a research (investigational) drug, MK-0752 combined with either tamoxifen or letrozole on breast cancer cells.

Tamoxifen and letrozole are standard hormone treatments used to treat breast cancers that are positive for the estrogen receptor. However, over time the breast cancer cells can become resistant to tamoxifen and letrozole. MK-0752 is in a class of drugs called gamma secretase inhibitors. Gamma secretase inhibitors may play a role in reversing the resistance to drugs such as tamoxifen and letrozole.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: MK-0752
Number of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event, The number of participants experiencing at least one adverse event during the 24-day observation period and initial post-operative visit., 30 days
OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the gamma-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 in the pre-surgical setting in patients with early stage, estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI).

To establish the feasibility and success of multi-laboratory collaborations in evaluating clinical specimens and biomarker testing.

To provide preliminary data on the impact of MK-0752 on a panel of biomarkers involved in the notch signaling pathway.
