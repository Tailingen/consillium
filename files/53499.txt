Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement in Colorectal,Coloanal and Ileoanal Anastomoses
The primary purpose of this prospective, randomized multicenter center study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes of colorectal, coloanal and ileoanal anastomoses reinforced with a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement material compared with standard non-reinforced colorectal, coloanal and ileoanal techniques with respect to the incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture and time to ileostomy closure, if applicable.

DEVICE: GORE SEAMGUARD® Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement|PROCEDURE: Staple line without reinforcement
Proportion of Subjects Who Experience a Clinical and/or Radiologic Anastomotic Leak, The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of subjects who experience a clinical and/or radiologic anastomotic leak through 4 - 12 weeks post procedure., Completion of procedure through 4-12 weeks post procedure
Identify and Compare the Rate of Anastomotic Stenosis Associated With Circular Stapled Anastomoses Constructed With and Without CBSG., Post operative|Determine the Rate of Significant Staple Line Hemorrhage With and Without the Use of CBSG in Circular Stapled Anastomoses, Post operative|Determine the Efficacy and Further Substantiate Safety of CBSG Used in Conjunction With Circular Staplers When Performing High-risk Colorectal, Coloanal, and Ileoanal Anastomoses., Compare th number of patients experiencing significant post-operative complications when performing high-risk colorectal, coloanal, and Ileoanal anastomoses across both groups studied., Within 4 - 12 weeks post-surgery
This is a randomized prospective trial that compares the use of GORE SEAMGUARD® Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement (CBSG) to standard stapling techniques in colorectal resections. The potential exists to utilize CBSG as a means of lowering the rate of post-operative anastomotic leakage and bleeding in high-risk colorectal, coloanal, and ileoanal anastomoses.
