A Single-arm, Open, Exploratory Clinical Study of Allogeneic CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Brain Gliomas With Positive CD70 Expression
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if allogeneic CAR-T cells can treat patients with advanced gliomas. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Evaluate the safety of allogeneic CAR-T cells in the treatment of advanced gliomas.

To evaluate the effectiveness of allogeneic CAR-T cells in the treatment of advanced gliomas and to study its immunological properties in patients.
Gliomas
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T
Evaluate the safety of allogeneic T cells in the treatment of advanced giloma patients, The adverse events and severe adverse events will be evaluated., 2 years
Evaluate the efficiency of allogeneic CAR-T cells in the treatment of advanced glioma patients., The objective clinical response will be evaluated., 2 years
In this open, single-armed study, selected patients with advanced gliomas confirmed by Histopathology will be received allogeneic CAR-T cells treatment. First, their tumor specimen will be test to evaluate the expression of CD70.The patients with positive CD70 expression will be in enrolled.Then they will be received allogeneic CAR-T cells infusion cultured from heathy adults.
