HIFU for Focal Ablation of Prostate Tissue: An Observational Study
The Sonablate HIFU device was approved by the U.S.FDA for prostate tissue ablation in October, 2015. The purpose of this observational research study is to investigate the localized treatment of prostate cancer using HIFU through clinical data and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Sonablate HIFU device
Oncological Response, The following definitions will be used for evaluation of oncological response:

1. Complete response: Ablation of prostate tissue in targeted biopsy cores at 6 months and 18 months post-procedure biopsy and resolution of initial mp-MRI abnormality.
2. Incomplete radiographic response: Residual mp-MRI abnormality at 6 months compared to baseline
3. Local failure: Failure to ablate prostate tissue, 6 months
Evaluation of Quality-of-Life Symptoms (EPIC-CP), The EPIC-CP questionnaire will be used to evaluate urinary, bowel and sexual health quality-of-life symptoms for participants pre- and post-HIFU., 6 months|Evaluation of Quality-of-Life Symptoms (EPIC-CP), The EPIC-CP questionnaire will be used to evaluate urinary, bowel and sexual health quality-of-life symptoms for participants pre- and post-HIFU., 18 months|Decisional Regret Scale, This questionnaire data will be collected to assess for subjects' decision-making satisfaction., 18 months
This observational study will serve to collect data from medical record review and questionnaires before and after High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) for focal ablation of prostate tissue. The subject will have already undergone or opted to receive the HIFU procedure as part of standard of care in order to participate in this study.
