Influence of an Intervention on Diet, Physical Exercise and Mindfulness in the Quality of Life of Survivors With Breast Cancer
ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:

Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of death among women around the world. Integrative oncology, together with conventional medical treatment, has proven to be an important support for the control of cancer symptoms, improvement of quality of life, and contribution to the overall patient health, providing an integrated patient care both physically and emotionally.

Within the intervention group (IG) a diet, exercise and mindfulness intervention was performed, while the control group (CG) did not receive any sort of treatment, during 6 months. Passed (at the beginning and end of the research) questionnaires concerning general health, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23), and diet (Mediterranean diet adherence test and 24-h-recall) and a blood and urine sample was collected to analyze general biochemical variables.
