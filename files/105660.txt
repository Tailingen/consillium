Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy (PD-1 / PD-L1) Combined With Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: a Single Center, Prospective, Open, One Arm Exploratory Clinical Study
To purpose of this study is to access the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant Immunotherapy (PD-1 / PD-L1) combined with chemotherapy for locally advanced thoracic esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Neoadjuvant Therapies
PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy (PD-1 / PD-L1) Combined With Chemotherapy
Pathologic Complete Response, According to the detection of pathological specimens after operation, no malignant tumor cells were detected, so the patient achieved complete pathological remission., 2-5 years
Disease-free Survival, The patient achieved CR (complete remission) and still had no probability of recurrence after treatment in 2-years., 2-5 years|Progression-Free-Survival, The time between the beginning of treatment and the observation of disease progression or death from any cause., 2-5 years|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death from any cause., 2-5 years|Security, The safety of drugs was evaluated from four aspects: adverse events, adverse reactions, serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions., 2-5 years|Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume reduced to a predetermined value and could maintain the minimum time limit., 2-5 years
Tumor markers, Tumor markers refer to those characteristic bioactive substances that can be detected that can reflect the development stage of malignant tumor cells. In a narrow sense, tumor markers refer to bioactive substances synthesized, secreted and released into blood and / or body fluid by malignant tumor cells, including enzymes, hormones, proteins, metabolites and other substances, Their occurrence and changes are closely related to the growth, diffusion, occurrence and development of malignant tumors., 2-5 years|Intestinal flora, Intestinal flora homeostasis is called the organ of human body. Intestinal flora homeostasis plays an important role in the life activities of the body. It has important physiological significance in promoting the digestion and absorption of host nutrients, maintaining the normal physiological function of intestine, regulating body immunity and antagonizing the colonization of pathogenic microorganisms., 2-5 years
Each patient will complete 2 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy and decide whether to operate after evaluating the curative effect if there is no active withdrawal of the subject from the trial or the researcher believes that the subject is not suitable for further trials. The patients after operation and without operation enter the survival follow-up period. If the imaging evaluation is PD after neoadjuvant therapy, the follow-up treatment shall be carried out according to the following principles: the imaging evaluation belongs to the continuous operation that can be operated; If the imaging evaluation was inoperable, radical concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy were performed. Postoperative adjuvant therapy shall be performed according to NCCN guidelines. If it is necessary to improve the local control rate, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy is feasible. At the same time, imaging evaluation was performed until tumor recurrence and metastasis. After tumor recurrence and metastasis, all patients should also enter survival follow-up; In case of drug withdrawal (such as intolerable toxicity) other than recurrence and metastasis during treatment, the treatment is completed, the post-treatment visit is entered, and the survival follow-up is entered after recurrence.
