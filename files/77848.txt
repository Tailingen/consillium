Response Rate, Will be assessed according to the revised RECIST guideline v1.1, 6 months|Progression free survival - PFS, Time from treatment to date of first documented progression or date of death, Up to 12 months|Overall Survival - OS, Measure the time from the commencement of treatment to death, Death|Peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA, Circuiting tumor DNA will be measured at baseline and 6 weeks after treatment, 8 weeks
This is a phase 1/2 clinical study investigating the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine in combination with PD-1 knockout T cells in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The therapeutic vaccine is a customized product involving ex vivo treatment of the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a recombinant fusion protein (PAP-GM-CSF) to activate the expression of the antigen that would activate the immune function to kill cancer cells. The PD-1 knockout engineered T cells are also prepared using patient's T cells in which PD-1 gene will be knocked out using CRISPR Cas9 technology. The therapeutic vaccine and PD-1 knockout T cells will be infused back to the patient in 3 times with a 2-week interval.
