Retrospective Study of Immunotherapy Related Toxicities and Factors Impacting Outcomes in Children and Adults With Cancer
Immunotherapy is changing the landscape of cancer therapy. Particularly unique to immunotherapy is the toxicity profile, which differs from chemotherapy-based strategies and can be associated with inflammatory responses and/or autoimmune type reactions resulting from activation of the immune system. Referred to as immune related adverse events (irAEs), these adverse events may require systemic immunosuppression or have other consequences and present unique management challenges. Specific to CAR T-cell and other adoptive cell therapies is the constellation of symptoms referred to as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can range in severity from mild to severe, and can require both cytokine directed blockade and/or systemic immunosuppression to ameliorate the side effects. While side effects may be unique to each individual immunotherapy, and may also be patient specific, cumulative experience will help to inform toxicity profiles and improve management of side effects and overall outcomes.

Given the number of immunotherapeutic approaches at the NCI, the primary goal of this protocol is to facilitate retrospective chart review of various immunotherapy trials at the NCI used in the treatment of cancer to comprehensively study toxicity profiles. This study will not involve the use of specimens or participant contact. All data that is needed has already been collected on the individual treatment protocols and is available in CRIS records or protocol specific databases.

Data will only be collected from treatment protocols where the PI has given permission for use of the data on the trial the subject was enrolled on. This protocol will be amended to incorporate new research objectives and new protocols as necessary....
