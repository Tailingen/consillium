Cetuximab in Combination With Anti-PD-1 and mFOLFOX Treat For RAS/BRAF wt Right-Sided Colon Cancer
We plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with anti-PD-1 and mFOLFOX6 in the treatment of RAS/BRAF WT locally advanced or metastatic right colon cancer
Colonic Neoplasms
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Objective response rate (ORR), percentage of patients showing complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response according to RECIST1.1, an average of 6 to 12 weeks after surgery
disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of first documentation of disease recurrence or death due to any cause, UP to 3 years|R0 resection rate, The percentage of patients whose post-operative pathology indicate negative margin is observed under microscope, an average of 6 to 12 weeks after surgery
According to the World Health Organization, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women worldwide. CRC is estimated to kill 551,269 patients worldwide each year, accounting for 5.8% of cancer deaths.Despite recent development in treatment, locally advanced or metastatic colon cancer (CC) represents a major therapeutic challenge. Presently, the standard therapeutic approach for CC is surgery and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Nevertheless,several studies showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a more effective treatment option.Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) directed against programmed death-1 (PD-1) is highly effective and has become the standard of care for patients with dMMR metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs). In contrast, the same regimens have shown poor response rates in patients with pMMR mCRCs.Due to the high ORR rate of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy and the microenvironment with high immune infiltration of right colon cancer, it may be more sensitive to ICI.

This study consisted of two phases: phase I consisted of 25 patients; if \> 11 patients responded, the trial will continue to phase II, and a total of 66 patients will be enrolled.
