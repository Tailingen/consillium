Single Agent Abraxane as Second Line Therapy in Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine what effects the drug Abraxane has on bladder cancer.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Paclitaxel
Response rate, one year
safety, 1 year|overall survival, 1-2 years
For those patients with advanced bladder cancer who have progressed on a platinum based regimen, no widely accepted standard second line therapy currently exists. Taxanes including paclitaxel have exhibited clinical activity in this disease and are sometimes given off study. However, toxicities including neurotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions often limit the use of paclitaxel. ABRAXANE may allow delivery of a greater dose of paclitaxel to those with bladder cancer with an easier method of administration and with less toxicity.
