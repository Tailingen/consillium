Biological Medicine for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) Eradication 2.0
The BIOMEDE 2.0 study is the second stage of the BIOMEDE multi-arm, multistage rolling programme (adaptive platform protocol).

It is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase-3 trial evaluating efficacy of ONC201 in comparison with everolimus (primary objective based on internal comparison) and subsequently to historical controls.

Two treatment groups will be compared. Study treatment will be continued until centrally confirmed disease progression (either radiologically or histologically), unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. A switch between treatment groups is allowed after confirmation of the disease progression (real-time central review blinded to the treatment arm allocation).

The final conclusion of the trial will be successful for ONC201, if ONC201 is found significantly superior to everolimus in terms of centrally-reviewed PFS (Progression-free survival) from randomization (internal comparison) either overall, considering ND-DMG and DIPG-patients together, or in the subgroup of ND-DMG patients alone. In other cases, Everolimus will remain the standard arm unless it appears associated with an excess of toxicity compared to ONC201 which could then be discussed as a new standard.
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma|Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3 K27M-Mutant
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: ONC201|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Progression-free survival, Defined as the time between date of randomization and unequivocal clinical, cytological or radiological progression confirmed by central review, or death whatever the cause., Until 2 years after inclusion of the last patient
Overall survival (for all the comparisons to historical controls), Defined from the date of radiological diagnosis to the date of death from any cause., Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Overall survival (for the internal comparison between randomized groups), Defined from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Progression-free survival after first progression, It will also be computed from the date of progression to the date of subsequent progression or death from any cause, in order to describe the outcome after progression., Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Complication rate of the diagnostic biopsy-based procedure, Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Severity of the complications (including prolongation of the hospital stay) of the diagnostic biopsy-based procedure, Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Duration of the complications (including delay for starting treatment) of the diagnostic biopsy-base procedure, Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Safety profile of the drugs, Using the NCI-CTC v5.0 criteria, during radiotherapy and during the entire duration of the administration of the drug, considering all adverse events except adverse events unequivocally related to the disease (pseudo)-progression., Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient|Relative benefit/risk ratio of ONC201 compared to everolimus, It will be assessed using the Q-TWiST approach (Quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or adverse event) evaluated from survival times (overall survival and progression-free survival) and adverse events data (date of occurrence of grade 3+ adverse event)., Until 5 years after randomization of the last patient
