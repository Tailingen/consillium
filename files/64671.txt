Diagnostic Value of Molecular Cytological Analysis (CMA) and Shear Wave Elastography ShearWave (SWE) in Patients With a Thyroid Nodule With Indeterminate Cytology: Feasibility Study
The purpose of the study is to investigate the contribution of molecular cytological analysis (CMA) and shear wave elastography ShearWave (SWE) in the diagnosis of nodules with indeterminate cytology (IC)
Thyroid Node|Indeterminate Cytology|Surgery Indication
PROCEDURE: aspiration in thyroid node for Molecular Cytogenetic Analysis.
Evaluate the diagnostic performance of the AMC and SWE elastography, Evaluate the diagnostic performance of the AMC and SWE elastography in patients with a thyroid nodule CI taking as reference the histology of the nodule., at inclusion, before surgery
evaluate the diagnostic performance of elastography SWE, For elastography SWE validate decision thresholds for the parameters of elasticity of thyroid nodules, and evaluate the diagnostic performance of elastography SWE combined with those of the standard ultrasound., at inclusion, before surgery|Establish a combined diagnostic score results of elastography, Establish a combined diagnostic score results of elastography, the standard ultrasound and molecular analysis, at inclusion, before surgery
The purpose of the study is to investigate the contribution of molecular cytological analysis (CMA) and shear wave elastography ShearWave (SWE) in the diagnosis of nodules with indeterminate cytology (IC)
