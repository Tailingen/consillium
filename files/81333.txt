A Study of ImmunoPet Imaging Using 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 in Adult Participants With Solid Cancers Treated With Cemiplimab
This study is researching an experimental drug called 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 and cemiplimab. The study is focused on patients with a type of cancer that can be potentially imaged using 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 and show special tumor features that may be important to the way the immune system fights cancer.

The aim of the study is to study the safety and tolerability (how the body reacts to the drug) of the imaging agent 89Zr-DFO REGN5054.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the study drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)

DRUG: 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054|DRUG: cemiplimab
Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Part A, Up to day 8, after the infusion of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN5054|Incidence and severity of TEAEs, Part A and B, Up to approximately week 115
Clinical dosimetry based on tissue radiation absorbed dose calculated from positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition data, After injection of 37 megabecquerel (MBq) of 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054, a series of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images will be obtained over a period of up to 8 days and corrected for attenuation by low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans using PET/CT. The radiation effective dose per organ/tissue will be calculated for each organ using Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling (OLINDA/EXM). The unit of effective dose per organ/tissue will be millisievert per Minimum Base Quantity (MBq) for each participant's organ/tissue. The final values for each organ will be averaged across participants for each mass dose, On days 1, 5 and 8|Clinical dosimetry based on tissue radiation effective dose calculated from PET image acquisition data, After injection of 37 MBq of 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054, a series of whole-body PET images will be obtained over a period of up to 8 days and corrected for attenuation by low-dose CT scans using PET/CT.
