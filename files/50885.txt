The Effect of Breast Cancer Prevention Journey Program
The aim of this quasi-experimental study is to determine the effect of the "Breast Cancer Prevention Journey Program" on health beliefs about breast cancer in women over 40 years of age who have never had a mammogram before. The research aims to answer the following basic questions:

-Do women who participated in the "Breast Cancer Prevention Journey Program" have different health beliefs about breast cancer than women who did not participate in the program? The researchers will compare the program with routine care to see if the "Breast Cancer Prevention Journey Program" works. The study will be conducted in a quasi-experimental design with a pre-test post-test control group.

Participants in the experimental group will first participate in the "The fight against breast cancer" training structured according to the Health Belief Model. One week after the training, the participants in the experimental group will be taken to mammography screening with free shuttles.

Participants in the control group will not receive any additional intervention. This group will only receive routine intervention within the scope of the breast cancer screening program conducted by the Ministry of Health.

Champion's Health Belief Model Scale in Breast Cancer Screening, This scale was developed to assess women's breast cancer beliefs (1984) and adapted into Turkish in 2004 (2004). It has a total of 52 items. It is a 5-point Likert-type scale. No single total score is obtained from the scale. The 8 sub-dimensions of the scale and the minimum and maximum scores that can be obtained are as follows; "Perception of sensitivity (min:3; max:15)", "Perception of severity (min:6; max:30)", "Perception of health motivation (min:5; max:25)", "Perception of benefit of breast self-examination (BSE) (min: 4; max:20)", 'Perception of benefit of breast self-examination (CBM) (min:10; max:50)', 'Barriers to CBM (min:8; max:40)', 'Perception of benefit of mammography (min:5; max:25)' and 'Barriers to mammography (min:11; max:55)'. Scale subscale scores are calculated by summing the scores. An increase in score is associated with a positive attitude in all sub-dimensions except the barrier sub-dimension. The Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale is between 0.69 and 0.83., two week
