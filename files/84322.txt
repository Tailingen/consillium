Stopping Maintenance Therapy in People With Multiple Myeloma in MRD-Negative Remission
This study will test whether stopping maintenance therapy in people with multiple myeloma in MRD-negative remission has the same effect on disease control as continuing this therapy. The study will look at whether people currently on maintenance therapy can safely stop this treatment and continue with active surveillance instead while keeping their MRD-negative remission status for at least 1 year.
