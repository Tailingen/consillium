Early Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Improves Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength in Patient After Low Anterior Resection
The aim of study is to investigate the difference in Maximum Squeeze Pressure in patients with and without pelvic floor muscle training in low anterior resection in peri-operative period
Cancer of Rectum
OTHER: Pelvic floor exercise
Maximum Squeeze Pressure, 1 week before operation and 3 months after operation
Functional Outcomes, Bowel frequency, Fecal incontinence score, 1 week before operation and 3 months post operation
The functional outcome after low anterior resection varies greatly. Proportion of patient suffers from urgency and incontinence. Pelvic muscle disuse with atrophy and fibrosis may be a cause for the poor function. Peri-operative pelvic floor muscle training may preserve pelvic floor muscle bulk and function and thus improve functional outcome after surgery.
