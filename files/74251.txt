Procedural Outcomes in Endobronchial Ultrasound - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) With and Without Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE)
The objective of this study is comparing the attributable procedural time of Endobronchial Ultrasound - Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) when sampling mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with or without Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE). The primary outcome will be the time elapsed from EBUS bronchoscope insertion to bronchoscope withdrawal. Secondary outcomes will include total number of sampled lymph nodes, average number of needle aspirations per lymph node sampled, overall diagnostic yield, and procedural time of the cytopathologist.
