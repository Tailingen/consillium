Intravenous Lidocaine for Pain Associated With Pancreatic Cancer and Chronic Pancreatitis
Pain is a major clinical problem for many patients with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis (CP).In pancreatic cancer, nearly 75% of patients suffer from pain at the time of diagnosis, with over 90% of patients in advanced stages. In CP, pain occurs in 80-90% of patients and strongly affects quality of life. For both conditions, the majority of pain is addressed using the WHO analgesic ladder. However, more invasive pain therapies are often necessary.

Currently, in several centers in the Netherlands, treatment with IV lidocaine is already used in clinical practice in patients with pancreatic cancer and CP. Based on practical experience, the majority of patients benefit from this therapy, however, its efficacy in terms of duration of pain relief, decrease in pain scores, increase in patient satisfaction and adverse events is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of monitored single intravenous infusion in patients with pancreatic cancer and CP.
