Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of SAR443216 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory HER2 Expressing Solid Tumors
Primary Objectives:

Part 1 (Dose Escalation)

* To determine the MTD/maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR443216 administered as a single agent in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors and determine the RD(s) for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration in the dose escalation part.
* To determine the safety of SAR443216 after intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration.

Part 2 (Dose expansion)

• To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 at the RD(s) in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.

Secondary Objectives:

Part 1 • To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 after IV and SC administration at the RD(s) in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.

Part 2

• To determine the safety of SAR443216.

Part 1 and 2

* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR443216 when administered as a single agent after IV and SC (Part 1 only) administration.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of SAR443216 after IV and SC administration.
* To assess preliminary clinical activity of single agent SAR443216 at the RD(s) in participants with HER2 expressing solid tumors, with various levels of HER2 expression.

The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression date; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated to be:

* 7.5 months (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 3.5 months for treatment, and a median of 3 months for long term follow-up) in escalation.
* 9.5 months (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 5.5 months for treatment, and a median of 3 months for long term follow-up) in expansion.
