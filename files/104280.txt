A Study of Cadonilimab（AK104） Plus Lenvatinib in Previous Immunotherapy Treated Advanced/Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase II, open-label, single arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 in combination with lenvatinib in previous immunotherapy treated advanced/metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Subjects with unresectable advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who were second line patients after first-line immunotherapy combined treatment progression. Subjects will receive Cadonilimab（AK104） plus lenvatinib until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxic effects, death, a decision by the physician or patient to withdraw from the trial. The primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigators.

This trial is a single-arm, multicenter clinical study with the aim of enrolling 28 patients with unresectable advanced ccRCC. The study was divided into three research centers, namely Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University in Shanghai, and Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. Lenvatinib capsules are taken orally, 8 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing \< 60 kg, 12 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing ≥ 60 kg, combined with cardunilimab, intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg, once every three weeks (q3w) until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of new antitumor therapy, investigator decision, loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first. Tumor efficacy will be assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks (6 weeks ± 7 days) during treatment, and at end-of-treatment visits.

The experiment is mainly divided into the effectiveness import stage and the cohort expansion stage. The safety introduction phase planned to enroll 12 patients, and after the first dose, the dosing regimen: lenvatinib capsules orally, 8 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing \< 60 kg, 12 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing ≥ 60 kg, in combination with cartunilimab, intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg every three weeks (q3w), evaluated in 12 patients, 2 or more patients achieved remission before cohort expansion.

The cohort expansion phase plans to enroll 16 patients with accRCC with lenvatinib capsules orally 8 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing \< 60 kg, 12 mg once daily (qd) for subjects weighing ≥ 60 kg, plus cardunilimab, intravenous infusion, 10 mg/kg every three weeks (q3w) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up or death, The investigator or subject decided to terminate the treatment, or the study ended the capsules used in this study were donated by Jiangsu Simcere Zaiming Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and cardunilimab was donated by Akeso.
