IGNITE Firefighters' Health
Investigators hope to learn about potential dietary intervention strategies (specifically a whole-food, plant-based diet) that may help lower cancer markers in firefighters.

The purpose of the San Francisco (SF) Firefighter's Diet Study is to determine if a diet low in processed foods, mostly plant-based, with added fermented foods, can lower the risk of cancer in firefighters. We will assess this by randomly assigning SF firefighters to either a whole-food, plant-based diet or their usual firehouse meals. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks.
