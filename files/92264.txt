It is the percentage of individuals in the group whose disease is likely to remain stable (and not show signs of progression) after a specified duration of time. Progression-free survival rates are an indication of how effective a particular treatment is., 2 years|Relapse Free Survival (RFS) for Complete Responders, This is determined only for patients achieving a complete remission.

Following sample collection, PBMC will be thawed, and flow cytometry will be performed to assess NK cell number (CD56+CD3-), subsets, and phenotype utilizing the Siteman Cancer Center Flow Cytometry / Cell Sorting Core. In addition, NK cell function will be assessed in flow based killing assays using PBMC (containing NK cells) as effectors and NK sensitive cell lines (K562) and/or autologous leukemic blasts as target cells. Thus, analyzing these parameters in patients before, during, and after therapy will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of lenalidomide to modulate NK cells in patients in vivo., Baseline, during therapy, and posttherapy|Gene Expression Profiles of Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood, RNA will be made from total bone marrow cells for labeling and evaluations by RNA profiling. Cellular RNA and corresponding biotinylated cRNA targets will be prepared and hybridized with Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® microarrays within the Multiplexed Gene Analysis SCC Core (Dr. Mark Watson, Director). Microarray data (and eventually corresponding gene sequence data) will be integrated an analyzed with state-of-the-art software packages. The pre- and post-treatment RNA profiling studies will be used as a discovery tool. Patterns of gene expression before and after lenalidomide therapy will be compared within each patient's sample to identify genes with altered expression after lenalidomide therapy. In addition, supervised algorithms will be sued to identify genes that can potentially predict clinical outcome and response to lenalidomide therapy., Pre and post treatment|Plasma Proteins Via Proteomics, Proteomic analysis will be performed within the Siteman Cancer Center proteomics core on pre- and post-treatment plasma samples. This pilot proteomic study will identify candidate proteins of interest with altered expression after treatment with lenalidomide. This approach will provide an unbiased method to assess global changes in serum proteins following lenalidomide therapy., Pre and post treatment
The incidence of AML increases with age, and current treatment options for the older patient population with newly diagnosed AML (AML \>= 60) is limited, all with poor outcomes. AML \>= 60 patients are more likely to have poor-risk cytogenetics abnormalities, and many have a preceding myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Traditional induction chemotherapy approaches in AML with cytarabine and anthracyclines yield remissions in 45-60% of AML \>= 60, however the vast majority of these patients relapse with a median survival of about 9 months. These patients are rarely candidates for potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Many untreated AML \>= 60 patients are not candidates for aggressive therapy, and those who do receive therapy have a significant induction mortality of 10-20%, and significant hematologic toxicity occurs in over 30%, with no change in overall survival compared with supportive care. AML \>= 60 patients with favorable risk cytogenetics have a modest improvement in prognosis, for example with a 5 year overall survival of \~20%, compared with 0% in other cytogenetic categories. Thus, all eligible patients with AML \>= 60 should be recommended a clinical trial, regardless of whether they would be offered generally ineffective traditional induction chemotherapy. More effective and less toxic therapies are needed for the treatment of AML in this older patient population, indeed the preferred first line therapy in the national cancer center network (NCCN) guidelines for AML is a clinical trial.

In trials of lenalidomide in patients with MDS the dose of lenalidomide has been reduced for myelotoxicity and/or thrombocytopenia. However, current paradigms for the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia are based on using high doses of myelosuppressive chemotherapy and supporting the patient through a 4-5 weeks period of neutropenia/thrombocytopenia in an attempt to eliminate the malignant clone. Based on its efficacy in the related myeloid disorder MDS, and the close relationship between MDS and AML in patients \> 60, this trial employs the same paradigm of myelosuppressive therapy using high dose lenalidomide instead of chemotherapy. Importantly, within the MDS trials using low doses of lenalidomide, responses were observed in 3/9 (33%) of patients with excess blasts (RAEB/RAEB-t), which are now classified as evolving into AML or AML. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of lenalidomide occurs in the setting of a large percentage of blasts, such as AML, although the dose and schedule of lenalidomide administration is different. The response of AML \>= 60 patients to the proposed high dose lenalidomide regimen is unknown. Following high dose lenalidomide, in those patients that have a response, we propose using a lower dose maintenance strategy similar to the FDA approved dosing for MDS. The maintenance phase will include standard dose reductions for unacceptable toxicities.
