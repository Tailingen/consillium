DEVICE: Entia Liberty System
Validity of of the Liberty System for haematological parameters of interest: Hb, WBC, PLT, ANC, The accuracy of the Liberty System will be measured by comparing the results of finger-prick blood samples that have been analysed using the Liberty System to the results of venous (blood from the arm, port or PICC line) blood samples that have been analysed by a standard laboratory haematology analyser., Through study completion, up to 8 days per participant.|Reliability of of the Liberty System for haematological parameters of interest: Hb, WBC, PLT, ANC, To measure the precision of the Liberty System by comparing the results of finger-prick blood samples that have been analysed by the Liberty System to each other, and to venous (blood from the arm, port or PICC line) blood samples that have been analysed by the Liberty System., Through study completion, up to 8 days per participant.
