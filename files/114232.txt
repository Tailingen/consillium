Study of High Dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Stereotactic Body Radiation (SBRT) in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cancer
All patients will receive IL-2 (14 planned doses with an additional cycle 14 days after the first). Responding patients with regressing disease are eligible for up to 6 IL-2 cycles. Patients assigned to SBRT arm will receive two doses of SBRT on the Wednesday and Friday before the Monday on which IL-2 starts.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: High Dose IL-2|RADIATION: SBRT
Response Rate, The objective of this study is to compare the response rate among renal cell cancer (RCC) patients of high dose IL-2 to SBRT + IL-2 in patients with metastatic renal cancer, 5 years
Response Rate in Patients Who Receive SBRT following Progression on IL-2, Measure the response of SBRT + IL-2 in patients with RCC who have disease progression after high-dose IL-2, 5 years
All patients will receive IL-2 at 600,000 international units per kilogram (kg) by intraveneous bolus (IVB) every 8 hours for 14 planned doses with an additional cycle 14 days after the first. Responding patients with regressing disease are eligible for up to 6 IL-2 cycles. Patients assigned to SBRT arm will receive two doses of SBRT at 20 Gray (Gy) on the Wednesday and Friday before the Monday on which IL-2 starts.
