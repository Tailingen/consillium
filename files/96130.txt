The Study of 177Lu-TLX591 Plus SOC Versus SOC Alone in Patients With mCRPC (ProstACT Global)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-TLX591 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed following treatment with Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitor Treatment
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 177Lu-TLX591|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Docetaxel
Radiographic Progression-free Survival, time from randomization to disease progression confirmed by central independent radiology review according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria (which incorporates Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST 1.1, for soft tissue lesions), or death (whichever occurs first), 337days
Overall Survival, Defined as the time from randomization, until death from any cause., 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Tumor response in terms of PCWG3 criteria (which incorporates RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions)., 337days|Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), Time to a first SSE, defined as the use of external beam radiation to relieve bone pain, or occurrence of a new symptomatic pathological fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), or occurrence of spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention., 337days
The primary objective of the study is to compare radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in participants who receive 177Lu-TLX591 with SOC to rPFS in participants who receive SOC only.

This study consists of three Parts:

* Part 1: Safety and Dosimetry Lead-in,
* Part 2: Randomized Treatment Expansion, and
* Part 3: Long-term Follow-up

The study will commence with a 30-patient safety and dosimetry lead-in (Part 1) and proceed to a randomization treatment expansion in approximately 400 patients (Part 2).

Patients in Part 2 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-TLX591 + Standard of Care SoC (Group A), or SoC alone (Arm B).

SoC in this trial is either: ARPI (enzalutamide or abiraterone) or docetaxel.

All patients will be followed in long-term follow-up for at least 5 years from the first therapeutic dose, death, or loss to follow up (Part 3).

Only patients that meet PSMA-positivity criteria per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be eligible for this study.
