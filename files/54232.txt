A Study of HX008 Plus LP002 for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Melanoma
The subsequent treatment choices for the patients with advanced melanoma, who have failed the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy of single agent. Evidences showed that PD-1 and PD-L1 signalling pathways are not redundant. Blocking both of them could produce synergistic effect. HX008 and LP002 are humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells respectively. In this study, participants with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who have failed previous anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 will be administrated with HX008 plus LP002. The safety and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated.

DLT (dose limited toxicity) rate, To observe how many participants experience DLT in each LP002 dose group in phase Ia., 6 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., 1 year|Terminal half-life (T1 / 2) of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Area under curve (AUC) of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Apparent volume of distribution of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Systemic clearance of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Cmax of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Cmin of HX008 and LP002, 1 year|Tmax of HX008 and LP002, 1 year
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) refers to the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR and SD through imaging evaluation., 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first evidence of response (PR or CR) to the first evidence of PD or the date of death for any reason., 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first study drug treatment to disease progression (PD) or to death of the subject due to any reason., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the first study drug treatment to death due to any cause., 2 years
