Maintenance Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) Versus Active Surveillance for Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma Patients Who Had Controlled Disease After Standard Anthracycline-based Treatment (MELODY)
Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
Progression-free survival from randomization, The Tumor response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1, see Appendix 2) every 8 weeks, and every 12 weeks 24 weeks after randomization., Up to approximately 2 years
Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, or censoring at the date of last known follow-up alive, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months. PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (including radiograph or clinical progressive disease), or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Time to next treatment (TTNT), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of commencing next treatment line. Patients who started other anti-cancer therapy (including radiotherapy and surgery) will be counted as an event for TTNT. Those who received radiotherapy or surgical resection after randomization but not based on clinical or radiological progression are considered as an event for TTNT., Up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) at maintenance PLD phase per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Up to approximately 2 years|Frequency and severity of AE, AEs will be accessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., Up to approximately 2 years|Safety of interest: cardiac function as assessed by LVEF, Safety of interest: cardiac function as assessed by LVEF(either by cardiac US or MUGA), Up to approximately 2 years|Quality of Life Effects on patient-reported outcomes as assessed by EORTC QLQ C30, The questionnaire comprises 5 functioning scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health status/QoL scale. The functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4-point scale that range from "not at all" to "very much," and the global health status and QoL items are scored on a 7-point scale that ranges from "very poor" to "excellent.". There are 30 questions in total and the scores range from 0 to 100., Up to approximately 2 years
Patients enrolled will be randomized to either experimental arm or control arm. Patients in experimental arm will receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 40mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Maintenance PLD could be administered up to a total of 12 cycles. Patients in control arm will receive active surveillance without treatment (treatment holiday).
