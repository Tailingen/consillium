A Umbrella Study in R/R PTCL Guided by Molecular Subtypes
This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, interventional umbrella study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted therapies guided by molecular subtypes in patients with relasped or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Azacitidine Injection|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Linperlisib|DRUG: Tucidinostat|DRUG: SHR2554|DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib
Overall response rate, Percentage of participants with complete and partial response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6）(each cycle is 28 days)
Complete response rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6）(each cycle is 28 days)|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of favorable response until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., From enrollment to study completion, a maximum of 4 years
