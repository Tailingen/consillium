Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy for Pediatric High Risk Solid Tumors
Part One of this study will determine the feasibility of creating Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) product prospectively from high-risk pediatric solid tumors.

Part Two of this study will determine the safety of TIL therapy with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and post-TIL Interleukin-2 in high-risk pediatric solid tumors
Lymphocytes
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Interleukin-2
Safety of TIL therapy in Pediatric Solid Tumors, The regimen will be declared safe if \<33% of patients (0 or 1 out of maximum 6 patients on the safety phase) experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., 3 years
Feasibility of Generating TIL Product from Pediatric Solid Tumors, The TIL acquisition/production strategies will be considered feasible if 50% or more of all tumors collected on the prospective biobanking study generate a primary TIL culture that is satisfactory for rapid expansion for use on the Phase I trial., 3 years|Toxicity of TIL Therapy in Pediatric Solid Tumors, Toxicities of all grades related to therapy and all Grade 3 and higher toxicities will be collected., 3 years|Disease Response to TIL Therapy, For recurrent patients with measurable disease, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 will be used. For all patients, event-free survival (EFS) will be reported., 3 years
