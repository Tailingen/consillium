Study of Ciforadenant in Combination With Daratumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 1b open-label study of ciforadenant, an oral, small molecule inhibitor targeting adenosine-2A receptors (A2AR), on safety/tolerability and efficacy in combination with daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
