Evaluation of Uterine Fibroids by CEUS and SHAPE Pre and Post UAE
This study goals are to determine the patterns of uterine fibroid vascularity pre and post UAE using CEUS resulting in an alternative to gadolinium-enhanced MRI that is less expensive, has less contra-indications and side effects, is real time, and noninvasive helping physicians to evaluate the result of UAE procedures. Also, this study will evaluate uterine fibroid pressures using SHAPE, comparing the results with normal myometrium tissue in order to determine its characteristics and tissue differences, which we believe will lead to the development of a new biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of uterine fibroids.
Uterine Fibroid
DRUG: Perfluten
Evaluation of Uterine Fibroids by Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) and Subharmonic- Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) Pre and Post-Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE)., This is an open-label, non-randomized, single center, clinical study that will be conducted at TJU. This trial of CEUS and SHAPE imaging examinations will evaluate the microvascularity of uterine fibroids in order to determine vascularity characteristics before,2 weeks, as well as 3 months after UAE to assess the success of the UAE procedure in short term follow-up., 2 years
