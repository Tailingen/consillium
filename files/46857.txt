Assessment of Clinical Practice Administration of Chemotherapy and Anti-angiogenic Agent (Bevacizumab) in Colorectal Cancer
Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively (from 1/7/2009) and prospectively (up to 31/12/2013,) the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of standard chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line treatment of patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer with or without KRAS mutation. All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international guidelines as standard therapy for patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Number of Participants with AE, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which administration was every 2 weeks., Every 2 weeks up to 12 weeks
Number of Participants with Response Rate, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which the disease evaluation was performed every 6 weeks, Disease evaluation at Week 6|Percentage of Patients with Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Patients Overall Survival, 1 year
In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response, frequency of curative liver resection after the administration of treatment, progression free survival and estimation of overall survival
