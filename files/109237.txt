A Study of SNDX-5613 in Combination With Intensive Chemotherapy in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemias
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of SNDX-5613 in combination with intensive chemotherapy in participants with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring alterations in KMT2A, NPM1, or NUP98 genes.
Acute Myeloid Leukemias
DRUG: SNDX-5613|DRUG: Chemotherapy Regimen|DRUG: HiDAC
Dose Escalation: Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities, Up to Day 42|Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Day 1 through 30 days after final dose (up to approximately 3 years)
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of SNDX-5613 and Relevant Metabolites, Predose through Day 15|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to t (AUC0-t) of SNDX-5613 and Relevant Metabolites, Predose through Day 15
The Dose Escalation portion of this study will identify the maximum tolerated dose, or if different, the recommended Phase 2 dose of SNDX-5613 to be used in combination with intensive chemotherapy and in maintenance monotherapy following intensive chemotherapy in participants with newly diagnosed AML harboring alterations in KMT2A, NPM1, or NUP98 genes.

In the Dose Expansion portion of the study, safety and preliminary efficacy of SNDX-5613 may be explored in expansion cohorts at tolerated dose levels.

In both Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion, the treatment period will consist of an induction phase (up to 2 cycles), a consolidation phase (up to 4 cycles and could include hematopoietic stem cell transplant for participants who are transplant eligible and have an available donor), and a maintenance monotherapy phase with SNDX-5613. The cycle duration will be 28 days.
