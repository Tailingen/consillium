Phase II Study of Combined Modality Treatment in Primary Testicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The primary objective assess the clinical activity of combination doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibody anti-CD20 (Rituximab) plus intrathecal prophylactic chemotherapy and loco-regional radiotherapy in primary localised testicular DLCL and to assess the toxicity of this therapeutic strategy
Lymphoma, B Cell
DRUG: rituximab|DRUG: CHOP|DRUG: intrathecal methotrexate|PROCEDURE: radiotherapy
Disease-free survival|Progression-free survival|Event-free survival
Overall survival will be a secondary end-point because post-relapse therapy is not specified in this protocol and is expected to be highly variable
