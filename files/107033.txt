A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Drug Levels and Safety of Luspatercept (ACE-536) for the Treatment of Anemia Due to IPSS-R Very Low, Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Chinese and Japanese Participants With Ring Sideroblasts Who Require Red Blood Cell Transfusions
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) for the treatment of anemia due to Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Chinese and Japanese participants with ring sideroblasts who require Red Blood Cells (RBC) transfusions.
