Right-sided Colon Tumor, Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery, in an ERAS Protocol
Register study. Patients who had been operated for right-sided colon tumor or benign adenoids between year 2011 to 2012. The study compare open surgery with laparoscopic surgery in an ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol.

Hypothesis:

Operation of right-sided colon tumor and large benign adenoids, a better selection of patients for open or laparoscopic surgery can improve short term results.
Colon Tumor
Pathological Anatomic diagnosis (PAD) on a tumor biopsy, After PAD result, malign or benign tumor, type of malign tumor,tumor growth, stage, lymphatic recharge.

Right selection of patients to laparoscopic versus open surgery in relation to PAD result?, day of surgery
Length of hospital stay, days, Compare laparoscopic versus open surgery, 30 days after surgery|C - reactive protein, Inflammation answer laparoscopic versus open surgery, 1-7 days after surgery
Immobilizing patient after surgery, After laparoscopic versus open surgery, 4 -10 hours after surgery|Leakage of anastomosis, Compare laparoscopic versus open surgery, 0 - 30 days after surgery
