Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Assessment, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease as assessed by the independent radiologist or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS (in months) was calculated as (date of event or censoring-randomization+1)/30.4375. Progressive disease is defined per RECIST version 1.1, as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From time of Study Start up to 33 months

The scale includes items capturing mood, (loss of pleasure, sadness, and irritability), suicidal ideation, and cognitive signs (punitive thoughts, self-criticism, self-dislike pessimism, poor concentration) as well as somatic signs (appetite, sleep, fatigue, libido). Scores were obtained by adding up the total points from the series of answers. The total score ranged from 0 to 63, with higher total scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are as follows: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression., Baseline, Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C8D1, C10D1, C12D1, C14D1, C16D1, C18D1, C20D1, C22D1, C24D1, C26D1, C28D1, C30D1, C32D1, C34D1, C36D1, C38D1 and End of Treatment|Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior Across Time, Suicidal ideation and behaviors were assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS is a unique, simple and short method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events and provides a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide., Baseline, Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C8D1, C10D1, C12D1, C14D1, C16D1, C18D1, C20D1, C22D1, C24D1, C26D1, C28D1, C30D1, C32D1, C34D1, C36D1, C38D1 and End of Treatment|Change From Baseline in Global Quality of Life (QOL), Functional Scales and Symptoms Scales as Assessed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) During Overall Treatment, The EORTC QLQ C30 consists of 30 questions and includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); a global health status/global quality of life scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting); and 6 single items that assess additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and financial impact. All scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores on the functional scales represent higher levels of functioning. Higher scores on the global health status/quality of life scale represent higher health status/quality of life. Higher scores on symptom scales/items represent a greater presence of symptoms., From Baseline up to Cycle 38 Day 1|Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Symptoms as Assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ- LC13) During Overall Treatment, The EORTC QLQ LC13 consists of 13 questions and includes 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, cough, haemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. The scale scores rang from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher ("worse") level of symptoms., From Baseline up to Cycle 38 Day 1|Change From Baseline in Health Status as Assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Across Time, The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status. There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L: a descriptive system in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a VAS. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) and higher scores indicate better health state., Baseline, Day 1 of all cycles from Cycle 2 to Cycle 38, and End of Treatment|Change From Baseline in Health Status as Assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Index Across Time, The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status. There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L: a descriptive system in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a VAS in which participants rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the 5 dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health)., Baseline, Day 1 of all cycles from Cycle 2 to Cycle 38, and End of Treatment|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Participant Reported Pain in Chest, Dyspnea, or Cough From QLQ-LC13, The EORTC QLQ LC13 consists of 13 questions and includes 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, cough, haemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. The scale scores rang from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher ("worse") level of symptoms. TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough was defined as the time from randomization to the first time the participant's score showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the 3 symptoms. TTD in months was calculated as (date of deterioration or censoring - randomization date +1)/30.4375., From Baseline up to 33 months|Number of Participant With ALK Domain Mutation in Plasma Circulating Nucleic Acid (CNA) Analysis at Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1, The analysis of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) domain mutation in plasma CNA was performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the number of participants with one or more ALK mutations at Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1 is presented here., at Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1|Number of Participant With ALK Fusion Variant in Plasma Circulating Nucleic Acid (CNA) Analysis at Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1, The analysis of ALK fusion variant in plasma CNA was performed by NGS and the number of participants with fusion variants at Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 7 Day 1 is presented here.
