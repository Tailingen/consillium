Real-life Second-line Epirubicin-Paclitaxel Regimen as Treatment of Relapsed Small-Cell Lung Cancer : EpiTax Study.
Initial chemosensitivity is known concerning SCLC but relapse is almost systematic, especially at a metastatic stage. Brain metastasis are identified around 40 to 50% during the evolution of the disease. Concerning the efficacy of epirubicin combined with paclitaxel from the second-line treatment, data is lacking more particularly about specific response on brain metastasis.

In this retrospective multicentric observational study in real life conditions, we try to evaluate systemic and specific cerebral efficacy and safety of a regimen combining epirubicin and paclitaxel in patients treated between 2010 and 2020 for a small cell lung carcinoma from the second-line treatment.
