Efficacy of Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Ablation of Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a dedicated Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) unit in ablating breast cancer by comparing MR imaging and pathologic specimen after resection.

Single-center, single-arm, non-randomized trial
Breast Cancer, Invasive Ductal
DEVICE: Philips SonalleveÂ® MR-HIFU Breast Therapy System
Accuracy of MRI as Method for Assessment of Quantitative Treatment Success (Correlation With Results of the Histopathological Analysis Performed as Reference Method), Quantitative assessment: Correlation between MRI and histopathology results (volume of necrosis), Day 14
Assessment of Treatment Efficacy, Effective treatment is defined as complete necrosis (100%) of targeted tumor including safety margin (\>1mm) (histopathological analysis).

Safety margin: measurement of smallest margin on histology and measurement of smallest margin on MRI. Parameter: Percentage of necrosis including safety margin, Day 14
Incidence of Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability of the Treatment], Adverse events, general:

Patients will be asked to report information about adverse events at each time point of the study. Information about time of onset, duration, resolution, action to be taken assessment of intensity, relationship with study treatment will be collected.

Assessment of additional predefined safety parameters:

- Skin changes, assessment in physical examination: presence/absence of redness, burn

* Palpation breast: lump (mobility of lump related to skin: yes/no)
* Pain, reported by patient, Day 0, 3, 8
The dedicated MR-HIFU unit has been shown to be safe and feasible to ablate breast tissue.

The planned study should address the possibility to completely ablate breast cancer with the dedicated breast MR-HIFU unit. The result of the MR-HIFU therapy should be monitored by imaging (contrast enhanced MRI) as well as with histopathological correlation after surgery.

The patient population would consist of female patients with proven breast cancer scheduled for surgical lumpectomy or mastectomy.

The idea is to evaluate a minimal invasive method to treat breast cancer as a potential alternative to surgical resection in the future
