Study of Tislelizumab in Participants With Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) in participants receiving tislelizumab plus chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment.
Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab
pCR Rate, The pCR will be defined as the proportion of participants with absence of residual tumor in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant treatment., approximately 5 years
R0 Resection Rate, This will be defined as the proportion of participants with R0 resection., approximately 5 years|1-year/3-year Disease-free Survival (DFS) Rate, The DFS will be defined as the proportion of participants free from disease events at 1st year and 3rd year after the first date of no disease. The DFS will be defined as the time from the first date of no disease (R0 resection as surgery outcome) to local or distant recurrence or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The DFS rate will be analyzed only for participants who undergo R0 resection., approximately 5 years|1-year/3-year Event-free Survival (EFS) Rate, The EFS will be defined as the proportion of participants free from EFS events at 1st year and 3rd year after the first dose. The EFS will be defined as the time from the time of first dose until any of the following events, whichever occurs first: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause., approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR will be defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response or partial response before surgery as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 in all participants with measurable disease at baseline., approximately 5 years|Number Of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, approximately 5 years
