Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Expression and Mutations Within Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Patients Treated for High Risk Prostate Cancer With Proton Therapy (PRX32)
Retrospective Review Study for Prognostic Transcriptional Output Related to Androgen Receptor Expression in Patients Treated for High Risk Prostate Cancer with Proton Therapy
Prostate Cancer
Immunohistochemistry of tumor cell proteins will be performed on prostate biopsies to detect for androgen receptors and other protein products related to oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes thought to play a role in radiation or ADT., 2 years follow up
DNA sequencing will be performed on prostate tumor DNA to determine the mutational status of several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes including genes coding androgen receptors., 2 years follow up|RNA sequencing will be performed on several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes including genes coding androgen receptors to detect RNA expression including genes related to the androgen receptor., 2 years follow up
