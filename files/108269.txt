Trial With Cetuximab in Maintenance Therapy After Platinum Based Chemotherapy in First Line Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This open-label, randomized, multinational, non-comparative, phase IIIb trial with 2 parallel groups will screen about 1400 subjects with stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC. It is expected that of approximately 1200 (85 percent) subjects who will be included, about 1000 will be Caucasian; about 120 Asian, and the remainder (about 80) will be of other ethnic origin (that is neither Caucasian nor Asian). Approximately 480 (40 percent) subjects are expected to be free of progression at the end of combination treatment with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy. These subjects will be eligible for randomization to intravenous cetuximab maintenance therapy with either 500 milligram per square meter (mg/m\^2) every 2 weeks or 250 mg/m\^2 weekly (q1w); about 240 subjects are expected per group.

The trial will be performed in a community practice setting, with approximately 230 centers participating in the trial worldwide (planned countries are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and Venezuela). With noncompetitive enrollment, approximately 4 to 8 subjects are expected to be enrolled at each center. Enrollment in the individual centers is generally limited to a maximum of 8 subjects. If any of these subjects does not receive trial treatment for any reason or discontinue all trial treatment at the first visit, additional subjects may be enrolled until 8 subjects were treated. The primary endpoint of the trial will be overall survival time from inclusion into the trial to death. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be time to treatment failure, tumor response, and disease control rate. Other endpoints will include safety and toxicity, compliance with maintenance therapy, subject satisfaction and translational research (TR) (for subjects with tumor samples available).

Overall Survival (OS) Time, The OS time is defined as the time from trial inclusion to death. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whichever is earlier., Time from trial inclusion to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant included, that is, Jan 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)|Percentage of Participants With 1-year Overall Survival, The OS time is defined as the time from trial inclusion to death. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whichever is earlier. Percentage of participants who were still alive until one year after the last participant was included (March 2010)., Time from trial inclusion to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant included, that is, Jan 2009 until one year after the last participant was included (March 2010)
Overall Survival (OS) Time (From Randomization to Cetuximab Maintenance Regimen Until Death), The OS time is defined as the time from randomization in cetuximab maintenance regimen to death. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whichever is earlier., Time from randomization in cetuximab maintenance regimen to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant randomized, that is, May 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from trial inclusion to date of either first occurrence of progression, discontinuation of treatment due to progression or adverse event, withdrawal of consent or lost to follow up, start of further anticancer therapy, or death, whichever is earlier. Participants without events are censored either at the time of their last drug intake, or on the day of inclusion (Day 1) if they received no study drug., Time from trial inclusion to treatment failure or last drug intake, reported between day of first participant included, that is, Jan 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)|Time to Treatment Failure (From Randomization to Cetuximab Maintenance Regimen Until Death), Time from randomization in cetuximab maintenance regimen to date of either first occurrence of progression, discontinuation of treatment due to progression or adverse event, withdrawal of consent or lost to follow up, start of further anticancer therapy, or death, whichever is earlier. Participants without events are censored either at the time of their last drug intake, or on the day of randomization (Day 1 of maintenance therapy) if they received no study drug., Time from randomization in cetuximab maintenance regimen to treatment failure or last drug intake, reported between day of first participant randomized, that is, May 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)|Percentage of Participants With Best Unconfirmed Tumor Response in the Combination Therapy Phase, The response rate is defined as the percentage of participants having achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the unconfirmed best overall response (BOR) according to centrally reviewed investigator assessments based on an independent review charter (IRC). As per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Evaluations were performed every 2 cycles during combination therapy period until progression and at the end of combination therapy period, reported between day of first participant included, that is, Jan 2009, until cut-off date, (17 Dec 2011)|Percentage of Participant With Best Unconfirmed Tumor Response for the Whole Study Period, The response rate is defined as the percentage of participants having achieved CR and PR as the BOR according to IRC assessment in combination therapy phase and radiological assessments (based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors \[RECIST\] Version 1.0) in the maintenance therapy phase. As per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by MRI: CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Evaluations were performed every 2 cycles during combination therapy and 6-weekly during maintenance therapy period until progression and at end of both periods, reported between day of first participant included, Jan 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control in the Combination Therapy Phase, The disease control rate is defined as the percentage of participants having achieved complete response or partial response or stable disease as the unconfirmed BOR according to IRC assessment., Evaluations were performed every 2 cycles during combination therapy period until progression and at the end of combination therapy period, reported between day of first participant included, that is, Jan 2009, until cut-off date, (17 Dec 2011)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control for the Whole Study Period, The disease control rate is defined as the percentage of participants having achieved complete response or partial response or stable disease as the unconfirmed best overall response according to IRC assessment in combination therapy phase and radiological assessments (based on RECIST Version 1.0 criteria) in the maintenance therapy phase., Evaluations were performed every 2 cycles during combination therapy and 6-weekly during maintenance therapy period until progression and at end of both periods, reported between day of first participant included, Jan 2009 until cut-off date (17 Dec 2011)
