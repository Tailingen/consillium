Effect of Chemotherapy and Radiation Prior to Surgery for Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Cisplatin when given with radiation therapy prior to surgery is effective in improving response to treatment in breast cancer patients. Tumor, blood and bone marrow samples will be collected in this study and will also help researchers determine if cisplatin is able to change tumor DNA so it cannot multiply itself and create more tumor cells, and cause the tumor cells to die.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|PROCEDURE: Mastectomy
Overall Response, * Complete response: disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level
* Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD
* Stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started,
* Progressive disease: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, appearance of one more new lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., At the time of surgery (week 13)
Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression: time from registration until objective tumor progression; does not include deaths, Until study was terminated (23.5 months)|Overall Survival Rate (OS), OS = Time from registration until death from any cause, Until study was terminated (23.5 months)|Number of Participants With Surgical Complications, 30 days post surgery (week 17-18)|Number of Participants With Medical Toxicities, The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting. All detailed information regarding serious and other adverse events are listed in the Adverse Event module of these results., 30 days post surgery (week 17-18)|Effect of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy in Disseminated Cancer Cells in the Bone Marrow and Correlation to Tumor Response, 5 years|Develop Animal Models of Triple Negative Breast Cancers, 5 years|Provide Samples for the Development of the FNA Assay, At time of IVAD placement and at time of surgery
