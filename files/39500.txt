A Study of Androgen Annihilation in High-Risk Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, three-arm, phase 3 study in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and PSA doubling time â‰¤ 9 months at the time of study entry.

DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: LHRH Analogue|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone
PSA progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population, To compare PSA progression-free survival in each of the experimental arms (LHRH analogue + apalutamide; LHRH analogue + apalutamide +abiraterone acetate) versus the control arm (LHRH analogue) among all randomized patients (intent-to-treat population)., 36 months
PSA progression-free survival in the testosterone-evaluable population, Compare PSA progression-free survival in testosterone-evaluable population in each experimental arm versus the control arm. Testosterone-evaluable population includes all patients who achieve serum testosterone recovery to \> 50 ng/dL with subsequent PSA measurements sufficient for evaluation, 36 months|PSA progression-free survival in both the intent-to-treat and testosterone-evaluable populations, To compare the 36-month PSA progression-free survival rate in each experimental arm versus the control arm in both the intent-to-treat and testosterone-evaluable populations., 36 months|Serum testosterone, To compare the time to recovery of serum testosterone to greater than 50 ng/dL in each experimental arm versus the control arm., 12 months|Time to castration resistance, To compare the time to castration resistance in each experimental arm versus the control arm., 6 years|Metastasis-Free Survival, To compare metastasis-free survival in each experimental arm versus the control arm., 6 years|Overall Survival, To compare overall survival in each experimental arm versus the control arm., 6 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To characterize the safety profile in each treatment arm, 6 years|Quality of life Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), 72 months|Quality of life Hot Flash Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), Hot Flash Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), 72 months|Quality of life EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-5L, 72 months|Quality of life PROMIS Fatigue, PROMIS Fatigue, 72 months|Quality-adjusted survival, To compare the quality-adjusted survival (overall survival multiplied by utility score) of patients in each experimental arm versus the control arm., 72 months
Patients will be stratified by PSA doubling time (\< 3 months vs. 3-9 months) and randomized in 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment arms: (1) Control arm consisting of LHRH analogue monotherapy (degarelix or leuprolide), (2) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide in combination with LHRH analogue, and (3) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide, abiraterone acetate + prednisone, and LHRH analogue. Patients will be treated for a maximum duration of 52 weeks and then enter follow up phase until the time of PSA progression, development of metastasis, or patient withdrawal from study, whichever occurs first. Patients with PSA progression will be followed long term until the development of castration resistance, first metastasis, and death.

The primary endpoint of the study is PSA progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat patient population. PSA progression during the 52-week treatment period is defined as a rising PSA confirmed on repeat measurement, and at least 25% and 2 ng/mL above nadir or baseline, whichever is lower. PSA progression during follow up defined as PSA \> 0.2 ng/mL confirmed by repeat measurement at least 2 weeks later. Secondary study endpoints include PSA progression-free survival in testosterone-evaluable population, 36-month PSA progression-free survival rate in both intent-to-treat and testosterone-evaluable populations, time to testosterone recovery, time to castration resistance, metastasis-free survival, quality of life, and safety. Each experimental arm will be compared against the control arm in pair-wise fashion. The study is not powered to detect differences in primary or secondary endpoints between the two experimental arms.
