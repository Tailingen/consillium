A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Targeted Therapies as Treatments for Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a phase 2/3, global, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or in combination in participants with unresectable, advanced or metastatic NSCLC determined to harbor oncogenic somatic mutations or positive by tumor mutational burden (TMB) assay as identified by a blood-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay.
