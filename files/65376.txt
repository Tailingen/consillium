Serial FES PET/CT to Measure Hormone Expression in Patients Undergoing Endocrine Targeted Therapy
This clinical trial studies use of F-18 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol (\[F-18\] FES) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in measuring tumor hormone receptor expression in patients undergoing endocrine-targeted therapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer or breast cancer that has come back or spread to other places in the body. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before, during, and after hormone therapy may help measure a patient's response to treatment.

Change in F-18 16 Alpha-fluoroestradiol (FES) Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) - Avg SULmax, FES uptake will be quantified using lean body mass adjusted SUV (SUL). Percentage change in FES average SULmax between baseline and a second FES scan will be calculated for up to 3 lesions per patient., From time of first F-18 FES-PET/CT scan to time of second F-18 FES-PET/CT scan (approximately 1-12 weeks)|F-18 16 Alpha-fluoroestradiol (FES) Uptake, Quantitative measures of FES uptake for each disease site will be determined by drawing regions-of-interest on lesions to determine maximal FES uptake (SUVmax) per lesion. Up to 10 sites seen on the static torso survey will be quantified., From time of first F-18 FES-PET/CT scan to time of second F-18 FES-PET/CT scan (approximately 1-12 weeks)|Proportion of Patients With a Threshold of Percentage Change, or That Surpass a Targeted Follow-up F-18 16 Alpha-fluoroestradiol (FES) Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), The number of patients showing a 20% increase in FES uptake (SULmean or SUVmax) compared to baseline from the first to second scan using a 90% Wilson score binomial confidence interval., From time of first F-18 FES-PET/CT scan to time of second F-18 FES-PET/CT scan (approximately 1-12 weeks)
Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression will be measured as the time from the start of endocrine therapy to the time the patient is first recorded as having disease progression., From start of therapy up to 20 years
OUTLINE:

Patients undergo F-18 FES PET/CT scan at baseline. Patients also undergo F-18 FES PET/CT and FDG PET/CT between 1-12 weeks after starting therapy, and then 1-12 weeks after the second FES PET/CT scan. Repeat FDG PET may be omitted in patients on selective estrogen receptor degrader.

After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 20 years.
