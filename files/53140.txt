Does Prehabilitation Improve Exercise Performance and Insulin Resistance After Surgery for Oesophago-gastric Cancer?
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multimodal pre-operative prehabilitation programme during neo-adjuvant therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise performance and insulin resistance prior to resection for oesophago-gastric cancer.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Prehabilitation|BEHAVIORAL: Standard care
Change in cardiopulmonary exercise performance, Change in cardiopulmonary exercise performance between week 0 and week 17
Change in insulin resistance, Change in insulin resistance between week 0 and week 17|Change in quality of life, Change in quality of life (as assessed by the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire) between week 0 and 6 months|Change in grip-strength, Change in grip-strength between 0 weeks and 6 months
The trial objectives are as follows: Primary: To evaluate the effect of a prehabilitation programme during neo-adjuvant therapy on CPX performance prior to resection for oesophago-gastric cancer. Secondary: To investigate the impact of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on insulin resistance; to determine whether a prehabilitation exercise programme is feasible during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy; to determine whether rehabilitation has a positive impact on quality of life outcomes; to investigate the impact of prehabilitation on clinical outcomes; to assess the effect of prehabilitation on nutritional status; to determine whether prehabilitation affects the stress response to surgery.

This study is a randomised controlled trial where patients will be stratified into 'fit' and 'unfit' groups based upon their anaerobic threshold and then randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive multimodal prehabilitation or standard care prior to OG cancer surgery, during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
