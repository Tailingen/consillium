Pomalidomide With Melphalan and Dexamethasone for Untreated Systemic AL Amyloidosis
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide that can be given in combination with melphalan and dexamethasone that can be given to patients with AL amyloidosis. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

Pomalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease the growth of cancer cells.

Melphalan is designed to damage the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.

Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body. Dexamethasone is often given to Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients in combination with other chemotherapy to treat cancer.

Planned Phase I/II Study terminated early during Phase I portion without continuation to Phase II.
Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Dexamethasone|BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Pomalidomide with Melphalan and Dexamethasone (PMD)., Maximum tolerated dose defined as highest dose level at which less than 33% of patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Dose-limiting toxicities defined as (grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days despite G-CSF administration, any other grade 4 hematologic toxicity, any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, or a new cycle delay beyond a maximum of 4 weeks) in less than 33% of patients during the first cycle of therapy., 28 days
Complete Response (CR) Rate, CR Rate is number of participants with CR out of total study participants. Complete response defined using treatment response in primary systemic amyloidosis from the 10th International Symposium on Amyloid and Amyloidosis where CR: Serum and urine negative for a monoclonal protein by immunofixation; free light chain ratio normal; marrow \<5% plasma cells., Response evaluated after a minimum of 2 cycles and a maximum of 6 cycles of 28-day treatment
Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of pomalidomide, based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of pomalidomide will be tested for the Phase I portion of this study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled at each dose level in the Phase I portion, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase II. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide is found.

If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive pomalidomide at the highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.

All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and melphalan. If intolerable side effects are seen at the lowest dose level, then the melphalan dose will be lowered.

After 2 cycles of therapy, you may be referred to a transplant specialist, if you are eligible for a stem cell transplant.

Study Drug Administration:

Each cycle is 28 days.

Treatment Phase:

You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle. You should take each dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow the pomalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Pomalidomide should be taken without food (at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (DO NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You should tell the study doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide. If you take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused pomalidomide and empty bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan or dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to review.

On Days 1-4 of each cycle, you will take melphalan pills by mouth one time each day. You should take melphalan in the morning at least 2 hours before or after a meal.

You will take dexamethasone pills on Days 1-4 of each cycle.

You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will receive a blood thinner to prevent blood clots. The study doctor will decide what type of blood thinner you will receive.

Maintenance Phase:

You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle during the maintenance phase. You should take each dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow the pomalidomide capsules whole with water, at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (DO NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You should tell the study doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide. If you take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused pomalidomide and empty bottles to the clinic at each study visit.

You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan, or dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to review.
