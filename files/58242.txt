Focal Radiation With Pulsed Systemic Therapy of Abiraterone, Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), Lynparza Towards Castration Sensitive Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (FAALCON)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of radiation therapy with hormone therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy as an investigational study treatment for prostate cancer. This is a phase 2 study to deliver focal radiation with pulsed systemic therapy of Abiraterone, ADT and Lynparza (olaparib) in men with castration sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer.

DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Prednisone|RADIATION: External Beam Radiotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)|DRUG: Olaparib
Percentage of patients without treatment failure at 24 months, Treatment failure is defined as one of the following:

* New or progressive metastases on Computed Tomogrophy (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
* New lesion(s) on bone scan without alternate explanations (e.g. trauma, arthritis) in distribution consistent with prostate cancer metastases, by provider assessment
* Clinical progression by provider assessment
* Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) doubling time under 6 months with an absolute final PSA over 1.5 ng/mL, 24 months after enrollment
Percentage of patients with undetectable PSA, testosterone >150 ng/dL and without treatment failure., The number of patients who achieve an undetectable PSA (PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL) AND have a testosterone \>150 ng/dL will be divided by the number of patients treated in the study with a 95% confidence interval (CI). This will be analyzed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months., Up to 36 months after enrollment|Rate of obtaining an optimal PSA (PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL), The number of patients who achieve an undetectable PSA (PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL) will be divided by the number of patients treated in the study with a 95% CI. This will be analyzed at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months., Up to 36 months months after enrollment|Time to Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) restart, Time to ADT restart is defined as time from day 0 to restarting of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) agonist or antagonist. The time to ADT restart may be determined by Kaplan-Meier methods., Up to 36 months months after enrollment|Time to subsequent therapy (e.g. ADT, radiation), Time to subsequent therapy (e.g. ADT or radiation) will be measured from day 0 to start of therapy and determined by Kaplan-Meier methods., Up to 36 months after enrollment|Frequency of adverse events grade 3 or higher and attributable to study treatment, Adverse events \>= grade 3 and attributable to study treatment (possibly, probably, likely) will be reported by body system, severity and grade, and summarized by different levels of treatment exposure, per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5., Up to 36 months after enrollment
