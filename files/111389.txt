Active Surveillance for Low Risk Prostate Cancer
An active surveillance protocol for patients diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer will be held. We plan to use PSA (prostate-specific antigen) testing, DRE (digital rectal examination), TRUS (transrectal ultrasound), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and follow-up biopsies to monitor patients and detect cancer progression in time.
