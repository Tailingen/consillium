Dose Escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AVE8062 Combined With Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity and the maximum administered dose of ombrabulin in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin administered every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the overall safety profile of the combination therapy
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ombrabulin, its active metabolite RPR 258063, docetaxel and cisplatin in combination.
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy
Neoplasms, Malignant
DRUG: OMBRABULIN (AVE8062)|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: docetaxel
Dose limiting toxicity, 3 weeks (cycle 1)
Global safety profile based on treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities, on-treatment period + 30 days|Pharmacokinetic profiles of all study drugs and AVE8062 active metabolite based on PK parameters (Cmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, Vss)., Cycle 1: Day 1 and 3; up to Cycle 4: Day 1|Objective tumor response as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), on-treatment period + 30 days
The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 4-week screening phase, 21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit and a follow-up period 30 days after the last infusion of ombrabulin. The patient will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal of further treatment.
