A First-in-Human, Phase 1 Study of SY-4798 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a Phase 1, open-label and multicenter study of SY-4798, a highly specific and potent inhibitor of FGFR4, in patients with advanced solid tumor. This study has two phases: dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SY-4798
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D(s)) in Cycle 1., Escalation Cycle 1 (28 days)|Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Characterization of the safety and tolerability as determined by changes in laboratory values and electrocardiograms., Up to 24 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of SY-4798 in patients with FGF19+ advanced tumor., Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of SY-4798 in patients with FGF19+ advanced tumor., Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (Cmax) for SY-4798, Defined as maximum observed plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (Tmax) for SY-4798, Defined as time to maximum plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (AUC0-t) for SY-4798, Defined as area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last quantifiable measurable plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (tÂ½) for SY-4798, Defined as the apparent plasma terminal phase disposition half-life, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (Cl/F) for SY-4798, Defined as oral dose clearance, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment (each cycle is 28 days)
Dose-escalation phase is designed to determine the DLTs (Dose-limiting toxicity) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of SY-4798. Other dose regimens may be explored based on the analysis of emerging PK and safety data. At this study phase, SY-4798 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles to adult patients with advanced solid tumor.

Dose-expansion phase is designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity (ORR and DOR) of SY-4798 in patients with FGF19+ advanced tumor.
