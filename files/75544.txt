APG-1252 in Patients With SCLC or Advanced Solid Tumors
APG-1252 is a highly potent Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor, a promising drug candidate which shown high binding affinities to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. The preclinical studies have shown that APG-1252 alone achieves complete and persistent tumor regression in multiple tumor xenograft models with a twice weekly or weekly dose-schedule, including SCLC, colon, breast and ALL cancer xenografts; achieves strong synergy with the chemotherapeutic agents, indicating that APG-1252 may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent and in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-1252 is intended for the treatment of patients with SCLC or other solid tumors. Upon completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), several phase Ib/II studies will be implemented accordingly.
Small Cell Lung Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
DRUG: APG-1252
Dose limit toxicity (DLT) determination, Number of participants with APG-1252 treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, 18-24 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination, If â‰¥ 2/6 patients develop a DLT at any dose level, then this dose will be declared as the MTD., 18-24 months
Pharmacokinetic evaluation, Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed on all participants with APG-1252 treatments., 18-24 months|Preliminary efficacy assessment, Patients will be evaluated for response every 2 cycles (i.e., 8 weeks), according to the new response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: revised RECIST Guideline, Version 1.1, 18-24 months
Pharmacokinetic evaluation, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be assessed on all participants with APG-1252 treatments, 18-24 months|Pharmacodynamic evaluation, Apoptosis will be assessed on the patients treated with APG-1252, 18-24 months
