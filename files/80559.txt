A Study of S-1 in Combination With Gemcitabine as First-Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
Primary Objective:

To evaluate disease control rate (DCR) of S-1 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate overall response rate (ORR)
* To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS)
* To evaluate overall survival (OS)
* To assess the safety profile
