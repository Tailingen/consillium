Rural Women Connecting for Better Health
Women who are obese at breast cancer diagnosis have a 1.5 to 2.5 increased risk of recurrence and death compared to their normal weight counterparts. Moreover, weight gain and decreased physical activity are common after diagnosis and also increase the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence and death. Rural women suffer from health disparities in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Women of the most rural counties also have the highest prevalence of obesity compared to urban women. To address these disparities, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a clinically effective and cost efficient strategy for delivering a weight control intervention to rural breast cancer survivors. Group phone-based treatment via conference call is a novel treatment delivery approach that the investigators have shown to be effective for initial weight loss among rural breast cancer survivors and more effective than the standard individual phone-based approach among rural women. This innovative method of providing group treatment addresses access barriers in rural areas and may be especially ideal for rural breast cancer survivors because it provides social support in conjunction with a level of anonymity. However, the impact of group phone counseling during extended care for weight loss maintenance beyond 6 months remains unknown. Weight loss maintenance is the more challenging phase of treatment when weight regain is common, and this regain presents a potential risk for breast cancer recurrence. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of group phone-based treatment for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors, compared to an established mail-based education comparison condition, subsequent to a 6 month group phone-based weight loss phase for both conditions. In addition to the intervention impact on weight loss maintenance, the study will provide estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness per kg loss between the two conditions and the impact on secondary outcomes including quality of life, breast cancer risk biomarkers, dietary intake, and physical activity.

Weight loss maintenance, Examine the impact of group phone-based treatment on weight loss maintenance from 6 to 18 months, compared to a mail-based education COMPARISON condition, following a 6-month weight loss phase among obese rural breast cancer survivors., 6 - 18 months
Quality of life, Compare the effects of treatment conditions on aspects of quality of life important for breast cancer survivorship, including general physical, social, and emotional well-being, fatigue, arthralgia, lymphedema symptoms, menopausal symptoms, and depressive symptoms., Baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months|Breast cancer risk biomarkers, Examine the association of weight change with changes in selected breast cancer risk biomarkers, including bioavailable estradiol, testosterone, and fasting insulin. Examine whether modulation of biomarkers is sustained during weight loss maintenance., Baseline and 6 and 18 months|Cost effectiveness, Compare the incremental cost-effectiveness of weight loss maintenance (kg below baseline) between group and control conditions. Costs include fixed and variable provider costs (facility, time, phone charges, supplies) and fixed and variable participant costs (time, out-of-pocket expenses)., 18 months
