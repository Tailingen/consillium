The investigational medicinal product INT-1B3 is a lipid nanoparticle formulated microRNA (miR-193a-3p) mimic destined for therapeutic intervention in oncology. Preclinical work showed that INT-1B3 has a multi-target mechanism of action with an anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, anti-migration, cell cycle disruption, induction of apoptosis effect and modulation on the tumor microenvironment leading to significant induction of T cell-mediated immune response.

The first part of the study (Phase I) is a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose, as well as the safety profile of INT-1B3 in patients with advanced malignancies.The subsequent expansion phase of the study (Phase Ib) will further explore safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic responses, and antitumor activity of INT-1B3 in patients with selected cancer types treated at the recommended phase 2 dose.
