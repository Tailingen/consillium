The Effects of Optimizing Post-operative Pain Management With Multi Modal Analgesia on Immune Suppression and Oncologic Outcome in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery
Traditionally, pain control methods based on narcotic analgesics have been used to control severe pain after surgery, but this has resulted in side effects such as vomiting, constipation, dizziness, mental confusion due to drugs, and respiratory depression. This slowed the recovery of the patient after surgery and increased the duration of hospitalization, which had a negative impact on the patient 's prognosis. In addition, research has been conducted on the use of various painkillers in a variety of ways over the past decade to reduce the dose of narcotic analgesics and to increase the effectiveness of pain control, since studies of anesthetics and narcotic analgesics have shown immunosuppressive effects.

This study investigate the effect of multimodal analgesics for postoperative pain control on immune function amd prognosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.
