Imaging Response to Immunotherapy and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Liver Metastases
Patients will be imaged with MRE at the time of the RT planning MRI, prior to the induction of RT and immunotherapy. Research imaging will be in addition to standard imaging studies performed at time points consistent with the standard of care (at the time of the RT planning MRI and the first clinical follow-up). An additional MRE exam will be performed at the end of treatment outside the standard of care imaging.
