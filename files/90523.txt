68Ga-N188 PET/CT Imaging in Malignancy
The Nectin-4 protein belongs to the cell adhesion factors family and has a tissue-specific expression spectrum in normal human tissues. However, Nectin-4 is overexpressed in various malignancies, especially those of epithelial origins, such as uroepithelial carcinoma, making Nectin-4 a highly specific and significant imaging target for malignancies.

\[68Ga\]N188, a novel molecular probe of PET imaging agent that targets Nectin-4, can be used in the diagnosis and research of a wide variety of Nectin-4 high-expression malignancies, including bladder cancer.
