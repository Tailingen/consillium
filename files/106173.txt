Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Negative Node-Negative Breast Cancer
This is an exploratory interventional study that initiates standard-of-care anti-estrogen treatment preoperatively for four weeks.

Change in Baseline of Cancer Cell Protein Levels of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER) Family Members (HER1-4) Following Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy., ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC) will be used. The IHC test gives a score of 0 to 3+ that measures the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of cells in a breast cancer tissue sample. If the score is 0 to 1+ (up to 25% of cells stained), it's called "HER2 negative." If the score is 2+ (approximately 50% of cells stained), it's called "borderline." A score of 3+ (approximately 75% or more of cells stained) is called "HER2 positive." Upregulation means increased staining from a prior observation; Downregulation means decreased staining from a prior observation; and No Change means similar staining from a prior observation., At four weeks.
Number of Subjects Who Achieve Complete Radiographic Response., This will be assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria:

* Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all known disease, based on a comparison between the measurements at baseline and after four weeks of treatment with neoadjuvant therapy.
* Partial Response (PR): A 50% or greater decrease in the product of the bi-dimensional measurements of the lesion (total tumor size), based on a comparison between the measurements at baseline and after four weeks of treatment with neoadjuvant therapy.
* No Change (NC): A 50% decrease in total tumor size cannot be established nor has a 25% increase in the size of the lesion been demonstrated.
* Progressive Disease (PD): A 25% or greater increase in the total tumor size of the measurable lesions (calculated on the smallest diameter recorded over time)., At four weeks.|Number of Subjects Who Achieve a Partial Radiographic Response., This will be assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria:

STUDY RATIONALE: Patients with hormone receptor (HR)+, HER2- node-negative breast cancers generally undergo surgical resection upfront, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, if needed, in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered in the postoperative setting, the ability to assess the tumor response to this treatment modality is lost and very difficult to assess. This study offers the unique opportunity to assess the responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy while the tumors are still in vivo by treating patients with endocrine therapy before surgery and assessing molecular changes with treatment. By comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of molecular markers in individual tumors, the team expects to identify predictors of responsiveness to existing agents and identify new candidate therapeutic targets.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the frequency of increased HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases protein expression in tumors, following treatment with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and their correlation with Ki-67 tumor responses. The team will measure cancer cell protein levels of growth factor receptors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family before and after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The data will be used to inform a future randomized trial of combined endocrine and the most promising anti-HER targeted therapy.
