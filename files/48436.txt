A Study of ASP1570 Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab or Standard Therapies in Adults With Solid Tumors
Immune therapies work with the body's immune system to treat a number of cancers. They work with T-cells, a type of white blood cell, to target and attack specific tumors. However, some tumors can become resistant to attack by T-cells over time. They do this by sending "off" signals to T-cells. The researchers are finding ways to switch the T-cells back on.

Before a treatment can be approved for use, clinical studies need to be done. This study will provide more information on ASP1570 in adults with advanced solid tumors. ASP1570 will either be given by itself, or given with another medicine called pembrolizumab, or given with a standard cancer therapy.

The main aims of this study are：

* To check the safety of ASP1570
* To check how well ASP1570 is tolerated
* To find a suitable dose of ASP1570

This study is for adults with advanced solid tumors. Their tumor has either grown outside of the area where it started (locally advanced and unresectable) or it has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Their cancer gets worse after standard therapy or they are unable to have standard therapy. The study doctors can give more advice about who can take part.

This study will be in 2 parts.

In Part 1, the most suitable dose of ASP1570 to give to people with advanced solid tumors will be worked out. Different small groups of people with advanced solid tumors will take lower to higher doses of ASP1570. People will either be given ASP1570 by itself, ASP1570 with another medicine called pembrolizumab, or ASP1570 with a standard cancer therapy. The study treatment given depends on the type of cancer people have. There are different doses of ASP1570, with each group staying on the same dose. There is just 1 dose of pembrolizumab. The dose of a standard cancer therapy depends on its label. After taking the lowest dose of ASP1570, the first group will be checked for medical problems. The next group can only take the higher dose of ASP1570 if the first group tolerates the lowest dose . This will continue in the same way for each group.

Each group will take tablets of ASP1570 either once or twice every day in a 21-day cycle. People taking part in Japan will stay in hospital for up to 21 days during the first treatment cycle only. People will continue with more treatment cycles on the same dose unless they can't tolerate the study treatment, their cancer gets worse or the study doctor decides that person should stop treatment. People who also receive treatment with pembrolizumab will be infused with pembrolizumab on the first day of every other cycle of ASP1570 (once every 6 weeks). People who are receiving standard cancer therapy (with ASP1570) will be treated according to its label.

In Part 2, different small groups of people with advanced solid tumors will take the most suitable dose of ASP1570 worked out from Part 1. The dose will not go above the highest dose that people could tolerate from Part 1. Some groups of people will have specific advanced tumors. These include colorectal cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC for short). Again, each group will take tablets of ASP1570 once or twice every day in a 21-day or 28-day cycle. People with NSCLC will also receive docetaxel, one of the standard cancer therapies. People with stable colorectal cancer (known as CRC with microsatellite stability, or MSS-CRC) will also receive another standard cancer therapy called TAS-102 with bevacizumab. The standard cancer therapies will be given according to their label. People with solid tumors will also receive pembrolizumab on the first day of every other cycle of ASP1570 (once every 6 weeks). All groups will continue with more treatment cycles with ASP1570 by itself with pembrolizumab, or with one of the standard cancer therapies unless they can't tolerate the study treatment, their cancer gets worse or the study doctor decides that person should stop treatment.

Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) for ASP1570 Single Agent, A DLT is defined as any event meeting the DLT criteria occurring within 21 days of first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), excluding toxicities clearly related to disease progression or intercurrent illness., 21 days|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of study IP, whether or not considered related to the study IP. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the (study) procedures., Up to 27 months|Change from baseline to 45 days after End of Treatment (EOT) in laboratory values, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) grade changes from baseline to highest post-baseline grade will be assessed., Baseline and 45 days after EOT|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values., Up to 27 months|Number of participants with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant ECG values., Up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of ASP1570 per Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per iRECIST., Up to 27 months|ORR of ASP1570 per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 27 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of ASP1570 per iRECIST, DOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response CR/PR per iRECIST., Up to 27 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of ASP1570 per RECIST 1.1, DOR will be calculated only for the subgroup of participants with confirmed response CR/PR per RECIST 1.1., Up to 27 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of ASP1570 per iRECIST, DCR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as confirmed CR, PR or SD per iRECIST., Up to 27 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of ASP1570 per RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the proportion of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as confirmed CR, PR or SD per RECIST 1.1., Up to 27 months|Pharmacokinetics of ASP1570 in plasma: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 27 months|Pharmacokinetics of ASP1570 in plasma: Time of Maximum Concentration (tmax), tmax will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 27 months|Pharmacokinetics of ASP1570 in plasma: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dosage interval (AUCtau), AUCtau will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 27 months|Pharmacokinetics of ASP1570 in plasma: Trough plasma concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough will be recorded from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 27 months|Changes in tumor infiltration with CD4/CD8 cells, Proportion of participants with changes in infiltration of CD4/CD8 cells., Up to 27 months|Level of proliferation of CD4/CD8/Ki67+ cells, Proportion of participants with changes in level of proliferation of CD4/CD8/Ki67+ cells in the tumor microenvironment resulting from ASP1570., Up to 27 months
