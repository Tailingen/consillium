Individualised Versus Standard Care for Breast Cancer Patients at High-risk for Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting The ILIAD Study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding olanzapine 5mg to standard antiemetic medication can significantly reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy regimens such as anthracycline with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy.

To help clinicians prescribe antiemetic medications in a more patient-centered, evidence-based and cost-effective manner, we've developed the world's first validated risk-stratification tool for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and because of this, it is now possible to perform a trial of personalized precision antiemetic therapy for breast cancer patients.

Despite widespread antiemetic use, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains among the most feared and expected side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer. Inadequately controlled CINV can significantly reduce a patient's quality of life, impair functional activity, lead to chemotherapy dose delays and reductions, and even discontinuation of treatment. The merit of current antiemetic medications is based on their ability to control chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but not necessarily nausea, and nausea is the major issue for breast cancer patients.

With olanzapine demonstrating significant promise in preventing acute and delayed nausea, the investigators are proposing to evaluate guideline-recommended aprepitant-based triple regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg) for patients at high personal risk for CINV. For patients at low personal risk for CINV the investigators will also evaluate guideline-recommended double antiemetic regimen compared to the same regimen plus olanzapine (5 mg).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Olanzapine|DRUG: Olanzapine Placebo
High personal risk of Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, To assess whether the addition of olanzapine to the standard antiemetic regimens significantly reduces the incidence of nausea during the overall period, over repeated cycles of chemotherapy in patients at high personal risk for Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, 3 years
High personal risk overall total control of Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, To compare overall total control of Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (i.e. no nausea, no vomiting and no use of rescue medications) between the two study arms in the high risk cohort., 3 years|Improvement of patient Health Related Quality of Life by completing a patient diary and quality of life questionnaire in the high risk cohort, To assess whether adding olanzapine to a standard antiemetic regimen significantly improves patient Health Related Quality of Life in the high risk cohort, 3 years|Safety of olanzapine with respect to sedation and extrapyramidal side effects in the high risk cohort, To assess the safety of adding olanzapine as a standard antiemetic regimen particularly with respect to sedation and extrapyramidal side effects in the high risk cohort, 3 years
Low personal risk of Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, To assess whether the addition of olanzapine to the standard antiemetic regimens significantly reduces the incidence of nausea in patients at personal low-risk for Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting over repeated cycles of chemotherapy., 3 years|Low personal risk overall total control of Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, To compare overall total control of CINV (i.e. no nausea, no vomiting and no use of rescue medications) between the two study arms in the low risk cohort., 3 years|Improvement of patient Health Related Quality of Life by completing a patient diary and a quality of life questionnaire in the low risk cohort, To assess whether adding olanzapine to a standard antiemetic regimen significantly improves patient Health Related Quality of Life in the low risk cohort., 3 years|Safety of olanzapine with respect to sedation and extrapyramidal side effects in the low risk cohort, To assess the safety of adding olanzapine as a standard antiemetic regimen particularly with respect to sedation and extrapyramidal side effects in the low risk cohort., 3 years
