A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of RO7589831 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7589831 monotherapy, and in combination with pembrolizumab, in participants with microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) advanced solid tumors. RO7589831 is an oral drug that acts on a protein called Werner (WRN), which may promote the growth of cancers that are MSI and/or dMMR. By acting on WRN, RO7589831 may be able to block the growth of these types of cancer.
