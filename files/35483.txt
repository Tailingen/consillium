Cabazitaxel in Platinum Refractory Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer patients are considered platinum refractory if their disease worsens during primary platinum treatment or if they have no effect of the treatment. This constitutes a major therapeutic problem and new treatment approaches are highly needed.

Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both tumors it has effect in patients refractory to taxotere. Consequently, it could be anticipated that cabazitaxel may have an effect in platinum refractory ovarian cancer.
