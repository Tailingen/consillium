A Study of IBI351 in Combination With Cetuximab in Subjects With KRAS G12C Mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Phase 1b consists of combined dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. Phase 3 study will compare efficacy and safety of IBI351 combined with cetuximab versus chemotherapy in treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: IBI351|DRUG: Cetuximab
Incidence of DLTs (Dose-limiting Toxicity) in the Combined Dose Escalation Phase, 28 days during the first 4-week cycle|Objective response rate (ORR), Up to 1 year
incidence of serious treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) , treatment-related adverse event(TRAE), adverse events (SAEs), up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of participants with abnormality in vital signs, up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of participants with abnormality in hematology parameters, up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of participants with abnormality in clinical chemistry parameters, up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of participants with abnormality in routine urinalysis parameters, up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of participants with abnormality in ECG parameters, up to 30 days after the last administration
A Phase 1b study of the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of IBI351 combined with cetuximab in the treatment of KRAS G12C mutant metastatic colorectal cancer will be conducted based on recommended dose of IBI351, which consists of combined dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase. After confirming the efficacy and safety of IBI351 combined with cetuximab in Phase Ib, an open-label Phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of IBI351 combined with cetuximab versus oxaliplatin-based mFOLFOX6 regimen or irinotecan-based FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab in treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer will be conducted.
