Study of Fuquinitinib Combined With Capecitabine First-line Maintenance in the Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a single-arm, single-center, prospective phase I/II study that received standard first-line chemotherapy (FOLFOX,FOLFIRI,XELOX, FOLFOXIRI± targeted therapy). If the first-line chemotherapy regimen is a 2-week regimen, patients need to undergo ≥8 cycles of standard chemotherapy. If the first-line chemotherapy regimen is a 3-week regimen, maintenance therapy is required for patients with unresectable advanced metastatic colorectal cancer who have reached CR,PR,SD (RECIST 1.1) after standard chemotherapy after ≥4 cycles.

The eligible patients were screened for maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy research is divided into the following two phases:

Phase IIB fuquinitinib combined capecitabine dose exploration trial (n=6-9) : Phase II: Dose extension trial (n=47) : 47 patients were continued to be enrolled in the dose extension phase trial according to the recommended dose of fuquinitinib combined with capecitabine established in phase iB, and were treated until toxicity became intolerable or disease progression.
