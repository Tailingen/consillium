De-Escalation Protocol Of HPV Mediated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of treating participants with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancer, with less treatment, using the new staging system. The investigators believe this treatment will provide the same effectiveness as the usual treatment, but decrease the side effects. The radiation doses, chemotherapy doses, and the type of surgical approaches that will be used in this treatment protocol have all been previously investigated. Previous research suggests that this can be done safely, but there has not been a study done basing treatment on the new staging system.

Overall survival, To determine if overall survival remains the same with the de-escalated protocol as the historical standard of care survival benefit., From randomization to death, assessed up to 10 years|Disease Free Survival, To determine if disease free survival remains the same with the de-escalated protocol as the historical standard of care survival benefit., From randomization to date of progression, second primary tumor from the head and neck region, or death, assessed up to 10 years
Rate of Patients with a Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Event, To evaluate the side effects patients experience when being treated on the de-escalated protocol., From randomization to death, assessed up to 10 years|Measure the quality of life of participants using the FACT H&N assessment tool, To evaluate the quality of life of patients who are treated with the de-escalated protocol., From randomization to death, assessed up to 10 years|Measure the depression of participants using the Self-Report Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology assessment, To evaluate depression in patients who are treated with the de-escalated protocol., From randomization to death, assessed up to 10 years
