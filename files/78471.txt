Safety and Tolerability of Trametinib in Combination With Docetaxel in Japanese Subjects With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy of trametinib and docetaxel with growth factor support in Japanese subjects with Stage IV or a postoperative recurrence non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study data will be used for making decision for further Japanese development plan for NSCLC. Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled in a dose level to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity will be assessed during the first 21 days of combination therapy.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Filgrastim
Change from baseline in laboratory parameter values., Laboratory parameters include: hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation tests and urinalysis tests., Baseline and up to 6 months|Change from baseline in vital sign values, Vital sing measurement include: temperature, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), Baseline and up to 6 months|Number of participants with Adverse events (AEs)., AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice, Baseline and up to 6 months
Composite of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for, PK parameters include: area under the concentration time curve over dosing interval (AUC\[0 to tau\]), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of occurence of Cmax (tmax), and pre-dose (trough) concentration at the end of the dosing interval, PK samples will be collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 hours (pre-dose) post-dose/infusion start|Composite of PK parameters for Docetaxel, PK parameters include: area under the concentration time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC\[0 to infinite\]), area under the concentration time curve from time zero to last quantifiable concentration within subject across all treatments (AUC\[0 to t\]), Cmax, tmax, systemic clearance of parent drug (CL), and volume of distribution (V), PK samples will be collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 hours (pre-dose) post-dose/infusion start|Tumor response as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, As per RECIST v1.1 the response will be assessed from target lesion as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), not applicable (NA) or not evaluable (NE) and from non-target lesion as CR, Non-CR/Non-PD, NA or NE, 6 months
