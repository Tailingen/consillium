A Dose-Finding Study of E7389 in Combination With Carboplatin in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to explore the safety and anti-tumor activity of E7389 in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Cancer
DRUG: E7389 + carboplatin AUC 5|DRUG: E7389 + carboplatin AUC 6|DRUG: E7389+carboplatin AUC 6
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Eribulin Mesylate of E7389 in Combination With Carboplatin in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors., MTD was established by summarizing the number and percent of subject with dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) for the first cycle., 21 days (first cycle)
Safety of Eribulin Mesylate in Combination With Carboplatin as Measured by the Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events., Adverse events were considered treatment emergent if they started on or after the date of administration of the first dose of study drug, or if they were present prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug and increased in severity during the study., Throughout the entire study|Percent of Subjects With Best Overall Response as Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria., Objective response measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and is Complete Response (disappearance of all target lesions) plus Partial Response (at least 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter \[LD\] of target lesions compared baseline sum of LD)., From start of eribulin treatment until disease progression or death
This is a Phase Ib open-label, two-arm, dose-finding study of E7389 in combination with carboplatin in patients with solid tumors.
