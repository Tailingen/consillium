The Culture of Ovarian Cancer Organoids and Drug Screening
The tumor organoids platform can provide the precise genetic information and phenotype, as well as the heterogeneity of the tumor, thus provide information on drug sensitivity specific to the patient.This is an exploratory research to see if organoids testing could help guide precision treatment for ovarian cancer(OC) patients.
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: no intervention
PFS, Progression-free survival, 5 years|OS, Overall survival, 5 years
ORR, CR+PR, 1 year|DCR, CR+PR+SD, 1 year
Tissue will be received from operative specimens( primary ovarian carcinoma) at time of primary cytoreductive surgery.Ovarian cancer(OC) organoids will be then cultured. Organoids will be validated with a combination of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis and immunohistochemistry (TP53, PAX8 etc). After then, the patient-derived organoids cultured from OC will be compared the sensitivity to standard regimens (chemotherapies and targeted agents) recommendated by NCCN guidlines versus patients treated in clinical practice.
