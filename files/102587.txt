Intravascular Radiofrequency Ablation of Sympathetic Nerves for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Patients who met the inclusion criteria were treated with endovascular radiofrequency ablation and desympathetic nerve surgery. After enrollment, endovascular radiofrequency ablation and desympathetic surgery were performed. After radiofrequency ablation, the safety and efficacy of follow-up treatment will be carried out every 1 month or so, including blood routine, liver and kidney function, tumor indicators, abdominal CT/magnetic resonance, etc.
