Prostate Cancer Screening for People at Genetic Risk for Aggressive Disease, PATROL Study
This study investigates ways to detect prostate cancer earlier in people at genetic risk for disease that forms, grows, or spreads quickly (aggressive). Studying samples of blood, urine, and/or tissue in the laboratory may help doctors further understand the genetics of prostate cancer and help identify ways to detect cancer earlier, thereby improving treatment and methods of early detection in the future.

Positive predictive values (PPVs) of age-based prostate specific antigen (PSA) thresholds, To estimate PPVs of age-based PSA thresholds for biopsy referral in this patient population, will first fit a logistic regression model to estimate the odds that biopsy leads to a prostate cancer diagnosis. The regression will have a binary indicator of prostate cancer diagnosis as the response variable, patient age at biopsy (categorized as \< 50, 50-59, or \>= 60 years to correspond to the age-based PSA thresholds) as a fixed effect, and a unique patient identifier as a random effect to account for possibly repeated biopsies. Will then convert the estimated odds that biopsy leads to a prostate cancer diagnosis within each age category into corresponding probabilities of this outcome-i.e., PPV point estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals-using the inverse logit function., Up to 10 years
OUTLINE:

Participants undergo collection of blood, urine, and/or tissue samples every 6-12 months, when any biopsy occurs, and if relevant, at time of curative therapy and 3-9 months after completion of curative therapy for up to 3 years.
