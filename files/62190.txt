A Study of Recombinant Oncolytic Virus M1(VRT106) in Patients With Solid Tumors
To Evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intratumoral injections of recombinant oncolytic virus M1 (VRT106) in patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: VRT106
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of intratumoral injection of VRT106., Incidence rate of TEAE, About 2 years|Characterize the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) levels., Incidence rate of DLT, About 2 years
Examine the biological distribution characteristics and shedding patterns of intratumoral injection of VRT106., Measure the distribution and shedding of VRT106 following intratumoral injection using qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) method., About 2 years|Assess the immunogenicity of intratumoral injection of VRT106., Detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies against VRT106, which represent the potency of the neutralizing antibodies, using the PD50 value., About 2 years|Assess the anti-tumor effect of VRT106, including objective response rate (ORR) as efficacy indicators., ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to intervention, based on assessments by RECIST v1.1., About 2 years|Assess the anti-tumor effect of VRT106, including disease control rate (DCR) as efficacy indicators., DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on assessments by RECIST v1.1., About 2 years
This study is an open-label, dose-escalation clinical study which aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IT injections of VRT106 in subjects with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors, as well as evaluating the biological distribution characteristics and biological effects of VRT106 (i.e., virus tissue distribution and shedding characteristics), evaluating immunogenicity of VRT106, and preliminarily exploring the anti-tumor effects of VRT106.
