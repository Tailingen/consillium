Nursing Follow up in Geriatric Oncology : Tracking Time of Caregiver Exhaustion Risk
In geriatric oncology, caregivers are submitted to a risk of exhaustion. To investigate the clinical risk factor of exhaustion, the researchers propose to conduct a prospective observational study during 6 months phone follow up of the caregivers. The recruitment will take place during the oncogeriatric assessment consultation.

The exhaustion level felt by caregiver is assessed with Mini-Zarit scale, subjects will be followed for the duration of patient treatment and follow-up in geriatric department, an average of 6 months, 6 months|Medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition is assessed with Mini-Zarit scale, An exhaustion is noticed when caregiver score is â‰¥ 2 on Mini-Zarit scale. However, the medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition is also assessed with an increasing of 2 points from caregiver baseline score on mini-Zarit scale.

The primary purpose aim to describe the caregiver of patient with 70 years old or more, suffered from cancer and for which a treatment is planned, along with their long term evolution.

The secondary purposes are to :

* Assess the exhaustion level felt by this caregiver
* Assess the medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition
* Relate factors associated to the medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition during patient chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment
