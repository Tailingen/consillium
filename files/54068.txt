Study of SGR-1505 in Mature B-Cell Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of SGR-1505.

SGR-1505 Maximal Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Concentrations of SGR-1505 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax)., Through study completion, up to 2 years.|SGR-1505 Time to Maximal Plasma Concentration (tmax), Concentrations of SGR-1505 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax)., Through study completion, up to 2 years.|SGR-1505 Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), Concentrations of SGR-1505 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC)., Through study completion, up to 2 years.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients who have an objective response per response criteria other than stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) to treatment., Throughout the study, up to 2 years.|Duration of Response (DOR), The time from response CR/PR until relapse or death from any cause., Throughout the study, up to 2 years.|Disease Control Rate, PR, CR, and SD for 2 post-baseline disease assessments at least 6 weeks apart., Throughout the study, up to 2 years.
This is a study of SGR-1505, an oral inhibitor of MALT1, in subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphomas to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of SGR-1505. Exploratory cohorts will evaluate additional PK, PD, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and safety to establish the SGR-1505 RD. A planned amendment will evaluate SGR-1505 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, such as BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors, in patients with specific B-cell malignancies.
