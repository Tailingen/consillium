Screening of Gastric Cancer Via Breath Volatile Organic Compounds by Hybrid Sensing Approach
The study is aimed to determine the potential of volatile marker testing for gastric cancer screening.

The study will be addressing the role of confounding factors, including lifestyle factors, diet, smoking as well as addressing the potential role of microbiota in the composition of exhaled volatile markers.
Gastric Cancer|Atrophic Gastritis|Gastric Dysplasia|H.Pylori Infection
DEVICE: Breath sampling for VOC detection|PROCEDURE: Surgery material collection for VOC headspace analysis|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Upper endoscopy|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microbiota testing
Characteristic VOC pattern identification for gastric cancer detection, The characteristic VOC pattern based on sensor analysis and its performance indicators will be detected, 2 years following initiation of patient recruitment|Specific chemistry identification in the exhaled breath, Identification of specific chemistries (GC-MS analysis) originating from gastric cancer, 2 years following initiation of patient recruitment
Characteristic VOC pattern identification for gastric precancerous lesion detection, The characteristic VOC pattern based on sensor analysis and its performance indicators will be detected, 2.5 years following initiation of patient recruitment|Identification of the best-performing sensors, Comparative analysis between the performance of different sensor performance in target disease identification, 3 years following initiation of patient recruitment|Gut microbiota analysis in relation to breath VOCs, Analysis of the role of gastric and faecal microbiota in the origin of VOCs in the exhaled breath, 3 years following initiation of patient recruitment
Confounding factor analysis, The role of confounding factors will be addressed to address their role in VOC emission, 3 years following initiation of patient recruitment
Patients with established disease (gastric cancer, precancerous lesions) as well as patients investigated for the lesions and having been documented lack of the lesions will be enrolled to the study at clinical sites in Europe (Latvia, Ukraine) and Latin America (Colombia, Chile, Brazil). In addition, group of persons from general population at average risk for developing the target disease and individuals being referred for upper endoscopy according to clinical indications will be also enrolled.

Testing of volatile markers will be conducted by one of two methods: 1) gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) and 2) sensor technology. Various sensors will be used and evaluated for the purpose.

The potential sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath will be addressed by studying VOC emission by using headspace analysis from cancer tissue, gastric contents, cancer cell cultures and H.pylori.

The potential role of gastric and faecal microbiota in the origin of VOCs in the breath will be addressed. Metabolome in the circulation will also get correlated to VOCs in the breath and with microbiome.
