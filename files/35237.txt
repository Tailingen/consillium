A Trial of Glutamine to Prevent Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity and a Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Oxaliplatin
The investigators hypothesize that glutamine significantly reduces the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer, decreases the need for dose reduction of oxaliplatin, and it does not impair oxaliplatin efficacy or pharmacokinetics.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Glutamine
To evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interactions between oxaliplatin and glutamine at 30g and 40g in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer., Post cycle 2 and cycle 3
To evaluate effects of glutamine supplementation on neuropathy and diarrhea related to oxaliplatin, and on dose reductions and in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer., Post cycle 2 to 30-day follow-up visit|To compare the toxicity profile of glutamine and FOLFOX to historical data., Post cycle 2 to 30-day follow-up visit.
This is a phase II , open-label, non randomized study of oral glutamine administration to evaluate oxaliplatin pharmacokinetics, and to prevent oxaliplatin neurotoxicity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
