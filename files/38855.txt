Deep Learning Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomic Predict Platinum-sensitive in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Platinum-sensitive is an important basis for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) without effective methods to predict.We aimed to develop and validate the EOC deep learning system to predict the platinum-sensitive of EOC patients through analysis of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images before initial treatment.Ninety-three EOC patients received platinum-based chemotherapy (\>= 4 cycles) and debulking surgery from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospitalin China from January 2011 to January 2020 were enrolled. This deep-learning EOC signature achieved a high predictive power for platinum-sensitive, and the signature based on MRI whole volume is better than that on primary tumor area only.
