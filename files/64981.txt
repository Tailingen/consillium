The Purpose of This Research Study is to See if Combining Gemcitabine, Cisplatin and Durvalumab Chemotherapy Treatments With a Direct Tumor Therapy Yittrium-90 (Y-90) Will Work Better Together to Shrink Tumors and Control Cancer
The purpose of this research is to see if combining gemcitabine, cisplatin and Durvalumab chemotherapy treatments with a direct tumor therapy called Yittrium-90, will work better together to shrink the tumor and control cancer.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Induction Chemotherapy Triplet Therapy|RADIATION: Concurrent Y-90 treatment|DRUG: Consolidation Doublet Therapy:
Assessing the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 months in patients with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), Best response in terms of tumor shrinkage (by RECIST 1.1 criteria including complete + partial responses) obtained during protocol therapy., 6 months
Assessing Progression Free Survival (PFS), time from treatment initiation to disease progression, death or last patient contact, 48 months|Hepatic Progression-Free Survival (HPFS), time from treatment initiation to hepatic disease progression, death or last patient contact, 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from treatment initiation to death due to any cause or last patient contact, 48 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease (by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria) obtained during protocol therapy., 48 months|R0 resection rate, Rate of patients that achieve an R0 resection at 6 months., 6 months|treatment related impact on quality of life, Self-assessed metric of treatment-related impact on Quality of Life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) questionnaire with measures of Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale using a 5 point scale ((0) Not at all (1) A little bit; (2) Somewhat; (3) Quite a bit; (4) Very much). Better performance status, i.e. higher score, is associated with a higher quality of life., 48 months|safety and toxicity rate, Development of Treatment Toxicities (grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities persisting beyond 2 weeks despite best supportive care, any grade 3 hematologic toxicities, or any toxicity grade 4 or higher) assessed as per NCI's CTCAE v5.0 criteria., 48 months|rate of downstaging to surgery, Rate of downstaging to surgery that occurs during protocol therapy at 6 months., 6 months
