Natera Ovarian Cancer Detection Assay
The purpose of this study is to enroll participants who present with an adnexal mass on imaging to develop a non-invasive ovarian cancer assay to distinguish between malignant and benign masses. The study will collect blood, tissue, and health information from these individuals.
Adnexal Mass
Compare ctDNA from benign ovarian masses and confirmed ovarian cancers, Examine ctDNA between benign ovarian masses and confirmed ovarian cancer cases (based on tumor pathology report). The purpose of this outcome is to determine whether cfDNA could be used to develop a non-invasive ovarian cancer assay to distinguish between malignant and benign masses., Up to 60 months or 5 years
Determine the relationship between quantity of ctDNA and standard prognostic criteria, Examine quantity of ctDNA and standard prognostic criteria such as tumor grade, histology and stage of cancer, Up to 60 months or 5 years
The purpose of this study is to enroll participants who present with an adnexal mass on imaging to develop a non-invasive ovarian cancer assay to distinguish between malignant and benign masses. The study will collect blood, tissue, and health information from these individuals.
