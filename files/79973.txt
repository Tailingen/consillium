IoN- Is Ablative Radio-iodine Necessary for Low Risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Patients
IoN is a phase II/ III trial that will look to ascertain whether or not radio-iodine ablation is necessary for low risk differentiated thyroid cancer patients.
Thyroid Cancer
RADIATION: I131 1.1 GBq
Phase II: monthly patient accrual rates, To determine if recruitment into a phase III trial is feasible, Evaluated within months 7-18 of the trial|Phase III: Disease-free thyroid specific survival, DFS measured from randomisation until date of recurrence or death from thyroid cancer, From randomisation until recurrence or death from thyroid cancer
Phase III: Mortality (cause and date of death), Cause and date of death, From randomisation until death|Phase III: Occurrence of loco-regional recurrence or metastatic disease, Both groups will be compared to ascertain if radio-iodine results in a statistically significant reduction in risk in developing loco-regional recurrence in the low risk subgroup of patients., After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Stage of cancer at the time of recurrence, and the ability to treat this successfully, Both groups will be compared to ascertain if radio-iodine results in a statistically significant difference in the stage of cancer at the time of recurrence, and the ability to treat this successfully., After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Health-related quality of life, Quality of Life, After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Adverse events for all patients, Adverse events will be collected for patients in both groups during treatment and the groups compared during analysis., After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Further neck surgery, The number of further neck surgeries will be collected for patients in both groups during follow up and the groups compared during analysis., After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Further RAI ablations, Further RAI ablation and the reasons for this, After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)|Phase III: Cost-effectiveness, Costs of treatment for both groups will be collected for duration of trial to see if there is a difference between the two., After follow up is complete (estimated year 8-9 of trial)
Phase II: to determine if recruitment into a phase III trial is feasible, with a target of 10 patients per month during a minimum of 6 months (evaluated within months 7-18 of the trial).

Phase III: to determine whether the 5-year disease-free survival rate among patients who do not have routine Radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is non-inferior to those who do.
