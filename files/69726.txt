This is a prospective, multicenter, phase IV, one-arm, open-label clinical trial investigating patients treated with ribociclib and standard of care endocrine therapy for hormone receptor positive (HR+) / human epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer in the first therapy line. Patients eligible for this trial will receive on-label ribociclib according to Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and as well as the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The survival rates for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at month 12 are the co-primary objectives. Quality of life and toxicity are secondary objectives. Additionally, there is a comprehensive biomarker discovery and validation program included into the study.

A total of 1000 patients are planned to be enrolled into this trial in 75 trial sites in Germany.

Biomarkers will be evaluated before, during and after treatment or at progression. A comprehensive biospecimens sampling will be done to enable translational research projects and evaluation of potential biomarkers within circulation tumor desoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), circulating tumor ribonucleic acid (ctRNA), formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) tissue, Serum, Plasma and circulating immune cells
