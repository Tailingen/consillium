Vulvar Cancer|Quality of Life
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire administration
Global quality of life, Measured by the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30-questionnaire.

A change of at least 5-8 points is regarded as clinically significant., 1 year after end of treatment|Vulvar-cancer-specific quality of life, Measured by the EORTC-QLQ-VU34-questionnaire. Higher values represent higher quality of life., 1 year after end of treatment
Satisfaction with Care, Measured by EORTC-PATSAT-questionnaire. Higher score represent higher satisfaction with care., 3--4 months after end of treatment|Depression and anxiety, Measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Index (HADS)-questionnaire. Higher scores represent more depression and anxiety, 1 year after end of treatment.|Unmet needs, Measured by the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form (SCNS-SF)-34-questionnaire.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Information about:

* General and vulvar-cancer-specific quality of life before and after any treatment for newly diagnosed vulvar cancer
* Treatment-related morbidity after any treatment for newly diagnosed vulvar cancer
* Unmet needs of patients with newly diagnosed vulvar cancer
* Satisfaction with care after any treatment for newly diagnosed vulvar cancer in Sweden.

OUTLINE:

The study is planned as a prospective, longitudinal multi-centre study in Sweden. Since 2017, the treatment of vulvar cancer patients has been accredited to four tertiary referral university hospitals in Sweden; the Sahlgrenska University hospital in Gothenburg, the Linköping University hospital, the Skåne University hospital in Lund and the Karolinska University hospital in Stockholm.

150 patients are estimated for inclusion during a time frame of about 18 months.

Eligible patients will be asked to complete a validated questionnaire at different points of time (before and after treatment). Calculating a response rate of about 50% - 60%, this will result in at least 80 completed questionnaires.

The questionnaires consist of the following parts:

* European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30
* European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-VU-34 (Vulva-specific module)
* Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)
* Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form, excerpt (SCNS-SF34)
* European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-PATSAT (Patient Satisfaction), excerpt
* Demographic data
* 25 self-constructed (and validated) questions

RESULTS:

Results are expected to be available in 2021.
