Observational Study for the Evaluation of Incidence of Systemic Mastocytosis in t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The observational study aimed at evaluating the incidence of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML in patients with de novo t(8;21) AML and their responses to first induction, and the prognosis from standard therapy.
Systemic Mastocytosis With AHNMD|Acute Myeloid Leukemia With T(8;21)(Q22;Q22)
Incidence of Systemic Mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Evaluation of the incidence of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML in patients with de novo t(8;21) AML.

The incidence of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML will be evaluated by means of the number of diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML on the number of all diagnoses of de novo t(8;21) AML between September 2022 and August 2023., at 1 year
Hematological characteristics of all the t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 1. The neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells in WBC classification (%);
2. The proliferative degree in sections of BM (%);
3. The ratio of mast cells in BM smear and FCM (%);
4. The ratio of expression of CD25, CD2, and CD30 in FCM (%);
5. The quantification of the AML1-ETO gene fusions (%)., at 1 year|Responses to the first induction therapy of all the t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 1. The rate of eligible complete remission (CR) patients(%);
2. The rate of eligible CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) patients(%);
3. The rate of eligible morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) patients(%);
4. The rate of eligible partial remission (PR) patients(%);
5. The rate of eligible no response (NR) patients(%);
6. The rate of eligible CR without MRD patients(%);
7. The rate of eligible overall response rate (ORR) patients(%)., at 1 year|Incidence of transplantation of all the t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, The outcome of transplant in three groups of patients with systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML, t(8;21) AML without systemic mastocytosis, and OSM with associated t(8;21) AML., at 1 year|Survival Distribution of all the t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, 1. Overall survival (months): Measured the time from enrollment to the date of the last follow-up or death;
2. Leukemia-free survival (months): Measured the time from the date of attaining CR1 until the first relapse, death, or the final follow-up day., at 2 years
This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational study that aims to collect clinical information on patients with systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML from September 2022 to August 2023. No intervention is expected.

The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the patients with systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML, t(8;21) AML without systemic mastocytosis, and OSM (Oligo-mastocytic SM) with associated t(8;21) AML.

In order to estimate the incidence of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML, a survey will be sent every month to all participating sites to collect the number of all diagnoses of systemic mastocytosis associated with t(8;21) AML, t(8;21) AML without systemic mastocytosis, and OSM with associated t(8;21) AML. All patients will be followed until August 2025 in order to have at least 2 years of observation.
