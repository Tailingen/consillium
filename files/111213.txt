A First-in-human Study of IBI354 in Subjects with Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and DLTs to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), and the RP2D of sequential doses of IBI354 (study drug), and to explore and confirm the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IBI354 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: IBI354
Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs)., An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed before. A TEAE will be defined as any new AE that begins, or any pre-existing condition that worsens in severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment has been administered., Up to 30 days after the last administration|Number of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events., 21 days during the first cycle in Phase Ia
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 2 years|duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented tumor response (CR/PR) until PD/death., Up to 2 years|progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug until the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years
