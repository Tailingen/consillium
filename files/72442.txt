A Phase II Study of Balstilimab Independently or in Combination With Zalifrelimab in Advanced Cervical Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Balstilimab (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or in combination with Zalifrelimab (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy) for treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer who relapsed or progressed after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
