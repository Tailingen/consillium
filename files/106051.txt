A Dose-Finding Study of the Second Mitochondrial Activator of Caspases (SMAC) Mimetic Debio 1143 When Given in Combination With Avelumab to Participants With Advanced Solid Malignancies and to Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Platinum-Based Therapy
The study is primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating oral doses of Debio 1143 and preliminary anti-tumour activity when combined with the standard dose of avelumab in participants with advanced solid malignancies.

DRUG: Debio 1143|DRUG: Avelumab
Part A: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD:dose with estimated probability of dose limited toxicity(DLT) below 30%.DLT:any of following adverse events(AEs) during 1st treatment cycle if deemed related to treatment:grade (gr) 3/4 febrile neutropenia/any gr 4 neutropenia of \>5 days duration;gr 4 thrombocytopenia\[\<25000 per cubic millimetre(/mm\^3)\]/gr 3(\<50000/mm\^3),associated with medically concerning bleeding;gr ≥3 non-hematologic laboratory value;non-hematologic toxicity of gr 3/4,gr ≥2 uveitis/eye pain that does neither respond to topical therapy nor abate to gr 1within the avelumab re-treatment period/that required systemic treatment;gr ≥2 pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that not resolve with dose delay and systemic steroids;toxicity related to study drug that requires dosing delay of \>2weeks,dose reduction,premature discontinuation of any of two;other drug related AE in the opinion of investigator is of potential clinical significance so that further dose-escalation would expose participants to unacceptable risk., Baseline up to Cycle 1 (4 Weeks)|Part B: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response is defined as any partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter., From first occurrence of objective response until disease progression or death from any cause or switch to a new systemic therapy or end of study (Up to 2 years)
Part A and B: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Severity will be graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03., Baseline up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 2.5 years)|Part A and B: Change in Tumor Size, Change in tumor size is the maximum reduction or, in case of no reduction, the minimum increase in tumor size from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence, the start of a new systemic therapy or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first., Day 1 of cycle 3 up to 6 months; Day 1 of cycle 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 26 or until disease progression/EOT (up to 2 years)|Part A and B: Objective Response Rate, Objective response is defined as any PR or CR recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter., At the end of Cycle 6 (168 days)|Part A and B: Best Overall Response (BOR), Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response (CR, PR, stable disease or disease progression) recorded from the start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence is documented, a new systemic therapy is started or analysis cut-off, whichever occurs first. It is assessed by using RECIST criteria version 1.1. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter while on study., Day 1 of cycle 3 up to 6 months; Day 1 of cycle 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 26 or until disease progression/EOT (up to 2 years)|Part A and B: Duration of Response, Duration of response is the time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression was observed in participants with CR or PR. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., Baseline up to Cycle 26 (2 years) or until disease progression/EOT|Part A and B: Disease Control Rate, Disease control is derived as CR, PR or stable disease lasting at least 16 weeks reported during the study. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter., Day 1 of cycle 3 up to 6 months; Day 1 of cycle 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 26 or until disease progression/EOT (up to 2 years)|Part A and B: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS duration is defined as the time elapsed between treatment initiation and tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. RECIST v1.1 criteria- CR: disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Disease progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., Up to 6 months, 1 and 2 years of treatment initiation|Part A and B: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time elapsed between treatment initiation and death from any cause., Up to 6 months, 1 and 2 years of treatment initiation|Part A and B: Assessment of Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Up to Cycle 25 (700 days)
