clinical evolution, treatment and prognosis, clinical profile of patient, the phenotypic and behavioural characteristic and the clinical course from baseline to follow-up., from baseline through study completion, an average of 3 years
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an epithelial tumor characterized by the malignant proliferation of keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. It is part, along with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and accounts for 80% of all skin cancers and the most common skin cancer in the United States and Europe. Estimates of BCC incidence, however, are inaccurate since in most countries there is no cancer register collecting data on BCC incidence and many patients are treated on a territorial outpatient basis, making data collection and epidemiological analysis complex. In recent decades, there has been an increasing trend in patients with BCC, as well as a reduction in the average age of onset, with a consequent drastic increase in the social and economic cost of healthcare facilities. From these considerations, arises the need to investigate and characterize the profile of patients with advanced BCC, the clinical characteristics and the course of such neoplasm, and the choice of therapeutic options available.
