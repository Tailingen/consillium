Radiofrequency Ablation Using Combined RF Energy Delivery Mode and Octopus Electrodes for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate, through a prospective multicenter trial, the procedural time, safety, technical success rate for achieving a safety margin of at least 5 mm around the tumor, and the clinical efficacy (local and remote recurrence rates: estimated local recurrence rate at 12 months) of radiofrequency ablation using the "No-touch" technique. This approach employs Octopus electrodes and combined radiofrequency energy delivery (dual switching monopolar and bipolar mode) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
