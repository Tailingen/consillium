Electronic Skin Surface Brachytherapy for Cutaneous Basal Cell and Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of electronic skin surface brachytherapy (ESSB) for early stage basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin using a new device. This new device is Nucletron's Esteya Electronic Skin Surface Brachytherapy System. The investigators want to understand what effects, good and/or bad this device for delivering brachytherapy has on your skin cancer. The investigators also want to assess the safety, cosmetic results, the effects that ESSB has on quality of life and to correlate skin imaging with clinical response to ESSB.
