Biomarkers in Patients With Advanced Rhabdomyosarcoma
This research trial studies tumor tissue to identify important proteins and biomarkers from patients with rhabdomyosarcoma that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Prevalence of the candidate target (Pax3, Pax7, or Patched-1), and whether the candidate target is expressed in the tumor vs stroma, 1 month
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate whether the expression of a subset of proteins (by immunohistochemistry), known to be Involved in the paired box (Pax)3, Pax7, and Patched-1 neuromuscular development pathways, are dysregulated in advanced and relapsed alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas.

OUTLINE:

Immunohistochemistry is performed for each candidate target (Pax3, Pax7, and Patched-1) in each disease (alveolar, embryonal, and anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma) for tissue microarray analysis.
