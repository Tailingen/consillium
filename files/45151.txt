Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is one of the rare subtypes of ovarian cancer, yet its prognosis is extremely poor. Previous studies indicate that PD-1 inhibitors may have clinical benefits for OCCC patients. This single-arm, single-center, pilot study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of zimberelimab combined with metformin in treating relapsed/persistent ovarian clear cell carcinoma.
