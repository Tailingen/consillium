Risk Factors of Medistinal Metastasis in Endoscopic Staging of Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate risk factors for mediastinal lymph node metastasis in potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer in order to find indications for endoscopic mediastinal staging. Chest CT, integrated PET/CT, and endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) +/- endoscopic ultrasound with bronchoscope-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) are performed for mediastinal staging. CT and PET/CT findings, histologic types and other risk factors will be analyzed. The investigators develop the prediction method for mediastinal metastasis.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Relative risk of risk factors for mediastinal metastasis, risk factors; CT staging (N0-3), PET staging (N0-3), tumor location(central or peripheral), tumor size and histologic types of lung cancer., When confirmative diagnosis are available in all subjects ;3 years
