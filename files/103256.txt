Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Primary Breast Cancer With Epirubicin/Docetaxel and Carboplatin/Docetaxel
The purpose of this study is to optimize results in neoadjuvant chemotherapy of local advanced primary breast cancer. Therefore patients become first 3 cycles of Epirubicin/Docetaxel followed by 3x Carboplatin/Docetaxel.
Primary Breast Cancer
DRUG: Epirubicin, Carboplatin, Docetaxel
Determining pathologic complete remission under study treatment, 28 days after last administration of chemotherapy
Rate of breast conserving operations, 28 days after administration of last chemotherapy|Response to treatment, 28 days after last administration of chemotherapy|Determining the therapy associated toxicity, 28 days after last administration of chemotherapy
Most of the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are in the situation that an operation is possible. Using a neoadjuvant therapy the rate of breast-conserving surgery can be extended and tumor cell proliferation may be inhibited. Further the neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an in-vivo-activity-test for the used drugs. Epirubicin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin have shown antineoplastic activity against solid cancer alone and in combination.

Using two different combinations of these three drugs, first 3 cycles Epirubicin/Docetaxel and then changing to Carboplatin/Docetaxel for 3 further cycles it is assumed that the results of the therapy will improve. Main criterion is the determination of pCR, second criteria are the rate of breast-conserving surgery, tumor response and therapy-dependent toxicities.
