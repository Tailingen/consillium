Fully Covered or Partially Covered Stents in Malignant Esophageal Strictures
The purpose of this study is to determine whether fully covered or partially covered metal stents are more favorable in incurable malignant stenosis of the esophagus or cardia. Primary outcome will be the occurence of recurrent dysphagia which is defined as dysphagia due to a stent or tumour related cause in a 6-month follow-up

DEVICE: Partially covered SEMS|DEVICE: Fully covered SEMS
Number of Participants With Recurrent Dysphagia., This is defined as occurrence of dysphagia due to a stent or tumor related cause. These include tumor in- or overgrowth, stent migration, stent fracture or food impaction., From stent placement (t=0) until death or placement of second stent, assessed up to 6 months.
Number of Participants With Technical Success of SEMS Placement, Technical succes was defined as succesful deployment of the stent which bridges the stricture, At stent placement (t=0)|Number of Participants With Clinical Success Defined as Improvement of Dysphagia Score, Clinical success was defined as an improvement of dysphagia (at least 1 point reduction in the Dysphagia score) during follow-up.

Dysphagia scores will be obtained at time point: t=0, t= 1 week, t=2 weeks, t=1 month, t=3 months and t= 6 months, From stent placement until death or placement of second stent, assessed up to 6 months.|Number of Participants in Whom a Major Complication Has Occured, A major adverse event was defined as a life-threatening event, including perforation, major haemorrhage, severe pain (NRS pain score â‰¥ 7), pneumonia, stridor and fistula., From stent placement until death or placement of second stent, assessed up to 6 months|Median Survival After SEMS Placement, Survival from stent placement until death or placement of second stent, From stent placement until death or placement of second stent
