Glycosaminoglycan Scores as Early Detection Biomarkers in Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
Early detection of bladder cancer (BCa) is considered an effective strategy to curb mortality from the disease. However, current urinary biomarkers have insufficient specificity to warrant BCa screening. Urine free glycosaminoglycan profiles (or GAGomes) are promising noninvasive biomarkers of cancer metabolism. In this study, samples are obtained from patients with BCa and controls to compare the glycosaminoglycan profiles between groups.
