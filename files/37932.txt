HER2 Expression of CTC to Predict Response in HER2-positive Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Treated With ADC
To evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of HER2 expression of circulating tumor cells in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients treated with ADC
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER2 expression of circulating tumor cells
Progression free survival(PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to either the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or a partial response, 2years|Overall survival(OS), OS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to death from any cause, 5 years
To evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of HER2 expression of circulating tumor cells in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients treated with ADC
