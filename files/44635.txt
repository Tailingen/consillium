Study has two parts, Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Part 1 is divided into Parts 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E and Part 2 is divided into Parts 2A, 2B, 2D and 2E. In Part 1A, single escalating doses of PF-07248144 alone will be administered to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and select the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). In Part 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E PF-07248144 will be administered in combination with either fulvestrant (Part 1B); palbociclib + letrozole (Part 1C) or PF-07220060+fulvestrant (Part 1D) or vepdegestrant (Part 1E). After the determination of the monotherapy RDE in Part 1A, PF-07248144 will be evaluated in a dose expansion cohort as a monotherapy in Part 2A.

After determination of the combination RDE from Part 1B, PF-07248144 in combination with fulvestrant, PF-07248144 will be evaluated in a combination dose expansion with fulvestrant in Part 2B. In Part 1C, PF-07248144 in combination with letrozole + palbociclib will be evaluated for dose finding to determine the MTD and RDE for this combination. After determination of the triple combination RDE from Part 1D, PF-07248144 in combination with PF-07220060 + fulvestrant will be evaluated in a combination dose-expansion cohort, Part 2D. After determination of the combination RDE from Part 1E, PF-07248144 in combination with vepdegestrant will be evaluated in a combination dose-expansion cohort, Part 2E.
