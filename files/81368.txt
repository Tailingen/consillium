Outcomes of Low-Risk Endometrial Cancer with Isolated Tumor Cells in the Sentinel Lymph Nodes: a Prospective, Multicenter, Cohort Study
This study evaluates whether isolated tumor cells in the first lymph nodes near the tumor can tell researchers something important about the future of patients with a certain type of endometrial (uterine) cancer.

OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the length of time after primary treatment that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer. (Recurrence may be vaginal, hematogenous, lymphatic, or peritoneal.) RFS will be measured from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence, death, or last disease evaluation., Up to 5 years
Non-vaginal RFS, Non-vaginal RFS is defined as the interval from the date of surgery to the date of the first of the following events: non-vaginal recurrence or death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from surgery to death due to any cause., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate whether patients with low-risk endometrial cancer and isolated tumor cells (ITC) will have worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) than a historical cohort of similar patients with negative nodes.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo tissue sample collection and have their medical records reviewed on study.
