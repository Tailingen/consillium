Characterisation of TIM-3/Gal-9 Immune Checkpoints in Primary Central Nervous System Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas
Primary central nervous system diffuse large B cell lymphoma is a rare and aggressive entity of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. A previous transcriptomic study showed an overexpression of TIM-3 and Gal-9 in the tumor microenvironment. The investigators aimed to characterise TIM-3/Gal-9 immune checkpoints by using immunohistochemistry in the tumor microenvironment of primary central nervous system diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
