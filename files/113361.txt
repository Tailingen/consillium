RESOLUTE Trial Aims to Investigate the Value of Adding Local Ablative Treatment to Standard Systemic Treatment for Unresectable Oligometastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study aims to assess the clinical benefit of local ablative therapy (LAT) following initial standard first-line systemic treatment including the impact on survival, compared to continued standard first-line systemic treatment for oligometastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer|Oligometastatic Disease
PROCEDURE: Local Ablative Therapy|PROCEDURE: Standard first-line systemic treatment
Progression free survival (PFS), To compare the efficacy of metastasis-directed LAT following initial standard first-line systemic treatment vs continued first-line systemic treatment alone, as measured by Progression-Free Survival (PFS), 12 Months from randomisation
Overall survival, To compare the efficacy of LAT following initial standard first-line systemic treatment, compared to continued first-line systemic treatment alone, as measured by Overall Survival (OS), 12 Months from randomisation and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Efficacy of local ablative therapy, To compare the efficacy of LAT following initial standard first-line systemic treatment, compared to continued first-line systemic treatment alone, on:

1. time to development of new metastatic lesions.
2. time to initiation of 2nd line systemic treatment., 12 Months from randomisation and through study completion, an average of 1 year|Time to progression following local ablative therapy, To assess the time to progression of LAT treated lesions., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Systemic treatment-free interval, To compare systemic treatment-free interval between the two treatment groups., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Rate of high-grade toxicities, To assess and compare rate of high-grade (Grade 3-5) toxicities between the two treatment groups., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Quality of life measure, To compare quality of life measures between the two treatment groups using patient questionnaire - The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) using the 4-point ordinal scale (not at all, a little, quite a bit and very much), Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Who is this study for:

Adults with unresectable oligo-metastatic colorectal who have demonstrated treatment benefit (partial response or stable disease as per RECIST criteria) after 3-4 months of standard first-line systemic treatment.

Study details

Participants will be randomly allocated to either a LAT arm, who will receive metastasis-directed LAT such as radiotherapy or thermal ablation following initial standard first-line systemic treatment, or a control arm who will receive continued first-line systemic treatment alone. Those receiving LAT will return to systemic treatment 16 weeks post-randomisation. Information on progression-free survival and treatment outcomes will be collected.

Data from this study will inform investigators of the potential benefit of local ablative therapy in the therapeutic setting for metastatic colorectal cancer.
