Natural Killer Index From Hematopoietic Stem Cell Graft
Numerous studies about the potential role of NK alloreactive during a n hematopoietic stem cells graft are based on genotypical analyses of the KIR receptors and on genotypic incompatibilities between KIR and HLA for couple donor/recipient. There is still a lot of issues non resolved: Are KIR really expressed and how occur their expression during time when hematopoietic reconstitution? Is it depending on HLA of the recipient?If KIR are expressed, what are the mechanisms of alloreactivity of NK cells? Are NK able to lyse tumoral cells? Could alloreactive NK cells constitute a therapeutic tool able to induce tolerance and elimination of leukemia during hematopoietic stem cells grafts?
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
PROCEDURE: Blood test
Estimate in the pilot study the percentage of different NK cell populations during hematopoietic reconstitution after HSCT with regard to the KIR and HLA genotypes of donor / recipient, J60 post-HSCT
Genetic analysis of KIR and HLA incompatibility of donor and recipient - Rate of in vitro amplification of NK cells from the donor - Assess the percentage of NK cells from the donor, J60 post-HSCT
