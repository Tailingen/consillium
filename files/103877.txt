A Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Local Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of LDE225 on Skin Basal Cell Carcinomas in Gorlin Syndrome Patients
Part I was a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled Proof of Concept (PoC) study to evaluate the safety, local tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple topical administrations of LDE225 (a specific Smoothened inhibitor) on skin basal cell carcinomas in Gorlin's syndrome patients.

Following a 21-day screening period, patients were exposed to multiple doses of topically applied LDE225 twice daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind manner. The patients returned weekly for visits where each BCC was clinically evaluated and digital photographs taken. Local safety and tolerability was also assessed. After the last application of treatment, biopsies were taken from treated (both vehicle and LDE225) BCCs (three per patient) for histology, biomarker evaluation and for pharmacokinetics (skin exposure). In addition, a biopsy from LDE225-treated uninvolved perilesional skin was taken for pharmacokinetic evaluation. In total, 4 biopsies were taken: 2 for histology and biomarker and 2 for PK.

Part II of this study consisted of a 21-day screening period, a baseline period (directly before commencing the treatment period) and a treatment period of 6 or 9 weeks, depending on randomization. A clinical assessment was performed on site on the last treatment day and if a full clinical response had been observed, approximately 3 weeks after the last treatment an excision of the BCC(s) would have been performed. The study completion visit occurred either 1 week after the excision (when this visit was planned) or 1 week after the last treatment. For a subset of patients, skin biopsies were collected on the last treatment day and an excision of a BCC was also performed at that same visit.

Change From Baseline in Tumor Measurements (Part I), Measurement of the tumor size, volume and color by standardized digital photography, using dermatoscopic, macroscopic and 3D images of the BCCs was done by participant where if a participant had more than one tumor, for each of these tumors, the change from baseline was calculated (% change). From these values, the mean was calculated to get only one result per participant. Then for all the participants (n=8 both for LDE and vehicle), the mean was calculated. Photographic analysis was conducted by QuantifiCare. The volume of a lesion was measured with a special device, the "3D LIFEVIZ Micro system", which uses a lens splitter to produce two images of the skin surface, captured at the same time, with viewing angle differences close to human vision. A stereovision algorithm is then applied to reconstruct and quantitatively analyze the skin surface in 3D. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., 4 weeks|Change From Baseline in Tumor Measurements (Part II), Measurement of the tumor size, volume and color by standardized digital photography, using dermatoscopic, macroscopic and 3D images of the BCCs was done by participant where if a participant had more than one tumor, for each of these tumors, the change from baseline was calculated (% change).
