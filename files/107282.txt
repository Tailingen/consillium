Exploratory Drug Interaction Study Between SMIs and DOACs
The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs), used in targeted therapy for tumours, on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
Solid Tumor|Cancer, Lung
DOAC trough concentration, DOAC trough concentration before and during concomitant use with an SMI, At least 7 days after start DOAC use and in combination with an SMI at steady-state (after at least 21 days)|DOAC peak concentration, DOAC peak concentration before and during concomitant use with an SMI, At least 7 days after start DOAC use and in combination with an SMI at steady-state (after at least 21 days)
Thromboembolic and bleeding events during follow-up, Thromboembolic and bleeding events during follow-up, within 6 months after the last blood sampling|SMI trough concentration during concomitant use with a DOAC, SMI steady-state trough concentration during concomintant use with a DOAC, After the start of the DOAC use in combination with an SMI at steady-state (after at least 21 days)

Patients who receive anticoagulant therapy in the form of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and simultaneously receive anti-cancer targeted therapy with a small molecule inhibitor (SMI), potentially have an increased risk on thromboembolic complications and bleeding events due to interfering drug-drug interactions. Some SMIs influence CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein (p-gp) for which DOACs are substrates. In this study, the effect of theoretically relevant SMIs on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients with solid tumours will be investigated. For this purpose, plasma concentration analyses will be performed.
