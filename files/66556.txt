A Phase I/II Study of OBI-3424 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
A first-in-human open-label, Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD/RP2D, PK, and preliminary efficacy of OBI-3424 administered as a single agent.
Solid Tumor|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: OBI-3424
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Adverse events will be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Adverse events will be noted as it occurs. Timeframe for measure begins after first administration of study drug until 30 days after last dose of study drug. Study duration defined as up to 2 years from the first dose.|Assess safety changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), Resting 12-lead ECGs will be obtained from all subjects' pre-OBI-3424 infusion and within 15 minutes post-OBI-3424 infusion in order to assess any impact OBI-3424 may have on the QT interval as assessed by the Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF)., Day 1 Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Assess safety changes of body weight., If during treatment a subject's body weight changes by \>10%, the dose should be adjusted., Day 1 of each cycle (there are 34 cycles; 21 days for each cycle)|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as the occurrence of Grade 3/4 adverse events within the first cycle (the first 21 days) of treatment that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to OBI-3424., Throughout Cycle 1 (21 days for each cycle)|Define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Determination of the MTD, based on the frequently of DLTs observed in Cycle 1 in subjects recruited to the Dose Escalation Phase., Days 1 and 8 of each cycle (all 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax of OBI-3424 and OBI-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Maximum peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax of OBI-3424 and OBI-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - The magnitude of the slope of the linear regression of the log concentration vs. time profile during the terminal phase (Kel), Kel of OBI-3424 and OBI-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Half-life (T1/2), T1/2 computed as ln (2)/Kel of OBI-3424 and OBI-2660 will be computed for each subject where possible., Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (first cycle of 34 cycles and there are 21 days for each cycle)|PK - Area under the concentration-time curve (AUClast), AUClast from Hour 0 through the last quantifiable concentration time (LQCT), where LQCT is the time at which the last sample with a quantifiable concentration was drawn, Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1 is 21 days)
