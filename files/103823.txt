A Study to Test How Safe Pozelimab and Cemdisiran Combination Therapy and Cemdisiran Alone Are and How Well They Work in Adult Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
This study is researching the experimental drugs called pozelimab and cemdisiran, and cemdisiran monotherapy. The study is focused on patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Myasthenia gravis is a disease that causes weakness and fatigue in muscles in the body because the nerves and muscles are not communicating properly. The aim of the study is to see how effective pozelimab and cemdisiran are when used in combination and when pozelimab and cemdisiran are used alone for patients with gMG.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs
* How the study drugs work inside the body
* How much study drugs are in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against pozelimab and cemdisiran (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects)
