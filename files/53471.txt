Docetaxel to Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors in Patients With Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Suboptimal PSA Response
This study is being done to answer the following question: can the chance of prostate cancer growing or spreading be lowered by adding a drug to the usual combination of drugs?

This study would like to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for prostate cancer.

The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is hormone treatment with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Androgen-Receptor Pathway Inhibitor (ARPI).
Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)
DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Darolutamide (BAY 1841788)|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: ADT
Overall Survival, 39 months
PSA Progression compared in both arms, 39 months|PSA Response comparison between arms, PCWG3 criteria, 39 months|PSA Kinetics compared between both arms, * 90% PSA decline
* PSA \<0.2ng/ml
* PSA \<0.02ng/ml, 39 months|Clinical progression-free survival between both arms, 39 months
This is an international multi-centre, open-label, randomized phase III trial comparing Docetaxel chemotherapy added to standard of care Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) + Androgen-Receptor Pathway Inhibitor (ARPI) versus standard of care Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) + Androgen-Receptor Pathway Inhibitor (ARPI) in participants with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) who have a suboptimal PSA response after 6-12 months of androgen-targeting therapy.
