A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and How YH002 Enters, Moves Through and Exits the Body in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the study drug YH002. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of YH002 in patients with advanced solid Malignancies
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: YH002
Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events, The safety profile of YH002 will be assessed by monitoring the adverse events (AE) per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, From screening up to 2 year|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycle, Cycle 1 of each cohort. Duration of one cycle is 3 weeks|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLT is defined as a toxicity (adverse event at least possibly related to YH002) occurring during the DLT observation period (the initial 21 days), Cycle 1 of each cohort. Duration of one cycle is 3 weeks

This is a single arm clinical trial in subjects with advanced solid tumor receiving multiple doses of YH002 intravenously (IV). YH002 will be administered (IV) in 6-48 patients with advanced solid tumors. An accelerated titration method followed by a traditional 3+3 dose escalation algorithm will be utilized to determine MTD/MAD. Patients will be dosed at Dose A, Dose B, Dose C, Dose D, Dose E, Dose F, Dose G, and Dose H every 3 weeks (Q3W).
