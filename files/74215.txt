A Study to Evaluate the Value of Circulating Tumour DNA in Follow-up of Patients With an Advanced Gastroenteropancreatic or Lung Neuroendocrine Tumour Under Everolimus +- SSA Treatment (Liquid-NET 2.0)
Prospective, multicentric, single arm, POC study to evaluate the value of CtDNA in follow-up of patients treated with everolimus, with or without somatostatin analogues for advanced gastroenteropancreatic or lung neuroendocrine tumours.

Prospective, multicentric, single arm, POC study to evaluate the value of CtDNA in follow-up of patients treated with everolimus, with or without somatostatin analogues for advanced gastroenteropancreatic or lung neuroendocrine tumours. Inclusion is possible after proven progressive disease on CT and/or DOTANOC scan (at physician's discretion) and decision of physician to start everolimus ± SSA treatment. During the study, CT and/or DOTANOC scans (thorax/abdomen/pelvis) (at physician's discretion) will be performed to detect progressive disease and CtDNA levels will be measured from the start of the treatment. The changes in CtDNA levels will be correlated to the tumour disease progression based on imaging (RECIST 1.1 and or PERCIST 1.0 (if available)) and laboratory and clinical markers. Characterization of CtDNA will be based on detection of tumour-specific alterations (i.e. mutations, copy number alterations and DNA methylation) using next-generation sequencing, digital droplet PCR and a photoelectrochemical biosensor. The identification of tumour-specific mutations will be done using next-generation sequencing of tumour tissue.
