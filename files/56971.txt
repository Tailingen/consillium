Cardiotoxicity of Radiation Therapy (CTRT)
The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the utility of sensitive imaging and biomarker measures in detecting subclinical cardiotoxicity across a spectrum of radiation doses to the heart. We will focus specifically on patients receiving photon or proton chest radiotherapy. Our broad working hypothesis is that RT induces early, subclinical CV injury, as evidenced by cardiomyocyte inflammation and necrosis, and worsening CV function.
