Gemtuzumab Chemotherapy MRD Levels; Adult Untreated, de Novo, Fav Interm Risk AML
MRD driven study. Addition of gemtuzumab to conventional chemotherapy to reduce MRD of patients with favorable/intermediate-risk AML. Post-consolidation assessment of MRD.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin
Activity of GO in combination with chemotherapy in terms of MRD negativity achievement, Percentage of MRD negativity after consolidation in patients treated in induction and consolidation with GO, 2 months
Setting up a multicenter, MRD (Minimal Residual Disease)-driven study that relies on addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin to conventional chemotherapy to reduce the pre-transplant levels of MRD of patients with favorable/intermediate-risk (according to ELN 2017) AML. Post-consolidation assessment of MRD will be exploited to establish the final risk assignment and to verify whether the delivery of a post remission therapy intensity (AuSCT, Autologous Stem Cell Transplant, vs ASCT, Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant) of which is MRD-driven will improve the outcome in terms of anti-leukemic efficacy.
