Sho-Saiko-To Following Removal of Liver Cancer By Embolization in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Surgically Removed
RATIONALE: The Chinese herbal medicine Sho-saiko-to contains ingredients that may slow the growth of tumor cells and stimulate a person's immune system to help kill tumor cells. This may be an effective treatment following hepatic artery embolization.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of Sho-saiko-to following hepatic artery embolization in treating patients who have liver cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Sho-saiko-to after ablation therapy with embolization vs historical control patients.
* Compare the liver function and alpha fetoprotein levels in patients treated with this drug vs historical control patients.
* Compare the intervention-free survival in patients treated with this drug vs historical control patients.

OUTLINE: Beginning within 1 week after the first course of ablation therapy with embolization, patients receive oral Sho-saiko-to three times daily. Treatment with Sho-saiko-to continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
