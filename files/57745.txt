Implementation of a Pharmacist-Based, Post-Chemotherapy Follow-up Clinic
The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pharmacists on reducing chemotherapy-related side effects by providing education before and after patients receive intravenous chemotherapy at one of Cedars-Sinai outpatient infusion centers.

Participants will be interviewed via telephone within 7 business days after receiving intravenous chemotherapy from the outpatient cancer center infusion clinic.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Follow-up phone interview
Hospital admission related to chemotherapy within 30-day post treatment, Number of hospital admission related to chemotherapy, 30 days after receiving the first intravenous chemotherapy
The study involves participation at a single timepoint only.

Participants who consented to participate and are considered eligible will be interviewed by a pharmacist via phone at approximately 7 business days after receiving intravenous chemotherapy infusion. Phone call will be made between the hours of 9am - 6pm on Monday - Saturday. Calls are anticipated to last between 15 to 20 minutes. Participants will be asked if they have experienced any adverse events since the infusion, whether or not they have had any barriers taking supportive care medications, and if the patient understands how to manage potential adverse events. If applicable, participants will be provided further education on optimizing adverse events, guided on proper medication administration times, and will be provided with non-pharmacological clinical pearls to minimize chemotherapy-related side effects and optimize supportive care management.

If unable to reach the participant or caregiver after three attempts, the participant will be considered ineligible. Participants can decline participation at any time during the phone call.
