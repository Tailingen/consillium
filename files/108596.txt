To Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Antitumor Activity of ABN401 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring c-MET Dysregulation
This is a dose escalation, Phase 1 study of ABN401 in patients with advanced solid tumors, refractory metastatic disease, or refractory locally advanced disease not amenable to local therapy.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: ABN401- Escalation Phase|DRUG: ABN401- Expansion Phase
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABN401., Safety and tolerability determined by abnormal clinical laboratory tests, vitals signs, physical exam, ECG parameters, Liver function tests, Measurements at Baseline till the last day of Visit|To determine the objective response rate (ORR) to ABN401 according to RECIST 1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who experience a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as measured by RECIST 1.1., Up to 30 days
To determine the systemic PK of ABN401., Dose Escalation Phase: Cycle 1- Day 1, Day 2, Day 5, Day 8, Day 15; Dose Expansion Phase: Cycle 1, Day -2, Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Day 15|To determine preliminary estimate of ABN401 efficacy in patients with selected malignancies, Efficacy will be assessed by CT/MRI Scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (patients with lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer, and if clinically indicated for patients with other malignancies), Screening and at every 6 weeks from C1D1 independent of cycle length|Evaluate the duration of response (DoR) to ABN401 according to RECIST 1.1, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time period from documentation of disease response to disease progression., Up to 30 days|Assess the objective disease control rate (DCR) of ABN401 according to RECIST 1.1, Disease advanced control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) as measured per RECIST 1.1., Up to 30 days|Determine progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first dose of study drug until disease progression or death., Up to 30 days
First part of the study uses single patient cohorts at the initial dose levels, followed by a classic 3+3 design, with enrollment of 3 patients per cohort and expansion to 6 patients in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

The second part of the study consists of expansion cohorts will enroll Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring patients with c-MET dysregulation.
