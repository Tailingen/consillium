Safety and Pharmacokinetic Profile of CKD-581
This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in patients with Lymphoma failed to standard therapy. The usefulness of the this regimen is evaluated by response rate, progression free survival.
Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CKD-581
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Up to 28 days (For 1st cycle)
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Up to 28 days (For 1st cycle)|Pharmacokinetics, PK parameters(AUC, Cmax) of CKD-581 \& metabolites, 0, 0.25, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hrs post dose(1st cycle Day1, 15)|Objective response rate, every 56 days (every 2 cycle)|Progression Free survival, up to progression
Recently, the role of transcriptional repression through epigenetic modulation in carcinogenesis has been clinically validated with several inhibitors of histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. It has long been recognized that epigenetic alterations of tumor suppressor genes was one of the contributing factors in carcinogenesis. Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) de-repress genes that subsequently result in growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. CKD-581 is developed for HDAC inhibitors. Such as to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicity (DLT), safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in patients with Lymphoma failed to standard therapy.
