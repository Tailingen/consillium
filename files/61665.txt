An Exploratory Study to Evaluate Immune Determinants of the Response to Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) in Solid and Hematologic Tumors
This is a study to explore the phenotypic and transcriptional changes of different cellular components in the tumor following the injection of somatic cell therapy drugs.

The second objective is to explore phenotypic and transcriptional changes of different cellular components in blood and bone marrow following injection of somatic cell therapy drugs.Then correlate the phenotypic and transcriptional profile of different tumor, blood and bone marrow immune populations with clinical response and/or toxicity. And to finish this study is designed in order to identify a phenotypic, transcriptional and epigenetic profile of intra-tumoral adoptive cells and correlate this profile with clinical response and/or toxicity.
Solid Tumor, Adult|Solid Tumor, Childhood|Hematologic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood sample|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow sample
Comparison of frequency, phenotype and transcriptional profile of the different immune subsets in the tumor following adoptive cell therapy infusion using spectral flow cytometry and RNA sequencing, 3 months following ACT
Objective Response, Defined by RECIST 1.1 score for lymphoma and solid tumors, 3 months following ACT|Progression-free survival, Defined as the time between the adoptive cell therapy and progression, or death whatever the cause, whichever occurs first., 5 years after first ACT infusion|Overall survival, Defined as the time between the adoptive cell therapy injection and death whatever the cause, 5 years after first ACT infusion|Safety of biopsies procedures (when applicable) graded according to CTCAE v5.0, From enrollment to 30 days after the last sample
