Geldanamycin Analogue in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a geldanamycin analogue in treating patients with advanced cancer.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: tanespimycin
Recommended phase II dose of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) at 4 weeks
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) client protein and co-chaperone changes during first course of treatment|Pharmacokinetic profile of 17-AAG during the first course of treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose for a geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), in patients with advanced malignancies.
* Determine the toxic effects and dose-limiting toxicity of AAG in this patient population.
* Determine the safe dose of AAG for a Phase II study.
* Measure the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of AAG in these patients.
* Assess time to tumor progression and any antitumor activity in patients treated with AAG.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive a geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (AAG), IV over 15-30 minutes every week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
