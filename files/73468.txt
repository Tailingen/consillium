Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab Versus Sunitinib in Previously Untreated Advanced or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (CheckMate 214)
The purpose of this study is to compare the objective response rate, progression free survival and the overall survival of Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab to Sunitinib monotherapy in patients with previously untreated Renal Cell Cancer.
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma|Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Sunitinib
Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate(ORR) in Intermediate/Poor Risk Participants Per IRRC Using RECIST v1.1, ORR was defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria based on IRRC assessment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, From first dose until date of documented disease progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in Intermediate/Poor-Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC), OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. Survival time was censored at the date of last contact ("last known alive date") for subjects who were alive., From the date of randomization to the date of death (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Intermediate/Poor-Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the IRRC (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subsequent therapy included anticancer therapy, tumor directed radiotherapy, or tumor directed surgery. Subjects who died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death., From date of first dose to date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)
Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate(ORR) in Any Risk Participants Per IRRC Using RECIST v1.1, ORR was defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria based on IRRC assessment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, From first dose until date of documented disease progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in Any Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. For subjects that are alive, their survival time will be censored at the date of last contact ("last known alive date"). Overall survival will be censored for subjects at the date of randomization if they were randomized but had no follow-up. Survival follow-up will be conducted every 3 months after subject's off-treatment date., From the date of randomization to the date of death (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Any Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the IRRC (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subsequent therapy included anticancer therapy, tumor directed radiotherapy, or tumor directed surgery. Subjects who died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death., From date of first dose to date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)
