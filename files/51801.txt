Metvix Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Versus Cryotherapy in Participants With Primary Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) cream to cryotherapy, in treatment of participants with primary superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

Secondary objectives was to compare cosmetic outcome and tolerability (adverse events) in these participants, 3 months after treatment. In addition the recurrence rates in the two treatment groups will be compared up to five years after treatment.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: MetvixÂ® cream|PROCEDURE: Hand held liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy
Percentage of Participants With Histologically Confirmed Patient Complete Response (CR) 3 Months After Last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy Cycle, Patient Complete Response (CR) was defined as 100 percentage of the lesions within the participant having negative findings for nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in the histological examination., 3 months after last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy cycle, up to 6 months
Number of Lesion With Complete Response 3 Months After Last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy Cycle, Complete response was defined as no clinically visible BCC lesions in the treatment area., 3 months after last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy cycle, up to 6 months|Overall Cosmetic Outcome Assessed by Investigator 3 Months After the Last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy Cycle, Cosmetic outcome was assessed by both investigator and participants in participants with 100% of lesions in complete response. Overall cosmetic outcome was assessed with regard to occurrence of the following signs or symptoms; scarring, atrophy, induration, redness or change in pigmentation. The investigator graded the cosmetic outcome as:

* excellent: no scarring, atrophy or induration, and no or slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation compared lo adjacent skin
* good: no scarring, atrophy or induration but moderate redness or change in pigmentation compared to adjacent skin
* fair: slight to moderate occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration
* poor: extensive occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration., 3 months after the last metvix PDT or Cryotherapy cycle (Up to 6 months)|Overall Cosmetic Outcome Assessed by Participants 3 Months After the Last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy Cycle, Cosmetic outcome was assessed by both investigator and participants in participants with 100% of lesions in complete response. Overall cosmetic outcome was assessed with regard to occurrence of the following signs or symptoms; scarring, atrophy, induration, redness or change in pigmentation. The participants graded the cosmetic outcome as:

* excellent: no scarring, atrophy or induration, and no or slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation compared lo adjacent skin
* good: no scarring, atrophy or induration but moderate redness or change in pigmentation compared to adjacent skin
* fair: slight to moderate occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration
* poor: extensive occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration., 3 months after the last metvix PDT or Cryotherapy cycle (Up to 6 months)|Recurrence Rate in Complete Clearance Group, Recurrence rate in complete clearance group was analyzed., 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after last Metvix PDT cycle or Cryotherapy (Up to 5 years)|Overall Cosmetic Outcome Assessed by Investigator 24, 36, 48, and 60 Months After the Last Metvix PDT or Cryotherapy Cycle, Cosmetic outcome was assessed by both investigator and participants in participants with 100% of lesions in complete response. Overall cosmetic outcome was assessed with regard to occurrence of the following signs or symptoms; scarring, atrophy, induration, redness or change in pigmentation. The investigator graded the cosmetic outcome as:

* excellent: no scarring, atrophy or induration, and no or slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation compared lo adjacent skin
* good: no scarring, atrophy or induration but moderate redness or change in pigmentation compared to adjacent skin
* fair: slight to moderate occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration
* poor: extensive occurrence of scarring, atrophy or induration., 24, 36, 48, and 60 Months After the Last Metvix PDT Cycle (Up to 5 years)
BCC was a highly frequent skin malignancy, and accounts for approximately 75% of all non-melanoma skin cancers. It is the most common malignant tumour of any organ, mostly affecting head and neck (84%) in fair-skinned people. Several non-pharmacological treatment modalities was used for BCC, including excision surgery, Moh's surgery, radiation, curettage/electrodesiccation and cryotherapy. The treatment used depends on the type, size, depth and localisation of the BCC lesion.

The use of PDT was attractive for the treatment of BCCs because of its efficiency, mild and local side effects and excellent cosmetic outcome. Previous clinical experience was promising and participants with primary BCCs were included in this prospective, randomised, comparative, multicenter study to show that Metvix is non-inferior to alternative treatment with better cosmetic outcome.

The primary end-point is the number of participants in whom 75% or more of the BCC lesions have responded completely at 3 months after PDT with Metvix or 3 months after cryotherapy. Both on-site and independent, blinded response assessments analysed. The analysis based on the results of the independent review board constitutes the primary analysis.

The secondary end-points was the proportion of participants in whom less than 75% of the BCC lesions respond completely, number of lesions across participants that show complete response, evaluation of cosmetic outcome and adverse events 3 months after Metvix PDT or 3 months after cryotherapy. In addition 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months recurrence rates was assessed.
