Preoperative Intratumor Dendritic Cells Injection Immunotherapy for Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to confirm safety and immunological responses of Preoperative intratumor dendritic cells injection immunotherapy using immature dendritic cells with S pyogenes Preparation (OK-432) for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer for pancreatic cancer patients.
Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: dendritic cells, OK-432
To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of intratumoral autologous dendritic cell vaccination in combination with OK-432, 2 years
To determine the overall response rate for this regimen as determined by overall and disease-free survival., 2 years|To evaluate the immune response of patients treated with this regimen based on the presence and characterization of tumor-infiltrating white blood cells, 2 years
The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor even with extensive surgery, and development of new treatment modalities is much-expected for cure of this disease. Dendritic cells (DCs) immunotherapy is expected favorable outcome when it is approached directly to the cancer tissue. To evaluate safety and immunological responses, we conducted a phase I/II study of intra-tumor DCs immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer patients.
