Voiding Disorders in Children After Sacrococcygeal Teratoma Resection
Sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common neonatal tumors and require rapid and complete resection. Tumor nerve compression and pelvic surgical sequelae may lead to many and varied voiding disorders. Data concerning long-term vesico-sphincteric disorders are conflicting. Some studies find good functional results \[Cozzi et al., 2008; Draper et al., 2009\]. However other authors reveal neurologic bladder with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia \[Hambraeus et al., 2018\] and rise concerned about long-term renal function \[Khanna et al., 2019; Rehfuss et al., 2020\] even in the absence of clinical voiding disorders. Most of studies include young patients with other malformations such as anorectal malformations or dysraphisms which may impact the results. The main objective is to assess bladder dysfunction in children aged 6 to 18 years after isolated sacrococcygeal teratoma resection.
