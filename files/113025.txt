VIC Regimen Versus Bevacizumab Plus Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for BRAF V600E-Mutated Advanced Colorectal Cancer
In this study, we compared first-line VIC regimen with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in Chinese patients with initially unresectable BRAF V600E-mutated mCRC. The principal goal was to evaluate the safety of VIC regimen, and to investigate the tumor response, the radical resectability, and the patient survival.
