Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation With CD3/CD19 Depletion and Reduced Intensity Conditioning in Patients With Acute Leukemia
Feasibility and toxicity of haploidentical allogeneic HCT after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen with CD3/CD19 depleted grafts. This study enrolls patients with acute leukemia in complete remission with an indication for allogeneic HCT but without a suitable HLA-identical donor
