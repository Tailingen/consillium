A Post-Market Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Performance and Operation of the Brevera Breast Biopsy System
The Brevera Breast Biopsy System integrates tissue acquisition, real time imaging, and post biopsy handling all during the same procedure. This post-market clinical trial will be performed to obtain clinical/operational data and feedback on the Brevera Breast Biopsy System as compared to the current standard-of-care breast biopsy procedures

DEVICE: Breast Biopsy
Difference in Procedural Time in Minutes, The primary endpoint of this trial is the measured difference in procedure time between biopsies performed with the Brevera biopsy system and those performed with the standard-of-care biopsy systems at each clinical site. Additionally, feedback from the perspective of the participant radiologists, technologists, and subjects using the systems was reported., Average Time- Procedure (1 Lesion per subject): Total Time elapsed from when the subject enters the procedure room until they have left the procedure room, an average of 43 minutes.
Post-biopsy Complication Rates, Adverse event percentage rates., The time of consent until the subject procedure was completed, an average of 1 day|Number of Samples Collected Per Lesion, Number of samples collected per lesion, Samples collected from day of Breast Biopsy Procedure Only|Percentage of Procedures With Overall Positive Opinion From Radiologists, Technologists and Patients, The radiologists, technologists, and patients participating in this study were asked to provide feedback on the Brevera Biopsy System at the completion of each procedure. Their responses (raw scores) were reported and converted to percentage of procedures with overall positive opinion. The scale goes from 0% (poor/negative opinion) to 100% (excellent/positive opinion)., Through study completion, enrollment expected to take up to 6-10 months at each participant site. Data collected from day of Breast Biopsy Procedure Only
