A Study of Aezea® (Cenersen) in Transfusion Dependent Anemia Associated With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purpose of the study is to test the safety of six cycles of cenersen treatment and to begin to test the hypothesis that intermittent administration of cenersen may lead to a reduced dependence on transfusion.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: cenersen|DRUG: Dexamethasone
1) Interventional Drug Safety: dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cenersen for each of three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol in patients with lower risk MDS defined as low or intermediate-1 risk by IPSS., Assessment of adverse events for each dosing level, 6 months w/ 24 month follow-up
Reduction in RBC transfusions, Erythroid Response (HI-E) from the lowest pharmacologically active exposure after evaluation of all dose levels - Reduction in RBC transfusions by greater than or equal to 4 units/8 weeks triggered by a hemoglobin transfusion threshold lower than 9 g/dL when compared to the 8 week baseline for transfusion-dependent patients (where transfusion dependence is defined as 4 units or more RBCs in 8 weeks), 6 months w/ 24month follow-up|Improvement in Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, Hematologic Improvement by Hb increase by ≥ 1.5 g/dL or more for at least 8 weeks and the patient is not transfusion-dependent., 6 months w/ 24 month follow-up
The study is a nonrandomized open-label treatment with varying doses of cenersen by intravenous administration to:

Primary

\*To assess the safety profile and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cenersen for each of three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol in patients with lower risk MDS defined as low or intermediate-1 risk by IPSS.

Secondary

* To determine the lowest pharmacologically active exposure from among three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol that exhibits the desired activity on erythropoiesis after evaluation of all dose levels, and
* To determine if intermittent treatment with cenersen will reduce transfusion requirements for patients with lower risk MDS.
