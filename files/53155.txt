Optimization of Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy for Cervical Cancer Based on MRD(Minimal Residual Disease)
This study is a prospective cohort clinical trial that aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of a combined chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy treatment for early postoperative cervical cancer. Specifically, this study seeks to evaluate the ability of MRD-based screening to detect and monitor changes in MRD status at different stages of treatment, its potential for use in monitoring patient recurrence rates and in prognosis evaluation. In addition, this study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy as a postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients identified to be at risk of early cervical cancer based on MRD screening.

The study comprised of three periods; a screening period (within 28 days prior to informed consent), a treatment period (defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to its termination for any reason), and a follow-up period (consisting of end-of-treatment visits, safety visits, and survival follow-up). During the screening period, participants underwent eligibility evaluations, including tissue and blood sample collection for biomarker detection. Eligible subjects were divided into high-risk and intermediate-risk groups based on Peter's criteria and Sedlis criteria, with patients in the high-risk group or those identified as MRDc0 (+) (3 days after surgery to 10 days before adjuvant therapy) receiving conventional pelvic concurrent chemoradiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and four courses of immunotherapy. Patients in the intermediate-risk group and those identified as MRDc0 (-) received simultaneous chemoradiotherapy in the target volume of the small pelvis, four courses of immunotherapy, continued immunotherapy with MRDIn(+)(2 months after initiation of immunotherapy), and follow-up monitoring with MRDIn(-). Subjects returned to the hospital for a safety follow-up 28 days (±7d) after the last dose to track the outcome of adverse events. Safety visits consisted of vital sign measurements, laboratory tests, and other protocol-required assessments to evaluate adverse events, concomitant medications, and concomitant therapy. At the end of treatment, subjects began survival follow-up every 3 months (±7d). Radiographic assessments were conducted at this frequency until disease progression, death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of follow-up antitumor therapy, or investigator-initiated termination of the study.
