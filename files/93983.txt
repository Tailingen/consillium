Effect of Transcutaneous Acupoint Electrical Stimulation (TAES) on Postoperative Cough in Lung Cancer
Observation and exploration of the improvement in cough symptoms in postoperative lung cancer patients with Transcutaneous Acupoint Electrical Stimulation (TAES), the change in Cough Symptom Score (CSS) compared to baseline, the change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for cough symptoms compared to baseline, the change in total score of Leicester Cough Questionnaire-Mandarin Chinese version (LCQ-MC) compared to baseline, and overall evaluation of treatment effectiveness by patients. A total of 120 postoperative lung cancer patients with cough were strictly selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and treated and followed up according to the research plan requirements. Clinical observation forms were completed and clinical data were recorded in the database. Statistical analysis was performed on relevant clinical observation indicators to report research results and write related papers.

LCQ-MC, The questionnaire consists of 19 items, each of which is divided into 7 levels according to the severity, including the impact of chronic cough on the physiological domain (chest pain, cough, sputum, fatigue, sleep, hoarseness, etc.), psychological domain (feeling embarrassed, anxious, depressed, annoyed, etc.), and social domain (work, daily life, leisure activities, conversation, phone calls, interference with friends or family members). The score for each domain is the total score of each item in that domain divided by the number of questions (scored from 1 to 7), and the total score is the sum of the scores for the three domains (scored from 3 to 21). A higher score represents a better patient's health condition., Prior to treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment (week 2), and 2 weeks after the end of treatment (week 4)
To obtain sufficient evidence from evidence-based medicine, prospective, random, blind, and controlled clinical trials are adopted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TEAS in treating postoperative cough in lung cancer patients. This study aims to provide a potential non-pharmacological treatment option for postoperative cough patients with lung cancer, improve the quality of life of postoperative lung cancer patients, identify the population that is more likely to benefit from TEAS treatment and provide a solid scientific basis and guidance for personalized acupuncture treatment for postoperative cough in lung cancer patients.
