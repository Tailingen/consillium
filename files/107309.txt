Reduction of Cancer Related Fatigue in Patients During TKI Therapy
The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects of a 12-week resistance training program on cancer related fatigue in cancer patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. It is hypothesized that incidence and severity of cancer related fatigue can be reduced by exercise training in this population which leads to an improved treatment completion rate.
All Tumor Entities Treated With TKI Therapy
BEHAVIORAL: Progressive strength training
Change in cancer related fatigue, Assessed via the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)., From baseline to the 6th and 12th week of training.
Change in muscle strength of the knee extensor, hip flexor and forearm flexor muscles., Assessed isokinetically and isometrically via an IsoMed2000 test system., From baseline to the 12th week of training.|Change in endurance capacity, Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) assessed in a maximal incremental cycling test., From baseline to the 12th week of training.|Change in body composition, Assessed via bio-impedance measurement., From baseline to the 12th week of training|Change in quality of life, Assessed via the EORTC QLQ C30., From baseline to the 6th and 12th week of training.|Change in depression, Assessed via "Allgemeine Depressionsskala" (ADS)., From baseline to the 6th and 12th week of training.|Time of the first tumor progression under TKI therapy, Within the first 6 months of TKI therapy|Time of reduction or replacement of TKI therapy, Within the first 6 months of TKI therapy
