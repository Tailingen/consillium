Local recurrence-free survival, The time from date of treatment until date of first documented disease recurrence at a local site, assessed up to 5 years., up to 5 years|Regional recurrence-free survival, The time from date of treatment until date of first documented disease recurrence at a regional site, assessed up to 5 years., up to 5 years|Overall survival, The time from date of treatment until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years., up to 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, The time from date of treatment until date of first documented distant metastasis, assessed up to 5 years., up to 5 years|Locoregional failure patterns, The failures were categorized as occurring inside or outside the high dose target volume, depending on the location of Vrecur: "in field" if 95% of Vrecur was within the 95% isodose; "marginal" if 20% to 95% of Vrecur was within the 95% isodose, or "outside" if less than 20% of Vrecur was inside the 95% isodose., up to 5 years|Number of participants with acute toxicities, Number of participants with acute toxicities occurred during the chemoradiotherapy according to CTCAE4.0, during treatment|Number of participants with late toxicities, Number of participants with late toxicities occurred from 3 months after completion of radiotherapy to last follow-up visit according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria., up to 5 years|Changes of tumor volume, Changes of tumor volume before and after induction chemotherapy, 2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy|Relationship between treatment failure and dose received by target, Relationship between treatment failure and dose received by target, up to 5 years
Although concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. Besides, a common problem in locally advanced NPC is the narrow gap between the tumor and critical normal structures, which makes dose optimization difficult. Considering that significant tumor shrinkage may occur during induction chemotherapy, and incidences of distant metastases may be reduced by adjuvant chemotherapy, this study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of sequential chemoradiotherapy with regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil and reduced target delineation and radiation doses IMRT for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.
