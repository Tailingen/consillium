Impact of Circadian Rhythm on the Spread of Circulating Tumor Cells in Lung Cancer Patients
This is a prospective pilot study designed to demonstrate the impact of circadian rhythm on the spread of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in patients with Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer - NSCLC.

27 patients will be included in the study and will be followed for 12 months.

For each included patient, blood samples will be collected before the anticancer treatment initiation.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Blood samples will be collected at two times before the treatment initiation:
Presence of CTCs detected with the CellSearch technique., 12 months after the end of inclusions
Quantification of CTCs by the CellSearch technique and expressed in number of cells / millilitre of blood., 12 months after the end of inclusions|Quantification of CTCs by the ParSortix technique and expressed in number of cells / millilitre of blood., 12 months after the end of inclusions|Objective response defined as complete or partial response., Response will be assessed according to the clinician's judgment., 12 months after the end of inclusions|Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time between the date of inclusion and the date of first progression or death., 12 months after the end of inclusions
