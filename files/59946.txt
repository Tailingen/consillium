Outreach and Choice in Colorectal Cancer Screening
The primary objective of this clinical trial will be to compare overall colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation between an active choice (fecal immunochemical test \[FIT\] or colonoscopy) and a sequential choice (FIT offered first, then colonoscoscopy offered in those still unscreened) arm. Secondarily, we will (1) compare the proportions of FIT vs. colonoscopy per arm, (2) compare active choice vs FIT only in the initial 3 months of the study, (3) characterize changes in physician knowledge and attitudes regarding CRC screening before and after an educational seminar delivered at the launch of the initiative, (4) characterize perceptions regarding the effect of the intervention on clinical practices, and (5) compare detection rates of CRC, adenomas and SSLs per arm, and the operational results of the outreach program across arms.
