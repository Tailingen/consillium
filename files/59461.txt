Efficacy Study of AuroLase Therapy in Subjects With Primary and/or Metastatic Lung Tumors
This is an open-label, single-center, single-dose efficacy pilot study of AuroLase Therapy in the treatment of subjects with primary and/or metastatic tumors of the lung where there is airway obstruction. In this study patients will be given a systemic IV infusion of particles and a subsequent escalating dose of laser radiation delivered by optical fiber via bronchoscopy.
