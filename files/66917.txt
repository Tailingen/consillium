Spectrum Analysis in Ex-vivo Human Lungs
This study will analyze spectral features of the radiofrequency of lung tumors in ex-vivo human lungs. The resected specimens will be evaluated using the spectrum analysis to determine the localization rate of the targets. Ultrasound measurement and images will be used for correlation of TS mode image findings with pathology by using HE and IHC slides of lung tumor and lymph node.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Spectrum Analysis
To analyze the relationship of three spectral features of the radiofrequency of lung tumors in ex-vivo human lungs., From obtained ultrasound images, a linear regression line is quantified, and three ultrasonic spectral parameters including Midband-fit, Intercept, and Slope are calculated., Within an hour after resection.
To find the correlation of TS mode image findings with pathology by using lung tumor and lymph node samples., After evaluation, the actual tumor size and histological diagnosis will be determined. Differences between US image and pathological morphology will be determined by using HE and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) slides of lung tumor, the investigators will evaluate comparison of nucleus size in each tissue and the spectral parameters in each region of interest., Within an hour after resection|To clarify the feasibility of using the conventional EBUS scope to visualize solitary pulmonary nodules in an ex-vivo human lung., The bronchial stump of the specimen will be opened and a small sized endotracheal tube will be inserted to inflate and deflate the lung. After inflation of the lung, visualization of the tumor will be evaluated to see the difference in ultrasound images between deflated and inflated lung., Within an hour after resection
