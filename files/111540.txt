Detecting the Impact of Statin Therapy On Lowering Risk of Venous Thrombo-Embolic Events (DISOLVE)
Patients with cancer have a high risk of developing venous blood clots or thromboembolism (VTE). In an effort to target patients at highest risk of VTE for thromboprophylaxis (protective treatment for blood clots), numerous studies have identified serum biomarkers for risk of future VTE. There is also increasing evidence pointing to a prophylactic effect of statin therapy on the risk of developing VTE in high-risk populations including patients with advanced cancer. The purpose of this research study is to find out whether treatment with rosuvastatin (the study drug) reduces the risk of VTE in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. This study is specifically investigating the impact of rosuvastatin therapy on serum biomarkers (D-dimer and others) that indicate a risk for VTE, as well as safety and tolerance of rosuvastatin therapy in this population.

This is a phase II randomized crossover study with two 3-4 week treatment periods during which all enrolled patients will receive 20 mg of rosuvastatin once a day by mouth or a matching placebo tablet. Approximately two tablespoons of blood will be collected for biomarker analysis at the beginning and end of each treatment period. After the first treatment period there will be a 3-5 week break where subjects will undergo a washout. Following this washout period every subject will "crossover" or begin taking the alternative therapy so everyone enrolled will receive the study drug either during the first or the second treatment period. Biomarker levels will be analyzed in both treatment periods and compared to baseline, with every patient acting as their own control.
