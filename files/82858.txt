Precision Optical Guidance for Oral Biopsy
To learn if a new type of imaging device called the Active Biopsy Guidance System can help doctors to decide when and where to perform invasive biopsies of mouth lesions.
Oral Lesions
DEVICE: High Resolution Microendoscope (HRME)|DEVICE: Optical Mapping Scope|DRUG: Proflavine hemisulfate
To establish a preliminary estimate of the sensitivity and specificity of the Active Biopsy Guidance System with respect to histopathology, Through study completion an average of 1 year.
Primary objective:

-To evaluate and optimize the technical performance characteristics of an Active Biopsy Guidance System.

Secondary objective:

-To provide a preliminary estimate of the sensitivity and specificity of the Active Biopsy Guidance System with respect to histopathology. Optical imaging; optical projection of light onto tissue; optical contrast agent (proflavine).
