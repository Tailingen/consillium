Comparison of Nipple-areolar Complex Sensation According to Incision Types in Nipple-sparing Mastectomy
This study aims to assess nipple areolar complex sensation after nipple sparing mastectomy and compare the results according to different incisional approaches; specifically, inframammary fold (IMF) versus peri-areolar/radial. One-hundred-and-five post NSM patients from Oct 2019 to Nov 2021 have been recruited prospectively and evaluated for NAC sensory. A total of 97 patients (IMF 65 and peri-areolar/radial 32) were included in the analyses for comparison during follow up from 24 to 48 months after surgery. It was hypothesized that patients with IMF would have better outcomes for NAC senroy.
