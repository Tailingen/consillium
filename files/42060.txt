A Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) in Combination With FOLFIRI
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 when coadministered with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil, in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors resistant to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Folinic acid|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Irinotecan and Its Metabolite SN-38 From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] in Cycle 1, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose. Data presented are Geometric Least Squares (Geo LS) means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 1: 0, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours post-irinotecan infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized AUC(0-∞) of Irinotecan and Its Metabolite SN-38 in Cycle 2, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose. Data presented are Geo LS means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 2: 0, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours post-irinotecan infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Irinotecan and Its Metabolite SN-38 in Cycle 1, Dose-normalized Cmax was calculated from Cmax divided by the dose. Data presented are Geo LS means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 1: 0, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours post-irinotecan infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Cmax of Irinotecan and Its Metabolite SN-38 in Cycle 2, Dose-normalized Cmax was calculated from Cmax divided by the dose. Data presented are Geo LS means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 2: 0, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours post-irinotecan infusion
Pharmacokinetics: Cmax of Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B), Cycle 2: -2, -1, -0.5, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 25, 48, 72, 96, 168, 264, 336 hours post-ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) infusion|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Anti-Drug Antibodies (TE-ADA), Number of participants with positive treatment emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies was summarized by treatment group., Up To 2 Years
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 when coadministered with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil, in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors resistant to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.
