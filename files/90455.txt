A Phase I Study of CFT8919 in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of CFT8919 capsules in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying EGFR mutations. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CFT8919?
* Does CFT8919 demonstrate antitumor activity in these patients?

Participants will:

* Take CFT8919 capsules at different doses.
* Undergo regular assessments for safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response. Researchers will compare different dose levels to determine the best balance between safety and efficacy.

Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The occurrence of adverse events that prevent further dose escalation., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Safety and Tolerability, Assessed by the frequency, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., From the start of treatment until 28 days after the last dose|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The maximum observed concentration of the drug in plasma., Up to approximately 30 months|Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (Tmax), The time at which Cmax is observed, Up to approximately 30 months.|Half-Life (t1/2), The time required for the plasma concentration of the drug to decrease by half., Up to approximately 30 months
This is a Phase I clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of CFT8919 capsules in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who carry EGFR mutations. The study includes three parts: dose-escalation, dose-expansion, and cohort-expansion. The primary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the dose-escalation phase and to assess the antitumor efficacy in the cohort-expansion phase. Secondary objectives include assessing pharmacokinetic parameters, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Exploratory objectives will evaluate biomarkers and the relationship between drug exposure and treatment outcomes.
