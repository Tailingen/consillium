Regimen for the Treatment of Cachexia in Subjects With NSCLC
Cachexia is a presentation of a chronic manifestation of acute metabolic stress, a hypercatabolic nutritional state in which the normal fat and protein sparing mechanisms are not functioning and increased nutrition is not utilized.

To switch the nutritional system from a hypercatabolic to a normal nutritional state, therapy must block multi-factorial stress signaling a threshold of activation. Consistent with the synergistic hypothesis, propranolol and etodolac have been evaluated in subjects with advanced cancer demonstrating cachexia. This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VT-122 in subjects with NSCLC who have hypercatabolic cachexia.
Cachexia
DRUG: VT-122 low dose|DRUG: VT-122 high dose
Proportion of Subjects With a Positive Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Lean Body Mass, 4 weeks|Proportion of Subjects With a Positive Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Grip Strength, 4 weeks
The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and dose tolerability of VT-122 regimen and to evaluate the efficacy of VT-122 regimen

This trial is to be conducted on patients who have a diagnosis of Stage IV NSCLC, are not on chemotherapy, have lost 5% of their body weight in the previous 2 months and are deemed to be hypercatabolic.
