LAS41005 in Hyperkeratotic Actinic Keratosis
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAS 41005 compared to cryotherapy in subjects with moderate to severe hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (punch biopsies).
Actinic Keratosis
PROCEDURE: Cryotherapy|DRUG: LAS41005
Histological status (AK diagnosis and grade) of one predefined target lesion, Histological clearance at 8 weeks after end of treatment with LAS 41005, respectively 14 weeks after first cryotherapy. Histological Status will be measured by Histological Biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis of AK and the grade., Screening and 8 weeks after last treatment
Total Actinic keratoses (AK)lesion count at each visit, The clearance rate (complete/partial) of AK lesions (determined by clinical evaluation) in the treatment area (target areas A and B) will be measured by comparing the total AK lesion counts pre-treatment (on Day 1 before study treatment has been applied) with the lesion counts measured., day 1, day 21, day 42 and day 98.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAS 41005 compared to cryotherapy in subjects with moderate to severe hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (punch biopsies).
