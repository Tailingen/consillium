No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for relief. The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of asoprisnil 10 mg and 25 mg tablets, compared to placebo, administered daily for 12 months to women with abnormal uterine bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, by assessing whether asoprisnil administration prevents surgical and/or invasive intervention in the study population. Women, who meet the predefined uterine bleeding criteria for surgical and/or invasive intervention (hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization) who are willing to undergo surgical and/or invasive intervention if the study medication fails, will be enrolled in this study.
