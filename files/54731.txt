Multi-center Research Project for Glioma Molecular Pathology Intraoperative Rapid Detection
We explores the accuracy and sensitivity of rapid intraoperative detection of IDH, TERT, BRAF indicators through a prospective clinical multi-center study. This part includes a total of 300 fresh tissue samples, paired blood samples, relevant clinical information and follow-up information from 300 patients with different grades of adult glioma. By comparing with the postoperative sequencing results, the specificity and sensitivity of intraoperative IDH and TERT rapid detection results are clear.
