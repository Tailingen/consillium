Narrow Band Imaging Versus White Light for Colonoscopy Serrate Lesions Detection
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death and its' incidence is rising in most European countries. Colonoscopy has been shown to reduce CRC incidence, however its effectiveness depends on the sensitivity to detect pre-malignant lesions.

Our aim is to evaluate narrow band imaging (NBI) during colonoscopy and serum miRNAs as novel tools for the early detection of colonic sessile serrated lesions (SSL). The investigators will perform a multicenter-randomized-controlled-trial to study the role of NBI in SSL detection.
