PurIST Classification-Guided Adaptive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy by RNA Expression Profiling of EUS Aspiration Samples
This is an open-label, phase II study in patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

The study intervention involves molecular profiling Purity Independent Subtyping of Tumors (PurIST) subtyping of pretreatment Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS/FNA) samples to determine pancreatic cancer subtype. Neoadjuvant therapy is directed based on the molecular subtype (classical vs. basal). Patients with classical subtype will receive a standard chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) and patients with basal subtype will receive an alternative standard therapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel).
