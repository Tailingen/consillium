Novel Approaches for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention Compared to Contemporary Controls (BMT CTN 1203)
Acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This study aims to determine if any of three new GVHD prophylaxis approaches improves the rate of GVHD and relapse free survival at one year after transplant compared to the current standard prophylaxis regimen.

GVHD grade:

0: All organ stages 0 or GVHD not listed as an etiology I: Skin stage 1-2 and liver and GI stage 0 II: Skin stage 3 or liver or GI stage 1 III: Liver stage 2-3 or GI stage 2-4 IV: Skin or liver stage 4, Day 180 Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD is classified per 2005 NIH Consensus Criteria (Filipovich et al. 2005) into categories of severity: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Occurrence of chronic GVHD is defined as the occurrence of mild, moderate, or severe chronic GVHD per this classification., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Chronic GVHD Requiring Immunosupressive Therapy, Chronic GVHD is classified per 2005 NIH Consensus Criteria (Filipovich et al. 2005) into categories of severity: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Occurrence of chronic GVHD is defined as the occurrence of mild, moderate, or severe chronic GVHD per this classification. This endpoint considers the occurrence of chronic GVHD that necessitated initiation of immunosuppressive therapy for treatment., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Disease Relapse or Progression, Relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of acute leukemia or MDS consistent with pretransplant features, or radiologic evidence of lymphoma. Progression of disease applies to patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) not in remission prior to transplantation and is defined as increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM), TRM is defined as death without prior disease relapse or progression., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival is defined as being alive and free of disease relapse or progression., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With GVHD-free Survival, GVHD-free survival is defined as being alive without previous onset of Grade III-IV acute GVHD or chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy., 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival, 1 Year Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Neutrophil Recovery, Neutrophil recovery is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 500/mm\^3 for three consecutive measurements on three different days., Days 28 and 100 Post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Platelet Recovery, Platelet recovery is defined as the first day of a sustained platelet count \>20,000/mm\^3 with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days., Days 60 and 100 Post-transplant|Donor Cell Engraftment, Donor cell engraftment will be assessed with donor/recipient chimerism. Chimerism may be evaluated in bone marrow, whole blood, or CD3 fractions. Full donor chimerism is defined as the presence of ≥ 95% of donor cells as a proportion of total cells. Mixed chimerism is defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of total cells, of \< 95% but \> 5% in the bone marrow or peripheral blood. Full and mixed chimerism will be evidence of donor cell engraftment. Donor cells of ≤ 5% will be considered as graft rejection., Days 28 and 100 Post-transplant|Primary Cause of Death, 1 Year Post-transplant
GVHD is a complication that can occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. The transplant recipient's body is attacked by the newly introduced cells. Only about 40% of patients with acute GVHD have durable responses when treated with corticosteroid therapy. A strategy that helps fewer people suffer from GVHD, without other adverse effects, would be an effective approach to improve survival after allogeneic transplantation.

GVHD incidence can be decreased with various treatment plans. Early transplants were done using post-transplant methotrexate to prevent GVHD. Another drug, cyclosporine, was later shown to work better than methotrexate. Then doctors discovered that the combined use of cyclosporine and methotrexate worked even better than either agent alone. More recently, other calcineurin-inhibitors, such as tacrolimus have been developed as GVHD prophylactic agents due to favorable toxicity profiles in comparison with cyclosporine. Studies have been conducted to compare available treatment combinations for related and unrelated donors. The combination of tacrolimus/methotrexate remains a standard for GVHD prophylaxis.

However, improved GVHD prophylaxis remains a significant clinical need in HSCT. The current clinical trial will test three novel GVHD prophylaxis approaches: tacrolimus/methotrexate and bortezomib (Tac/MTX/Bort), tacrolimus/methotrexate and maraviroc (Tac/MTX/MVC) and tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide (Tac/MMF/Cy). This randomized Phase II clinical trial will compare each intervention arm with a Tac/MTX control.

This study will enroll people who have a cancer of the blood or lymph glands and a stem cell transplant is a treatment option. The study will take at least two years and will include 270 participants - 90 participants in each of three treatment groups. The purpose of this study is to compare three combinations of medications to see whether one or more of them are better than the current standard of care (Tacrolimus/Methotrexate) to prevent GVHD.
