Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Platinum Resistant|Recurrent Ovarian|HIPEC|Mitomycin|Cytoreductive Surgery
PROCEDURE: HIPEC
Progression-free survival (PFS), From randomization to time of first progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|cancer-specific survival, From randomization to the date of death due to ovarian cancer, assessed up to 5 years|Treatment-related adverse events, assessed by CTCAE ver.5.0, From randomization up to the end of treatment plus 6 weeks|Health-related quality of life (QLQ C30), assessed by EEuropean Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Score 30 (QLQ-C30), Over the 5 year surveillance period|Health-related quality of life (QLQ OV28), assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Ovarian Cancer Module (QLQ-OV28), Over the 5 year surveillance period|Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), assessed by the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L), Over the 5 year surveillance period|Cost-effectiveness analysis, assessed by Quality-Adjusted Live Years (QALYs), At time of completion of 5-year surveillance period
The objective of this trial (KOV-HIPEC-02R) is to prove the survival benefit of HIPEC with doxorubicin and mitomycin (trial arm) compared to physician-choice chemotherapy (control arm) in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
