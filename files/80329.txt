Expanded Activated Lymphocytes (EAL) as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With HCC at High Risk of Recurrence After Radical Resection
This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label pivotal phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAL as adjuvant therapy in preventing recurrence in patients with primary HCC at high recurrence risk after radical resection.

HCC, accounting for 80% of all liver cancers, is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Radical resection is considered as a curative strategy for patients with primary HCC. However, over 50% of patients experience recurrence after resection, resulting in a very low 5-year survival rate. EAL are ex vivo expanded and activated lymphocytes comprising mainly CD8+ T cells derived from patients' peripheral blood. This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label pivotal phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EAL in preventing recurrence in patients with primary HCC at high recurrence risk after radical resection. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20 doses of EAL (1×10\^9\~2×10\^10 per dose) infusion in combination of a single TACE or a single TACE only. Primary endpoint is the independent review committee-determined recurrence-free survival (from randomization to first recurrence or death from any cause). Secondary endpoints include overall survival, cancer-specific survival, adverse events and others.
