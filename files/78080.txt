Response of Brain Metastases After Gamma-Knife Radiosurgery Using Dynamic Susceptibility-weighted Contrast-enhanced Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging
This study is designed to evaluate whether advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI may be used to predict treatment response of brain metastasis after radiosurgery.
Brain Metastases
DEVICE: dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging
Time to local progression of each treated and evaluable brain metastasis, Tumor perfusion on DSC-PMR will be used as predictor for time to local tumor progression., At time of radiosurgery and after radiosurgery (approximately 1 week)
Radiation necrosis, Radiation necrosis will be defined by pathology, when available. When no pathology is available, clinical diagnosis based on clinical course and management will be used., Up to 1 year|Complete response, Complete response = no residue enhancing lesion on MRI, Up to 1 year|Elsewhere brain failure, Elsewhere brain failure = appearance of brain metastases outside of the prior radiosurgery region which can be diagnosed radiographically and does not required require pathological confirmation., Up to 1 year|Clinical deterioration, Clinical deterioration will be assessed based on the Karnofsky Performance scale (KPS).

* 100=Normal no complaints; no evidence of disease.
* 90=Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease.
* 80=Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.
* 70=Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work.
* 60=Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs.
* 50=Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care.
* 40=Disabled; requires special care and assistance.
* 30=Severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent.
* 20=Very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary.
* 10=Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly.
* 0=Dead, Up to 1 year
