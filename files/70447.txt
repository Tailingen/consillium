For subjects with palpable splenomegaly at baseline:

Improvement - no palpable splenomegaly during clinical treatment visits; No progress - ultrasound examination during clinical treatment visits shows an increase in spleen size of ≤ 25%; Progress - Ultrasound examination during clinical treatment visits shows an increase in spleen size of\>25%., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.]|Change of bone marrow pathology, Bone marrow histological remission defined as the presence of age-adjusted normocellularity and disappearance of trilinear hyperplasia, and absence of grade 1 reticulin fibrosis; no remission defined as the persistence of trilinear hyperplasia; progression defined as disease transformation into post-PV myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52|The incidence of major thrombotic events, To compare the incidence of major thrombotic events between the two groups., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|The incidence of major bleeding events, To compare the incidence of major bleeding events between the two groups., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|The incidence of progressing to acute leukemia, The incidence of progressing to acute leukemia will be compared between the two groups., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Change in Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form total symptom score, To compare the proportion of subjects that display change in Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form total symptom score (0-100 scores, higher scores mean a worse outcome) between different treatment groups., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Change of quality of life using QLQ-C30 V3.0 questionnaire., The QLQ-C30 V3.0 questionnaire consists of 30 questions, with questions 1-28 scoring 1-4 and questions 29 and 30 scoring 1-7. Therefore, this questionnaire has a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 126, and the score is directly proportional to the quality of life., From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Change of microcirculation disturbance, The rate of patients with improvement in microcirculation disturbance (such as pruritus, headache, dizziness, chest tightness, erythematous limb pain and limb paresthesia) will be compared between the two groups, From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Specific pre-defined toxicity, To compare incidence of specific pre-defined toxicity including fatigue, flu-like symptoms, dizziness, injection site necrosis, dyspnea, pain, depression, blurred Vision, insomnia, anorexia, weight Loss, weakness, pruritis, sweating, fever, decreased Libido, hot Flashes, flushing, infection,, From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.
Changes of T lymphocytes, Change in the proportion and gene expression profile of T lymphocytes, From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Changes of B lymphocytes, Change in the proportion and gene expression profile of B lymphocytes, From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.|Changes of dendritic cells, Change in the proportion and gene expression profile of dendritic cells, From the start of study treatment (Week 0) up to the end of Week 52.
Study purpose: To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon α-2b in combination with ruxolitinib versus pegylated interferon α-2b alone for treating hydroxyurea-resistant or hydroxyurea-intolerant polycythemia vera.

The subjects will be randomly divided into two groups:

pegylated interferon alpha-2b combined with ruxolitinib group: pegylated interferon alpha-2b at a starting dose of 180ug will be administered subcutaneously once a week; ruxolitinib at a starting dose of 10mg will be administered orally twice daily.

pegylated interferon alpha-2b group: pegylated interferon alpha-2b at a starting dose of 180ug will be administered subcutaneously once a week.

If complete hematologic remission is not achieved after 12 weeks of treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2b alone, the subject may be switched to the pegylated interferon alpha-2b combined with ruxolitinib group. If ruxolitinib is not tolerated, the subject may be switched to the pegylated interferon alpha-2b group alone.
