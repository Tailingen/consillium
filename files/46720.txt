A Study of Atezolizumab (Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 [PD-L1] Antibody) Alone or in Combination With an Immunomodulatory Drug and/or Daratumumab in Participants With Multiple Myeloma (MM)
This multicenter, open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab alone or in combination with daratumumab and/or various immunomodulatory agents in participants with MM who have relapsed or who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Cycle length will be 21 days in Cohorts A to C and 28 days in Cohorts D to F.
