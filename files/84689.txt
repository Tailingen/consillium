A Prospective Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Avastin® Bevacizumab (BEV) With or Without Microbubble-mediated Focused Ultrasound (FUS-MB) Using NaviFUS System in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients
This will be a prospective, randomized, standard of care (SoC) controlled, parallel, open-label, multicenter pivotal study to investigate the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab (BEV) in combination with or without microbubble (MB)-mediated FUS in patients with recurrent GBM. BEV represents the physician's best choice for the standard of care in rGBM after previous treatment with surgery (if appropriate), standard radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy, and with adjuvant temozolomide.

6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) of Bevacizumab (BEV) with or without microbubble-mediated focused ultrasound (FUS-MB) using NaviFUS System, PFS-6 will be estimated the proportion of patients who remain progression-free at the 6-month time point, based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria, from the time of randomization., Up to 6 months
12-month progression-free survival (PFS-12), PFS-12 will be estimated the proportion of patients who remain progression-free at the 12-month time point, based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria, from the time of randomization., Up to 12 months|Progression-free survival time (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic progression disease based on RANO Criteria, death, or last known follow-up due to any cause whichever occurs first. PFS will be followed continuously till the End-of-Study., Up to 62 weeks|One- and Two-year survival rates, One- and Two-year survival rates will be estimated the proportion of patients who remain alive at the one-year and two-year time points from the time of randomization., Up to 12 and 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of death or last known follow-up due to any cause whichever occurs first. OS will be followed continuously while subjects are on study and the survival follow-up phase of the study., Up to 36 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on a combination of imaging and clinical features as assessed by the RANO Criteria., Up to 62 weeks|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on a combination of imaging and clinical features as assessed by the RANO Criteria., Up to 62 weeks|Local disease control on the MRI Images, Local disease control is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a CR, PR, or SD within the planning target tumor lesion, as assessed by the RANO Criteria. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as the presence of at least two sequential CE-MRI scans, separated by a ≥ 4 weeks interval, exhibiting local tumor progression at the treatment site, with distant recurrence or new lesion(s) not included in the assessment. The target tumor lesion on the MRI images will be assessed at baseline and throughout treatment period., Up to 62 weeks|Corticosteroid consumption, Corticosteroid consumption will be assessed at baseline and throughout treatment period. The mean corticosteroid dosage prior to study treatment will be considered as the patient's baseline. The changes in corticosteroids during treatment will be compared to baseline., Up to 62 weeks|Severity and frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs), Documented and reported severity and frequency of AEs and/or SAEs will be assessed and classified based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 62 weeks|Karnofsky performance status (KPS), The KPS score is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents death, and 100 represents normalcy without complaints or evidence of disease. A higher score indicates the patient is better able to perform daily activities., Up to 62 weeks|Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is an 11-question measure that assesses multiple aspects of cognitive function. The maximum score is 30, with a higher score indicating less cognitive impairment., Up to 62 weeks
The study aims to compare the efficacy of combining Bevacizumab with NaviFUS System relative to Bevacizumab alone in patients with rGBM who have previously undergone radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy.

Any patient with a histological diagnosis of GBM who meets all of the specific eligibility criteria may participate in this study by signing informed consent in person or through their legal representative. Eligible patients will undergo a 2-week baseline observation screening period.

Up to 32 evaluable patients will be recruited in this study. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with one group receiving the standard of care (SoC) BEV alone and the other group receiving treatment with microbubble-mediated FUS treatment in addition to BEV (FUS-MB+BEV).

Eligible patients who assigned to the SoC group will follow the standard operating procedures of BEV (10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion over 30-90 minutes). On the other hand, eligible patients assigned to treatment group will initially receive the same BEV schedule. After at least 30 minutes, patients will be administered microbubbles (MB) (SonoVue® ) at a dose of 0.1 mL/kg, along with optimal ultrasound exposure doses determined by the acoustic emission feedback FUS power control algorithm of the NaviFUS System. The treatment will be administered every 2 weeks up to 34 weeks or until evidence of progression disease (PD), intolerable toxicity precluding further treatment, non- compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.
