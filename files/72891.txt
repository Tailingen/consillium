PET Imaging Targeting Granzyme B Predicts Immunotherapy Efficacy in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study aims to investigate the predictive value of PET imaging targeting granzyme B on the outcome of patients with diffuse large B lymphoma receiving immunotherapy.

The investigators will number all participants, create a medical record file, and record their basic information (gender, age) as well as contact information and medical history information. All participants will undergo 68Ga-grazytracer PET at baseline and after one course of immunotherapy (CAR-T, Glofitamab or iR2 ).
