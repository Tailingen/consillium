Personalised Risk-based Breast Cancer Prevention and Screening
This is a cohort study, applied research and T3 translational genomics to estimate the impact of genetic risk for breast cancer detection in the screening program. The study group base consists of 28 389 female participants, currently in the age-group 22-79, in the Biobank of Estonian Genome Centre. The study is aimed to demonstrate the usability of personalised approach for adjusting and stratifying screening recommendations, based on predicted genetic risk estimates for breast cancer in the situation, where the genome data could be available from all women who have given informed consent for that. The project includes both the detection of moderate and high hereditary breast cancer risk carriers as well as high risk polygenic risk-score (consisting several single nucleotide polymorphisms) carriers among healthy individuals for application of personalised prevention and screening strategies.
