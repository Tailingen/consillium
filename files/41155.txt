High-intensity Exercise After Treatment
This pilot study tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week, 3-arm pilot exercise trial in which 45 breast cancer survivors will be randomized to high-intensity interval training (HIIT; n=15), moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD; n=15), or Usual Care (UC; n=15).

Participation Rate, Sample size / \[1-(#ineligible/# exposed to recruitment)\*(#exposed to recruitment)\], Baseline|Adherence to the exercise programs, average number of exercise sessions (out of 24) attended, post-intervention (Week 9)|Compliance of the exercise programs, average number of exercise sessions (out of 24) in which the prescribed exercise duration and intensity are achieved, post-intervention|Acceptability of the exercise programs, satisfaction with the exercise program as measured by a satisfaction survey. Survey uses a 5-point Likert-type scale. Satisfaction for each item is defined as reporting 4-5 on the scale (i.e., somewhat agree or completely agree)., post-intervention|Change in executive function processing, Change in completion time on Trails B task, with higher values indicating lower executive function., Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)|Change in cognitive flexibility, Change in reaction time on Task-switch task, with higher values indicating lower cognitive flexibility, Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)|Change in spatial working memory reaction time, Change in reaction time on spatial working memory task, with faster reaction times indicating better spatial working memory, Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)
Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Change in Peak VO2 as measured by a modified Balke treadmill graded exercise test protocol., Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)|Carotid arterial wall thickness, will be estimated from vascular ultrasound and expressed as average and maximum mm, Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)|Endothelial function, estimated from brachial artery flow mediated dilation and expressed as percent change in brachial artery diameter relative to baseline diameter, Baseline, post-intervention (Week 9)
Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program compared with a standard moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD) program in 45 breast cancer survivors prescribed aromatase inhibitors.

Aim 2: Calculate effect sizes associated with the 8-week HIIT program, compared with MOD and Usual Care (UC), on cognitive and cardiovascular functions in 45 breast cancer survivors.

Eligible individuals will be women diagnosed with Stages I-IIIa breast cancer, have completed primary treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy), and currently prescribed an aromatase inhibitor. The specific aims are: 1) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program compared with a standard moderate-intensity (MOD) program; and 2) Calculate effect sizes associated with the 8-week HIIT program, compared with MOD and usual care (UC), on cognitive and cardiovascular functions. Cognitive function is operationalized as performance on executive function and working memory tasks. Cardiovascular function is operationalized as exercise capacity (VO2peak, heart rate recovery), resting function (heart rate, blood pressure), and cardiovascular structure/function (arterial stiffness, arterial wall thickness, endothelial function). Associations between change in cardiovascular outcomes and change in cognitive outcomes across the intervention period will also be explored.
