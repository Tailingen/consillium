GDC-0084 With Radiation Therapy for People With PIK3CA-Mutated Solid Tumor Brain Metastases or Leptomeningeal Metastases
This study will test the safety of the study drug, GDC-0084, in combination with radiation therapy in people who have solid tumor brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. All participants will have cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. The researchers will test increasing doses of GDC-0084 to find the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects in participants. The study will also try to find out if the combination of the study drug with radiation is effective against participants' cancer.
Brain Metastases|Leptomeningeal Metastasis
DRUG: GDC-0084|RADIATION: whole brain radiation therapy radiation
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Four dose levels will be examined and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified.

The standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme for this study is as follows. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3. For any given dose an initial cohort of 3 patients will be treated at that dose.The dose level will be escalated if none of the 3 exhibits any dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., 1 year
local recurrence rate, For patients with brain metastases, response determination will be determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases criteria28. For patients with leptomeningeal metastases, response assessment will be determined by investigator based on MRI., 1 year
