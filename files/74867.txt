Detection and Prevention of Cancer-Related Cardiovascular Toxicity Registry
This study is being done in order to assess the cardiovascular events known as cardiovascular toxicity of chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy protocols in cancer subjects to identify risk prediction, prevention and treatment of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction
