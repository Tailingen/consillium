Phase I Trial to Investigate Cafusertib Hydrochloride Monotherapy in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
A Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of Cafusertib Hydrochloride in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Neoplasms
DRUG: Cafusertib Hydrochloride
MTD of cafusertib based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities, 4 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, 6 weeks|Incidence and intensity of Adverse Events according to Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs (CTCAE version 4.0), 6 weeks|Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), 4 weeks|Max concentration (Cmax) of cafusertib, 3 weeks|AUC of cafusertib, 3 weeks|Elimination half-life(T1/2) of cafusertib, 3 weeks
To investigate safety, tolerability of cafusertib in Chinese patients with Advanced Solid Tumors that are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of cafusertib will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cafusertib in advanced cancer patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of cafusertib will be observed in advanced cancer patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase II.
