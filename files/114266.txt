A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CLL1 and CD38 Dual-Target CAR-T Cell Injection in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CLL1 and CD38 dual-target CAR T cell injection in r/r AML subjects.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: CLL1 and CD38 Dual-Target CAR-T Cell Injection
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Rate, Proportion of subjects with DLT within 28 days after infusion of CLL1/CD38 dual-target CAR-T cell injection., 28 days|Adverse Events （AEs）, Proportion of subjects experiencing AE within 96 weeks after infusion of CLL1/CD38 dual-target CAR-T cell injection., 96 weeks
Complete Remission Rate (CRc), Proportion of subjects achieving CR + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) +CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) (Patients achieving CRh are no longer repeatedly recorded as CRi)., 96 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects achieving CR+CRi+CRh+MLFS+PR., 96 weeks|MRD negative rate and MRD negative duration, MRD negative proportion and MRD negative duration in CR/CRh/CRi subjects were measured by qPCR and/or flow cytometry., 96 weeks|Duration of Remission（DOR）, The time from CR/CRh/CRi first assessed to disease recurrence or death from any cause., 96 weeks|Event-free Survival (EFS), The time from receiving CAR-T cell infusion to treatment failure, disease relapse, or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., 96 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), The time from cell infusion to death from any cause was calculated., 96 weeks|Indicators of proliferation and survival in vivo, The number of CAR gene copies and CAR-T cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood after receiving CAR-T cell infusion., 96 weeks|Anti-drug Antibodies, Proportion of subjects who developed anti-drug antibodies in peripheral blood after CAR-T cell injection infusion., 96 weeks
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase I dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CLL1 and CD38 dual-target CAR T cell injection in r/r AML subjects.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of CLL1 and CD38 dual - target CAR - T cell injection in the treatment of r/r AML and the study contains two phases with the first phase adopting an ATD design and the second phase adopting a 3+3 design.
