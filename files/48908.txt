Participants participated in the screening period visit, and received HER2-PET and 18 F-FDG PET/CT examinations before receiving tumor treatment, after receiving 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and after disease progression. Patients of first-line received docetaxel combined with trastuzumab±pertuzumab regimen, and patients of second-line received T-DM1 monotherapy or capecitabine combined with pyrrotinib regimen.
