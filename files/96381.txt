Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec In Children With Advanced Non CNS Tumors
This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of intralesional talimogene laherparepvec administration in pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection
Advanced Non CNS Tumors
DRUG: Talimogene Laherparepvec
Percentage of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), All toxicities were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0:

* Grade 1: Mild
* Grade 2: Moderate
* Grade 3: Severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening
* Grade 4: Life-threatening
* Grade 5: Death related to adverse event

The occurrence of any of the below was considered a DLT, if judged to be related to talimogene laherparepvec:

* Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity
* Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity that lasted \> 3 days despite optimal supportive care
* Any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if medical intervention was required, the abnormality led to hospitalization or the abnormality persisted for \> 1 week unless deemed not clinically important per both investigator \& sponsor
* Febrile neutropenia grade 3/4
* Thrombocytopenia \< 25 x 10\^9/L associated with bleeding event that required intervention
* Serious herpetic event
* Grade 5 toxicity
* Any intolerable toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of talimogene laherparepvec, Day 1 to Day 35
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per modified immune-related response criteria simulating Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRC-RECIST) response criteria.

CR was defined as the disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not and whether baseline or new) and confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks (28 days) from the date first documented. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.

PR was defined as the decrease in tumor burdena ≥ 30% relative to baseline confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks (28 days) after first documentation., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of an initial response of CR or PR to the earlier of PD/death., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was defined as the number of days from the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec to the first objective assessment of response as per modified irRC-RECIST., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec until objective tumor progression per irRC-RECIST.

TTP was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose to the earlier of disease progression per modified irRC-RECIST or death from any cause.

PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as as the time from first dose to the event of death from any cause.

OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up; maximum duration of follow-up was 54.51 months
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical setting. Approximately 18 - 24 pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled and treated with at least 1 dose of talimogene laherparepvec into 2 cohorts stratified by age. DLT will be evaluated based on at least 9 DLT-evaluable subjects in cohort A1. The DLT evaluation period is 35 days from the initial administration of talimogene laherparepvec.
