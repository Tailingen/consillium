Maintenance Pembrolizumab at Usual or Low doSE in Non-squamous Lung Cancer: a Non-inferiority Study
Pulse is a randomized non-inferiority phase III clinical trial assessing a new mode of immunotherapy administration based on increased interval time between 2 infusions as maintenance treatment in Pulse arm compared with the conventional administration in Control arm.

In both treatment arms, pembrolizumab alone or combined with pemetrexed is allowed as maintenance treatment. Indeed :

In Pulse arm : Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered to patients every 6 weeks (Q6W) plus, in the absence of contra-indication pemetrexed 500 mg/m\^2 will be administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).

In control arm : Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered to patients every 3 weeks (Q3W) or 400 mg every 6 weeks plus,in the absence of contra-indication pemetrexed 500 mg/m\^2 will be administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).
Metastatic Non-squamous Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q6W|DRUG: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 Q3W|DRUG: Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W
Overall survival, defined as the time elapsed between the date of randomization and the date of death whatever the cause. Patients alive at the date of last follow-up will be censored at that date., 6 years
Progression-free survival, defined by the time between the randomization date and the date of observation of a progression of the disease according to RECIST 1.1 or death of the patient (all causes combined) or date of last follow-up if the patient is alive without progression or lost to follow up., 6 years|Duration of response between both treatment arms., Duration of response among patients who had a response (CR/PR) after the 4 induction cycles. It is defined by the time between first response observed (i.e. randomization date) and first event observed (progression, secondary malignancy or death in case of no previous progression)., 6 years|Assessment of quality of life between both treatment arms via the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire., Patient reported outcomes via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).

The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of cancer subjects and is the most widely used cancer-specific HRQoL instrument. It contains 30 items and measures five functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact) and global health and quality of life. The global health and quality of life scale uses a 7-point scale scoring with anchors (1=very poor and 7=excellent); the other items are scored on a 4 point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3= quite a bit, 4=very much)., 6 years|Assessment of quality of life between both treatment arms via the EORTC QLQ-LC13 questionnaire., Patient reported outcomes via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13).

The EORTC QLQ-LC13 covers 13 typical symptoms of lung cancer patients, such as coughing, pain, dyspnea, sore mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss. It is scored on a 4 point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much)., 6 years|Assessment of quality of life between both treatment arms via the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire., Patient reported outcomes via the 5-level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire).

The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of five health state dimensions include the following: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a five-point scale from 1 (extreme problem) to 5 (no problem). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a graded (0 = The worst health you can imagine, to 100 = The best health you can imagine) vertical visual analog scale on which the subject rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment., 6 years|Treatment tolerance in both treatment arms, Frequency of adverse events according to CTCAE V5, 6 years|Economic evaluation, An important cost reduction per patient associated to treatment de-escalation is expected. We will compare the costs between the two arms. Time horizon extends from randomization to the date of last follow-up.

Direct medical costs will be estimated from the French national health insurance perspective (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS)., 6 years|Population pharmacokinetic analysis in both arms (primary objective), The primary objective of the PK study will be to evaluate the systemic exposition (Ctrough) of pembrolizumab in both arms., 6 years|Population pharmacokinetic analysis in both arms (secondary objective), The secondary objective of the PK study will be to use the clearance evolution of the pembrolizumab as marker of the response to explore the potential correlation between clearance evolution and the survival., 6 years|Evaluate the saturation of PD-1 on circulating lymphocytes in both arms, Calculate the % of saturation of PD-1 on fresh circulating lymphocytes at baseline and during treatment in both arms., 6 years|Evaluate the target engagement pharmacodynamics (PD) in both arms, Target engagement pharmacodynamics (PD) will be assayed using the interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation ratio at baseline and during treatment in both arms., 6 years
