Niraparib In Recurrent IDH 1/2 Gliomas
This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label, phase 0 trial to assess intratumoral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of niraparib in subjects with progressive IDH1 or IDH2 mutant glioma.

- This research study involves an experimental treatment called Niraparib.

Patients alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation up to 5 years|Median Overall Survival, calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-Rank test will be conducted to compare between the study arms, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive up to 5 years|Duration of Overall Response, ORR will be calculated as the proportion of patients that are determined to be CR, PR or SD, one month from start of treatment (Arm A only) and 2, 4, 6 and 12 months out from start of treatment after surgery up to 5 years|Response Rate in subjects with recurrent glioma after 1 month of treatment, measured by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group for low-grade gliomas, 1 month|Response Rate in subjects with residual glioma after surgery, measured by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group for low-grade gliomas (only in patients with subtotal resection), Up to 5 years|D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels by MRS, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels by MRS, before and one-month post treatment with niraparib up to 3 months|Genomic profile, assessed by whole exome sequencing (WES) performed on resected tumor, Up to 5 years
This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label, phase 0 trial to assess intratumoral pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of niraparib in subjects with progressive IDH1 or IDH2 mutant glioma.

* This research study involves an experimental treatment called Niraparib.
* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.
* Participants will be randomized into one of two groups

  * Arm A: 1 cycle of Niraparib, followed by surgery, followed by up to 12 cycles of niraparib.
  * Arm B: Surgery followed by up to 12 cycles of niraparib

Participants will receive study treatment for up to 12 Cycles (1 cycle is 28 days long) and will be followed for up to 5 years after the study treatment.

It is expected that about 16 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Pilot Study to investigate the study drug's (niraparib) activity in tumor tissue. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved niraparib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
