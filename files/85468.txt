Decitabine Combining Modified CAG Followed by HLA Haploidentical Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Infusion for Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia(AMLï¼‰
Demethylating agent decitabine enhances the immunogenicity of leukemia cells by inducing the expression of cancer testis antigens (CTAs),MHC class I and II molecules,costimulatory molecules and adhesion molecules. The leukemias cells treated by decitabine will become more sensitive to the following adoptive T cell therapy.
