18F-NaF-PET/MR vs 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT to Detect Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients.
The number of metastases in a patient with primary or recurrent prostate cancer has major prognostic implication.

The purpose is to compare, in a pilot study, the diagnostic performance of 18F-NaF-PET/MR with respect to the results of the scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT (routine exam) for determining the presence or absence of bone lesions in prostate cancer patient, with up to five metastases (oligo-bone metastatic) based on scintigraphy 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT. The gold standard will be a combination of clinical follow-up, additional imaging and biopsy, as indicated by the multidisciplinary discussion at the tumor board. The findings from whole-body 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF-PET/MR, and the combination of the 2 modalities will be categorized by 2 teams of 2 readers as benign or probably benign, equivocal, or malignant or probably malignant and compared with the results of follow-up for JAFROC and ROC analysis.

Compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-NaF-PET/MR scanning to that of whole body 99mTc-MDP-SPECT/CT for detecting cancer that has spread to the bone (bone metastasis), the primary measure will be differences in the area under the curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves that will be generated from the interpretations of each technology., through study completion, an average of 2 years
To assess differences in sensitivity and specificity in detecting bone metastases between the two imaging modalities., Sensitivity and specificity of PET and SPECT for the detection of secondary bone lesions (gold standard: clinical and imaging follow up), through study completion, an average of 2 years|To determine the number of equivocal and diagnostic tests resulting from the two imaging modalities., rate of equivocal/non equivocal findings for the two modalities, through study completion, an average of 2 years
