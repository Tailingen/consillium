Capsule Endoscopy in Iron Deficiency Anaemia
This project aim to investigate whether wireless capsule endoscopy(WCE) has a similar diagnostic yield as conventional endoscopy in detecting the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA)
Iron Deficiency Anemia|Bowel Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopy
Diagnostic yield, Mucosal lesions detected, 90 minutes
Small bowel lesions, Number of lesions detected in the small bowel, 90 minutes|Complete examination, Proportion of complete examinations, 90 minutes|Bowel preparation, Proportion of satisfactory bowel preparation, 90 minute|Adequate examinations, Proportion of adequate examinations defined as both satisfactory bowel preparation and complete examination, 90 minutes
IDA is common and 90-95% of cases are caused by bleeding from ulcers, tumours or vascular malformations in the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine or the large bowel.Bleeding from more than one localisation is common.

International guidelines recommend bidirectional endoscopy(gastro- and colonoscopy) to detect and treat the source of bleeding.

Our hypothesis is that WCE is non-inferior to the combination of gastroscopy and colonoscopy in locating GI-bleeding and that complete examinations will be achieved in â‰¥90% of the examinations.
