Phase I Study of sss40 Injection for Moderate-to-Severe Bone Metastatic Cancer Pain
This is a Phase Ib/IIa, multicenter, sequential clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of SSS40 injection in patients with moderate-to-severe bone metastatic cancer pain. The study includes two stages: a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase Ib followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIa.
Cancer Pain
DRUG: Injection of humanized nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) Events (NCI-CTCAE V5.0), All adverse events occurring during the entire study period will be assessed and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0), Up to Day 85
Pain intensity maximum change from baseline (NRS), The mean change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score from baseline within 12 weeks, Week 12
The study consists of two sequential phases:

Phase Ib - Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion:

This phase is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial involving single-dose administration of SSS40 injection. Patients will be enrolled into sequential dose cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of escalating doses of SSS40. Based on observed adverse events, particularly dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and PK data, the sponsor and investigators will determine whether adjustments to the dose escalation scheme (e.g., dosing interval, cohort size) are needed or if additional unplanned dose levels should be added. Following initial dose-escalation, a dose-expansion cohort will be conducted at the selected dose level to further characterize safety and gather additional preliminary efficacy data.

Phase IIa - Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial:

After sufficient safety and efficacy data are obtained from Phase Ib, the sponsor and investigators may proceed to Phase IIa. This phase will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK of SSS40 injection in patients with moderate-to-severe bone metastatic cancer pain. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either SSS40 injection or placebo, and outcomes including pain intensity, analgesic use, and quality of life measures will be evaluated.
