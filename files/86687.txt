Single vs Multi-fraction SRS Patients on Immunotherapy
This study is meant to compare different surgical approaches to brain cancer.

Multi-Fraction SRS superiority compared to single fraction SRS, To determine if Multi-Fraction SRS will decrease the rate of radionecrosis when compared to single-fraction SRS for patients with small metastases and are on immunotherapy., 4 years
Target metastasis progression, Target metastasis progression will be assessed using adapted Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) consensus imaging criteria. In brief, progressive disease is defined as a â‰¥20% relative increase in the longest diameter (LD) of the target metastasis compared to its smallest LD recorded on study, with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm, 4 years|Overall Survival Rate, Time from randomization to death, 4 years|Acute CTCAE v5.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities, Any acute CTCAE v5.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities, within 90 days of SRS completion (toxicity must be specified)., 4 years|Late CTCAE v5.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities, Any late CTCAE v5.0 CNS Grade 2+ and Grade 3+ toxicities, greater than 90 days from SRS completion (toxicity must be specified)., 4 years|rate of individual metastases radionecrosis, To compare the rates over time of individual metastases radionecrosis using a parametric survival analysis, 4 years|rate of individual metastases rates of edema, To compare rates over time of individual metastases rates of edema using a parametric survival analysis., 4 years|Rates of Symptomatic Edema, To compare rates of symptomatic edema at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.1, 1 year|Time to any distant intracranial failure, Time to any distant intracranial failure (ie, appearance of brain metastasis at untreated site)., 4 years|Time to initiation of any combination, Time to initiation of any combination of death, salvage SRS, WBRT, or neurosurgical resection for intracranial failure., 4 years
