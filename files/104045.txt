Study of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Following CCRT in the Treatment of Patients With Cervical Carcinoma
A Phase I trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and effectiveness of cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus TIL in treating patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA cervical carcinoma.
Cervical Carcinoma
DRUG: CCRT+TIL
Toxicity Evaluation, Patients will be monitored for clinical toxicity by by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events., From chemo-radiotherapy start until Day30 after TIL infusion|Feasibility of CCRT in combination with TIL successful infusion, Number of patients receiving a complete TIL infusion, 30 days after start of TIL-ACT infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease response evaluated after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy and TIL treatment. Achievement of complete response, partial response., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease response evaluated after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy and TIL treatment. Achievement of complete response, partial response or stable disease., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months|Disease control time (DCT), Duration from complete response, partial response or stable disease to progression., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months|Immunological correlates to tumor response, Post-hoc exploratory analyses for immunological correlates to tumor response., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was the standard treatment for locoregionally advanced cervical cancer, while the incidence of treatment failure is still high. Adjuvant chemotherapy or inducing chemotherapy addition to CCRT did not significantly improve patient survival compared to CCRT alone. Hence, there is a need for novel therapies to improve survival for these patients.

Accumulating evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) selected for tumor recognition and greatly expanded in vitro are effective for treating cervical cancer patients.

This is a phase I trial to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity and effectiveness of cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus TIL in treating patients with FIGO stage IIIA to IVA cervical carcinoma.
