Evaluation of PD-L1 Expression and Immune Infiltration in High-risk Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a high rate of recurrence (60 to 70%) and progression (20 to 30%) to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

The local immunotherapy (intra-vesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)) reduces significantly the risk of recurrence and progression as compared to observation or to intra-vesical chemotherapy.

Systemic immunotherapy with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) or Programmed cell Death 1 (PD1) inhibitors has shown major efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed on platinum-based regimens of chemotherapy, or even in front line setting. In the field of NMIBC, immunotherapy using PD-L1 or PD1 inhibitors is under investigation but the frequency of PD-L1 expression has rarely been precisely described in the different subtypes.

The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the expression of PD-L1 by different types of NMIBC.

The secondary objective is to characterize the immune contexture of NMIBC.
Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Samples of bladder tissue
PD-L1 status (positive or negative) of the tumor and tumor associated immune cells., PD-L1 status will be considered positive if more than 25% of tumor cells exhibit membrane staining or immune cells present (ICP) \>1% and immune cells (IC)+ \>25% or ICP=1% and IC+ = 100%.

PD-L1 status will be considered negative if none of the criteria for PD-L1 positive status are met., Day 1
Descriptive analysis of the differential expression of all the following immune biomarkers in normal bladder tissue, NMIBC (Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer) and MIBC (Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer)., Descriptive statistics will be performed from clinical characteristics as mean values for categorical variables, or medians (range) for non-normal continuous variables., Day 1|Association of immune profile with recurrence and progression rates, Association between all variables will be analysed with t-test, Mann Whitney or ANOVA multiple comparison test. Correlation analysis will be performed with Ï‡2 and Fischer exact test. Results will be considered significant if the p-value is \<0.05., Day 1

The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the expression of PD-L1 by different types of NMIBC.

The secondary objective is to characterize the immune contexture of NMIBC. The immunological contexture of NMIBC in comparison with normal bladder tissue and invasive bladder cancer will be deciphered. The objective is to determine immune signatures associated with response or relapse/progression, with and without immune treatments in NMIBC.
