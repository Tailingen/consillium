A Study of Oprozomib, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Adults With Primary Refractory or Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of the Phase 1 part of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and assess the safety, tolerability and activity of oprozomib in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in adults with primary refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

The purpose of the Phase 3 part of the study is to compare the efficacy for adults with primary refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who are randomized to either oprozomib or placebo in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or ≥ 90% decrease in serum M-protein with urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hrs. If disease measurable only by serum FLC (SFLC), ≥ 90% decrease in dFLC.

CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM). Normal SFLC ratio if disease measurable only by SFLC.

sCR: As for CR, and absence of clonal plasma cells in BM., Disease response was assessed every 4 weeks for the first 18 months and then every 8 weeks for the remainder of study treatment; median duration of treatment was 7.6, 28.0, 32.1, 46.3, and 17.4 weeks in each treatment group, respectively.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of minimal response (MR) per modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria, or PR, VGPR, CR, or sCR as determined by the investigator according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC).

MR:

* ≥ 25% but \< 49% reduction in serum M-protein and a 50 - 89% reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein, which still exceeds 200 mg per 24 hours

This was a phase 1b/3, multicenter study composed of 2 parts: part 1 was a phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion component and part 2 was to have been a phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized component. Part 2 was not conducted.

The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study followed a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. For each of the 2 schedules, groups of 3 to 6 patients were enrolled. The starting doses of oprozomib were 150 and 210 mg in the 5/14 and 2/7 schedules, respectively. The starting dose of pomalidomide was 4 mg in both schedules. As long as \< 33% of patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in a given cohort, the dose of oprozomib was escalated in 30-mg increments for successive cohorts.

Once the recommended dose and schedule for the expansion phase had been selected, additional participants were enrolled in the dose expansion portion of part 1 to continue the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the regimen and determine the recommended phase 3 dose. Enrollment was halted during the dose expansion phase and part 2 was not conducted.
