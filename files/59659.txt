'This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and safety of Olaparib maintenance with Bevacizumab and Pembrolizumab in subjects with platinum-sensitive who have received prior of platinum-based chemotherapy. The study will assess the effectiveness of progression-free survival(6 months PFS rate) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The subject will be treated to until disease progression as below:

* Maintenance : Olaparib 300mg (twice daily \[BID\])
* Pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) from 2nd infusion for up to 35 infusions
* Bevacizumab 15mg/kg or 7.5mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W)
