A Pilot Study of Liver Protection Using Prednisone for Patients Receiving Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Patients on this study will self administer Prednisone for three days before starting Radiation Therapy (RT) and continue to take 60 mg/day during the first three fractions of RT.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Prednisone
Mitigation of liver inflammation as reflected by sTNFR1 levels, Measuring whether sTNFR1 level is attenuated following prednisone treatment, given before and during radiation therapy for HCC patients who are at high risk of radiation induced liver toxicity. sTNFR1 levels will be summarized descriptively at each time point as absolute values and change from baseline (prior to taking prednisone). Longitudinal regression models will be used to test whether mean changes over time are statistically significant. Treatment with prednisone will be considered successful if it causes a decrease in the level of sTNFR1 of 50%, which would be predicted to decrease toxicity by 15%., at baseline, day of first RT fraction, day of 3rd RT fraction and at 1-, 3- and 6-months post commencing radiation therapy
Estimating the safety of the steroid treatment, Define steroid administration protocol based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5 adverse events attributable to the study drug and experienced within the first 6 weeks of study treatment. These will be assessed via NCI's CTCAE version 5.0. Toxicity rates for patients on this study will be compared to a propensity matched historical control cohort of recently treated patients at UM who were not treated with prednisone., up to 6 weeks from start of study treatment|Percent of patients who complete of the proposed steroid treatment, Successful completion of steroid treatment., up to 6 weeks from start of study treatment|Evaluate whether steroid treatment reduces radiation-induced liver toxicity, Rate of liver decompensation (as measured by worsening in ALBI score\>0.5) or grade 3-5 GI bleeding during the subsequent 6 months following radiation treatment. The former are laboratory values that are already collected as part of standard of care. The latter will be assessed via the NCI CTCAE version 5., up to 6 weeks from start of study treatment|Assess whether steroids have a durable ability to attenuate the level of inflammation as reflected by sTNFR1 level, Determining the mitigation of the inflammatory state, as reflected by biomarkers previously proposed in the literature to correlate with radiation-induced liver injury., up to 6 months from start of study treatment|Assess tumor response, assessing tumor response as part of standard of care to determine response rate, up to 6 months from start of study treatment
Patients on this study will self administer Prednisone for three days before starting Radiation Therapy (RT) and continue to take 60 mg/day during the first three fractions of RT.
