Safety and Efficacy Study of Pazopanib and MK 3475 in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC; KEYNOTE-018)
This is an open-label, 2 part study of pazopanib and/or MK 3475 in treatment naïve subjects with advanced RCC. Part 1 consists of a Phase I dose escalation of pazopanib + MK 3475 followed by an expansion cohort to determine the maximum tolerated regimen and the recommended Phase II dose. Part 2 is a randomized 3-arm Phase II study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of pazopanib + MK 3475 as compared to single-agent pazopanib and single-agent MK 3475. The objectives of this Phase I/II study are to test the safety and tolerability of pazopanib in combination with MK 3475, and study the clinical efficacy of pazopanib in combination with MK 3475 in subjects with advanced RCC as compared with single-agent pazopanib and single-agent MK 3475.

Following the Urgent Safety Measure (USM) released on February 09, 2017, the phase II (Part 2) portion of this study will not commence.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Pazopanib|DRUG: MK-3475
Part 1: Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs ), From the start of study treatment (first dose) and, until the post-treatment follow-up visit (at least 30 days after the last dose of investigational product) for AEs, and until 90 days after last dose for SAEs|Part 1: To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated regimen (MTR), MTR is defined as the highest dose of pazopanib in combination with the highest dose of MK 3475 at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT after a minimum of 8 weeks of treatment. DLT is defined as a drug-related AE starting in the first 8 weeks of treatment, 8 weeks|Part 1: Number of subjects with permanent discontinuation of treatment, dose reductions, interruptions, or delays, 24 months|Part 1: Change from baseline in laboratory parameters, Laboratory assessments include haematology, clinical chemistry, urine, coagulation and thyroid function test, Average of 4 years|Part 1: Change from baseline in vital signs, Vital sign measurements will include heart rate, temperature and blood pressure, 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Part 1: Change from baseline in cardiac parameters, Cardiac assessments will include Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Echocardiograms (ECHOs), 24 months|Part 1: Incidence and titer of anti MK 3475 antibodies, Subjects will be monitored for anti-MK 3475 antibodies throughout the study, 24 months|Part 2: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earlier date of disease progression (using RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause., Average of 4 years
Part 1: Dose escalation cohorts: pazopanib plasma concentrations and serum MK 3475 concentrations., For analysis of plasma pazopanib and serum MK 3475 concentrations, blood samples will be collected from all subjects, For Pazopanib: before and after the 1st and 2nd dose of MK-3475. For MK-3475: Until 6 months after the last dose of MK-3475|Part 1: Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in Expansion cohort, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hrs (AUC\[0-24\], maximum observed concentration (Cmax), tmax, and concentration at 24 hours (C24) of pazopanib; Pre-dose (trough) concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctau), and apparent clearance following oral dosing CL/F of pazopanib will be determined if data permit., For Pazopanib: before and after the 1st and 2nd dose of MK-3475. For MK-3475: Until 6 months after the last dose of MK-3475|Part 1 and Part 2: Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects, who achieved either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST, Average of 4 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate is defined as a confirmed response of CR or PR or at least 6-months stable disease by RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST., Average of 4 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Time to response, Time to response is defined for all subjects with a confirmed CR or PR as per RECIST v1.1as the time from randomization until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first), Average of 4 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Duration of response, Duration of response is defined for all subjects with confirmed CR or PR as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until time of first documented disease progression or death due to any causes, whichever is first by RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST, Average of 4 years|Part 2: PFS by modified RECIST, Average of 4 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Progression-free survival rate at 18 months (PFSR18), PFSR18 will be calculated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of Progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months by RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST, 18 months|Part 2: Overall survival (OS) at 18 months, Overall survival at 18 months will be summarized based on the Kaplan-Meier method., 18 months|Part 2: Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Average of 4 years|Part 2: Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs, From the start of study treatment (first dose) and, until the post-treatment follow-up visit (at least 30 days after the last dose of investigational product) for AEs, and until 90 days after last dose for SAEs|Part 2: Number of subjects with permanent discontinuation of treatment, dose reductions, interruptions, or delays, Average of 4 years|Part 2: Change from baseline in laboratory parameters, Laboratory assessments include haematology, clinical chemistry, urine, coagulation and thyroid function test, Average of 4 years|Part 2: Change from baseline in vital signs, Vital sign measurements will include heart rate, temperature and blood pressure, Average of 4 years|Part 2: Change from baseline in cardiac parameters, Cardiac assessments will include ECG and ECHOs, Average of 4 years|Part 2: Incidence and titer of anti MK 3475 antibodies in patients treated with pazopanib + MK 3475 and single-agent MK 3475, Subjects will be monitored for anti-MK 3475 antibodies throughout the study, Until 6 months after the last dose of MK-3475|Part 2: PK parameters in randomized phase, For analysis of plasma pazopanib and serum MK 3475 concentrations, blood samples will be collected from all subjects. AUC\[0-24\], Cmax, tmax, and C24 of pazopanib alone and in combination with MK 3475; Cmax, Ctau, and apparent clearance following oral dosing CL/F of pazopanib will be determined if data permit., For Pazopanib: Until Dose 49 of MK-3475.
