Identification of Predictive Factors for the Response to Anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD1) Immunotherapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This project aims to organise the sampling of blood and tumor at key points of the standard of care of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). This will allow to identify new potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy of immunotherapy and to investigate the evolution of the tumoral microenvironment after successive systemic treatments.

Tumor and blood samples will be collected on patients treated by anti-PD1 immunotherapy at different timepoints. Tumor samples will be collected (i) before initiation of immunotherapy, (ii) at 50 days after initiation of immunotherapy and, optionally, in case of disease progression, (iii) before the initiation of the new line of chemotherapy and (iv) at 50 days after initiation of chemotherapy. Blood samples will be collected : (i) before initiation of immunotherapy, (ii) at each cycles of treatment until 84 days after initiation of immunotherapy and, optionally, in case of disease progression, (iii) before the initiation of the new line of chemotherapy and (iv) at each cycle until 50 days after initiation of chemotherapy (maximum 2 samples per month).
