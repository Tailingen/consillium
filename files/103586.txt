A Study of Trilaciclib Combined With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of NSCLC
The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of Trilaciclib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, so as to provide more evidence-based medical evidence for the optimal diagnosis and treatment strategy in this population.
NSCLC
DRUG: Trilaciclib Injection
Incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), Incidence of febrile neutropenia in the first treatment cycle, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 21 days
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Occurrence and severity of AEs by NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to 2 years|Antibiotic Use rate, Antibiotic Use rate in the first treatment cycle, during Trilaciclib plus chemotherapy assessed up to 21 days|Number of medication delays, Number of delays in the second treatment cycle due to myelosuppression, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of chemotherapy dose reductions, Number of chemotherapy dose reductions in the second treatment cycle due to myelosuppression, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
This is a single-arm, exploratory clinical study. Eligible patients were treated with Trilaciclib before the first cycle of chemotherapy, and their peripheral blood samples were tested on days 3,7,14,21Â±1 after chemotherapy. At the same time, the incidence of FN, the use of antibiotics, the safety, the number of patients who delayed the second cycle of treatment, the number of patients who reduced the dose of chemotherapy, the number of patients who reduced the dose of chemotherapy due to neutropenia, and the number of patients who discontinued chemotherapy were observed.
