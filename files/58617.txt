Trial Comparing Complication Rates Associated With Robot-assisted Thyroidectomy to External Thyroidectomy
The main objective is to compare 12 month complication rates between a new surgical method for thyroidectomy (robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy via a sub-clavical approach) and open thyroidectomy.
