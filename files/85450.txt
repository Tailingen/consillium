Germ Cell Tumor|Non-seminomatous Germ Cell Tumor|Ovarian Germ Cell Tumor
DRUG: Etoposide
12-month Progression Free Survival, Investigator determination of tumor progression (clinical, radiographic, tumor markers including AFP and hCG), time from the date of randomization to the date of disease relapse or death (i.e. up to 1 year)
12-month Overall Survival, Time of registration to death from any cause (i.e. up to 1 year)|Assess toxicity and tolerability of maintenance etoposide, Toxicities according to CTCAE v5 will be summarized by frequencies and rates calculated as the proportion of patients in the safety population experiencing SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs., through study completion (i.e. up to 2 years)
This is a randomized phase 2 trial of maintenance etoposide versus observation following HDCT+PBSCT for relapsed GCT. Patients who completed HDCT+PBSCT within the past 16 weeks will enroll and randomize in 1:1 fashion to maintenance daily oral etoposide 50mg vs. observation only.
