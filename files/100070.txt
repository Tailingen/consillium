A Trial of Famitinib in Patients With Failure of First-Line Treatment For Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase II clinical trial intended to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of famitinib malate in treating iCCA(Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma ) patients with FGFR2 genetic aberrations who failed first-line therapy.
