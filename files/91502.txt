Safety and Tolerability of IPH4502 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of IPH4502 and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in advanced solid tumors that are known to express Nectin-4
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: IPH4502
Safety and Tolerability, To evaluate the incidence of AEs, SAEs, TEAEs, and DLTs., From time of first dose through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To characterize and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months|Area Under the Plasma Concentration (AUC), To characterize and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months|Incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) against IPH4502, To evaluate the immunogenicity of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months|Duration Of Response (DoR), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity of IPH4502., From time of informed consent through treatment period, including the follow-up: up to 24 months
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, single-arm Phase 1 study, with a part 1 dose escalation guided by a Bayesian optimal interval design with backfilling (BOIN-BF), followed by a part 2 dose optimization in up to 2 selected indications. This study is to measure the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of escalating doses of IPH4502 in patients with advanced solid tumors that are known to express Nectin-4.
