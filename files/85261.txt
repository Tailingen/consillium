Comprehensive Frailty Assessment
The purpose of this research study is to describe a patients' fitness before and after treatment (whether that treatment be chemotherapy or a transplant). Fitness is a way of measuring a patient's current quality of health. With surveys, questionnaires and blood tests, we hope to create a tool that will give a good picture of patients' ability to tolerate treatment. In the future, we hope to devise the best treatment for a patient based on their "fitness".

Change in Comprehensive Frailty Assessment, Responses to the Comprehensive Frailty Assessment will be assessed before and after treatment and changes will be evaluated. In transplant patients, this will be measured one year post transplant and in the non-transplant arm, this will be assessed after the second cycle of treatment., up to 14 months
Time to progression, We will assess time to progression for multiple myeloma patients and the relationships of those outcomes to patients' functional, cognitive and psychosocial health., date of enrollment to date of documented clinical progression up to two years post-enrollment
Overall survival, We will assess overall survival and the relationship of those measures to patients' functional, cognitive and psychosocial health., enrollment to date of death up to two years post-enrollment
