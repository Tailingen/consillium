Evaluation of the Impact of Nurse-led Telephone on Treatment Compliance
The study will take place over a period of 27 months. The recruitment phase will last approximately 24 months and each patient will participate for approximately 3 months.

At the inclusion visit (D0), the investigator will ask the patient whether he would like to participate in the study and will obtain his written consent.

Patients agreeing to participate will be randomised (3:1 ratio) and included in one of the following 2 groups:

Group without 'remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up: patients will receive the healthcare given routinely by their medical team (100 patients).

Group with 'remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up: patients will receive telephone calls from a nurse in addition to the healthcare given routinely by their medical team (300 patients).

All the patients will be seen according to normal practice by the study medical team.

Patients in the group with 'remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up will be contacted 8 times during the study (at D1, D7, D14, D21, D28, D44, D59 and D89). The nurse will make sure that the treatment takes place in good conditions; she cannot intervene in the medical care of the patient, nor give answer to the questions relative to the disease or to the treatment of the patient. The medical team remains the privileged contact of the patient.

The Cumulated Dose Milligram (mg) of Oral Targeted Therapy During the 3-month Follow-up., The cumulated dose (mg) of oral targeted therapy taken between visits is the sum of the doses (mg) of the tablets taken by the patient.

Score (0-6) Obtained With the Girerd Questionnaire, Girerd questionnaire is a questionnaire composed of 6 binary questions (yes/no) and is used to assess treatment compliance. The final score obtained is the number of questions to which the patient responded "yes". Thus, the score ranges from 0 to 6. A patient will be classified as:

Good compliant with score = 0. Minor non-compliant with score = 1 or 2. Non-compliant with score \>2., at Day 30 (D30), Day 60 (D60) and Day 90 (D90)|Cumulated Dose of Oral Targeted Therapy Not Taken (All Categories) Following Decision of the Medical Team, The cumulated dose (mg) of oral targeted therapy not taken between 2 visits is the sum of the doses (mg) of tablets not taken by the patient.
