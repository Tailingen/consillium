EF-41/KEYNOTE D58: Phase 3 Study of Optune Concomitant With Temozolomide Plus Pembrolizumab in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
This is a multicenter, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Optune® (Tumor Treating Fields at 200 kHz) together with maintenance Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy agent and pembrolizumab compared to Optune® together with maintenance TMZ and placebo in newly diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM) patients. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the Overall Survival (OS).

Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per mRANO assessed by investigator, PFS is defined as the time interval, in months, between randomization and the first documented disease progression per mRANO assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
