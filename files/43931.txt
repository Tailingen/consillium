Per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., From randomization until disease progression or death (up to approximately 36 months)|Investigator-Assessed PFS, in Subgroups Categorized by Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) Mutation Status, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in in the sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression in non-target lesions, and/or appearance of new lesions. Investigator-assessed PFS was analyzed in subgroups categorized by baseline ESR1 mutation status (i.e., with or without ESR1 mutation at baseline) from plasma circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA)., From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to a clinical cutoff of 15 months)|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Pain Severity, TTD in pain severity is defined as time to first documented ≥2-point increase from Baseline in the "Worst Pain" item from the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire. The BPI-SF is a self administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain (the sensory dimension) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (the reactive dimension). The BPI-SF uses 10-point numeric rating scale, with 0="No pain", "No interference" to 10="Pain as bad as you can imagine", "Highest imaginable interference". A lower score indicates improvement., From Baseline until treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 36 months)|TTD in Pain Presence and Interference, Defined as Time to First Documented ≥10-Point Increase From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 Linearly Transformed Pain Scale Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated and reliable self-report measure that consists of 30 questions assessing five aspects of participant functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health and quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. The functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4-point scale that ranges from 1=not at all to 4=very much. The Pain scale is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). The obtained scores are linearly transformed to a score range of 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse pain symptoms., From Baseline until treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 36 months)|TTD in Physical Functioning (PF), TTD in PF is defined as the time to first documented ≥10-point decrease from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 linearly transformed PF scale score. EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated and reliable self-report measure that consists of 30 questions assessing five aspects of participant functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health and quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. The PF scale has 5 questions about participants' physical functioning and is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). The obtained scores are linearly transformed to a score range of 0-100, where higher scores indicate a higher response level (better physical function)., From Baseline until treatment discontinuation (up to approximately 36 months)|TTD in Role Functioning (RF), TTD in RF is defined as the time to first documented ≥10-point decrease from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 linearly transformed RF scale score.
