IncobotulinumtoxinA for Treatment of Focal Cancer Pain After Surgery and/or Radiation
The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (Xeomin) Â® injections in patients who suffer from focal pain in areas of radiation and/or surgery as a result of cancer treatment. Our hypothesis is that injection of incobotulinum toxin A into an area of local pain, at or around the area of a post-surgical/post radiation scar, relieves the focal cancer pain.
