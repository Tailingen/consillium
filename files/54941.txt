Ezra Faster Scan Study
The Ezra Faster Scan study uses non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology that can "visually" detect early and late-stage cancer, and other pathologies. MRIs use a magnetic field and radio waves to create a 3-dimensional (3D) image of an individual's body without using ionizing radiation.

The purpose of this research is to decrease the amount of time required by an individual to complete an early cancer screening comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, such as the Ezra Full Body MRI imaging scan. If the time required to conduct a comprehensive scan is reduced, the cost of the scan may also decrease. By decreasing consumer costs and time, more individuals may be able to afford MRI-based early cancer screening technology.

Participants in this study will undergo a minimum 30-minute MRI session. These sessions will be used to evaluate new MRI "instructions" that allow for a faster MRI scan time. The images will also be used to develop mathematical models or machine learning tools that allow images to be enhanced. By enhancing images using machine learning, they may be restored to a quality typically observed in MRI sessions with longer scan (acquisition) times.

Accelerated MRI Sequence Protocol Time (s), The MRI scan time (minutes, seconds) for MRI instructions or sequences to be completed and qualitative feedback from MRI technologists and radiologists on execution of instrument instructions., Approximately 30 minutes for each participant scan .

Additional computational analysis of images throughout the study duration.|Statistical Analysis of MRI Images (Reference), Computed image signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of machine learning-restored accelerated images relative to reference images., Approximately 30 minutes for each participant scan. Additional computational analysis of images throughout the study duration.|Statistical Analysis of MRI Images (Likert), Visual radiologist review of reference and machine learning restored images. Images are reviewed using a Likert scale, comparing a reference image to a machine learning restored image. The scale grades are a radiologist's objective opinion of whether a machine learning restored image is similar to a reference image. If the machine learning image is worse, the radiologist rates the image strongly disagree or -2, if the machine learning image is better than the reference image, the radiologist selects strongly agree or 2. The Likert scale extends from worse to improved in the following order; strongly disagree (worse) -2, disagree -1, neither agree or disagree (neutral) 0, agree 1, or strongly agree 2. The minimum value is -2 and the maximum value is 2. A higher score greater than 0 indicates a better image, a lower score less than 0 indicates a worse image or outcome., Approximately 10 minutes of a radiologist's time. Additional analysis of images throughout the study duration.
