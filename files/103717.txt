Intratumoral Budding (ITB) in Preoperative Biopsies of Colon and Rectal Cancer
All the preoperative biopsies of patients suffering colorectal cancer (CRC) will be immunohistochemically stained with a pancytokeratin marker to detect Tumor buds. then, the intratumoral buds (ITB) in the densest Region of Tumor buds, namely the "hot spot" will be counted. Subsequently, the probability of N stage (lymphnodes), M stage (metastases) and disease free survival (DFS) will be calculated based on an existing logistic Regression model already developed by our previous retrospective work. Additionally, a Standardisation of ITB using a well- established Software will develop an algorithm which will help to eliminate inter- observer variability of Tumor budding Counts.
