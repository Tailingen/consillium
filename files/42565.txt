Zevalin® First Line in Follicular Lymphoma
This is a European multicenter study of 90Yttrium-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan (90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan) (Zevalin®) as a front line therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma grade I-IIIa and stage III-IV (as well as for selected patients with extended abdominal stage II). For patients with complete clinical remission but persistent molecular disease subsequent to 90Y-Ibritumomab Tiuxetan treatment a consolidation immunotherapy with Rituximab is added, to eradicate minimal residual disease.
