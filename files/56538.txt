Efficacy and Safety of IBI308 and Paclitaxel/Albumin Paclitaxel for SCLC Patients Who Failed Etoposide Chemotherapy
This phase II trial studies how well IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/albumin-bound paclitaxel work in treating participants with small cell lung cancer after failing to platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.
Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel/Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: IBI308
progression-free survival (PFS), 12 months
overall survival (OS), 12 months|disease control rate (DCR), 12 months|durative time of remission ( DoR）, 12 months|objective remission rate (ORR), 12 months
Primary objective :

To estimate progression free survival (PFS) probability of patient who recurrent SCLC treated with IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound paclitaxel following progression on platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

Secondary Objectives:

I.To evaluate the objective remission rate (ORR), disease control rate. (DCR),durative time of remission ( DoR）and overall survival (OS) of IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound paclitaxel following progression on platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

II.To evaluate the safety of IBI308 combined with paclitaxel/abumin-bound paclitaxel following progression on platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.

Exploratory Objectives To evaluate the correlation of biomarkers with efficacy and toxicity.
