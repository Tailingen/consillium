Difference of BFI score change after treatment, Brief Fatigue Inventory（ BFI）is a nine item scale used to evaluate the intensity of fatigue and the interference of fatigue to normal activities. The classification of fatigue severity is: Mild fatigue (1-3), Moderate fatigue (4-6) and Severe fatigue (7-10)., 2 years

Cancer related fatigue(CRF) in patients with breast cancer has a great impact on their quality of life and treatment compliance. Many studies suggest that acupuncture has certain therapeutic effects on fatigue. In this clinical trial, we treated patients with acupuncture to alleviate their fatigue symptoms. Currently, studies have shown that cancer related fatigue in breast cancer patients is related to some biological factors. While acupuncture is used to treat fatigue, we will collect blood samples from patients for fatigue related single nucleotide polymorphisms（SNP）.

Based on CRF related biological factors, our study aims to screen SNPs that related to CRF related biological factors to guide electroacupuncture in the treatment of cancer-related fatigue and establish a prognostic model.
