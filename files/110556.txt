Artificial Intelligence 3D Augmented Reality Robot-Assisted-Radical- Prostatectomy v.s. no3D Intervention
This is a prospective randomized multicenter study aimed at comparing 3D AI-AR-RARP vs. no 3D, verifying the impact of this new technology on oncological and functional outcomes after the procedure.
Cancer of Prostate
PROCEDURE: 3D Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy
Perioperative surgical oncological outcomes, Verify oncological outcomes in prostate cancer patients with evidence of bulging or extracapsular disease (ECE or rT3) on preoperative MRI, in terms of positive margin rate (PSM) following surgery, 12 months after surgery
Micturition outcomes, Evaluation of continence recovery rate. Continence was defined as use of 0-1 pads/die. Furthermore 24/h pad test was performed in case of persistence of incontinence to evaluate the different degree of urine losses, and was classified according to ICS definitions., 5 years after surgery|Sexual function outcomes, Evaluation of erection recovery in terms of IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire)., 5 years after surgery|Oncological outcomes, Evaluation of patients' oncological outcomes during the follow up in terms of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and occurrence of local/distant recurrence detected with different imaging techniques during the FU according to clinical indication, 5 years after surgery
Verify the potential application of AI, Verify the potential application of AI as an alert system during surgery in order to reduce the rate of possible intraoperative complications, 12 months after surgery
Considering that prostate cancer lesions are not identifiable during surgery, except in the case of extensive and advanced tumors, the surgeon does not have a real-time perception of the location of the tumor. The absence of clear spatial visualization can therefore lead to a positive surgical margin, particularly in tumors in the T3 stage (invasion of the prostatic capsule or seminal vesicles).

Our hypothesis is that with the help of AI 3D AR during surgery, positive surgical margins can be avoided, or at least reduced, while preserving the neurovascular bundles, with a consequent improvement not only in postoperative functional outcomes (continence and potency), but also oncological ones (less biochemical disease recovery (BCR), less need for salvage radiotherapy, lower risk of metastasis).
