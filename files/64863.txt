Evaluation of Diagnostic Performances of 18F-FDOPA PET KInetics
the investigators hypothesise that 18F-FDOPA PET kinetic parameters are good biomarkers to characterise suspected LGG brain lesions that exhibit no contrast on MRI, for identifying aggressive lesions. These parameters could constitute diagnostic biomarkers for this indication. This new diagnostic tool could enhance patient care in the short term in an evolving pathology affecting socially active subjects with a poor prognosis

enhancement, 24 months|To assess, in patients suspected to have a non-contrast enhanced glioma at diagnosis the clinical impact of the 18F-FDOPA PET (positon emission tomography) Time-To-Peak parameter, Number of patients who need to be diagnosed with 18F-FDOPA kinetic parameter TTP to identify an aggressive lesion within the suspected LGG population that do not exhibit any contrast enhancement on MRI at initial diagnosis and that undergo biopsy/surgery, defined as: 1/ \[% of aggressive lesions detected with the 18F-FDOPA Time-To-Peak parameter\]., 24 months
Diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGGs) without any contrast enhancement on MRI are rare (15% of gliomas, 700 cases/year in France), have a poor prognosis (median overall survival from 5 to 15 years) and affect young, socially active subjects (median age 40 years). Among these lesions, 30% present with high grade histopathological criteria or with poor prognostic molecular characteristics, according to the 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (lack of IDH \[Isocitrate DeHydrogenase\] mutation, CDKN2A/B deletion). These high-grade types of tumours progress within 6 months and their diagnosis and management represent a public health issue. Moreover, the care of LGG patients is currently not standardised.

Although treatment is based on surgery and the complete excision of the lesion, as far as this is possible, and/or first-line chemotherapy Â±radiotherapy, the optimal time to begin treatment remains controversial.

Aggressive forms should be diagnosed as soon as possible to allow immediate surgery to improve survival, whilst strategies allowing the maintenance of an optimal quality of life, more often with functional surgery alone, are recommended for non-aggressive forms. The main hurdle to standardised patient management is the lack of amenable non-invasive biomarkers to identify aggressive LGG forms.

18F-FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET) is promising to diagnose initial gliomas with conventional Standardised-Uptake-Value (SUV) parameters. Our team recently demonstrated the potential of 18F-FDOPA PET kinetics to better characterise gliomas. Two parameters are determined from the 30-minute dynamic acquisition curve of the tumour: the time-to-peak SUV (TTP), and the SUV slope. In our previous studies, limited by their monocentric and retrospective nature, molecular characteristics were mainly predicted by TTP: long TTP for an IDH-mutation and short TTP for IDH-wildtype tumours. A prospective multicentric study is needed to confirm our preliminary results in a specific population of suspected LGGs without any contrast enhancement on MRI.

The investigator hypothesise that 18F-FDOPA PET kinetic parameters are biomarkers which lead to improved care because they characterise aggressive forms of gliomas exhibiting no contrast on MRI.
