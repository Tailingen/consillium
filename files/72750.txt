Efficacy and Tolerability of Hemopatch After Hepatic Resection
* Previous in vitro and in vivo studies detected the Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat® to be a new versatile, self-adhering hemostatic sealing pad consisting of a polyethylene glycol-coated collagen.
* Initial study assessed that Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat® can be applied to seal almost any bleeding surface encountered during a range of procedures. The Authors shown that the device is eminently capable in both via laparotomy and laparoscopic approaches, and in patients with impaired coagulation or highly variable anatomies. They support the ease-of-use, application, and immediate hemostatic effect of the patch across a broad range of surgical settings and clinical applications, including solid organ, gastrointestinal, biliopancreatic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and urologic surgeries.
* In a recent published case report the authors reported the feasibility in using Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat® for the management of a myocardial wound, performing the procedure on cardiopulmonary bypass, which meant the patient had to be heparinized. Despite these major risk factors for bleeding Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat® managed to contain bleeding and seal the wound without needing any suture.

These initial results lead up to future randomized clinical trials with more extensive follow-up to assess which is the real contribution of Hemopatch Sealing Hemostat to reduce postoperative bleeding complications in cases where mechanical or energy-driven hemostasis is not possible or insufficient.

Advances in surgical techniques have reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications following liver resection and resulted in low surgical mortality and morbidity rates in high-volume centers.

Although partial liver resections for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies are considered standard interventions, intraoperative blood loss remains a risk factor associated with major complications in liver surgery \[1-3\]. There are several methods for reduction of blood loss, including meticulous resection technique along anatomical planes, reduction of central venous pressure during transection of the liver parenchyma \[4\], and vascular occlusion techniques (i.e., inflow occlusion and total vascular occlusion) \[5-7\]. In addition, specific instruments were devised for liver transection, such as the ultrasonic dissector, water jet, and other, more recent developments (e.g., focal radiofrequency ablation) that allow sealing of small vessels during transection \[8, 9\].

In order to control diffuse bleeding and to prevent intraperitoneal complications attributed to bleeding, various topical products are used when the conventional methods, such as suture, ligation, or argon beam coagulation, fail. Currently, there are numerous products on the market which are promising a successful outcome for hemostasis. These products include gelatin, collagen, oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin sealant glues, and synthetic glues.
