A Clinical Study of TJ004309 With Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) in Patients With Ovarian Cancer and Selected Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 2 study of TJ004309 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Ovarian Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Gastrointestinal Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Ovarian Carcinoma
DRUG: TJ004309
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in each Tumor Type, Number of responders Assessed by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and iRECIST for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI, Up to 120 weeks
Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria (version 5.0) Number of subjects with significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory findings, Up to 120 weeks|Number of participants with laboratory value abnormalities, Assessed by number of participants with clinically significant laboratory values., Up to 120 weeks|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities, Assessed by number of participants with clinically significant vital sign values, Up to 120 weeks|Number of participants with abnormal physical examination results, Assessed by number of participants with clinically significant abnormal physical examination results, Up to 120 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of responders Assessed by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and iRECIST for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI, Up to 120 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression assessed among patients who had an objective response, Up to 120 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), Complete response + Partial response + Stable disease (CR+PR+SD) based on RECIST 1.1, Up to 120 weeks|Progression-free-survival (PFS), by RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Up to 120 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be calculated for each subject as the number of days from the first day of treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of death from any cause., Up to 120 weeks|Pharmacokinetic profiles of serum TJ004309 and atezolizumab, Based on Anti-Drug Antibody Results, Up to 120 weeks|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters: Area under the curve (AUC0-T), AUC0-T is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve calculated using the trapezoidal method over the dosing interval after the first infusion, From pre-dose in Day 1 of Cycle 1 to post-dose in Day 21 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Assessment of PK parameter: Cmax, Cmax is maximum drug concentration observed, From pre-dose in Day 1 of Cycle 1 to post-dose in Day 21 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Assessment of PK parameter: tmax, Time to reach Cmax, From pre-dose in Day 1 of Cycle 1 to post-dose in Day 21 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 2 study of TJ004309 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This clinical study includes two cohorts: Cohort 1 will include Immuno-Oncology (IO) treatment naïve ovarian cancer (OC) patients who have progressed on or after platinum therapy; and Cohort 2 will include patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastrointestinal cancer (GC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), or ovarian carcinoma (OC) with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Additional cohorts for selected tumor types might be added later.
