Phase 2 Study Comparing 99mTc-EC-DG SPECT/CT With 18F FDG PET/CT in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a multiple-center Phase 2 study designed to expand the patient safety and clinical information using 99m Tc-Ec-DG with Spect/CT imaging, to develop procedures and methods for evaluation of the imaging studies, to determine comparability of diagnostic information between SPECT and SPECT/CT imaging and to to compare the safety and efficacy of 99m Tc-EC-DG SPECT/CT with 18F-FDG PET/CT in imaging patients with biopsy confirmed diagnosis of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Radiolabeled (99Tc) EC-DG (ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose)|RADIATION: 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose
Safety: Through adverse event collection, from 99m Tc-Ec-DG injection through 21 days
Efficacy: Comparison of 18F FDG PET/CT image against 99m Tc-EC-DG image, End of study|Efficacy: determine comparability of diagnostic information between SPECT (acs) and SPECT/CT (als) imaging, End of Study|Efficacy: To provide evidence of 99m Tc-Ec-DG in identifying anatomical regions with known Non-small cell lung cancer and in determining extent of disease in these patients as compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, End of Study
Male and female patients at least 18 years of age with untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who have non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence of disease (or from cytology results from a bronchoscope procedure) and who have been previously certified (per centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requirements) by their physicians will be consented for the study. The study consists of a screening visit, gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging followed by the investigational agent 99m Tc-Ec-DG SPECT/CT. The study procedures can be performed within 5-7 days of signing the informed consent. \[To better meet the standard of care at each clinical location, the PET/CT can be performed as part of pre-study procedures on a PET/CT camera previously qualified by the site to meet the standards required for the study. If this occurs, the SPECT/CT must be performed within 45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedures.\] Patients will be seen 24 hours after the 99m Tc-Ec-DG injection for safety. A 21-day follow-up period (after the SPECT/CT image) will allow the investigator to acquire additional imaging, surgical, pathology and treatment documentation. \[An actual patient visit is NOT required at the 21-day follow-up time point.\]
