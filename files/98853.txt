S1916 Digital Medicine Program for Pain Control in Cancer Patients
This is a feasibility study to assess the use of a Digital Medicine Program (consisting of an FDA-approved ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg), a small wearable patch, and a mobile application) in cancer patients with metastatic disease experiencing uncontrolled pain.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg|DEVICE: Proteus digital medicine program
Feasibility Determined by Accrual, Adherence and Patient Retention., Feasibility will be determined by accrual (as confirmed by registration to the trial), adherence and patient retention (as measured and relayed by the wearable patch/sensor)., adherence and retention - 6 weeks; accrual - 6 months
Pain Levels and Pain Interference With Daily Activity, Pain levels are measured by average pain score and pain interference with daily activity score at 2, 4, and 6 weeks on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). Also, pain in the last 24 hours is measured daily using the worst pain item from the BPI-SF. Pain is rated on a scale of 0-10 with 10 signifying the worst symptoms., 2, 4, and 6 weeks.|Opioid Medication Consumption, Opioid medication consumption is assessed as the number of pills taken over the number of study pills prescribed., 6 weeks|Unplanned Hospital and Emergency Department Visits, Unplanned hospital and emergency department visits assessed as any reported unplanned visits because of pain between the date of registration and the 6-week follow-up timepoint., 6 weeks|Frequency of Changes in Pain Management Regimen, Frequency of changes in pain management regimen is measured as any change in the dosage, frequency, or the pain medication between baseline and 6-week follow-up., 6 weeks|Activity Levels, Activity levels are measured as active time and rest time in minutes and total daily step count., 6 weeks|Patient Somatic Symptoms, Patient somatic symptoms of opioid treatment will be measured using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment (revised version). Questions are rated on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being "worst" outcome., baseline 2, 4, and 6 weeks.|Patient Satisfaction With the Digital Medicine Program (DMP)., Patient satisfaction will be assessed by survey that measures patient satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 with the higher score having the better outcome., 6 weeks|Provider Satisfaction With Digital Medicine Program (DMP), Provider satisfaction will be assessed by survey that measures provider satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 with the higher score having the better outcome., 6 weeks|ePRO Feasibility, ePRO feasibility will be defined by the extent of missing data at each assessment time for those items or instruments required to be completed using the Patient Cloud ePRO app; assessing the patient experience of using the Patient Cloud ePRO app with a one-time questionnaire at the conclusion of the study., 6 weeks|Patient Psychological Distress, Patient depression and anxiety will be measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Questions are rated on a scale of 0-3 with higher score having the worst outcome., 2, 4, and 6 weeks|Patient Global Quality of Life, Patient quality of life (including anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, satisfaction with participation in social roles and activities and single pain intensity) will be measured using the PROMIS-29. Patients respond to questions by marking one response: very poor, poor, fair, good and very good., 2, 4, and 6 weeks
Given the high prevalence of cancer pain and issues with undertreatment and opioid misuse, focused efforts to improve monitoring of medication ingestion patterns are needed. This study will test the feasibility of using a Digital Medicine Program (consisting of an FDA-approved ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with oxycodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg), a small wearable patch, and a mobile application) in cancer patients with metastatic disease experiencing uncontrolled pain. Data collected from this study (such as information on patterns of DMP usage by patients and physicians and changes to medication dosage based on the reported symptoms) will inform the design of a randomized controlled trial of the DMP vs. usual care to control cancer pain and increase quality of life. If successful, this DMP could be a new way for physicians to evaluate patients' pain medication use patterns and titrate for adequate pain control while concurrently monitoring for adverse effects or abusive/addictive behavior. It will also promote improved communication between patients and their physicians and potentially address and ease some of patients' concerns and hesitancies regarding opioid medications.
