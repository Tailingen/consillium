Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phase I Study to Assess the Safety and Clinical Activity of Multiple Doses of NKR-2 Administered Concurrently With FOLFOX in Colorectal Cancer With Potentially Resectable Liver Metastases
SHRINK (Standard cHemotherapy Regimen and Immunotherapy with NKR-2) is an open-label Phase I study to assess the safety and clinical activity of multiple administrations of autologous NKR-2 cells administered concurrently with a standard chemotherapy treatment (FOLFOX) in potentially resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

The trial will test three dose levels. At each dose, the patients will receive three successive administrations, two weeks apart, NKR-2 cells. The study will enroll up to 36 patients (dose escalation and expansion phases).
Colon Cancer Liver Metastasis
BIOLOGICAL: NKR-2 cells
The occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in all patients during the study treatment until 14 days after the first NKR-2 study treatment administration, DLT refers to any Grade 3 or higher toxicity or any Grade 2 or higher autoimmune toxicity that is experienced during treatment and within 14 days following the first NKR-2 dose, is new and at least possibly related to NKR-2 study treatment administered concurrently with chemotherapy, up to resection (up to day 99 to day 126)|The objective response rate (ORR) before resection as measured by RECIST (version 1.1), The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of the proportions of patients achieving CR or PR. The occurrence of ORR before resection will be reported., up to resection (up to day 99 to day 126)
The occurrence of AEs and SAEs and any toxicity corresponding to DLT definition during the study treatment until resection visit, The occurrence of AEs and SAEs and any toxicity corresponding to DLT definition during the study treatment until resection visit, up to resection (up to day 99 to day 126)|The occurrence of surgery complications and the wound healing status until 60 days after resection visit, Surgery and wound healing complications experienced within the 60-day post-operative period in patients who underwent surgery will be reported as safety endpoints, until 60 days after resection|The clinical benefit rate (CBR) before resection, The clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients achieving CR, PR or SD. The occurrence of CBR before resection will be reported., up to resection (up to day 99 to day 126)|The occurrence of mixed response (MR) before resection, The different types of MR are defined according to the following criteria: at least 30% decrease in the longest diameter (or shortest diameter for nodal lesions) occurring in at least one target lesion recorded and measured at baseline (such response occurring in otherwise SD or PD status of the sum of diameters of target lesions and without the appearance of one or more new lesions will be classified as "MR (SD)", which corresponds to a SD with target lesion regression or "MR (PD)", which corresponds to PD with target lesion regression) and the appearance of new lesion(s) in otherwise PR status of the sum of diameters of target lesions will be classified as "MR (PR)"., up to resection (up to day 99 to day 126)|The resection rate, The presence of residual tumor following surgical resection will be assessed., resection (day 99 to day 126)|The occurrence of pathological response at surgery, Resected specimens. will be graded according to the two grading systems by Rubbia-Brandt et al. and Blazer et al., resection (day 99 to day 126)|The disease-free survival (DFS) or progression-free survival (PFS), The disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from resection of liver metastases to recurrence of tumor or death from any cause. The progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as time from study registration in the study to the disease progression or death from any cause., through study completion (up to month 28)|The event-free survival (EFS), The event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from registration in the study to any of the following events: progression, non-resectability, local or distant recurrence, or death from any cause., through study completion (up to month 28)|The overall survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from study registration in the study to death. If death does not occur before the patient's last study visit, then the survival will be censored at the date when patient is known to be alive., through study completion (up to month 28)
