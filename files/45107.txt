Study of Robatumumab (SCH 717454, MK-7454) in Combination With Different Treatment Regimens in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (P04722, MK-7454-004)
This is a Phase 1B/2, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of robatumumab (SCH 717454, MK-7454) in combination with standard treatment in participants with advanced solid tumors to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices.

Six different treatment regimens will be investigated in combination with robatumumab.

The study will be divided into two parts. Part 1 will consist of initial safety evaluation and dose-finding of robatumumab in combination with each treatment regimen. Part 2 will consist of an expansion of each robatumumab regimen at a newly established dose level, to better define safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy in specific target populations.

Part 2: Number of Participants With Each Type of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-Determined Overall Best Response, Overall best response was determined by RECIST criteria. Types of overall response could be: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), Not Assessable (NA) or Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD)., Up to ~30 days after the final dose of robatumumab (Up to ~14 months)|Part 1: Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to this study drug. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions., Up to ~30 days after the final dose of robatumumab (Up to ~14 months)
