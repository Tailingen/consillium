An Observational Study to Evaluate Neoadjuvant Nivolumab (OPDIVOÂ®) in Combination With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Non-Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Participants in Germany
The purpose of this observational study is to collect and evaluate real-world data to assess the effectiveness of neoadjuvant nivolumab when given in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in participants with early-stage, resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Germany
