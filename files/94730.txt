Sexual Coercion in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonists (LHRHa )
The use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists(LHRHa) to suppress ovarian function is a common strategy for treating premenopausal, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, this approach can lead to more severe and prolonged menopausal symptoms, which can further impact intimate relationships and sexual function. Sexual coercion, encompassing both overt and subtle forms of pressure, is a significant global public health concern that threatens individual well-being.

Objective: The use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists(LHRHa) to suppress ovarian function is a common strategy for treating premenopausal, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, this approach can lead to more severe and prolonged menopausal symptoms, which can further impact intimate relationships and sexual function. Sexual coercion, encompassing both overt and subtle forms of pressure, is a significant global public health concern that threatens individual well-being.

Methods: This study is a randomized controlled study. In this study, the validated Turkish version of the Sexual Coercion in Intimate Relationship Scale was utilized to investigate whether patients receiving LHRHa therapy experienced higher rates of sexual sexual coercion compared to those taking tamoxifen. The study included 40 patients using LHRHa and 39 patients using tamoxifen. The instrument assessed partner sexual coercion across three subdomains: resource manipulation/sexual coercion, commitment manipulation, and defection threat.
