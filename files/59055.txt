Gedatolisib in Combination With Darolutamide in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, randomized, dose finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and PK of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide in subjects with mCRPC.

DRUG: Gedatolisib|DRUG: Darolutamide
Phase 1: Assessment of the safety and tolerability of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), Type, incidence, severity (as graded by National Cancer Institute \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] v5.0), seriousness, and relationship to study medications of adverse events (AEs) and any laboratory abnormalities, Cycle 1, Day 1 to end of safety follow up (each cycle is 28 days and safety follow up will continue until 30 days after last dose of study medication)|Phase 1: Identification of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide in mCRPC, Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and AEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Through Phase I completion, an average of 1 year.|Phase 2: Assessment of the antitumor activity of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide in each arm as demonstrated by radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by arm, Radiographic progression-free survival rate at 6 months as measured by the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method and assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 with modifications as specified in Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, 6 months
Assessment of the preliminary efficacy of gedatolisib in combination with darolutamide by arm, Radiographic progression-free survival rates at 9 and 12 months and overall rPFS Overall Survival (OS) rate at 18 and 24 months, 9 and 12 months post Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days); 18 and 24 months post Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, randomized, dose finding and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of gedatolisib, a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in combination with darolutamide, a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following progression on a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor. The aim of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate dose limiting toxicities and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. The aim of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to further assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of the drug combination.
