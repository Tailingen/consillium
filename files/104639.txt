ST-001 nanoFenretinide in Relapsed/ Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study evaluates a fenretinide phospholipid suspension for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Fenretinide|DRUG: Fenretinide
To determine the MTD of ST-001 (12.5mg/mL) for IV infusion in patients with SCLC, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ST-001 12.5 mg/mL for IV infusion (ST-001) in patients with Relapsed/Refractory SCLC when ST-001 is administered via 4-hour IV infusion daily for five consecutive days, q3weeks. MTD reflects the highest dose of drug that did not cause a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in \>33% of participants. DLTs are defined as any treatment-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0) Grade 3 or 4 adverse events., From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks
To describe the toxicity profile of ST-001 in patients with SCLC, Determine the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|To observe and record anti-tumor activity of ST-001 in patients with SCLC, Preclinical studies with fenretinide suggest potential efficacy against SCLC. Patients will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability. Objective Response Rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) will be used as tumor response endpoints in this study., From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR = (Number of patients with complete or partial response) / (Total number of evaluable patients) x 100. Minimum duration of individual patient participation is 3 weeks (one cycle of therapy) to be evaluable for response., From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression (increase in tumor size, new metastases) or death., From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|To describe the pharmacokinetics of fenretinide when ST-001 is administered by daily infusion for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks., The endpoint for the pharmacokinetic studies is to assess fenretinide blood plasma levels as a function of administered dose and to determine the following PK parameters: maximum fenretinide concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (Tmax), volume of distribution (Vd), clearance (CL), elimination and fenretinide half-life (t½)., From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|Cmax, Peak plasma fenretinide concentration (in ng/mL), From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|Tmax, The time it takes for fenretinide to reach the maximum concentration (Cmax) after drug administration (in hours), From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|Vd, Volume of distribution; fenretinide's propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments (in liters), From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks|t½, Fenretinide elimination and half-life; the time it takes for the amount of a drug's active substance in your body to reduce by half (hours), From enrollment to end of treatment is 3 weeks
Fenretinide has been shown to be a relatively safe and effective anticancer therapy; however, low fenretinide bioavailability and dose limiting toxicities due to excipients used in previous formulations has impeded its therapeutic utility. The product formulation in the current study (ST-001) is a phospholipid suspension of nanoparticle sized fenretinide. The current study is a Phase 1 trial in in relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer to determine the safety profile, pharmacology, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ST-001.
