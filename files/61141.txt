Genome Sequencing in Refractory Breast Cancer to Molecular Targeted Therapy and Young Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyse genomic profiles in patient with breast cancer who failed standard treatment, refractory and young breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
Number of Participants With Mutated Genes and/or Abnormal Gene expression and/or Different Immune signature That Affect to Treatment Outcome., 1 year
The hypothesis is that genomic profiling measured by CancerSCAN, cfDNA, Whole exome sequencing (WES), Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), FACS(Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting), cytokine and immunologic signature analysis would be helpful to find out tolerance for chemotherapy and innovate new therapeutic strategies.
