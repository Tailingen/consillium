Pulse Pressure Variation Based Intraoperative Fluid Management Versus Traditional Fluid Management for Colonic Cancer Patients Undergoing Mass Resection and Anastomosis
pulse pressure variation based intraoperative fluid therapy versus traditional fluid therapy for colonic cancer patients undergoing mass resection and anastomosis for maintaining adequate hydration without complications.
Intraoperative Fluid Volume|Hemodynamics|Serum Lactate|Intestinal Edema|Length of the Hospital Stay|First Time to Gastrointestinal Motion|Postoperative Complications
DEVICE: pulse pressure variation|OTHER: conventional fluid management
Intraoperative fluid volume, calculated immediately after surgery
intraoperative blood pressure, every ten minutes till the end of the surgery|lactate level, every hour till the end of the surgery|POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS, till one week after surgery|intestinal oedema, intraoperatively after tumor resection
All Patients will be assigned randomly by using computerized program to one of the two equal groups. Patients will be (forty five patients per group):

Group A ;( control group) Forty five patients will do elective open colonic mass resection and anastomosis. Infusion of 6 ml/kg/hr. Ringer's solution.

Group B; Forty five patients will do elective open colonic mass resection and anastomosis. Infusion of 2 ml/kg/hr. Ringer's solution guided by pulse pressure variation.

Intraoperative fluid volume, hemodynamics, serum lactate and intestinal edema will be measured after induction of anesthesia and every hour till the end of the operation, length of the hospital stay, first time to gastrointestinal motion and postoperative complications are recorded.
