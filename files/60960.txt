A Proof of Concept Pilot Study of the Addition of Venetoclax to Standard Remission Induction Chemotherapy Fludarabine or Cladrabine, Cytarabine, and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) (FLAG or CLAG) for Frontline Therapy of Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The primary purpose of this study is to determine complete remission rate of a novel combination induction chemotherapy treatment based upon 20 patients with newly diagnosed secondary AML.
Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: FLAG or CLAG Protocol
Morphologic complete remission (CR), If at least 12/20 (60%) of patients achieve a CR (based upon a bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and peripheral blood studies according to the International Working Group criteria for AML), the combination treatment will be considered successful. If the true CR rate is 40%, then the trial will be considered successful with probability 0.06 (type I error). Conversely, if the true CR rate is 70%, then the trial will be considered successful with probability 0.89 (power)., up to 43 days (+/- 2 days)|Percentage of patients who develop drug-related non-hematologic grade 3 or higher toxicity, Percent of patients who develop drug-related non-hematologic grade 3 or higher toxicities within 30 days after study treatment initiation (excluding nausea and vomiting or electrolyte abnormalities that are corrected with standard clinical care)., 30 days post study treatment start|Number of patients who develop drug-related non-hematologic grade 3 or higher toxicity, Number of patients who develop drug-related non-hematologic grade 3 or higher toxicities within 30 days after study treatment initiation (excluding nausea and vomiting or electrolyte abnormalities that are corrected with standard clinical care)., 30 days post study treatment start|Bone marrow aplasia, Defined as a bone marrow biopsy with an overall cellularity of \< 5% with no evidence of leukemia as well as an ANC \<0.5 and a platelet count of \< 10 requiring transfusion support., up to 43 days (+/- 2 days)
Overall response rate (ORR), {Percentage of patients?} with complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia free state rate (MLFS), and partial response rate (PR) per AML Response Criteria., 28 days (+/- 7 days) days post remission marrow collection|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time between first dose of study treatment to the event of disease progression or death; analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods., 6 months and 1 year following the conclusion of study enrollment|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from start of treatment to death; analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods., 6 months and 1 year following the conclusion of study enrollment|Event free survival (EFS), EFS defined as the time from start of treatment to resistant leukemia, relapsed leukemia, second malignancy, or death; analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods., 6 months and 1 year following the conclusion of study enrollment|Mortality rate, Defined as whether the patient was alive 30 days post-study treatment start (died/not died)., 30 days post study treatment start|Allogeneic transplantation, Defined as the total number of patients requiring allogeneic transplantation after protocol treatment., 1 year after study entry
