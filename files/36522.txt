Ultrasound Guided Core Biopsy vs Fine Needle Aspiration for Evaluation of Axillary Lymphadenopathy
The study was performed to determine if either ultrasound guided core biopsy or fine needle aspiration of an axillary lymph node has superior sensitivity in detecting metastatic carcinoma from the ipsilateral breast.
Focus: Breast Cancer With Axillary Node Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Fine needle aspiration and core biopsy of lymph node|PROCEDURE: Axillary surgery|OTHER: Titanium marker
Fraction of metastatic nodes found at axillary surgery that were identified pre-surgically by FNA vs. core biopsy, Results of FNA cytology and core biopsy histology are compared to axillary surgery results., 1 week to 10 months
Pain associated with each type of percutaneous biopsy procedure, Patients were asked to report pain level during the 2 types of percutaneous biopsy., immediate at time of biopsy
Women with suspected or recently diagnosed breast cancer and ipsilateral abnormal appearing axillary lymph nodes underwent fine needle aspiration immediately followed by core biopsy of the same lymph node.Cytology results from the fine needle aspiration (FNA)and histology from the core biopsy were compared to surgical pathology from axillary node excision to determine if either method of percutaneous node sampling was more sensitive in detecting metastasis. Pain during each procedure was also compared.
