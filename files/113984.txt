Targeting CD5 CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of r/r CD5+ T-ALL
A Clinical Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of targeting CD5 CAR-T Cells in the treatment of r/r CD5+ T-ALL
T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD5 CAR T-cells
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Up to 28 days after Treatment|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events \[Safety and Tolerability\], Up to 2 years after Treatment
Overall response rate ,ORR, The proportion of patients with CR (complete response) /CRi (complete response with incomplete blood cell recovery) and PR (partial response)., Up to 12 weeks after CAR-T infusion|Duration of remission ,DOR, The time from CR/CRi and PR to disease relapsed or death due to disease progression after CAR-T infusion, Up to 1 years after CAR-T infusion|Progression Free Survival, PFS, The time from randomization or start of study treatment until objective tumor progression or death, Up to 2 years after Treatment|Overall survival, OS, The time from CAR-T infusion to death due to any cause, Up to 1 years after CAR-T infusion
In this study, 30 patients with relapsed refractory T-ALL were proposed to undergo CD5 CAR-T Cells therapy. Under the premise that its safety has been clarified in previous studies, further observation and evaluation of the effectiveness of CD5 CAR-T Cells therapy for relapsed refractory T-ALL; At the same time, on the basis of expanding the sample size, more safety data on CD5 CAR-T Cells treatment for relapsed refractory T-ALL were accumulated.
