Improving Theempowerment in Patients With Severe Breast Fibrosis Radio-induced Treated by Pravastatin : Benefit of e-PROs (Electronic " Patient Reported Outcome ") on Breast-related Quality of Life
Conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is currently the therapeutic standard for patient with Breast Cancer. Symptoms are common among patients receiving this treatment. Ten percent of them will develop severe and chronic radio-induced toxicities, such as breast radio-induced-fibrosis impairing their quality of life (QoL). Yet, paying attention to symptom improves the empowerment and psychological adjustment to the disease. Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control, and to enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being.Benefits of systems to elicit e-PRO improve reliable measure of health-related quality of life (QoL) remains discussed.

To date, there are few specific treatments for these severe radio-induced fibrosis except the antifibrotic combinaison Pentoxifylline/Vitamin E with inconsistent result.

Since 2000, we and others have developed a mechanistic approach modulating the severity of RIF by targeting the Rho/ROCK/CTGF pathway, especially by inhibiting Rho activation by pravastatin. Our preclinical data, then followed by the Phase II PRAVACUR-01 trial, concluded that the use of pravastatin has an anti-fibrotic action on different experimental models and reduces the severity of the grade of fibrosis in 50% of patients.

Patients can now benefit from this new anti-fibrotic agent.

Taken as a whole, these data encourage combining both drug (pravastatin) and non-pharmacological intervention , in particular e-PRO, in the RIF management.
