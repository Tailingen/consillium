3D CEUS Generated Metrics in Kidney Mass: Wash_In_Slope, A study-specific model was created to predict kidney tumor type. The contrast-enhanced ultrasonogram (CEUS) Wash_In_Slope parameter was generated. This metric indicates the change in contrast with time in the mass using bolus imaging. Bolus imaging injects a small amount of contrast agent and monitors the contrast agent as it flows in (wash-in) and out (wash-out) of the body/mass. The intensity of the signal (the brightness of the image) is plotted over time to generate the time-intensity curve. The intensity of the signal (the brightness of the image) values range between 0=black, and 255=White.The Wash_In_Slope increases as the contrast agent is introduced to the body/mass. This value was generated by fitting the data to a linear equation. Increasing brightness is related to the slope of curve., Baseline- up to 3 minutes|3D CEUS Generated Metric in Kidney Mass: Wash_In_intercept, A study-specific model was created to predict kidney tumor type. The contrast-enhanced ultrasonogram (CEUS) Wash_In_intercept parameter was generated. This metric indicates the intensity level prior to infusion of contrast. The intensity of the signal (the brightness of the image) values range between 0=black, and 255=white. This value was calculated using an equation for a line which has a slope and the intercept. The values were negative because they were calculated (not measured)., Baseline- up to 3 minutes|3D CEUS Generated Metric in Kidney Mass: Wash_Out_Slope, A study-specific model was created to predict kidney tumor type.

This is a pilot cross-sectional study that compares contrast enhanced ultrasound to conventional ultrasound and contrasted MRI. Eligible patients will include anyone who has suspected kidney cancer and is scheduled for surgery, up to an anticipated total of 40 participants. Subject participation will be only for the day of CEUS study. There will be no follow-up period for this study. However, if results are encouraging, a longitudinal observational study may follow, and these same subjects would be eligible for enrollment. Eligible subjects will undergo a contrast enhanced ultrasound.

Following completion of imaging, all CEUS, MRI (within 4 months) and B-mode (at time of CEUS) US studies will be de-identified. Blinded radiologists will interpret images and provide an overall assessment of risk of malignancy to each kidney using the Bosniak criteria for each kidney lesion present. The Bosniak criteria places cystic lesions into one of 5 categories (I, II, IIF, III and IV) based on lesion characteristics. CEUS based diagnosis will be compared to the diagnoses on routine B-mode US and contrast-enhanced MRI.
