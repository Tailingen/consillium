USG Brachial Plexus Block for Upper Extremity Surgery
Ultrasound-guided (USG) brachial plexus (BP) block efficacy at the Supraclavicular (SCL), Lateral- Infraclavicular (LIC) and Axillary (AX) level: Randomized, observer-blinded study of the single-penetration multiple-injection-technique.

2. sever pain, Pain related to block performance reported by the patient right after block completion|Duration of time of block postoperatively (hours), Patient reported the time off ending sensory and motory block
The investigators will compare the BP block efficacy (for surgical anaesthesia) with the USG single-penetration multiple-injection-technique at the SCL, LIC and AX level for upper-extremity surgery (elbow, forearm, wrist, hand). The investigators want to investigate whether the single-penetration multiple-injection-technique would provide for safe surgical anaesthesia with lower volumes of local anaesthetics than has previously been described in a comparative study at the three different levels.

120 patients will prospectively be randomized to an USG BP block administered as a single-penetration multiple-injection-technique at one of three different levels: (1) SCL (2) LIC (3) AX. Ropivacaine 0.75% (20 mL) will be used for all blocks prior to surgery.
