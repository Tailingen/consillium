13-Cis Retinoic Acid With or Without Vitamin E for Prevention of Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: 13 Cis retinoic acid may prevent the development of cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 13-cis retinoic acid with or without vitamin E for chemoprevention or observation of cancer in persons at high risk of developing lung cancer.
Drug Toxicity|Lung Cancer
DRUG: 13-cis retinoic acid|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Tocopherol
Treatment failure, Treatment "failure" defined as histologic progression (any increase in the maximum histologic score) or failure to return for follow-up bronchoscopy, Three years
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if alpha tocopherol can reduce the toxicities of low dose 13-cis retinoic acid administered for one year.
* To access the adequacy of the collected specimens for studies of intermediate endpoint markers.
* to establish a depository of biologic specimens for future studies of new biomarkers.

  * Arm 1: Patients receive oral 13-cis retinoic acid daily.
  * Arm 2: Patients receive oral 13-cis retinoic acid and oral vitamin E daily.
  * Arm 3: Patients undergo observation only. Treatment continues in arms I and II for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed annually for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (33 Arm 1, 33 Arm 2, and 34 Arm 3) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
