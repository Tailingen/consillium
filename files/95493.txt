OLIGOS: Impact of Treatment on Primary Tumour in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Oligometastatic Neoplasia of the Prostate
The proposed study consists of a multicentre prospective observational study involving patients with oligometastatic prostatic neoplasia defined according to CHAARTED criteria.

The aim of the study is the creation of a registry including patients with newly diagnosed OMPCa, belonging to the main urological centres in the Triveneto region, in order to evaluate the oncological outcomes and the impact on the quality of life of local treatment of the primary neoplasm (surgical or radiotherapy) in addition to systemic hormonal treatment (ADT as monotherapy or in combination with Docetaxel/androgen receptor signal inhibitors (ARTA)).

The above criteria define 'high metastatic volume' disease with the following parameters

* ≥ 4 bone metastases, including at least one outside the spine and pelvis
* Presence of visceral metastases Consequently, patients included in the study should not have the above-mentioned characteristics.
Oligometastatic Prostate Carcinoma
Overall survival (OS), Impact of primary tumour treatment in addition to systemic therapy on overall survival (OS) in patients with new-onset oligometastatic prostate neoplasia., from the start date of the chosen treatment to the date of the subject's death from any cause, up to 3 years
Cancer-specific survival, CSS is defined as the time (quantified in months) from the start date of the chosen treatment and the subject's death caused by the malignancy., from the start date of the chosen treatment to the subject's death caused by the malignancy, up to 3 years.|CRPCa development, Serum testosterone levels \< 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L in association with biochemical progression or radiological progression, From the date of randomization up to 3 years|Radiological progression-free survival, Definition of radiological progression (r-PFS): time from treatment start date to radiological progression (appearance of two or more new lesions on bone scintigraphy or appearance of visceral lesions)., From the treatment start date to radiological progression, up to 3 years|Quality of life assessment, Assessment of QoL using the EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)19, From admission to discharge, assessed up to 3 years|Quality of life assessment, Assessment of QoL using the EPIC-26 Short Form questionnaire., From admission to discharge, assessed up to 3 years|Complications, Evaluation of complications related to radiotherapy treatment, according to CTCAE v5.0 and surgical treatment, evaluated according to the Clavien Dindo classification, From admission to discharge, assessed up to 3 years
