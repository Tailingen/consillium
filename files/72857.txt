Radiation Therapy Combined With Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Mixed Gliomas
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, carmustine, and lomustine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and temozolomide to see how well they work compared to radiation therapy and carmustine or lomustine in treating patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or mixed gliomas.

(Phase III) Overall Survival (OS), Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. Per the protocol, the pilot arms were not included in the Phase III analyses., From randomization to date of death. Patients are followed until death. Analysis occurs after 155 deaths have been reported, estimated at 5.5 years from the study opening.|(Phase I) Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) on the Two Pilot Arms, Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v2.0. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event (AE). The CTCAE v2.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3+ pulmonary toxicity, grade 4+ thrombocytopenia (\< 25,000 for 5 days), neutropenia (\< 500/microl for 7 days), or neutropenia of any duration with fever requiring hospital admission after one dose reduction of 50% in BCNU. A 20% rate of grade 3+ pulmonary toxicities or a 40% rate of grade 4+ thrombocytopenia and neutropenia was considered unacceptable for a treatment arm combining RT, TMZ, and BCNU., From start of treatment to 3 months
(Phase III) Time to Tumor Progression (TTP), Three-year rate is reported. Progression is defined as a radiographic increase in size of the lesion by \> 25%, recurrence of the study lesion, or the development of new lesions, confirmed by imaging. Time to tumor progression was estimated using the cumulative incidence function (CIF) on tumor progression, with death as a competing risk. Per the protocol, the pilot arms were not included in the Phase III analyses., From randomization to date of death. Patients are followed until death. Analysis occurs after 155 deaths have been reported, estimated at 5.5 years from the study opening.|(Phase III) Number of Patients With Grade 3 or Higher Toxicity, Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v2.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v2.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE. The number of patients with grade or higher toxicity was calculated overall and for non-hematologic toxicity only. Per the protocol, the pilot arms were not included in the Phase III analyses., From randomization to date of death. Patients are followed until death. Analysis occurs after 155 deaths have been reported, estimated at 5.5 years from the study opening.|(Phase III) Survival Time by MGMT Status, Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. Tumor tissue samples were analyzed for methylation status of methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), classified as methylated vs. unmethylated., From randomization to date of death. Patients are followed until death. Analysis occurs after 155 deaths have been reported, estimated at 5.5 years from the study opening.|(Phase III) Progression-free Survival by MGMT Status, Progression is defined as a radiographic increase in size of the lesion by \> 25%, recurrence of the study lesion, or the development of new lesions, confirmed by imaging. Progression-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of progression or death from any cause and is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. Tumor tissue samples were analyzed for methylation status of methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), classified as methylated vs. unmethylated., From randomization to date of death. Patients are followed until death. Analysis occurs after 155 deaths have been reported, estimated at 5.5 years from the study opening.
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or mixed gliomas treated with radiotherapy combined with temozolomide vs carmustine or lomustine vs temozolomide and carmustine (arm discontinued as of 8/15/02).
* Compare the relative toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.
* Correlate molecular analyses with overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50 vs 50 and over), Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%), and prior surgery (biopsy only vs resection).

Phase I

* Pilot Arms I and II: Prior to initiating the randomization to 1 of 3 treatment arms in phase III, Patients are accrued to Arm III regimen to determine tolerability.

Phase III

* Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (3rd arm was dropped).

  * Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 of the first week of radiotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12 courses.
  * Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV or lomustine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 of the first week of radiotherapy and a second course on days 56-58. Chemotherapy repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 6 courses.
  * Arm III (dropped, did not open): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive carmustine IV or lomustine IV over 3 hours on day 5 and oral temozolomide (2 hours after completion of carmustine or lomustine infusion) on days 1-5 of the first week of radiotherapy. Combination chemotherapy repeats every 8 weeks for 6 courses.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Phase I: 30 patients; Phase III: 454 patients (227 per treatment arm) within 4 years.
