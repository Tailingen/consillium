Use of Cone Beam Kilovoltage Imaging in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer
To evaluate the use of cone beam computed tomography in treating head and neck to hopefully reduce side effects
Head and Neck Neoplasms
DEVICE: PTV Reduction
Average Interfraction Shift of Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy, Determine the magnitude of the systematic error of patient positioning as determined by cone beam CT (CBCT) and the desired placement based on the treatment planning CT scan.

Every day, prior to radiation treatment, a CBCT will be performed. The CBCT images will be compared to the radiation therapy planning CT image just taken., Daily prior to radiation|Average Residual Error Motion of Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy, To determine the magnitude of random variance (random error) in radiotherapy treatment of head and neck neoplasms, Daily after each radiotherapy treatment
The general purpose of this study is to evaluate Kilovoltage (kv) Imaging, specifically the Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan device, to assess the accuracy of radiation therapy treatment delivery for patients with head and neck neoplasms
