Use of Indocyanine Green During Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.
Standard treatment of local or locally advanced prostate cancer is radical prostatectomy (RRP) surgery. During RRP in certain patients extended lymph node dissection (ELND) is recommended. to detect eligible patients for ELND some nomograms based on clinical factors of them is used. The Briganti nomogram is one of them. If the patient has 7% or more probability on Briganti nomogram, then ELND is recommended. But ELND is complicated surgical procedure and may cause labor lost and cost.

It is aimed here to show whether the ICG based fluorescence imaging during laparoscopy may yield higher accuracy to detect metastatic LNs than the conventional ELND?

50 patients with diagnosis of local or locally advance prostate cancer and having LN invasion probability between 7-50% on 2018 Briganti Nomogram will be included to this study.

Before Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRRP), ICG is injected left and right lobe of the propagate during cystoscopy.

Extended LND is performed in all patients. But before it, fluorescence imaging will be done, and ICG positive lymph nodes (LN) are dissected and sent pathology separately.

Positive LN yield pf ICG guided LND and conventional LND is compared.
