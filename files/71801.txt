Effect of Pentoxifylline on Preventing Chemotherapy-induced Toxicities in Patients with Breast Cancer
This clinical trial is a randomized clinical trial that aims to assess the usefulness of adding pentoxifylline to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment protocol of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide fllowed by taxane for breast cancer patients to decrease the incidence of developing toxicities, and enhance the quality of patient life using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. The participant will administer Pentoxifylline oral tablets three times per day along with the treatment protocol, starting from the first doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide cycle till the end of the chemotherapy cycles. The researchers will compare the incidence and grade of mucosities, neuropathy, and other chemotherapy-related toxicities in the presence or absence of oral pentoxifylline.
