SHR-1701 for Consolidation Therapy After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Inoperable Stage III NSCLC
This is a phase II, open-label, single arm study, aiming to investigate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1701 consolidation therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
NSCLC, Stage III
DRUG: SHR-1701
AE, Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Related TEAEs by Severity, From enrollment until confirmed disease progression; up to a maximum of approximately 2 years.|PFS, progression-free survival, Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression; up to a maximum of approximately 2 years.
ORR, objective response rate, Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression; up to a maximum of approximately 2 years.|DCR, disease control rate, Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~6 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression; up to a maximum of approximately 2 years.|OS, overall survival, From baseline until death due to any cause; up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.
The PACIFIC trial showed that durvalumab consolidation therapy significantly improved PFS and OS versus placebo for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy. Pacific regimen has become the standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. SHR-1701, a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a mAb against PD-L1 fused with the extracellular domain of TGF-Î² receptor II, has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in early clinical trials. In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1701 consolidation therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in inoperable stage III NSCLC.
