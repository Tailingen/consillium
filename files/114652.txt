A Study of BL-M07D1 + Pertuzumab With or Without Taxane Versus Taxane + Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
This trial is a registered phase III, randomized, open and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BL-M07D1 + Pertuzumab in combination with or without taxane regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The study is divided into a single-arm study phase (Phase II) and a randomized controlled study phase (Phase III).
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: BL-M07D1|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Taxane
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Pathological complete response (pCR) rate will be investigated., Up to approximately 48 months
Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time between the day the subject is randomized and the first occurrence of any event., Up to approximately 48 months|Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of radical surgery to the presence of ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence of invasive breast cancer, locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the day the subject is randomized and the subject's death., Up to approximately 48 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-M07D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M07D1., Up to approximately 48 months
