IOPTH Usefulness for Predicting Successful Surgery in Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a multisystemic syndrome that affects calcium and bone homeostasis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite medical treatment, 1-2% of patients require parathyroidectomy anually. The use of an intraoperative paratohormone protocol (IOPTH) to predict cure still in debate, due to the lack of standardized protocols, the use of different assays and uneven PTH clearance. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of an IOPTH in patients with SHPT for predicting successful surgery after parathyroidectomy.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Intraoperative Paratohormone
Successful surgery, Biochemical response to subtotal prathyroidectomy, 24 hours
PTH drop, Drop from baseline, aiming a drop \>70%, 15 minutes and 30 minutes after resection
A prospective observational study (cohort) was performed in patients who were submitted to parathyroidectomy by an endocrine surgeon for SHPT. All were submitted to a bilateral neck exploration with a subtotal parathyroidectomy. Three IOPTH determinations were withdrawn: at anesthetic induction (PTH0), 15 minutes (PTH15), and 30 minutes (PTH30) after completion gland resection. Another sample was taken 24 hours after the procedure (PTH24), values \<150pg/mL defined a successful surgery and patients were assigned to the successful or unsuccessful group. IOPTH drop was analyzed to predict successful surgery with drops of 70% and 90% at 15 and 30 minutes.
