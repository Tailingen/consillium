Leveraging Lung Cancer Screening to Optimize Screening Outcomes and COPD Management: COPD in LCS Registry
The COPD in LCS Registry will identify and characterize individuals who have functional or radiographic evidence of COPD and are receiving lung cancer screening. Clinical information will be obtained from study participants including symptom burden, lung cancer risk, spirometry, imaging characteristics, and peripheral blood eosinophils.
COPD - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
COPD diagnosis based on meeting spirometric criteria, Will be based on meeting spirometric criteria for COPD (FEV\^1/FVC =\< 0.7) and have \>1% low attenuation area on low-dose CT for LCS, 2 years|Accrual rate, Will be reported using percentages and 95% exact confidence intervals., 2 years|Intervention compliance rate, Will be reported using percentages and 95% exact confidence intervals., 2 years|Follow-up retention rate, Will be reported using percentages and 95% exact confidence intervals., 2 years
