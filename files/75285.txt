Multi-omics Analysis to Characterize the Invasive Evolution of Pulmonary Subsolid Nodules
Current clinical follow-up frequency and treatment timing for pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSNs) rely mostly on whether the nodules grow, which may not accurately reflect the pathological status, and may lead to unnecessary follow-ups. This study aims to use multi-omics techniques to dynamically observe the growth and invasiveness evolution process of SSNs and uncover its invasiveness mechanism. Radiological characteristics of SSNs in different invasiveness stages were also analyzed and summarized by analyzing preoperative CT. This can overcome the bottleneck of invasiveness assessment in the growth process of SSN and provide scientific evidence for the scientific management and clinical treatment timing choice of SSN patients, thus facilitating the rational allocation of medical resources and prolonging the expected survival of national health.

Accuracy of subsolid nodule invasive diagnosis, The efficacy of screening features for SSN invasiveness was compared to pathological diagnosis, using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
This prospective observational cohort study aims to recruit 120 patients with subsolid nodules (SSNs) and 100 healthy volunteers. Enroll 120 patients with SSNs planned for surgery and 100 healthy volunteers. Sequence blood and tissue samples from patients and compare the relevance of biomarkers between the two. Use blood from healthy volunteers as blank controls. Additionally, analyzes radiological characteristics of SSNs at different invasive stages using preoperative CT.
