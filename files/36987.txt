Study of 0.1% Uracil Topical Cream (UTC) for the Prevention of Hand-Foot Syndrome
The purpose of this research study is to see if combining uracil cream (UTC) with capecitabine (Xeloda) can prevent Hand-Foot Syndrome. The study will also see what effects UTC and capecitabine may have in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Capecitabine is used in the treatment of human breast cancer among other human cancers. Following absorption, capecitabine is converted enzymatically to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The administration of capecitabine or 5-FU can cause a cutaneous toxicity known as hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). HFS is progressive with dose and duration of exposure to 5-FU or capecitabine. HFS is characterized by progressive redness and cracking of hands and feet. Currently, there are no approved therapies for HFS.
