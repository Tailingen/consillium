IR-guided Ablation (IRGA) Combined With Stereotactic Ablative Radiation (SABR) for Large Lung Tumors
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy when given together with ablation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or lung metastases. Ablation therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells. Ablation therapy, such as microwave ablation kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving ablation therapy together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level where less than or equal to 33% patients incurred a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT will be defined as an acute (within 30 days) or subacute (31-90 days) irreversible grade 3 or any grade 4-5 toxicity (using National Cancer Institute \[NCI\]-Common Toxicity Criteria \[CTC\] version 4.0 criteria) that is possibly, probably, and definitely attributed to the therapy., 30 to 90 days

This is a dose-escalation study of stereotactic body radiation therapy.

Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy once daily (QD) for a total of 5 fractions and then undergo IRGA (either radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation) 1 week later.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
