Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection as First-Line Therapy of High-Risk Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The goal of this is Single-Arm, Multicenter, Open-Label Clinical Study is to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Injection(Axi-cel) as First-Line Therapy of High-Risk Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
CAR-T Cell Therapy|High-risk Large B-cell Lymphoma (LBCL)
DRUG: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
Complete Response (CR) Rate Per the Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, CR Rate is the percentage of participants with CR (complete metabolic response (CMR); complete radiological response (CRR)). CMR: positron emission tomography (PET) 5-point scale (5-PS) scores of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake ≤ mediastinum), 3 (uptake \> mediastinum but ≤ liver) with/without a residual mass); no new lesions; and no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow (BM). CRR: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter of lesion (LDi); no extralymphatic sites of disease; absent non-measured lesion (NMLs); organ enlargement regress to normal; no new sites; and bone marrow normal by morphology., Up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per the Lugano Classification as Determined by Study Investigators, ORR: percentage of participants with CR (CMR;CRR) or PR (partial metabolic response (PMR); partial radiologic response (PRR)). CMR: PET 5PS scores of 1 (no uptake above background, 2 (uptake ≤mediastinum), 3 (uptake \>mediastinum but ≤liver) with/without a residual mass; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in BM. CRR: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤1.5 cm in LDi; no extralymphatic sites of disease; absent NMLs; organ enlargement regress to normal; no new sites; bone marrow morphology normal. PMR: scores 4 (uptake moderately \>liver),5 (uptake markedly \>liver, new lesions) with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass; no new lesions; responding disease at interim/residual disease at end of treatment (EOT). PRR: ≥50% decrease in sum of the product of perpendicular diameters (SPD) of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extra-nodal sites; absent/normal, regressed, but no increase of NMLs; spleen regressed by \>50% in length beyond normal; no new sites., Up to 2 years|Complete Metabolic Response (CMR) - determined by investigator, CMR from axi-cel infusion (without additional anticancer therapy) based on investigator disease assessment according to PET-scan (using the Lugano Response Criteria), 3 months from axi-cel infusion|Duration of Response (DOR) Per the Lugano Classification, DOR is defined only for participants who experience an objective response after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and is the time from the first objective response to disease progression (PD) (Lugano classification) or death from any cause. Objective response is defined in outcome measure (OM) 2. PD is defined as a score 4 (uptake moderately \> liver) or 5 (uptake markedly \>liver and/or new lesions) with an increase in intensity of uptake from baseline; new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma at interim or end of treatment assessment; new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma rather than another etiology (eg, infection, inflammation); new or recurrent FDG-avid foci in bone marrow. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates were used for analysis., Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per Lugano classification or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAE), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant in a clinical trial participant, which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse event with onset on or after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. Serious adverse event was defined as an event that resulted in the following: death; life-threatening situation; in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; congenital anomaly or birth defect; and medically important event or reaction., Up to 2 years
Peak Serum Level of Granzyme B, Interferon-gamma (IFNg), Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, Peak is defined as the maximum post-baseline level of cytokine from baseline to Week 4., Up to Week 4|Peak Serum Level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Peak is defined as the maximum post-baseline level of cytokine from baseline to Week 4., Up to Week 4|Peak Serum Level of Ferritin, Peak is defined as the maximum post-baseline level of cytokine from baseline to Week 4, Up to Week 4|Proportion of participants experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in physical functioning and fatigue (EORTC QLQ-C30), Up to 2 years
