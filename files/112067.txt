A Research Program Targeting Pre- and Peri-transplant Optimization Program (R-PPOP)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of a research pre- and peri-transplant optimization program (R-PPOP) to improve multiple domains of health including physical function, cognitive function, mental health, and diet and nutrition for patients planning to undergo or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).
