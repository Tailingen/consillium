Study Assessing Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CC-223 With Either Erlotinib or Oral Azacitidine in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this first study combining an investigational dual mTOR inhibitor, CC-223, with other agents (erlotinib or the investigational agent, oral azacitidine) is to establish a maximum tolerated dose level for each combination in order to evaluate their effects in future clinical trials for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
