A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of CDX-0158 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a dose-escalation Phase 1 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose, and the safety profile of CDX-0158 in patients with KIT-positive advanced solid malignancies refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.
