Comparative Analysis of Short-Term Therapeutic Effects Between the π-Shaped and Overlap Methods for Esophagogastrostomy in Totally Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy
As of now, although the safety of π-shaped anastomosis and the overlap method has been separately discussed in different contexts, there have been few studies considering a direct comparison of the results of these two methods.

This article aims to explore the differences in the short-term therapeutic effects, surgical effectiveness, and safety between laparoscopic total gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy using the overlap method and the π-shaped method. The goal is to provide new reference points for surgeons in the clinical decision-making process regarding the choice of anastomotic techniques during totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy.
