Tumor Treating Fields for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: Two Emulated Trials With Chinese Multi-Hospital Based Real-World Data
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the effectiveness of Optune® (Tumor Treating Fields) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) in China. The main question it aims to answer are:

* The efficacy of Optune® as an concomitant/adjuvant to radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients.
* The effectiveness of Optune® given concomitantly with RT and TMZ in newly diagnosed GBM patients, compared to RT and TMZ alone.

Participants will:

* Receive or not receive TTFields.
* Concomitantly or adjuvantly receive TTFields.

* The effectiveness of Optune® given concomitantly with RT and TMZ in newly diagnosed GBM patients, compared to RT and TMZ alone.

Participants will:

Step 1:

* Treatment arm I: Patients receive standard RT + TMZ, followed by maintenance TMZ, with Optune® starts during peri-radiotherapy period (2 month before to 3 months after radiotherapy). The duration of TTFields lasts for at least 2 months.
* Treatment arm II: Patients receive RT and TMZ alone, followed by maintenance TMZ concomitant.

Step 2:

* Treatment arm I: Patients receive TTFields at 200 kHz to the brain using the Optune® System together with RT and TMZ, followed by maintenance TMZ concomitant with the Optune® treatment. The duration of TTFields lasts for at least 2 months. If the subject is assigned to this treatment arm, Optune® therapy will begin no later than the 7th day of RT and TMZ treatment.
* Treatment arm II: Patients receive RT and TMZ alone, followed by maintenance TMZ concomitant with TTFields at 200 kHz to the brain using the Optune® within 3 months after radiotherapy for at least 2 months.

Researchers will compare the overall survival of each arm to see if TTFields demonstrates an improvement in survival outcomes within the Chinese population in real-world practice, and whether this efficacy is further enhanced when combined with RT and TMZ.
