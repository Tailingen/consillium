Effect of Cyclosporine Drug Interaction on the Absorption, Metabolism and Elimination of CHF6001 in Healthy Volunteers. Drug-Drug Interaction 2 (DDI2) Study
The main goal of this pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers is to evaluate the potential effect of cyclosporine (probe inhibitor of P glycoprotein \[P-gp\] and breast cancer resistance protein \[BCRP\] transporters) on CHF6001 (Tanimilast) systemic exposure following single dose administration, by comparing the area under the curve (AUC) from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0 t) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of CHF6001 with and without cyclosporine. Participants will receive CHF6001 alone in Treatment Period 1, then CHF6001 after oral cyclosporine in Treatment Period 2, in order to evaluate the cyclosporine drug interaction on CHF6001 systemic exposure. The two treatment periods will be separated by a wash out period of 14 to 17 days.
