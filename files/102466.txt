Interferon Toxicities in Melanoma Treatment
The primary objective of this study is to quantify and compare the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in patients with stage III melanoma before and after initiation of interferon (IFN) therapy in a real-world setting. A secondary objective is to quantify annual costs and resource utilization before and after IFN initiation among patients with stage III melanoma in a real-world setting.
Stage III Melanoma
