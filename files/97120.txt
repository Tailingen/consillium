A Study of Chinese Herbal Compound Dendrobium Huoshanense Granules in NCRT for Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The study evaluates the addition of Chinese Herbal Compound Dendrobium Huoshanense Granules to capecitabine and irinotecan in neoadjuvant chemoradiation(CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer. Half of participants will receive CRT with Dendrobium Huoshanense Granules, while the others will receive CRT with placebo. We will evaluate whether Dendrobium Huoshanense Granules can enhance the immune function and alleviate symptoms caused by the tumor and CRT .
