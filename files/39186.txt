Mammaglobin-A DNA Vaccine for Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine in metastatic breast cancer patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine
Evaluate safety of mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine, WUSM-MGBA-01, 30 days after completion of treatment
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine, WUSTL-MGBA-01. Immunogenicity will be measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function., 52 weeks
This is a phase I open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The plasmid mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be formulated as a naked plasmid DNA vaccine (WUSM-MGBA-01). The hypothesis of this study is that the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and capable of generating measurable CD8 T cell responses to mammaglobin-A. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the mammaglobin-A DNA vaccine as measured by ELISPOT analysis, a surrogate for CD8 T cell function.
