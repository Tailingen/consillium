Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Patients who have not had an event will be censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting the patient was free of progression. Progression will be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 2 years
PFS Rate, PFS is defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment until disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Patients who have not had an event will be censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting the patient was free of progression. Progression will be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the date of starting maintenance treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) until death. Alive patients will be censored at the date of last known to be alive., Up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Related Toxicity and Adverse Events, Safety of the intervention will be reported as the incidence of treatment-related toxicity, including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs), in study participants using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 9 months
