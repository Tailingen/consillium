Safety and Efficacy Study of a BTK Inhibitor in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib (PCI-32765) in relapsed/refractory de novo activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal-cell B-Cell (GCB) Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
Diffuse Large Cell B-lymphoma
DRUG: ibrutinib
Percentage of Patients With an Overall Response to Study Drug, The primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to the revised International Working Group Criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Cheson et al, 2007), as assessed by the investigator., The median follow up time on the study for all treated participants is 1.7 months (range 0.1- 32.3 months)
Number of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Participants will be followed until progression of the disease or start of another anticancer treatment. The clinical database captured all AEs from baseline through end of treatment. Treatment Emergent AEs were collected pre-dose, at the beginning of each cycle and 30 days post last dose of study drug, unless related to study drug., Adverse events determined to be related to study drug are collected from first dose until study exit (approximately 3 years).|Ibrutinib and Its Metabolite (PCI-45227) AUC0-24h After Repeat Dosing of PCI-32765, Treatment Group 1 PK collection schedule:

Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 24 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 8: Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 24 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 15: Pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 22: Pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose

Treatment Group 2 PK collection schedule:

Cycle 1 Day 8: Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4 and 7 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 15: Pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose Cycle 1 Day 22: Pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose Cycle 3 Day 1: Pre-dose, 1, 2, and 4 hours post-dose, Performed during the first month of receiving study drug.
The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib administered at 560 mg once per day in relapsed or refractory de novo ABC and GCB DLBCL, and to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib administered at 840 mg once per day in relapsed or refractory de novo ABC DLBCL.

The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a fixed daily oral dosing regimen of ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory de novo DLBCL.
