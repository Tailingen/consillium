FMT in Checkpoint Inhibitor-mediated Diarrhea and Colitis
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the outcome of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated diarrhea/colitis (IMC) treated with faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.

The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility, pilot efficacy, and safety of FMT for patients with IMC.

Participants will be treated two times with capsule FMT or placebo capsules in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention treatment will be an add-on to the patients' standard treatment for IMC.

Researchers will compare the FMT-treated group to the placebo-treated group to see if FMT promotes remission of IMC.
