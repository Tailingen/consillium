Treatment period: From the time of transplantation, after screening by inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients who meet the criteria are enrolled and given maintenance therapy with Selinexor in combination with azacitidine (Selinexor: 40 mg/weekly, administered on D1; azacitidine: 50 mg/m2\*5d; every 28 days for a cycle of treatment, for at least one year of medication, or until progression of the disease, or until the development of intolerable toxicity, whichever comes first)
