A Prospective Single-center Randomized Controlled Trial of Robotic Surgery with Transrectal Resection Specimens (NOSES-IV) and Traditional Assisted Robotic Surgery for the Treatment of High Rectal and Sigmoid Colon Cancer
This study aimed to compare the short-term efficacy of robotic radical resection of high rectal cancer and sigmoid colon cancer (NOSES-IV) with transrectal resection specimens and traditional robotic surgery in the treatment of high rectal cancer and sigmoid colon cancer. At the same time, the safety and advantages of robotic radical resection of high rectal cancer and sigmoid colon cancer (NOSES-IV) with transrectal resection specimens and traditional robotic surgery in the treatment of high rectal cancer and sigmoid colon cancer were compared.
