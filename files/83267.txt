Study of RP3 Monotherapy and RP3 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Solid Tumours
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single agent dose escalation and combination treatment study of RP3 in adult participants with advanced solid tumors, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP3 both as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RP3.

RP3 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) that expresses exogenous genes (anti-CTLA-4 antibody, CD40 ligand and h4-1BBL) designed to directly destroy tumors and generate an anti-tumor immune response
