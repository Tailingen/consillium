Short and Long Term Effects of a Physical Therapy Program After Breast Cancer Surgery
Objectives: To evaluate the pressure pain threshold, shoulder biomechanics, cardiorespiratory function and the quality of life associated with the short and long-term physical therapy rehabilitation following breast cancer surgery. Methodology: The study presents three objectives and involves three groups of participants. Objective 1 is to develop a topographic map of pressure pain in the shoulder (using a digital pressure algometer), evaluate the biomechanics of the shoulder (using a digital inclinometer and load card), cardiorespiratory function (through frequency variability resting heart rate and distance traveled, through the six-minute walk test) and quality of life (through questionnaires of quality of life, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, upper limb functionality, fatigue and level of physical activity) between a group of women prior to the operation of breast cancer (experimental group, n = 36) and a group of asymptomatic controls for shoulder pain (control group, n = 18). Objective 2 is to evaluate the possible changes in the pain map over 24 weeks of supervised kinetic intervention (Supervised Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18, will begin after drainage, frequency 3 times per week and duration of 60 minutes each session) compared to unsupervised kinetic intervention (Home Physiotherapy experimental group, n = 18, participants will receive an exercise booklet). Objective 3 is to evaluate the biomechanics of the shoulder, cardiorespiratory function and the quality of life with respect to the experimental group with and without kinesic supervision. To achieve objective 1, two baseline evaluations will be carried out in both experimental and control groups (considering the month prior to the surgery of the experimental group) and the average of the evaluations will be considered evaluation 1. To achieve objectives 2 and 3, evaluation 2 (after 4 weeks of intervention), 3 (after 12 weeks of intervention) and 4 (after 24 weeks of intervention) will be performed. The statistical analysis will include the examination of qualitative and quantitative variables. Statistical tests will be applied according to the normality of the data and a significance level of 5% will be adopted for all comparisons. Expected results: It is expected to identify sensory, biomechanical, cardiorespiratory and quality of life alterations in the experimental group, compared to the control group. In addition, after 24 weeks of intervention, the supervised experimental group will show improvement in all the aforementioned variables with respect to the unsupervised group.
