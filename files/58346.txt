OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effect of MC5-A on pain symptoms both immediately and over time.

II. To evaluate the effect of Calmare therapy on other non-pain symptoms. III. To evaluate the effect of MC5-A on daily opioid and other pain medication use.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo electric stimulation pain therapy comprising MC5-A Calmare therapy over 30 minutes once daily for 10 days. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
