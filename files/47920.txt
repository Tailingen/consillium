Laparoscopic Versus Open Liver Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to observe the curative effect and safety of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Overall survival, The overall survival of HCC patients after operation, 5 years
Disease free survival, The disease free survival of HCC patients after operation, 5 years|Incidence of postoperative complications, Incidence of postoperative complications, 1 month
Liver resection is the most important treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Open hepatectomy was regarded as a giant surgery because of its big incision, influence of the liver function, and long hospital stay. Laparoscopic hepatectomy was widely used since it was reported by Reich in 1991. With the constant innovation of laparoscopic technique and equipment, there is no penalty area in laparoscopic hepatectomy. The Louisville consensus proposed that the best indication for laparoscopic hepatectomy was the tumor diameter \< 5cm, located in segment II-VI.

Previous studies shows that compared with the open surgery, laparoscopic hepatectomy has the advantages of shorter operation time, less bleeding, shorter hospitalization time. The mortality, mobility, the overall survival and the disease-free survival was same in these two groups.

So far, however, the curative effect and safety research of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for HCC is limited to retrospective study and case-control study. A prospective, randomized, controlled study is urgently needed.

This study was proceeded to observe the curative effect and safety of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for HCC.
