Oral Glutamine and Thoracic/Upper Aerodigestive Tumors Radiation Toxicity
PROTOCOL FOR PREVENTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF GLUTAMINE TO AVOID RADIATE SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS UNDER RADIOTHERAPY IN THE CHEST AND HEAD \& NECK

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The purpose of the protocol is to study the acute and distant toxicity of the mucosa of the oral cavity and esophagus after radiotherapy for head-neck and tumors of the chest. Radiation therapy in all cases is a three-dimensional conformal technique with a linear accelerator.

INCLUSION CRITERIA

Patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy for Ca nasopharynx, hypopharynx, palate, tonsils, mouth base, parotid, tongue, cervix and esophagus as well as mediastinal and lung cancer.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Patients with psychiatric problems and inability to cooperate, as well as patients with gluten intolerance, as well as patients with hepatic encephalopathy or hyperammonemia, are excluded from the study.

METHODS

Oral glutamine administration starting 4 days before the start of radiotherapy and for a total of 3 months. The preparation is dissolved in water and taken orally 4 hours before radiotherapy and 4 hours before dinner.

FOLLOW UP

Immediately after completion of radiotherapy at 3, 6 and 12 months, orthoscopy (on symptoms) and oral mucosal examination will be performed on patients who have undergone cervical and mediastinal radiotherapy and their evaluation based on the EORTC-RTOG scale.
