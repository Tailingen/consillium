A Study to Determine Safety and Tolerability of GMI-1359 in Subjects With HR+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
This trial is being conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the effect the body has on the drug), and pharmacodynamics (the effect the drug has on the body) of GMI-1359 when given with standard-of-care treatment to subjects with HR+ metastatic breast cancer.
