Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous IDOV-SAFETM in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose escalation, phase I study to evaluate safety tolerability, MTD or MFD, pharmacokinetic profile, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamic profile of IDOV-SAFETM in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Oncolytic Virus injection(IDOV-SAFETM)
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as an adverse event that is considered to be drug-related and meets one of the Protocol definitions, Within day 21 after administration|Incidence of adverse events and severe adverse events, Graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0, Within day 85 after administration|MTD/MFD, To explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administration dose (MFD) of IDOV-SAFETM in patients with advanced solid tumors., Within day 21 after administration
The Pharmacokinetics characteristics of IDOV-SAFETM((biological distribution and viral expulsion)), 1. The level of (non-essential) viral DNA in tumor tissue;
2. Levels of viral DNA in blood, saliva and urine, Up to 2 days|Immunogenicity of IDOV-SAFETM, Neutralizing antibody titer, Up to 85 days|ORR, The sum of the proportion of subjects with CR or PR, Every 6 weeks (±7 days) after initial administration and every 12 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|DCR, The sum of the proportion of subjects with CR 、PR or SD, Every 6 weeks (±7 days) after initial administration and every 12 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|DOR, The time between the start of the first assessment of the tumor as CR or PR and the second assessment as PD(Progressive Disease) or death from any cause, Every 6 weeks (±7 days) after initial administration and every 12 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|PFS, The time, measured in days, from the date of first treatment to disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression and death were measured in terms of preoccurrence. Progression included radiographic progression or clinical progression as assessed by the investigator., Every 6 weeks (±7 days) after initial administration and every 12 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|OS, The time from the date of first treatment to death from any cause, measured in days, Up to death
The study is a single agent dose escalation which will use an accelerated and "3+3" design to evaluate escalating doses of IDOV-SAFETM.Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 13-19 evaluable participants enrolled. A Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) observation period of 3weeks was established before the entry of the first patient at the next dose level. After all subjects in the current dose group have completed the DLT observation period, the administration of the next dose group can only be started if the condition of dose escalation is met.
