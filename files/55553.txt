A Study of Etrumadenant and Zimberelimab in People With Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
Participants will have a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) that has spread beyond its original location (advanced). In addition, their DDLS either has come back after treatment (recurrent), has spread to different parts of your body (metastatic), or is unable to be removed surgically (unresectable). The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of etrumadenant and zimberelimab is an effective treatment for people with advanced DDLS.
