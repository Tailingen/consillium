Does Caffeine Reduce Postoperative Bowel Paralysis After Elective Colectomy?
Postoperative bowel paralysis is common after abdominal operations, including colectomy. As a result, hospitalization may be prolonged leading to increased cost. A recent randomized controlled trial from the University of Heidelberg showed that consumption of regular black coffee after colectomy is safe and associated with a significantly faster resumption of intestinal motility (Müller 2012). The mechanism how coffee stimulates intestinal motility is unknown but caffeine seems to be the most likely stimulating agent.

Thus, this trial addresses the question: Does caffeine reduce postoperative bowel paralysis after elective laparoscopic colectomy?

Patients after laparoscopic colectomy will receive either 100 mg caffeine, 200 mg caffeine, or 250mg corn starch (placebo) 3 times daily in identically looking gelatin capsules.

The study is a randomized, controlled trial, with blinding of physicians, patients and nursing stuff (evaluating the endpoints).

Primary endpoint will be the time to first bowel movement.
Postoperative Ileus|Laparoscopic Colectomy Without Stoma Formation|Colorectal Neoplasm|Diverticulitis
DRUG: Caffeine (100 mg)|DRUG: Caffeine (200 mg)|DRUG: corn starch (250 mg approx.)|OTHER: Radiopaque marker
Time to first bowel movement, Time from end of surgery (time of closing suture) until patient's first bowel movement (passage of stool) in hours.

A patient is considered to have met the primary endpoint when he or she had first tolerated food (recovery of upper GI function) and experienced a bowel movement for the first time (recovery of lower GI function)., 7 days
Time to first flatus, Time from end of surgery until patient's first flatus in hours. The passage of flatus will be determined by questioning the patient; the passage of a bowel movement will be determined by reference to nursing records or by the clinical judgment of the investigator or designee following questioning the patient., 7 days|Time to tolerance of solid food, Time from end of surgery until patient tolerates intake of solid food in hours. Tolerance of food is defined as the first time the patient is able to eat solid food (any food re-quiring chewing) without vomiting or significant nausea within 4 h after the meal, and without reversion to only enteral fluids., 7 days|Postoperative vomiting events, Number of times patient has to vomit., 7 days|Colonic passage time, On day 1, 2 and 3 after surgery patients take one capsule with radioopaque markers. On day 4 location and count of markers is determined by X-ray imaging and the colonic passage time is determined (Metcalf 1987)., 4 days|Actual postoperative hospital stay, Number of days from surgery until actual discharge., 30 days|Theoretical postoperative hospital stay, Days from surgery until patient would be fit for release. Often patients stay longer in hospital than clinically required. Thus, evaluation of theoretical hospital stay.

A patient is fit for release if:

* there had been bowel movement
* solid food is tolerated
* no serious pain
* unproblematic mobilisation
* surgical wound shows no sign of inflammation, or wound can be treated well in an outpatient setting
* normal inflammatory markers (≤135 mg/l C-reactive protein (CRP), ≤9 10⁹/l white blood cell count), 30 days|Daily doses of analgetics, Amount, type, and time of application of analgetics will be obtained from medical and nursing records., 30 days|Postoperative pain, evaluated on the numeric rating scale (0 - 10, steps of 1), 7 days|Postoperative mobilization, Scoring:

* 0: 24 h in bed
* 1: Out of bed only to go to bathroom
* 2: Out of bed on free will, 7 days|Overall fluid intake, all fluids in ml per day, 7 days|Blood pressure, 3 times daily, 7 days|Pulse, 3 times daily (or more often if required), 7 days|Intensive care, number of days in intensive care unit, 14 days|Well-being, well-being evaluating on day 2 and 4 after surgery using the Basle mental state scale as well as 5 additional items to evaluate the effects of caffeine. (Hobi 1985, Hobi 1989), 4 days|Sleep behaviour, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) on day 2 and 4 after surgery. (Parrott 1986), 4 days|Sleeping habits, Questionnaire evaluating duration and deepness of sleep., 4 days|Satisfaction with surgery, Questionnaire on day 4 about satisfaction of treatment, 4 days|Consumption of sleep inducing drugs, amount and type of sleep inducing drugs, 7 days
preoperative caffeine consumption, Questionnaire evaluation the caffeine consumption of patients (type of beverages, amount etc), before surgery
