A Study of Dasatinib With Concurrent Chemoradiation for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a maximum dose of 100 mg of dasatinib with concurrent chemoradiation can be tolerated in patients with chemotherapy naive stage III NSCLC in separate cohorts of locally advanced and potentially resectable disease.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Group 1: Radiation, Paclitaxel,Carbo, Dasatinib days 1-47|DRUG: Group 2: Radiation, Paclitaxel, Carbo, Dasatinib days 1-38
Number of Patients Who Came Off Study for Toxicity Using CTC Version 3.0, 6 patients came off study for toxicity, within 28 days after the last radiation treatment
Complete and Partial Response by CT Scan or MRI, within 30 days of last treatment
Describe the safety of maintenance dasatinib, 100 mg/day for 2 years, in patients with stage III NSCLC.

For patients with potentially resectable disease, to assess the pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant dasatinib, paclitaxel, carboplatin and 50.4 Gy concurrent radiation.

For patients with locally unresectable disease, to obtain radiographic response data following dasatinib, paclitaxel, carboplatin and 64.8 Gy radiation.
