Patient Derived Organoid-guided Personalized Treatment Versus Treatment of Physician's Choice in Breast Cancer
This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial is designed to study the efficacy and safety of organoid-guided personalized treatment （OGPT）versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in previously treated refractory breast cancer.

Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of radiographic progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause., Within approximately 48 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death from any cause., Within approximately 48 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The number of participants with objective response is assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through discontinuation of treatment. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response of complete response or partial response based on local radiologists/investigators' tumor assessments., Within approximately 48 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response was defined as the time interval between the date of first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) and the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., Within approximately 48 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease, Within approximately 48 months|Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events as assessed by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., Within approximately 48 months
This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial is designed to study the efficacy and safety of organoid-guided personalized treatment （OGPT）versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in previously treated refractory breast cancer. Molecular subtype, presence of visceral metastases, and number of prior chemotherapy treatments for advanced or metastatic disease will stratify randomization. subjects in the OGPT arm will receive the treatment predicted to be the most effective by PDO drug sensitivity screening, and subjects in the TPC arm will receive treatment of physician's choice. The primary population to be included in the study will be patients with refractory breast cancer who have received multiple lines of prior therapy and who have at least one measurable target lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
