CAMPFIRE: A Study of Ramucirumab (LY3009806) in Children and Young Adults With Synovial Sarcoma
This study is being conducted to test the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in combination with other chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed, recurrent, or refractory synovial sarcoma (SS) in children and young adults. This trial is part of the CAMPFIRE master protocol (NCT05999994) which is a platform to accelerate the development of new treatments for pediatric and young adult participants with cancer. Your participation in this trial could last 12 months or longer, depending on how you and your tumor respond.
Synovial Sarcoma
DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the first investigator-determined objective progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause in the absence of progressive disease. Participants known to be alive and without disease progression will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment or date of randomization, whichever is later., Baseline to Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 6.4 Months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), ORR is the best overall tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions., Baseline through Measured Progressive Disease (Up To 6.4 Months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or objective disease progression is observed, per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of documented disease progression or recurrence., Date of CR or PR to Date of Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 4.13 Months)|Complete Response (CR): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve CR, CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level., Baseline Up to 6.94 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Serum Concentration of Ramucirumab (Cmax), Cmax was the concentration of study drug in the blood after the dose is administered. It was measured post-dose and was summarized using descriptive statistics., 0.5 hours after the end of ramucirumab infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1|PK: Minimum Serum Concentration of Ramucirumab (Cmin), Cmin was the concentration of study drug in the blood immediately before the next dose was administered. It was measured pre-dose at all visits and was summarized using descriptive statistics., Prior to ramucirumab infusion on Day 8 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Day 1 of Cycle 5|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Anti-Drug Antibodies (TE-ADA), A TE-ADA evaluable participant is considered to be TE-ADA positive if the participant has at least one post baseline titer that is a 4-fold or greater increase in titer from baseline measurement (treatment-boosted). If baseline result is ADA Not Present, then the participant is TE ADA positive if there is at least one post baseline result of ADA Present with titer \>= 20 (treatment-induced)., Baseline Up to 6.94 months
