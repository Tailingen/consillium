5-Azacytidine (Azacytidine; Vidaza) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Azacytidine in fludarabine-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Richter's transformation, and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Leukemia
DRUG: 5-Azacytidine
Tumor Response Rate (Complete, Partial) of Azacytidine, Overall response rate includes percentage of participants with complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) responses using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria for response: Complete response defined as no palpable lymph nodes, liver or spleen and absence of symptoms. Neutrophil count \> 15,00/Mic L, and platelet count more than 100,000/MicL. Hemoglobin should be \> 11g/dl without transfusions. Lymphocyte count \<4000/micL. On bone marrow aspirate lymphocyte % should be \<30%, and biopsy showing no lymphocyte infiltrate. A partial response was defined as more than or equal to 50% decrease in lymph nodes and liver and spleen size. Neutrophils \> 1500/ micL or \>50 % improvement from baseline, platelet count \>100,000/micL or \>50 % improvement from baseline. Hemoglobin \>11g/dl or \>50% improvement from baseline. A reduction of \>50% in Leukocyte count or \<30 % lymphocytes with residual disease on biopsy for nodular PR., 3 to 8 weeks treatment cycles, continuation up to 1 year
Azacytidine is designed to block certain genes in cancer cells whose job is to stop the function of the tumor-fighting genes. By blocking the "bad" genes, the tumor-fighting genes may be able to work better.

Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have "screening tests." These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will have blood drawn (about 3 teaspoons) to check your kidney and liver function (routine blood tests). You may have a bone marrow aspiration performed (if you have not had one in recent weeks). To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive azacytidine by subcutaneous (just under the skin) injection every day for 7 days. This course of treatment will be repeated every 3-8 weeks, depending on the results of your routine blood tests.

Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of azacytidine, depending on if you experience any side effects. You will continue to receive treatment on this study unless the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects. If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study.

This is an investigational study. This is an investigational study. Azacytidine has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 37 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
