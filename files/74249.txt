The purpose of this study is to determine the tissue kinetics of ertapenem in colorectal tissue from three hours up to six hours (25% of dosing interval) after administration of ertapenem before an elective surgical intervention (open or laparoscopic surgery) at the colon/rectum. Subjects are patients. Hospitalized patients 18 years or older requiring elective surgical intervention (open or laparoscopic surgery) at the colon will be eligible for this study.
