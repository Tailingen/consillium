Incidence and nature of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness/injury, or concomitant medications that occurs within the DLT observation period of \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB.

Newly diagnosed glioblastoma:

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor, with a high mortality rate. The current standard of care (SoC) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma includes the combination of the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) with Radiotherapy (RT). The hypothesis of this study is to improve the outcome for participants by combining the current standard of care with the radioligand therapy \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB. Participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma enrolled into this trial will be treated with the standard regimen TMZ and RT, combined with \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 6 administrations. In cases where participants tolerate and benefit from \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB, they can receive an additional 4 doses (total up to 10 dose administrations). During this period, regular safety and efficacy assessments are planned on a weekly basis. The primary objective of this trial is to identify the recommended dose of \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB in combination with TMZ and RT in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to characterize the safety and tolerability of this treatment. For this reason, participants will be enrolled and treated in cohorts with increasing dose levels and the totality of available data will be used to define the recommended dose. Contrast enhanced MRI assessments are to be repeated every 8 weeks. Following treatment, all participants will be followed for up to 5 additional years for safety, progression of disease and survival. Participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will undergo a baseline \[68Ga\]Ga-NeoB PET/CT or PET/MRI after the surgery/biopsy of the tumor.

Recurrent glioblastoma:

Participants with recurrent glioblastoma carry a dismal prognosis and a short survival. The primary objective in recurrent glioblastoma is to determine the recommended dose of \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB as single agent and to characterize the safety and tolerability of this treatment. For this reason, participants will be enrolled and treated in cohorts with increasing dose levels and the totality of available data will be used to define the recommended dose. In this study, all participants with recurrent glioblastoma will undergo \[68Ga\]Ga-NeoB PET scan to assess GRPR expression during the screening period. \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB will be administered as a single dose every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 6 administrations. Up to 4 additional administrations of \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB may be considered if participants tolerate and benefit from \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB (total up to 10 dose administrations).
