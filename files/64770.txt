Circulating Tumor DNA Longitudinal Monitoring in Stage III-IV Lung Cancer Patients
Conduct a prospective study in multicenter to confirm the value of circulating tumor DNA in longitudinal monitoring of stage III-IV lung cancer patients.

ctDNA effective time, To explore the appropriate chemo/ radio/ target effective time (CET/RET/TET) through measurement and monitoring of ctDNA after anti-cancer therapies in advanced NSCLC., 6 months|ctDNA leading time, To investigate the precise leading time for ctDNA compared to conventional biomarker or image evaluation in detecting disease recurrence after radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy respectively., 1 year
Assess the accuracy of ctDNA, To assess the accuracy of ctDNA when imaging undetectable or difficult to assess, 1 year|Compared to conventional image, Compared to conventional image evaluation, to determine the consistency of ctDNA in treatment response of measurable lesion after radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy respectively, 1 year|Compared to traditional tumor markers, To explore the consistency for ctDNA in determining the efficacy of advanced NSCLC compared to tumor markers after radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy respectively, 6 months
The study consists of two phases, the first stage is the exploratory stage of blood collection point which is the appropriate effective time after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy. The second phase, which is the expansion of the first phase, is to determine the precise leading time of ctDNA relative to tumor biomarkers or image evaluation in determining the efficacy of advanced NSCLC cancer therapy. Both stages were divided into three subgroups: the chemotherapy group, the radiotherapy group, and the targeted therapy group.
