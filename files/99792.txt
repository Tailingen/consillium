Serum Concentration of Lidocaine After Local Injection During Mohs Micrographic Surgery
The primary objective of this study is to (1) determine whether local injection of lidocaine used during Mohs surgery will elevate serum lidocaine concentrations to a level that could cause systemic symptoms and (2) determine whether sustained high levels of serum lidocaine occur after intralesional anesthesia on the face and neck. This study is a cross-sectional study of 10 subjects with basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the face or neck requiring Mohs micrographic surgery. The study will consist of a brief questionnaire and blood draws during their Moh's surgical procedure.
