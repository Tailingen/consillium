UroCCR Database: French Research Network for Kidney Cancer
Within the framework for kidney cancer care, with the recent diversification of treatment modalities of these tumors and the deployment of the concept of multidisciplinary team, it was considered necessary to adapt the research tools to reality of health-care for patients with kidney cancer.

UroCCR is the French research network for kidney cancer, funded by the French National Cancer Institute as part of the call for projects for clinical and biological databases (BCB). Depending on the case presentation and disease evolution, more than a thousand of different variables can be recorded. At the same time, biological samples (plasma, urine, healthy and tumor tissues) are collected.

This database contains a considerable number of information and high added value since it is the result of multiple expertises that make it not only a multidisciplinary tool but also multicenter, allowing fundamental, translational and clinical research.

The UroCCR database is a national medico-scientific network focused on therapeutic management and applied research in kidney cancer.

Secondary objectives:

1. - Evaluate and compare different surgical approaches in the treatment of kidney cancer,
2. - Evaluate and compare safety/efficacy of different drugs in the treatment of kidney cancer.
