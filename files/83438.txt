Parts A and B will each have 2 Periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with a crossover design. Part B will be conducted only if results of Part A suggest a clinically meaningful effect of famotidine on savolitinib pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters. In both parts subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive one of the 2 treatment sequences: savolitinib alone first followed by crossover to the combination treatment of savolitinib+famotidine, or the reverse sequence. Subjects will be admitted for 4 days from one day before the first dose of the study drug and discharged 2 days after. There will be a washout period (no study treatment) of 14 days between the 2 Periods. The essential difference between the 2 parts is that in the combination treatment, famotidine will be administered 2 hours before savolitinib in Part A and 6 hours before savolitinib in Part B. A given subject will receive a total of 1 dose of famotidine and 2 doses of savolitinib during the study.

In this 2 part study, 16 subjects will be randomised in each part to ensure at least 14 evaluable subjects at the end of the last study period. If Part B is conducted, a total of 32 subjects overall are planned to be enrolled in the study. Additional subjects may be enrolled to ensure 14 evaluable subjects in each part if more than 2 subjects are deemed non evaluable.
