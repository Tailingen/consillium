Anti-HER2 Bispecific Antibody Zanidatamab (ZW25) Activity in Combination With Chemotherapy With/Without Tislelizumab
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity of zanidatamab in combination with docetaxel in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, and zanidatamab in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in participants with HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
