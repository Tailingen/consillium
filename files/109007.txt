Assessment of Progesterone Receptors in Breast Carcinoma by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Using Fluoro Furanyl Norprogesterone (FFNP)
The purpose of this study is to see if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with a radioactive form of the hormone progesterone called FFNP will give the same results as hormone receptor testing already performed on tissue used to diagnose breast cancer.
