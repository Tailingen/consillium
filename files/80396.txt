SHR-1316 Combined With Chemotherapy and Chest Radiotherapy in ES-SCLC
This study is a one arm, open, single center phase II study. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerance and preliminary efficacy of SHR1316 combined with chest radiotherapy after induction therapy.

This is a single-arm, single-center phase II study. Eligible subjects will receive the following treatment regimens: 4\~6 cycles of SHR1316 combined with EP/EC (etoposide, 100mg/m2, D1-3, q3w and cisplatin, 75mg/m², D1, q3w or carboplatin, AUC=5, D1, q3w). Patients with response sequentially received adebrelimab combined with chest radiotherapy based on investigator decision. Patients then the maintenance therapy with adebrelimab until disease progression or intolerable AEs.
