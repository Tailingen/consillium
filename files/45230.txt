Validation Study of a New Cytokine-based Dynamic Stratification Based on FLt3 Ligand Plasma Concentration Kinetic Profile and IL-6 Concentration During Induction of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The investigators have recently demonstrated the strong impact in terms of survivals of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FL) levels evaluated during intensive induction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Indeed, three FL kinetic profiles were delineated: i) sustained increase of FL concentrations between day (D) 1 and D22 (FLI group, n=26, good-risk), ii) increase from D1 to D15, then decrease at D22 (FLD group, n=22, intermediate-risk) and iii) stagnation of low levels (\<1000 pg/mL, FLL group, n=14, high-risk). However, with longer follow-up, the investigators have observed that FLI and FLD shared similar outcomes while FLL sub-group kept a very bad prognostic.

Because serum samples from this previous study (called the FLAM/FLAL study) had been frozen-stored, the investigators were able to conduct an ancillary study assessing the potential impact of the kinetics of 6 other cytokines: TNFalpha, stem-cell factor, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10 and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).. Only Il-6 level at D22 (\< or \>15.5 pg/mL) was associated with outcome allowing to distinguish between higher and lower survivals within the combined FLI/FLD sub-group.

A new prognostic risk-stratification can thus be proposed as follows: FLI/FLD with IL-6 \<15.5 pg/mL (favorable), FLI/FLD with IL-6 \>15.5 pg/mL (intermediate) and FLL (high-risk).

The aim of this new FLAMVAL study is to validate prospectively in a larger and independent cohort this prognostic risk-stratification i.e. that kinetic profile of FLT3L plasma level from D1 to D22 and Il6 plasma level at day 22 during induction of AML patients are predictive of overall and disease free survivals.

For that purpose, 201 newly diagnosed AML patients treated intensively in the 25 centres of the French Innovative Leukemia Organisation (FILO) will be included in the FLAMVAL study.
