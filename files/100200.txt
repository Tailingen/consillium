Low Dose Weekly Docetaxel Versus Pemetrexed in Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
Docetaxel and pemetrexed have been validated for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, tolerability is a concern with the docetaxel (tri-weekly 75 mg/m2 schedule). The investigators conducted this study to compare the efficacy and toxicity of weekly low-dose docetaxel versus tri-weekly pemetrexed for previously treated advanced NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: pemetrexed
Objective response rate, at least 3 cycles
PFS-progression free survival, the time from the first cycle of chemotherapy to documented progression, or death from any cause|OS-overall survival, from the start date of the treatment to death or to the last follow-up visit
We have been following a schedule of weekly low dose docetaxel (30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; 60 mg/m2 accumulated dose for each cycle) at our hospital in an effort to achieve better tolerability. We therefore performed an exploratory study, by statistical analyses, to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of such a low dose docetaxel schedule compared to that of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who have failed previous chemotherapy.
