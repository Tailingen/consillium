A French Multicenter Observational Retrospective Study of Rare Primary Liver Cancers
The aim of this French multicenter retrospective study is to describ rare primary hepatic cancers clinical, histological and radiological features, to obtain a biological tumor and blood collection, and to evaluate the efficacy of treatments received in clinical practice in order to determine optimal therapeutic sequences. This retrospective cohort will be the backbone of future translational studies aimed at identifying new molecular, histological, circulating and radiological tumor biomarkers, potentially useful at every stage of diagnosis and prognostic or theranostic evaluation.
