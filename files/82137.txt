Chronic Fatigue Following Acute Epstein-Barr Virus Infection in Adolescents
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by unexplained, disabling and long lasting fatigue, as well as pain, impaired memory, sleep difficulties and other symptoms. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection might precipitate CFS. In this study, 200 adolescents undergoing acute EBV infection will be followed prospectively, and also compared with a group of healthy controls. The aim is twofold:

* To identify factors that predispose to chronic fatigue among adolescents with acute EBV infection
* To compare pathophysiological features of patients with acute EBV infection with a group of healthy controls.

Possible risk factors for chronic fatigue 6 months after EBV-infection includes:

* Severity of the initial infection
* Immune responses characteristics
* Characteristics of the neuroendocrine stress response
* Cognitive functioning
* Emotional disturbances
* Genetics/ epigenetics of candidate genes
* Certain personality traits
* Critical life events
