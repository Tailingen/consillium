Genetic Analysis of Prostate Cancer to Identify Predictive Markers of Disease Relapse or Metastatic Evolution
Developing a genetic study on localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. The aim of the study is to identify genomic alteration predictive of metastatic recurrence in the context of primary heterogeneity, by using the next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques.

Identifying such biomarkers may be useful to detect a higher relapse risk, and thus lower the mortality rate.
