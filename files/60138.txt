The Voice as a Tool to Detect Recurrence of Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancer
The investigators will obtain three-monthly voice recordings and fiberendoscopic examinations of the larynx/hypopharynx for a minimal period of 6 months from all laryngeal/hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC/HPSCC) patients, who have successfully completed curative primary treatment, except those who underwent total laryngectomy. Furthermore, the investigators will ask the patients to fill out the voice handicap index-30 questionnaire (VHI-30) during each study visit. The VHI-30 allows to make a subjective assessment of the patients' own vocal problem. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and compliance of longterm regular voice monitoring in LSCC and HPSCC follow-up.
