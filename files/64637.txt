Intrapleural AdV-tk Therapy in Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusion
This is a phase I study of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). The primary objective is to test the safety of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy. Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy and biologic activity
Malignant Pleural Effusion|Lung Cancer|Mesothelioma|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AdV-tk + valacyclovir
Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, 8 weeks
Progression-free survival, 5 years|Overall survival, 10 years
The goal of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate if the administration of AdV-tk to patients with MPE followed by valacyclovir and chemotherapy is safe, can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy, and will have anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.

The first and second dose levels have been completed, and the study is currently expanded to enroll more patients to dose level 2 with Celecoxib.

Patients will receive one injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. The prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each AdV-tk injection. Celecoxib will be administered starting 3 days before AdV-tk and continuing for 2 days after AdV-tk administration.

Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy depends on the treating oncologist.
