A Study of TBio-4101 (TIL) and Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A multicenter trial to investigate TBio-4101, an autologous, neoantigen-selected, tumor-reactive TIL product, in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

This is a Phase 1 study to investigate TBio-4101. TBio-4101 is an autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy that utilizes tumor specific antigens to select, sort, and expand patient-specific tumor-reactive T-cells to be reinfused into the patient. The adoptive cell therapy is further enhanced through the use of non-myeloablative chemotherapy prior to TIL infusion, followed by the TIL plus IL-2 infusion. Low-dose radiation therapy is administered prior to and after TIL plus IL-2 infusion. Pembrolizumab is provided after the resolution of IL-2 toxicities. The trial is open to solid tumors of varying tumor mutational burdens.
