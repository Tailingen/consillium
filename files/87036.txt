A Retrospective and Prospective Real-world Study of Molecular Typing in the Treatment of Advanced Thyroid Cancer
This is a retrospective and prospective real-world clinical study of molecular typing in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer.

The retrospective study : Patients with advanced thyroid cancer who received precise treatment in our hospital from January 2020 to December 2023 were retrieved. The number of previous treatment lines was not limited. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, tumor treatment history, medication regimen, adverse reactions, molecular test results, survival follow-up results and other data were collected.

The prospective study : Patients with advanced thyroid cancer who received precise treatment in our hospital from January 2024 to April 2027 were enrolled.
Advanced Thyroid Cancer Patients Who Received Target Therapy
DRUG: dabrafenib plus trametinib with or without PD-1 antibody|DRUG: entrectinib or larotrectinib with or without anti-PD-1 antibdoy|DRUG: pralsetinib or selpercatinib with or without anti-PD-1 antibdoy|DRUG: anlotinib or anlotinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody|DRUG: lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibody|DRUG: Other Targets: precise treatment based on the target
Objective Response Rate(ORR), Complete remission rate+ partial remission rate, up to approximately 3 years
Duration of Response(DOR), Time from the date of first partial remission or complete remission to the date of disease progression, or death of any cause, or date of lost follow-up, whichever comes first, otherwise subject data were censored at time last known disease free., up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Complete remission rate+ partial remission rate+stable disease rate, up to approximately 3 years|Time to response(TTR), Time from the initiation of the treatment to the first remission, up to approximately 3 years|Progression Free Survival(PFS), Time from the date of enrollment to of disease progression, or death of any cause, or date of lost follow-up, whichever comes first, otherwise subject data were censored at time last known disease free., up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival(OS), Time from the date of enrollment to data of death from any cause, or date of lost follow-up, whichever comes first, and otherwise censored at time last known alive., up to approximately 3 years
