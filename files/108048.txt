Phase I/II Study of Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
A new type of treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy has recently been developed in hopes of improving the success of the treatment and improving the convenience to patients, while reducing the side effects. This study is developing stereotactic radiotherapy as a state-of-the-art treatment for lung cancer patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiotherapy
Local Control, One Year
Toxicity, One Year|Quality of Life, One Year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary Objectives

* To determine the efficacy of hypofractionated, image guided radiotherapy in treating patients with lung tumours, with the primary outcome being local control at one year.
* To determine the toxicity of high dose, small field,hypofractionated radiotherapy to the lung, based on the RTOG and CTCAE scales.
