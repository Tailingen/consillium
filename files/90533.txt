Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm
DRUG: bryostatin 1
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of bryostatin 1 administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine the duration of response and survival following bryostatin 1 in these patients.

OUTLINE: All patients receive bryostatin 1 by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression or 2 courses beyond complete remission. Response is assessed after every 4 courses. Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be entered into this study over 1.25 years.
