CO07204-Phase I/II of Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine & Sorafenib for Advanced Pancreatic & Biliary Carcinoma
This study involves the use of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and sorafenib which are all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of different cancers. Their use in this exact combination is considered experimental for the treatment of pancreas and biliary tract; however the combination has been tested in a preliminary trial. We are also testing a survey designed. The purpose of this research study is to investigate the chemotherapy drug sorafenib in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine chemotherapies for the treatment of pancreas and biliary tract cancers.to help patients report their side effects from chemotherapy treatments.

DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Sorafenib
Overall Response Rate, Response rate of participant to treatment, Up to 18 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time to progression, defined as number of days from day of first study drug administration to the day the patient experiences an event of disease progression or death; summarized using point estimates of the median time to progression and associated 95% confidence intervals for each stratum separately., Up to 18 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival, defined as number of days from the day of first study drug administration to the day the patient dies, summarized using point estimates of the median time to progression, and associated 95% confidence intervals, Up to 18 months
Primary Objectives

* To assess the overall safety of sorafenib when administered with "the 2DOC regimen" capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreas or biliary tract cancers.
* To define the dose limiting toxicity and maximally tolerated dose of this combination.
* To assess the clinical response rate (stable, partial and complete responses) of the combination in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreas or biliary tract cancers.

Secondary Objectives

* To define the time to progression and overall survival for patients treated with this regimen.
* To evaluate the congruency of the Adverse Events Self-Report Survey in determining patient reported side effects of treatment
