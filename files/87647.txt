Elimisha HPV (Human Papillomavirus)
This research study aims to develop a stigma-responsive educational intervention which includes simplified scripts that provide clear messages about HPV and video aimed at addressing fears and misperceptions from a peer perspective. These educational components will be incorporated into 'Elimisha' HPV a multi-level stigma-responsive cervical cancer prevention service delivery model.
