Study of the Infusion of ARI-0001 Cells in Patients With CD19 + Acute Lymphoid Leukemia Resistant or Refractory to Therapy
To assess the efficacy (in terms of response rate and duration) of the infusion of ARI-0001 cells (Adult differentiated autologous T-cells from peripheral blood, expanded and transducted with a lentivirus to express a chimeric antigen receptor with anti-CD19 specificity \[A3B1\] conjugated to the 4-aBB and CD3z co-stimulatory regions) in patients with resistant or refractory CD19+ acute lymphoid leukemia
Acute Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: ARI-0001 cells
