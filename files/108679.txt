Safety and Tolerability of TNG908 in Patients With MTAP-deleted Solid Tumors
This is a first in human study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors known to have an MTAP deletion. The first part of the study is an open-label, dose escalation and the second part is an open label dose expansion in specific MTAP-deleted tumor types. The study drug, TNG908, is a selective PRMT5 inhibitor administered orally. The study is planned to treat up to 192 participants.
Locally Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TNG908
Phase 1:, To determine the MTD and dosing schedule of TNG908, 28 days|Phase 2:, To assess anti-neoplastic activity of TNG908 in patients with MTAP-deleted advanced solid tumors by RECIST or mRECIST v1.1 or modified RANO criteria, 16 weeks
Phase 1:, To assess preliminary evidence of anti-neoplastic activity of TNG908 in patients with MTAP-deleted advanced solid tumors by RECIST or mRECIST v1.1or modified RANO criteria, 16 weeks|Phase 1 and 2:, To describe the safety and tolerability profile of TNG908 by frequency and severity of AEs, 28 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Time to achieve maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Apparent total plasma clearance when dosed orally (CL/F), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, Apparent volume of distribution when dosed orally (Vz/F), 16 days|Phase 1 and 2:, SDMA levels in tumor tissue will be assessed pre-treatment and post treatment with TNG908, 28 days
This is a Phase 1/2 multi-center, open label study in solid tumor patients (including glioblastoma) who have a confirmed homozygous MTAP deletion in their tumor. The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation study of oral TNG908 in patients with confirmed MTAP-deleted solid tumors. In Phase 2, 6 expansion arms defined by confirmed MTAP-deleted tumor types will enroll in parallel at the RP2D of TNG908. In both parts of the study participants who tolerate the drug may continue treatment until disease progression.
