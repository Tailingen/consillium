Evaluation of Bone Markers as Diagnostic Tools for Early Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With High Risk Prostate Cancer
It is the aim of this prospective, single-group, clinical study to assess whether bone parameters can be used as diagnostic tools for early detection of bone metastases in patients with high risk prostate cancer. The usefulness in monitoring zoledronic acid therapy in patients who have developed bone metastases will also be assessed.
Prostate Cancer

• To assess the relationship between change in bone parameters and bone scan with respect to bone metastases, Every 3 months
