Comparing Intermediate-dose CTX+ G-CSF Plus or Not rhTPO for PB CD34+ Cells Mobilization in MM Patients
Comparing intermediate-dose CTX (ID-CTX)and G-CSF with rhTPO or without for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma, try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: rhTPO|DRUG: CTX|DRUG: -CSF
Number of CD34+ stem/progenitor cells that are mobilized, two weeks
rate of mobilization success, two weeks|rate of mobilization optimal, two weeks
occurrence rate of febrile neutropenia, three weeks|platelet transfusion amount, three weeks|time of neutrophil engraftment, four weeks|time of platelet engraftment, eight weeks
The purpose of this study is to try to find out whether rhTPO combined to ID-CTX + G-CSF could improve the results of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization. Comparing ID-CTX and G-CSF plus rhTPO or not for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma. rhTPO15000U/d were given from day 5\~7 after chemotherapy until the stem cell collection .
