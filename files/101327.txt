Fluorescence Detection of Adult Primary Central Nervous System Tumors with Tozuleristide and the Canvas System
The purpose of this study is to examine the use of a single dose of tozuleristide (24 or 36 mg) and the Canvas imaging system during surgical resection of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors: Primary gadolinium enhancing (high grade) CNS tumors, primary non-gadolinium enhancing CNS tumors, and primary vestibular schwannoma.

The primary objectives of the study is to see how well tozuleristide and the Canvas imaging system during surgical resection will show fluorescence among primary enhancing/high grade CNS tumors; and among the tumors that demonstrate tozuleristide fluorescence, to estimate the true positive rate and true negative rate of fluorescence in tissue biopsies, as well as sensitivity and specificity of tozuleristide fluorescence for distinguishing tumor from non-tumoral tissue.

The secondary objectives of the study include evaluating the safety of tozuleristide and the Canvas imaging system, and to determine if the presence of remaining fluorescence at the time of surgery corresponds to remaining tumor evident on post-operative MRI images, or if the absence of fluorescence corresponds to evidence of no gross residual tumor on post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Central Nervous System Tumor
DRUG: tozuleristide|DEVICE: Canvas imaging system|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection of tumor
Percentage of patients with fluorescence-positive primary tumor biopsy, At the time of surgery|True positive rate of fluorescence, defined as the percentage of tumor-positive and fluorescence-positive tissue biopsies among all tumor-positive tissue biopsies, At the time of surgery|True negative rate of fluorescence, defined as the percentage of tumor-negative and fluorescence-negative tissue biopsies among all tumor-negative tissue biopsies, At the time of surgery
Positive predictive value of fluorescence, defined as the percentage of tumor-positive and fluorescence-positive tissue biopsies among all fluorescence-positive tissue biopsies, At the time of surgery|Negative predictive value of fluorescence, defined as the percentage of tumor-negative and fluorescence-negative tissue biopsies among all fluorescence-negative tissue biopsies, At the time of surgery|Extent of residual tumor measured on post-operative magnetic resonance imaging scans among all patients with evidence of residual fluorescence at the time of surgery, At the time of surgery
Incidence of adverse events, Recorded and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5, From the time of study drug administration 1-24 hours prior to surgery, until 30 days after surgery or until receiving additional therapy for the central nervous system tumor, whichever comes first
