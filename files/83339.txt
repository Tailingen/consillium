Inflammation-Induced CNS Glutamate During Breast Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study is to try and provide data linking the impact of increased inflammatory cytokines as a result of chemotherapy and their relationship with increased levels of CNS glutamate and related behavioral and cognitive consequences in breast cancer patients. The investigators will use neuropsychiatric assessments, blood sampling and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to collect study data.
Breast Cancer
Ratio of Glutamate to Creatine, Single voxel MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) scans will be done to determine the glutamate levels in the dACC (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex), basal ganglia and hippocampus and the glutamate/ creatine (Glu/Cr) ratio will be calculated.MRS utilizes a magnetic field to look at magnetic nuclei, which absorb and re-emit electromagnetic energy in the presence of the magnetic field. By looking at the peaks in the resultant spectra the structure and concentration of metabolites can be determined., Baseline|Levels of peripheral blood markers of inflammation, Peripheral blood samples will be analyzed for levels of plasma c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its soluble receptors (sTNFR1 and 2), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and the IL-1 receptor antagonist, and IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R)., Baseline|Cognitive dysfunction, Cognitive measures of processing speed, attention, executive function, memory and motivation will be assessed., Baseline|Behavioral assessments, Behavioral assessments will be done to assessed to measure depression and anxiety., Baseline
Approximately 70% of women with breast cancer experience behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms during treatment with chemotherapy and approximately 30% of women continue to experience these symptoms months to years after treatment completion. There is mounting data to suggest that inflammation may be involved and indicate that chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients exhibit higher inflammatory markers than non-chemotherapy-treated patients, and inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR2) have been associated with chemotherapy-induced depression and fatigue.
