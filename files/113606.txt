Diaphragm Structure and Function in Childhood Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this research is to study the feasibility of a specific training program for the breathing muscles (inspiratory muscle training) and the effects on how breathing is regulated during exercise in childhood cancer survivors.

Percent completion, Percentage of enrolled participants who complete the 6-week inspiratory muscle training protocol, 6 weeks|Adherence to treatment protocol, Number of sets and repetitions of training breaths completed during the 6-week inspiratory muscle training protocol, 6 weeks
Maximal inspiratory pressure (measured in cm H2O), Maximal pressure generated during an inspiratory maneuver, representing inspiratory muscle strength, 6 weeks|Diaphragm thickness (measured in mm), Thickness of the diaphragm muscle measured by noninvasive ultrasound imaging, 6 weeks|Exercise ventilation, Ratio of ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2) during steady-state walking, representing ventilatory drive during exercise, 6 weeks
6-minute walk test distance (measured in m), Maximal distance walked in 6 minutes, 6 weeks
During the first study visit, participants will undergo a series of pulmonary function and muscle performance tests followed by treadmill walking trials at different speeds with concurrent expired gas analysis via a face mask. The participants will then perform a training program for the breathing muscles at home for 6 weeks. The research team will follow up each week via telehealth visits to support training. After the 6-week training program, participants will return in-person for a follow-up visit and will undergo the same series of assessments as the first visit.
