The Impact of Immune Cell Changes During the Perioperative Period on the Prognosis of Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional real-world study. In a real-world environment, in line with the current status of the domestic diagnosis and treatment process, and on the premise of not increasing the burden of patients and medical resources, we explore the best indicators for predicting the outcome of patients with Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) after surgery. The inclusion criteria for patients are perioperative patients with CRC. Real-world data analysis were conducted to determine whether immunization interventions versus non-interventions were able to improve patients' clinical outcomes (OS, PFS).
