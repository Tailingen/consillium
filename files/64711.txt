Number of participants with tumor response assessed by Immunotherapy Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), iRECIST was developed by the RECIST working group for the use of RECIST version 1.1 in cancer immunotherapy trials, to ensure consistent design and data collection.

ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on iRECIST or RECIST v1.1 at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immune checkpoint inhibition in stage III and IV melanoma, stage IV renal call cancer, and stage IV urothelial cancer. This involves the addition of a treatment called brachytherapy to SOC immunotherapy. Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where radioactive pellets are placed within a tumor to temporarily irradiate the tumor at a low level. This is the first time that this combination (immunotherapy and brachytherapy) has been used in humans.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of combining LDR with immunotherapy, determine safety and feasibility, generate a toxicity profile, evaluate response, and overall survival.
