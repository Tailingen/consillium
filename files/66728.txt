Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib Use and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Chronic B-cell Malignancies
Background. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are both associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) but AF comparative risk between these 2 BTK inhibitors (BTKis) remains largely unknown.

Objectives. Our aim was to examine the risk of developing incident AF with ibrutinib exposure compared with acalabrutinib exposure.

Methods. Using the TriNetX research network database, authors will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified, aggregate adult patients with chronic B-cell malignancies and exposed to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. Patients will be divided into 2 groups based on ibrutinib or acalabrutinib exposure. After propensity score matching (PSM), hazard ratios (HRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be used to compare AF risk during follow-up between the matched 2 groups.
