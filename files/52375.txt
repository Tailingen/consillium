Novel Imaging Technique to Assess Gynecologic Cancer
This study will test a new type of DCE (dynamic contrast-enhanced) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to see whether, compared with traditional MRI, it produces better images that provide more information about tumors, which may help doctors make better decisions about treating women who have gynecologic cancer.

MRI is commonly used to detect and evaluate many types of cancer, but its slow processing speed and the risk that images will be blurred if the patient moves inside the scanner can limit its use in clinical practice. DCE MRI is a new imaging technique that uses additional computer processing to collect information continuously during scanning, which produces more detailed images faster than traditional MRI, which reduces the risk of movement-related blurring and provides important information about tumor activity.

The DCE MRI scan in this study will be done in a standard MRI scanner, using a contrast agent (gadobutrol; Gadavist®) that has been approved by the FDA.
