Pilot Trial of HER-2/Neu Pulsed DC1 Vaccine for Patients With HER-2 Positive Metastatic Cancer
Immune-based therapies (vaccines) are a new focus of clinical investigation. These therapies try to assist a patient's immune system (a system in our bodies that protects us against infection) in killing tumors. One form of such therapy is the dendritic cell combined with HER-2/neu (a type of protein over-expressed in some cancers) vaccine. Dendritic cells are immune cells that can tell your immune system to fight infection. In laboratory testing, these cells may also help the immune system attack tumors such as breast, kidney cancer or skin cancer. The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is both possible and safe to administer" this vaccine to patients with any HER2+ cancer.
Metastatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER-2/neu Pulsed DC1 vaccine
We have demonstrated that administration of HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 in patients with DCIS results in strong immunologic responses as well as clinical responses during a brief 4 or 6 week neoadjuvant vaccination. In subsets of patients with cancer HER-2 is over-expressed including subsets of breast, gastric, pancreatic, brain, lung, and colon cancer. This trial is designed for compassionate use of a HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 in patients with metastatic HER-2 positive cancer, who have no longer standard options to eliminate disease.
