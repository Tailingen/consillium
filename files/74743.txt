Phase II Study of Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab in Endometrial Cancer
This is a single arm, Phase II study using the combination of atezolizumab and bevicacizumab in women with advanced, recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Safety and futility of this drug combination will be assessed to see what effect this treatment has on this patient population.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Number of patients who experience complete or partial tumor response, To estimate the objective tumor response in women of this patient population, 3 years
Progression-free Survival, To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer treated with Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab., up to 3 years|Overall survival, To estimate overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer treated with Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab., up to 3 years|Number of patients who experience toxicity, To determine the nature and degree of toxicity in combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab., 6 months|Number of participants who experience immune related response, To estimate response using immune related response criteria (irRC) in patients receiving Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab., 6 months
This phase 2 study using atezolizumab and bevacizumab aims to study the objective tumor response in women with recurrent endometrial cancer. Drugs will be administered via IV every 21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit as determined by investigator. Subjects will receive routine cancer care as well as tests and procedures required for the purposes of this study. It is expected this combination will be produce an anti-cancer effect with manageable toxicities in this patient population.
