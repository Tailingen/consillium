Language Function in Patients With Brain Tumors
The purpose of this study is to use an imaging method called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients who have a tumor near an area of the brain that is believed to control language. The fMRI is a new kind of imaging that uses a strong magnetic field to look at functioning brain tissue. This kind of imaging will be used to study the effect of the brain tumor on your speech.
