Dose Escalation Trial of BIBW 2992 Administration in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for various treatment durations of BIBW 2992 when administered in combination with docetaxel as determined by drug-related adverse events (AEs) as well as Pharmacokinetics, overall safety and antitumor efficacy.
