Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
This study was planned to examine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and their relationship with each other and the nutritional status of individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in reproductive age, by evaluating anthropometric, biochemical, and ultrasonographic findings and food consumption frequency data.

Serum vitamin D levels, Serum vitamin D levels were measured by immunoassay analyzer., 3 months|Insulin resistance, Insulin resistance analyzed by homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formulation., 3 months|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) grade, NAFLD grade was evaluated by ultrasonography., 3 months
A total of 72 female individuals diagnosed with PCOS were included in the study. Nutritional status, physical activity levels, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical parameters of individuals were examined. A food consumption frequency questionnaire was applied to the individuals. According to the 2003 Rotterdam Consensus revision, PCOS is diagnosed when at least two of the following three conditions are present: Polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography, oligomenorrhoea, or anovulation; clinical and/or biochemical symptoms of hyperandrogenemia. Testing was done on insulin, lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, and liver function. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to determine body weight and composition. An abdominal ultrasound was used to diagnose NAFLD.
