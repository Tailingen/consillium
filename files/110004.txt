A Study of ABT-263 in Combination With Dose-Intensive Rituximab, or Dose-Intensive Rituximab Alone, in Previously Untreated Patients With B-Cell, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
This Phase II, randomized, open-label, international, multicenter trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab monotherapy when given according to a dose intense regimen and to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-263 when combined with dose-intense rituximab in previously untreated patients with B-cell CLL.
