Effects of ASA on Prostate Tissue
Aspirin affects many physiological processes through its anti-inflammatory actions. Various cancers, including prostate cancer, appear to utilize inflammatory signals to facilitate their growth and progression.

We hypothesize that oral aspirin acts directly on prostate epithelial cells to alter COX-2-related metabolism and inhibit prostate cell growth.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men and is the second leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men. 221,000 new cases and 29,000 deaths are expected in 2003. The incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis is increasing at 3% per year. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening has resulted in improvements in early diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, available treatments all may have a significant negative effect on quality of life.

Studies have implicated a beneficial association between ASA use and a lower risk of other types of malignancies, including stomach, esophageal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. There is significant evidence to suggest that aspirin has a protective effect against prostate cancer.
