BioProtect Balloon Implant™ Balloon System Pivotal Study BP-007
The BioProtect Balloon Implant™ System is intended to temporarily position the anterior rectal wall away from the prostate during radiotherapy for prostate cancer and in creating this space it is the intent of the balloon to reduce the radiation dose delivered to the anterior rectum. The balloon composed of a biodegradable material that maintains that space for the entire course of prostate radiotherapy treatment and is completely absorbed by the patient's body over time.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: balloon|OTHER: Control
Safety Endpoint: Number of Subjects in the Balloon and Control Groups With Rectal, Device or Procedure-related Grade > 1 AEs Within 6 Months of Procedure, Non-inferiority in occurrence of rectal, device or procedure-related Grade \> 1 AEs within 6 months of implantation for balloon as compared to control group, Within 6 months from balloon implantation|Efficacy Endpoint: Number of Subjects in the Balloon Group With Reduction of >25% in Rectal Volume Receiving 70 Gy (rV70), Observed reduction of at least \>25% in rectal volume receiving 70 Gy (rV70) in patients after spacer implantation, with efficacy of the study confirmed if \>75% of balloon recipients achieved this degree of dose reduction., 3 months
This study will be a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-arm, single blind, concurrently controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of the balloon in prostate cancer subjects undergoing radiotherapy by means of intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT).
