Neoadjuvant INBRX-106 (Hexavalent OX40 Agonist) in Combination With Pembrolizumab as a Chemotherapy-sparing Regimen for Stage II TNBC (Triple Negative Breast Cancer) Patients
This is a Phase II trial to assess feasibility of pembrolizumab + INBRX-106 as a chemotherapy-sparing neoadjuvant therapy. One therapeutic arm is being evaluated to provide an informal comparison of pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of concurrent dosing schedule.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: INBRX-106
Pathological response (post-IO), Patients who undergo definitive surgical excision and achieve complete pathological response following up to 6 cycles of study therapy, in the absence of intervening systemic therapy., Up to 6 Cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
Pathological response (post-chemotherapy), Patients achieving pathological response after completion of study therapy followed by additional neoadjuvant therapy per treating physician discretion, ascertained at the time of definitive surgical excision., 30 days from last dose of study treatment|IO-path response assessed prior to Cycle 2, On study biopsy conducted prior to Cycle 2:

* IO-path-NE (not evaluable): no tumor or evidence of treatment effect.
* IO-path-NR (no response): tumor present, no appreciable treatment effect, no sTILs/iTILs expansion by at least 10% absolute increase from baseline.
* IO-path-PR (partial response): tumor present, +treatment effect and/or sTILs/iTILs expansion by at least 10% absolute increase from baseline.
* IO-path-CR (complete response): no viable tumor, + treatment effect., Day 21|Volumetric response, Patients achieving at least some (\>0%) reduction in ultrasound estimate of breast mass volume (mL) at the end of study treatment, Up to 6 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Event free survival, Date of dose 1 until evidence of cancer recurrence or death. Those alive without recurrence are censored at date of last contact., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, Date of dose 1 to death. Those who are alive are censored at date of last contact., Up to 2 years|Toxicity profile, All AEs attributed to study therapy per CTCAE v5.0, 30 days from last dose of study treatment
A Simon 2-stage design is implemented to minimize exposure if the treatment regimen is futile. If feasibility is established with responses exceeding futility parameters, study will expand to stage 2. Additional arms may be introduced in a protocol amendment.

Below shows the sample size required using Simon's 2-stage design, 80% power and 5% one-sided significance level:

* Null hypothesis: \<5% pCR
* Alternative hypothesis: \>35% pCR
* Stage I n (r\*): 6 (0)
* Stage I + II total n (r): 12 (2)
* Criteria: Minimax
* Minimum responses to proceed to stage II: 1

Note: r\* and r represents the threshold for declaring futility, i.e. greater than r\* or r responses would be required to consider ongoing investigation.

The null hypothesis of 5% is based upon the assumption that virtually no subjects would experience pCR if the therapy was not effective. The alternative hypothesis of 35% is based upon the assumption that complete responses in the absence of chemotherapy in approximately one-third of subjects would be clinically meaningful, encouraging further development of the treatment paradigm.

If no responses are observed, a second feasibility run-in may be considered using a biomarker enrichment strategy (such as with the 27-gene IO score).

The arm will be terminated from further development if an unacceptable proportion of patients experience rapid clinical/radiographic progression (defined as progression of disease, or clinical evidence of progression), or other toxicities that interfere with curative-intent therapy, defined as \>1/6 evaluable subjects in stage I or \>2/12 in stage II, evaluated for each arm. This is a Pocock-type stopping boundary that yields the probability of cross the boundary at most 23% when the rate of dose-limiting toxicity is equal to 10%.
