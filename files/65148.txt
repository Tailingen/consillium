Comparison of Whole-body MRI, Circulating DNA and PET-CT in Staging, Prognosis, and Treatment Response in Patients with Diffuse Large Cell B Lymphoma
The aim of the study is to compare the diagnostic performance of whole-body MRI scan, positron emission tomography + CT, and circulating tumor DNA in patients with hematologic malignancy called diffuse large cell B lymphoma (DLBCL) in staging and restaging, and prognosis.
Lymphoma, Diffuse Large B-Cell
Diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI in staging of DLBCL, Comparison of diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI in staging of DLBCL in newly diagnosed adult patients before treatment compared to PET/CT as the gold standard, at baseline
Diagnostic value of MRI sequences, Rating of the diagnostic utility of MRI sequences used in whole body MRI in staging of DLBCL in newly diagnosed adult patients before treatment, At baseline|Assessment of therapeutic response, The assessment of therapeutic response by wbMRI after first-line treatment will be compared to that of PET/CT. Change in circulating tumor DNA will be correlated with therapeutic response assessed by PET/CT., after completion of first-line treatment, on average 6 months
Patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL or patients with relapsed DLBCL who consent to participate in this study will apart from standard staging and restaging examination with PET/CT undergo whole-body MRI (wbMRI). From blood samples, the level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments will be estimated. These procedures will be repeated during restaging after primary treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of wbMRI in initial staging and restaging will be compared with PET/CT as the gold standard. Circulating tumor DNA levels will be compared at baseline with staging from PET/CT. The change in levels of ctDNA will be compared with the treatement response assessed by PET/CT. All three methods will be used as prognostic indicators.
