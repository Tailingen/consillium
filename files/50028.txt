Community-Led Action Research in Oncology: Improving Symptom Management
This study will be conducted at La Liga Contra el Cancer in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. The overall objective of this project is to improve symptom management for patients undergoing chemotherapy in Honduras. The first step in this line of research is a "proof of concept" feasibility study in which the investigators will demonstrate their ability to train nurses to administer a non-pharmacological, telephone-delivered, symptom management program for chemotherapy patients.

BEHAVIORAL: symptom management program for chemotherapy patients
Recruitment feasibility, Number patients enrolled in the study divided by number of patients referred to the study, Through study completion , an average of one year
Intervention feasibility, Average number of minutes for each telephone sessions, Through study completion, an average of one year|Fidelity to treatment, Average fidelity score for rated telephone sessions, Through study completion, an average of one year|Acceptability of intervention, Semi-structured interview of patients and nurse interventionists, At study completion, approximately one year|Healthcare utilization, Average number of cancelled appointments, emergency room visits, and toxicity requiring change in treatment plan, 12 weeks after enrollment
The investigators will use the team's previous experience delivering a standardized, non-pharmacological palliative care intervention by telephone to inform a "proof of concept" feasibility study in Honduras. They will train nurses at La Liga Contra el Cancer in San Pedro Sula to conduct the telephone sessions and monitor their fidelity to treatment as they enroll a minimum They will then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of the program.
