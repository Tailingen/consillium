Orelabrutinib Therapy in Patients With r/r B-cell Lymphoma Intolerant to Other Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
To evaluate the safety and effecacy of Orelabrutinib therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma (including R /rCLL/SLL and R /rMCL) who are intolerant to ibrutinib/zanubrutinib or other BTK inhibitors

The efficacy of first-generation BTKi ibrutinib in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma is reasonable, but the kinase selectivity is poor and the off-target effect is increased. It is associated with non-BTK-related adverse reactions such as bleeding, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea and rash.This is the reason why some patients stop taking BTKi and cannot benefit from long-term treatment. Orelabrutinib kinase is highly selective. The safety of the treatment of 266 Chinese patients with B-cell malignancies (including r/r CLL/SLL, r/r MCL, r/r WM, r/r MZL, r/r CNSL) showed that no â‰¥ grade 3 atrial fibrillation occurred.The incidence of grade 3 diarrhea and severe bleeding adverse events was lower than that of ibrutinib and zanubrutinib.Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of self-selected switching to obrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma intolerant to ibrutinib/zanubrutinib therapy
