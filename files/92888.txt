Exploration of PD-1 inhibitors biomarkers, The study of PD-1 inhibitors biomarkers could be useful to identify a group of patients whose the molecules are most activated and then for futures studies., December 2019
The aim of the research is to study the activity of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and treated by Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab. These molecules have already received the authorities approvals. The data collected will be crucial for the understanding of the mechanism of PD-1 inhibitors and also for the futures studies.
