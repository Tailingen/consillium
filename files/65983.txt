A Study of High-Dose Chemoradiation Using Biologically-Based Target Volume Definition in Patients With Glioblastoma
This is a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Glioma
RADIATION: High Dose Radiation|DRUG: Temozolomide
Overall Survival at 12 Months, Percentage of patients alive at 12 months after completion of chemoradiation, 12 months after completion of chemoradiation|Median Overall Survival, Median overall survival in months, Median follow-up time was 26 months
Median Progression-free Survival, From start of RT until disease progression or death, or until date of last imaging follow-up, estimated using Kaplan-Meier. Progression is defined by any of the following: \>= 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids; a significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events; appearance of any new lesions; clear progression of non-measurable lesions; or definite clinical deterioration not attributable to causes other than tumor, or to decrease in corticosteroid dose. When pathologic confirmation was unavailable, progression was defined as worsening enhancement based on imaging with or without adjunctive advanced imaging including perfusion MRI or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, when clinically indicated., Median follow-up time was 26 months|Median Change in Tumor Volume From Baseline to Mid-radiation Treatment (Week 4), Tumor volume will be measured by diffusion MRI and perfusion MRI before treatment start and at mid-treatment., Baseline to Week 4|Percentage of Patients That Experienced Deterioration in Quality of Life (QOL), Percentage of patients that experienced deterioration in QOL per the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and other (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning., Baseline to 1 and 7 months|Percentage of Patients With Failure; Central or In-field vs. Marginal or Distant, Failures will be classified as central or in-field, marginal or distant based on previously published criteria. 1) "central," in which 95% or more of the recurrent tumor volume (Vrecur) was within D95, the region treated to high dose (95% of the prescription dose); 2) "in-field," in which 80% or more of Vrecur was within the D95 isodose surface; 3) "marginal," when between 20 and 80% of Vrecur was inside the D95 surface; 4) "outside," in which less than 20% of Vrecur was inside the D95 surface., Median 26 months
After analysis demonstrated the improved prognostic value of identifying both hypercellular tumor (TVHCV) based on high b-value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and hyperperfused tumor (TVCBV) based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), the study was amended and later-enrolled patients boosted to both TVHCV and TVCBV.
