Primary Tumor Sidedness Associated With Clinical Characteristic and Postoperative Outcomes in Colon Cancer: a Propensity Score Matching Study
Background: Recent investigations have suggested that sidedness is associated with the prognosis of colon cancer patients. The role of sidedness in surgical outcome is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the different clinical characteristics and associated postoperative outcomes of sidedness in colon cancer.

Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study using the multi-institutional, nationally validated database of the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) from 2009 to 2013. Sidedness groups including right sided and left sided colon cancer were created according to the associated diagnosis and procedure codes. Postoperative mortality, morbidity, overall complication, and length of total hospital stay were analyzed after using a propensity score matching method.
