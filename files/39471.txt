A Study of Pegylated rhG-CSF as Support to Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Receiving Chemotherapy
Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy. A newly pegylated rhG-CSF was independently developed by JIANGSU HENGRUI Medicine Co., Ltd, China. Phase 1a, 1b and phase 2 trials have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with ﬁlgrastim. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of pegylated rhG-CSF in preventing neutropenia following chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia in cycle 1, the rate of ANC lower than 1.0 × 109/L, 21 days
Incidence of febrile neutropenia in cycle 1, rate of ANC\<1.0×109/L and auxiliary temperature\>38.5℃, 21 days|Rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia and incidence of febrile neutropenia in cycle 2 to 4, The rate of ANC lower than 1.0 × 109 /L and rate of ANC\<1.0×109/L and auxiliary temperature\>38.5℃, Through 2 to 4 cycles|Time to neutrophil recovery in the 4 chemotherapy cycles, After chemotherapy administration the time from the expected nadir until the patient's ANC increased to 2.0 × 109/L, Through 4 cycles|Duration of 3/4 neutropenia in the 4 chemotherapy cycles, duration of ANC lower than 1.0 × 109/L, Through 4 cycles|Objective response rate, Through 4 cycles|Progress free survival, Through 4 cycles|Overall survival, Through 4 cycles|Exploratory biomarkers research, Relationship between SNP and microRNA with myelosuppression and tumor response rate, Through 4 cycles
