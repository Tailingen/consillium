PRIMUS 001: A Study Looking at Two Different Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This study is comparing two combinations of chemotherapy treatments in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Half the participants will receive FOLFOX-A and the other half will receive AG. Treatment will continue until progression or patient/clinican decision or intolerable toxicity.
Neoplasms Pancreatic
DRUG: FOLFOX-A|DRUG: Gemcitabe and Abraxane|DRUG: G-CSF
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival as measured froim the date of randomisation to progression or death (from any cause), At time of progression (estimated to be between 5 and 7.5 months)
Ojective Response Rate, Based on RECIST version 1.1, Measured every 8 weeks by CT scan (most patients will received 3-4 CT scans over 24-32 weeks))|Overall Survival, Survival will be measured from the date of randomisation and include all caused of death, From date of randomisation until date of death from any cause. Most patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer will die within 6-9 months from diagnosis|Safety and Tolerability of FOLFOX-A treatment, Using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, At every chemotherapy visit (every 2 weeks) - and at end of treatment visit (within 30 days of completing chemotherapy). Chemotherapy will continue until progression (estimated at between 5-7.5 months)|Safety and Tolerability of AG treatment, Using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, At every chemotherapy visit (3 weeks out of every 4) - and at end of treatment visit (within 30 days of completing chemotherapy). Chemotherapy will continue until progression (estimated at between 5-7.5 months)|Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30), patients will complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at clinic, Every 8 weeks while on treatment, at end of treatment visit, which will take place within 30 days of completing treatment, and at follow-up visits (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post randomisation).|Peripheral Neuropathy, Measured by GOG-NTX4, Every 4 weeks while on treatment, at end of treatment visit and at follow-up visits (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post randomisation).|Health Economics as defined to hospital resource use i.e how many nights the patient has spent in hospital and how may times they have attended hospital since the last time they were seen, Resource use will be assessed during the course of the study, At each study visit. Patient will be followed up for up to 5 years post randomistation (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post randomisation).|Biomarker Discovery and Development, This will be ongoing as part of the study. This will use trial material but will be extrinsic to the trials outcomes. The biomarker will be specificed and locked down before the first interim analysis that is biomarker dependent, Ongoing during study. Recruitment will take 46 months and patients will be followed-up for up to 5 years post randomisation|Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-PAN26), patients will complete the EORTC QLQ-PAN26 questionnaire at clinic, Every 8 weeks while on treatment, at end of treatment visit, which will take place within 30 days of completing treatment, and at follow-up visits (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post randomisation).|Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L), patients will complete the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire at clinic, Every 8 weeks while on treatment, at end of treatment visit, which will take place within 30 days of completing treatment, and at follow-up visits (6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post randomisation).
PRIMUS 001 is a multicentre, randomised, open label, two arm, phase II interventional trial with pre-clinical and translational work including in-depth molecular profiling and biomarker discovery/development. The primary objective is to look at the efficacy of FOLFOX-A compared to AG in all comers and in a biomarker positive group using progression free survival.
