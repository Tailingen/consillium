Study of the ZN-d5 and ZN-c3 in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
A Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of BCL-2 Inhibitor ZN-d5 and the Wee1 Inhibitor ZN-c3 in Subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: ZN-d5 ZN-c3|DRUG: ZN-c3
Observed dose limiting toxicities, Observed Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in DLT evaluable subjects., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Incidence, severity, and relatedness of adverse events( AEs), Through study completion, typically < 12 months
1. To investigate the plasma PK of ZN-c3 when given as monotherapy - Maximum Plasma Concentration, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ZN-c3 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) will be determined, Through study completion, typically <12 months|2. To investigate the plasma PK of ZN-c3 when given as monotherapy - Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24h, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24h \[AUC0-24h\] of ZN-c3 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) will be determined, Through study completion, typically < 12 months|5. To investigate the plasma PK of ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 when given in combination - Maximum Plasma Concentration, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ZN-c3 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) and ZN-d5 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) will be determined, Through study completion, typically < 12 months|6. To investigate the plasma PK of ZN-c3 and ZN-d5 when given in combination - Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24h, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24h \[AUC0-24h\] of ZN-c3 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) and ZN-d5 (and its potential metabolites, as applicable) will be determined, Through study completion, typically < 12 months|Rate and duration or remission according to the European LeukemiaNet 2017 criteria, Through study completion, typically < 12 months
This is an open-label multicenter Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the novel BCL-2 inhibitor ZN-d5 and Wee1 inhibitor ZN-c3 in subjects with AML.
