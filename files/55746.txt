Adebrelimab Plus Chemo and Recaticimab in Perioperative Treatment of Resectable NSCLC
Current studies confirmed that the immune perioperative treatment with combination chemotherapy curative effect and safety of resectable NSCLC, but its short-term curative effect and long-term survival benefit remains to be further improved to explore the new way of immune combination therapy.

Experimental study showed that the inhibition of PCSK9 could significantly increase in tumor cells of the immune response in mice, inhibit the PCSK9 enhanced anti-tumor immune response of mice can be further coordinate with immune checkpoint therapy, forming a lasting anti-tumor immune effect.

There are no reports on the peri-operative treatment of immune combined with chemotherapy and PCSK-9 inhibitors in patients with resectable NSCLC.

Based on the above, the aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Adebrelimab combined with recaticimab and chemotherapy in the perioperative treatment of patients with resectable NSCLC.
