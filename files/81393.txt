Ofatumumab With or Without Bendamustine for Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Ineligible for Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
This study is being done to understand how to treat Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). The goals of treatment are to control the lymphoma with the least amount of side effects. In many cases, MCL is treated with an antibody plus chemotherapy. An antibody is a laboratory-produced substance created to attach to proteins on the cancer cells, eventually destroying them. Chemotherapy is medicine that specifically destroys cancer cells.

The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the drugs Ofatumumab and Bendamustine have on this type of cancer. Patients in this study will either receive Ofatumumab alone, or Ofatumumab combined with Bendamustine.

BIOLOGICAL: Ofatumumab (This arm is closed)|OTHER: Ofatumumab + Bendamustine
Single Agent Efficacy (as Determined by Response Rate), of the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab alone in low risk patients. Assessments prior to each cycle of immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy: (every 4 weeks), 2 years|the Efficacy (as Determined by Response Rate) of the Combination Ofatumumab + Bendamustine, in high risk patients. Assessments prior to each cycle of immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy: (every 4 weeks), 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation, and logrank tests or Cox regression models when covariates are involved., Up to 6 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation, and logrank tests or Cox regression models when covariates are involved., 2 years|Remission Duration, (calculated from confirmation of CR to progression)will be analyzed using competing risks tools (with death as a competing risk for progression), and will be done on the subsets of patients who have CR or CR/PR., Up to 6 years|Response Duration, (calculated from confirmation of response (CR/PR) to progression. will be analyzed using competing risks tools (with death as a competing risk for progression), and will be done on the subsets of patients who have CR or CR/PR., Up to 6 years
