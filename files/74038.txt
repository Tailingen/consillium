Erector Spinae Block for Thoracoscopic Surgery
This randomized clinical trial compares the effects of the erector spinae plane block with levobupivacaine and 0,9% saline on postoperative pain intensity, and opioid consumptions following thoracoscopic pulmonary surgery.

Sixty patients planned for thoracoscopic pulmonary surgery are randomly assigned to an erector spinae plane block (ESPB) with levobupivacaine (intervention group) or 0,9% saline (control group). ESPB is performed under general anaesthesia before surgery.

Postoperative pain medication incudes acetominophen, NSAIDs en parenteral morphine (patient controlled analgesia).

Following surgery pain intensity (numeric rating scale) is registered at the recovery ward one hour after surgery. Furthermore, pain intensity is registered 2,4,8, 12 hours after the operation. On the first postoperative day, pain intensity is registered at 8.00 o'cock AM and 8.00 o'clock PM. Opioid consumption is registered as a second parameter of postoperative pain.
