CART-19 Immunotherapy in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells over a period of 4 or 5 consecutive days in an escalating dose. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 10 years.
Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer|Non-hodgkin Lymphoma,B Cell|Mantle Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19-CAR vector-transduced T cells
Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as \>= Grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical events) that are possibly, likely, or definitely related to the study., Until 2 years
Clinical responses to CART-19 cell therapy, Until 24 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the safety and efficacy of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced with the anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19 ) vector (referred to as CART-19 cells) in elderly patients with MCL.

II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify survival of CART-19 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over time.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-19 cell infusions.

Estimate relative trafficking of CART-19 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19, and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-19 (loss of engraftment).
