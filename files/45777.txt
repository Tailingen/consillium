Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment in Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of perioperative treatment with Durvalumab in combination with Oleclumab, Monalizumab, or AZD0171 and platinum doublet chemotherapy (CTX); or Volrustomig or Rilvegostomig in combination with CTX; or Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with Durvalumab or Rilvegostomig and single agent platinum chemotherapy in participants with resectable, early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
