Application of 3D Printing in Laparoscopic Surgery of Liver Tumors
To explore the utility of personalized 3D printed liver models in planning and navigating laparoscopic resections.
Liver Cancer|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Metastases
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic liver resection|DEVICE: 3D printing model
Number of changes in surgery plan, intraoperative|Blood loss, intraoperative|Operative time, intraoperative
Complications, Number of both total and severe (Clavien-Dindo\>=3) complications, intraoperative and until discharge, an average of 7 days|Length of stay, until patient discharge, an average of 7 days|Conversion rate, intraoperative|Readmissions, 6 months|Mortality, 90 days
Project goal is to evaluate utility of personalized 3D printed models in preoperative planning and performing laparoscopic liver resections. Models will be developed with unique, low-cost approach. Project will consist of three overlapping modules/stages evaluating:

1. Accuracy of 3D printed liver models compared to computed tomography and standard surface or volume rendering
2. Whether 3D printed utilized in planning surgery affects the decision making regarding the surgical plan
3. Whether 3D printed models utilized in planning and navigating laparoscopic resections affect perioperative outcomes

Methodology of developing 3D models is described elsewhere. Printed models will be delivered to surgical team at least 5 days prior to the resection. Surgery will be performed in both arms according to the department's procedures and surgical oncology guidelines.
