Molecular Profiling and Dynamic Changes of ctDNA in Unresectable Locally Advanced NSCLC
Multi-center observational clinical study to evaluate the application value of ctDNA monitoring in efficacy assessment and relapse prediction in patients diagnosed with unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC receiving CRT with or without durvalumab maintenance treatment.
Lung Cancer|Stage III Lung Cancer|Unresectable Lung Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Sample collection|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Characterization of the tumoral tissue genomic alterations|DRUG: Chemoradiation treatment regimen and maintenance (if amenable)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Genomic and methylation analysis in liquid biopsy
Quantitative variation of aberrant methylated ctDNA concentrations before chemoradiotherapy, after chemoradiotherapy, and every 3 months during 1 year of follow-up., 16 months|Correlation between patients' recurrence or progression, and quantitative detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) concentration., 2 years|Concordance of ctDNA genomic alterations detected in peripheral blood samples, with those in matched tumour samples., At diagnosis|Correlation between survival outcomes (progression free survival, overall survival) and quantitative detection of ctDNA genomic alterations or methylation status., 2 years
Newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, unresectable stage III NSCLC patients, amenable to receive standard of care chemoradiotherapy with or without durvalumab maintenance, will be enrolled in this study. Whole blood collection will be conducted during the treatment for ctDNA detection in specific time-points of interest. Next-generation sequencing using commercially available panels, and analysis of ctDNA aberrant methylation will be performed. Results will be correlated to patients' recurrence times and survival outcomes.
