Ultra-Violet Fluorescence Bronchial Cancer Location
Diagnose lung cancer at an early stage is crucial for effective treatment. At these early stages, cancer is usually invisible in ambient white light when the endoscopic analysis of the bronchial mucosa. This lining is self-fluorescent at its illumination by blue light. These widely distributed autofluorescence methods detect early mucosal abnormalities. They are very sensitive but not specific to recognize the lung cancer. Thanks to European funding (EURIMUS), a new tool with fluorescent UV light has been developed.

The purpose of this preliminary study is to verify the suitability for specific detection of cancerous tissue in Pneumology of this fluorescence method versus histological analysis of the tissue.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Rigid bronchoscopy with ultraviolet transmission|OTHER: Biopsy
ultraviolet fluorescence ratio Iodine360 / Iodine450, Detection of cancerous tissues and healthy or inflammatory tissues is used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the rigid bronchoscopy with UV transmission compared to biopsy (gold standard)., Day 0|Histology of tissue, The histology give the final diagnosis, Day 0
