New Markers for Treatment Response to Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer
The actual follow-up of patients undergoing definite radiotherapy for prostate cancer includes regular measurements of prostate specific antigen (PSA). Successful radiotherapy is critically dependent on local control of cancer; however, PSA takes 2-3 years to reach a nadir after therapy. We aim at collecting blood/urine after prostate massage before, and after radiotherapy in order to define new markers predicting local control earlier and more precisely than PSA.

Bio-repository, first assessment using predifined markers after recruitment of 15 patients followed for 1 year
Patients will be closely followed for 5 years (weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and then yearly). Each assessment includes PSA measurement, urine collection after prostatic massage, and blood collection.
