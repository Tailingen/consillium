The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Kanglaite Injection for advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).
NSCLC
DRUG: Kanglaite Injection+Chemotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival(PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), as Determined by the Investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Randomization until disease progression, death, or 12 months after randomized enrollment, whichever occurs first.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR:Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed by RECIST 1.1., Every two cycles (each cycle is 21-28 days) until disease progression, death, or 12 months after randomized enrollment, whichever occurs first.|One-Year Survival Rate, One-year survival rate refers to the proportion of patients with a survival period of more than one year starting from randomized enrollment., Randomization until One year.|Quality of life of the patient, This will be measured with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ C30) and Lung Cancer Symptom Scale(LCSS)., before and after each cycle of treatment, assessed up to 12 months after randomized enrollment|Living ability of the patient, This will be measured with validated questionnaires(ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS)., before and after each cycle of treatment, assessed up to 12 months after randomized enrollment|Blood lipid, total cholesterol, triacylglycerides, high density cholesterol, low density cholesterol., every 41-56 days(2 cycles ) until disease progression, death, or assessed up to 12 months after randomized enrollment.|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events in different arms., Baseline until disease progression,death, or assessed up to 12 months after randomized enrollment.
This study include a multicenter, randomized, controlled post-market clinical trial.The randomized clinical trial will enroll approximately 334 patients. Participants will be randomly divided into experimental (n=167) and control groups (n=167).Patients in the experimental group will receive Kanglaite Injection combination with first-line chemotherapy based on NCCN Guidelines (2019.V3). Patients in the control group will receive first-line chemotherapy based on NCCN Guidelines (2019.V3).The primary endpoint is PFS(progression free survival).The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the trial.
