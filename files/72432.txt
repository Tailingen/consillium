Study to Evaluate Adverse Events, and Change in Disease Activity, When Intravenously (IV) Infused With Livmoniplimab in Combination With IV Infused Budigalimab in Adult Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death. The majority of participants first presenting with HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and efficacy of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab.

Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HCC. There are 3 treatment arms in this study and participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), lenvatinib, or sorafenib. Approximately 120 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 60 sites worldwide.

In arm 1 (control), participants will receive the investigator's choice: lenvatinib as an oral capsule or sorafenib as an oral tablet, once daily. In arm 2, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose A) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In arm 3, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose B) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. The estimated duration of the study is up to 2 years

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires, and scans.

Best Overall Response (BOR) per Investigator, BOR is defined as a subject achieving confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as determined by investigators at any time prior to subsequent anticancer therapy., Through Study Completion, Up to Approximately 27 Months
Duration of response (DOR) per Investigator, DOR is defined as the time from first confirmed CR or PR until the first documentation of progressive disease according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by investigators or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Through Study Completion, Up to Approximately 27 Months|Number of Participants with Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the first documentation of progressive disease according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by investigators or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Through Study Completion, Up to Approximately 27 Months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Through Study Completion, Up to Approximately 27 Months
