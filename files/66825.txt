Tissue Collection for Correlation Between ATM Alterations by Next-Generation Sequencing and ATM Loss-of-Protein
This study examines the correlation between ATM alterations identified using NGS profiles with ATM protein expression levels from tumor tissue assessed by IHC.
Solid Tumor, Unspecified, Adult
OTHER: Determination of ATM alteration status.
Number of patients with loss of ATM protein, ATM protein expression levels from tumor tissue assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), 12 months
Number of potential patients with loss of ATM protein eligible for study REFMAL 721/ART0380C001, Patients in Group C are considered for enrolment into study REFMAL 721/ART0380C001 and must meet eligibility based on review of their medical records. REFMAL 721/ART0380C001 is a phase I/IIa open-label trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the ATR kinase inhibitor, ART0380 administered as a monotherapy as well as in drug combinations with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors., 12 months|Number of ATM genomic aberrations that lead to ATM LoP, Identify types of ATM protein expression from tumor tissue assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), 12 months|Rate of loss of function (LoF) of the ATM gene in patients with genomic aberrations in the ATM gene, ATM alterations identified using Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) profiles, 12 months
The purpose of this study is to address whether ATM genomic aberrations could be used to enrich for patients with ATM LoP. Screening of unselected patient populations for ATM protein loss is likely to a lead to high failure rate by IHC testing, as the prevalence of this is expected to be low. This study could allow for identification of the types of ATM aberrations that lead to ATM LoP, and thus significantly decrease IHC failure rate by pre-selecting patients harboring such aberrations. In this study the investigator will be collecting archival tumor tissue or fresh tissue which will be assessed for ATM LoP and compared to NGS data. Additionally, patients whose tumors exhibit ATM LoP within this study could potentially enroll onto the treatment study REFMAL 721/ART0380C001.
