A Phase 1b Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CC-122 With Obinutuzumab (GA101) in Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL and iNHL.
CC-122-NHL-001 study is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib study with dose escalation and expansion parts. It evaluates the safety, tolerability and clinical pharmacokinetics of CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab (GA101). The study is also assessing the preliminary efficacy of the combination as well as pharmacodynamic and tumor biomarkers as exploratory objectives. In the dose escalation part, the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of CC-122 administered with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab will be administered to identify the maximum tolerated dose. In the dose expansion part, more patients will be enrolled at a CC-122 dose selected from the escalation part of the study in combination with fixed dose obinutuzumab to further study safety and efficacy.

Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse events, Approximately 6 years
Tumor Response, Percentage of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) Tumor response will be determined by the Investigator, based on modification of the modified International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson,2007) criteria, and summarized using frequency tabulation by dose cohort and tumor type., Approximately 6 years|Response Duration, Duration from the time when criteria for response (CR or PR) are met to disease relapse/progression using modified IWG evaluation criteria., Approximately 6 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Number of participants who survive without disease progression/relapse (using modified IWG evaluation criteria) or death as a result of any cause and time from the first dose date to disease progression/relapse or death, whichever occurs first, Approximately 6 years|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum Observed Concentration in plasma, up to 8 months|Pharmacokinetics AUC, Area under the Concentration-time Curve, Up to 8 months|Pharmacokinetics Tmax, Time to Maximum Concentration, Up to 8 months|Pharmacokinetics T1/2, Terminal half-life (t1/2), Up to 8 months|Pharmacokinetics - CL/F, Apparent total body clearance, Up to 8 months|Pharmacokinetics - Vz/f, Apparent volume of distribution, Up to 8 months
The one or two cohorts during the dose expansion phase (Part B) will enroll subjects with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who were either refractory to or relapsed after treatment with a lenalidomide-containing regimen (FL-1 cohort) or never been exposed to lenalidomide (FL-2 cohort). The FL-1 and FL-2 cohorts will enroll up to 20 and/or up to 30 subjects, respectively.
