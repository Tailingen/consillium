Chemo-immunotherapy Plus Thoracic Radiotherapy in Extensive Stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
Studies have shown that combining chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) prolongs survival compared with chemotherapy alone in extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES SCLC), but the survival benefit is modest. The main aim of this trial is to investigate whether there is a synergistic/additive effect of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in ES SCLC patients receiving carboplatin/etoposide/durvalumab.
Small-cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Thoracic radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemo-immunotherapy
Change in 1-year overall survival, The Cox proportional hazards method will be used to compare survival between the treatment groups., 14 months after last patient entry
Change in 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rate, The Cox proportional hazards method will be used to compare survival between the treatment groups., 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after last patient entry|Frequency and severity of adverse events, Adverse events will be compared between the treatment arms using the Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact test., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry|Change in progression free survival (PFS), PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox-model adjusting for baseline characteristics will be used for multivariable analyses., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry|Change in overall response rates, Response rates are compared using Pearson's Chi-square test., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry|Change in response rates in non-irradiated lesions, Response rates are compared using Pearson's Chi-square test., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry|Local control rates in the thorax, Local control rates are compared using Pearson's Chi-square test., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), All HRQoL scores will be transformed to a scale of 0-100 according to the EORTC QLQ scoring manual. Mean scores will be compared at each assessment timepoint, and a difference of 10 points is considered clinically relevant., Through study completion, an average of 1 year after last patient entry
Change in cognitive function from baseline to end of treatment, Cognitive function will be compared between patients who receive PCI and those who do not, using the MoCA-test. Scores will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after last patient entry|Frequency and timing of brain metastases, Changes in brain metastases are compared using Pearson's Chi-square test., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after last patient entry|Associations between outcomes of study treatment and biomarkers in tissue, blood and stool, A detailed plan for analyses will be defined when sufficient material for translational research has been collected., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after last patient entry
Studies show that adding ICI therapy to standard chemotherapy prolongs survival in ES SCLC. The survival benefit, however, is modest, and there is a need for more effective therapy. It has been hypothesized that there is a synergistic effect of combining ICI with radiotherapy. In this randomized phase III study, the main aim is to investigate whether concurrent thoracic radiotherapy of 30 Gy/10 fractions improves survival in ES SCLC patients receiving carboplatin/etoposide/durvalumab.

It is currently not possible to classify the patients who benefit from ICIs in SCLC. In this study, biological material (tissue, blood, feces) which will be analyzed for potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation in ES SCLC is debated, mainly due to the potentially detrimental effect on cognition. Thus, frequency and timing of brain metastases and cognitive function will be assessed before, during and after study treatment.
