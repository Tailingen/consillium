High-dose Sequential Chemoimmunotherapy for B-cell Lymphomas With Central Nervous System Involvement
This prospective trial will assess the activity and feasibility of a new high-dose methotrexate-based high-dose sequential chemotherapy combination in patients with B-cell lymphomas and CNS involvement at diagnosis or relapse. Selected drugs, with a well-documented anti-lymphoma activity, will be administered at high doses to increase blood-brain barrier penetration and CNS bioavailability as well as to reduce potential cross-resistance.
B-cell Lymphomas

Patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma and involvement of the central nervous system at diagnosis or relapse will be treated with a combination of high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, rituximab, and intrathecal depocyte followed by rituximab-high-dose sequential chemotherapy supported by autologous tsem cell transplantation.
