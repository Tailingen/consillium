Study of TBI-2001(Autologous CD19 Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Gene-transduced T Lymphocytes) for Relapsed or Refractory CD19+ B-cell Lymphoma, CLL/SLL
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) (TBI-2001) for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-cell lymphoma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL).

TBI-2001 is a next-generation CAR-T product including costimulatory sequences that lead to the activation of cytokine-related JAK/STAT signaling pathways. This is a first-in-human study of TBI-2001 and will follow a 3+3 design of dose-escalation cohorts. Additional subjects will be treated with TBI-2001 at the determined recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) following cyclophosphamide and fludarabine pre-treatment. Long-term follow-up is conducted for 5 years following the infusion of TBI-2001
