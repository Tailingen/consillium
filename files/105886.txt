Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of MEDI5752 in Combination With Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Sarcoma
This is a phase I, multicenter, open-label study starting with a dose exploration phase and followed by an expansion phase to evaluate the safety profile and the preliminary activity of the bispecific antibody anti PD-1/CTLA-4 MEDI5752 in combination with SBRT delivered on one lung metastatic lesion, in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

Dose exploration phase:

The primary objective of this dose exploration phase I trial is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the toxicity profile of MEDI5752 when administrated with stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with metastatic sarcoma with lung metastases.

Expansion phase:

The primary objective of the expansion phase is to investigate preliminary activity of MEDI5752 when administrated with stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with metastatic sarcoma with lung metastases.

A maximum of 20 evaluable patients will be included in this trial.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: SBRT + MEDI5752
Dose exploration Phase: The incidence of the Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), For each patient, DLT incidence will be evaluated during the first cycle., 6 weeks after the last dose of radiotherapy for each patient|Expansion phase: the rate of patients alive and without progression at 3 months., 3 months post treatment for each patient
Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: The incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events will be evaluated using the NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0., 15 months for each patient|Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: Objective Response Rate (ORR) defined as the rate of patients with an objective response (i.e. CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 criteria)., 15 months for each patient|Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) defined (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) as the time from treatment initiation until progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 15 months for each patient|Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: Time to progression of irradiated lesions defined as the time from treatment initiation until progression of irradiated lesions or death from any cause., 15 months for each patient|Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: Time to progression outside the irradiation field defined as the time from treatment initiation until progression outside the irradiation field or death from any cause., 15 months for each patient|Dose exploration and Expansion Phases: Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from treatment initiation to death from any cause., 15 months for each patient
