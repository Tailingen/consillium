Chemoradiotherapy With Elective Low Dose Nodal Radiation for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoRT) has become the standard of care for treatment of many patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), though many clinical questions remain. Prior experience has revealed locoregional control (LRC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years exceeding 80% after treatment with the use of hyperfractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced HNSCC. This multi-institutional phase II ZCC00204 trial resulted in an acceptable quality of life (QOL) and toxicity profile. The current trial is an attempt to maintain high LRC, while further minimizing both acute and chronic toxicities, and maximizing QOL.
