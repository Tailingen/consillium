Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastatis
The incidence rate of gastric cancer is high in Southeast Asia, so is the mortality rate.Due to the lack of specific performance, about 5%-20% of patients have found peritoneal metastases at the time of first diagnosis.At present, clinical studies on HIPEC in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis are almost related to abdominal perfusion after laparoscopic gastrectomy.Herein, we conduct a single-centre randomized controlled trial to explore the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic exploration combined with HIPEC in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.

Gastric cancer is one of the most common digestive tumors in the world.In China, advanced gastric cancer with severe local progression or distant metastasis is more common.Gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis has an extremely poor prognosis,with a median survival of less than 6 months.Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is currently a treatment for malignant tumors in the abdominal cavity and prevents tumor recurrence and metastasis.Studies have shown that hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy (HIPEC) has good clinical efficacy in the prevention and treatment of peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer and its associated malignant ascites.Therefore,we conduct a single-centre randomized controlled trial to explore the safety and feasibility of HIPEC in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. The metahnism of HIPEC is taking advantage of the difference in temperature sensitivity between cancer cells and normal cells. Perfusion of the abdominal cavity with a chemical fluid of the appropriate temperature can be performed. Suitable high temperatures can directly kill tumor cells.It is generally believed that the optimal temperature for the treatment of tumors is 42.5°C to 44°C.In this study,we set the temperature 43°C. Paclitaxel is a novel broad-spectrum antitumor drug,which has a unique anti-cancer mechanism.We use Paclitaxel as peritoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy drugs.The chemotherapy is SOX(Teggio and Oxaliplatin),.The primary endpoint is PFS. Secondary endpoints are one-year OS、canversion rate and ascites assessment. A phase III study PHOENIX-GC trial had finished enrollment,and the conclusion was the median OS 17.7 and 15.2 months respectively for IP and SP.The primary analysis did not show the statistical superiority of the IP regimen.The sensitivity analysis IP considering the imbalance of ascites, suggested clinical efficacy of IP PTX in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. For this reason,we conduct a trial to explore the safety and feasibility of HIPEC in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
