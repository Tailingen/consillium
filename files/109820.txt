A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Activity of TAK-931 in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of TAK-931 in a cohort of Western participants with metastatic solid tumors and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TAK-931 in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous esophageal cancer (sqEC), and squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC).

The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931. TAK-931 blocks function of a specific protein called CDC7 kinase in the human body. TAK-931 is being tested in participants with metastatic cancer (colorectal, pancreatic, sqNSCLC and sqEC) in the United States and Japan and also in the participants with any type of metastatic cancer with no standard therapeutic alternative in the United States only. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TAK-931.

The study will enroll approximately 160 participants. Participants will be enrolled in 5 cohorts: 1) Western safety cohort, to be enrolled in the United States only, will include non-Japanese participants with metastatic solid tumors and no standard therapeutic alternative, 2) Metastatic pancreatic cancer cohort, 3) Metastatic colorectal cancer cohort, 4) Metastatic sqNSCLC cohort, and 5) Metastatic sqEC cohort. All participants will receive:

â€¢ TAK-931 50 mg (2x25 mg or 5x10 mg) capsules

All participants will be asked to take one 50 mg (2x25 mg or 5x10 mg) capsule at the same time of the day every day for 14 days, followed by 7 days break in 21-day cycles throughout the study.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 24 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic. Participants in both Western cohort and disease specific cohorts will be followed for progression-free survival every 12 weeks after the last dose of the study drug until the occurrence of disease progression, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal, death, start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, study termination, or until 6 months after discontinuation of the study treatment, whichever occurs first. Once disease progression is confirmed, participants in the disease-specific cohorts will be followed for overall survival every 12 weeks until death, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal, study termination, or transfer of a participant to a long term safety study, single participant investigational new drug application, or similar program after the last dose of the study drug.
