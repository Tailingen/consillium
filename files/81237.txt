A Study of Setanaxib Co-Administered With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck (SCCHN)
The primary objective of this study is to compare the change in tumour size per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN patients treated with setanaxib and pembrolizumab versus patients treated with placebo and pembrolizumab.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: Setanaxib|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Best Percentage Change in Tumour Size, Defined as the best percentage change from Baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions, as assessed by RECIST v1.1., Baseline to at least 15 weeks and up to 51 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as time from randomisation to the first documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to approximately 21 months|Change From Baseline in Cancer-associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Level in Tumour Tissue, Changes within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups summarized both descriptively and as adjusted mean difference between treatment groups., Baseline up to approximately 9 weeks|Change From Baseline in the Number of Cluster of Differentiation 8 (CD8+) Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) in Tumour Tissue, Changes within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups summarized both descriptively and as adjusted mean difference between treatment groups., Baseline up to approximately 9 weeks|Change From Baseline in the Number of Regulatory T-cells in Tumour Tissue, Changes within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups summarized both descriptively and as adjusted mean difference between treatment groups., Baseline up to approximately 9 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of the patients who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 will be used to access ORR., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The minimum time when CR or PR is first observed to the time of progression of disease (PD) or death will be used to access DoR., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of the patients in whom the best overall response is determined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST v1.1 will be used to access DCR., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. Patients without documented death at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up., Baseline up to 12 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Any clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests (including biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and thyroid function), or 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results will be recorded as Adverse Events (AEs)., Baseline up to approximately 21 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), AESI include Anaemia and Hypothyroidism., Baseline up to approximately 21 months|Levels of Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression in Tumour Tissue, Combined Positive Score (CPS) is a scoring method that predicts response to pembrolizumab in patients with cancer defined as the number of PD-L1-staining cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) relative to the total number of viable tumor cells. A higher CPS score indicates an increased likelihood to respond to pembrolizumab treatment. It was hypothesized based on the mode of action of setanaxib that there would be an increased immunological response and therefore an increase in PD-L1 in tumor tissue.

Changes within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups summarized both descriptively and as adjusted mean difference between treatment groups., Baseline up to approximately 9 weeks|Change From Baseline in CAFs Cell Type Abundance Based on Gene Expression Profiles, Digital cytometry was carried out using CIBERSORTx. This estimates cell type abundance based on gene expression profiles in bulk RNA-Seq data. The abundance of myofibroblastic CAF were enumerated using a custom signature matrix based on gene expression profiles derived from annotated SCCHN scRNA-Seq data.

CIBERSORTx Absolute Abundance ratio is calculated by the median expression level of all genes in the signature matrix divided by the median expression level of all genes in the mixture (bulk RNA-Seq data for the sample). This produces a score that quantitatively measures the overall abundance of each cell type using gene expression profiles., Baseline up to approximately 9 weeks|Change From Baseline in CD8+ TILs Cell Type Abundance Based on Gene Expression Profiles, Digital cytometry was carried out using CIBERSORTx. This estimates cell type abundance based on gene expression profiles in bulk RNA-Seq data. The abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were enumerated using a custom signature matrix based on gene expression profiles derived from annotated SCCHN scRNA-Seq data.

The abundance of regulatory T-cells were enumerated using a custom signature matrix based on gene expression profiles derived from annotated SCCHN scRNA-Seq data.
