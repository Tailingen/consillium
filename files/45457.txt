This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to determine the effect of leucovorin in preventing or reducing Folotyn-related Grade 2 or higher oral mucositis in patients with hematological malignancies including PTCL and CTCL.

Patients with hematological malignancies, including PTCL and CTCL, will be enrolled based on meeting all protocol eligibility criteria. The primary endpoint will be evaluated in the first 7-week treatment cycle. For patients who respond to study treatment, the Investigator can treat patients for a total of 6 cycles. Approximately 37 patients will be enrolled. Safety, as assessed by reported SAEs, will continue to be monitored during the optional treatment period. Efficacy will be followed to the extent that it is evaluated according to the Institution's standard of care. No formal analysis of efficacy will be made.
