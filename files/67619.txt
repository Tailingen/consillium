Postoperative complications, complications will be classified according to Clavien-Dindo classfication, Postoperative complications : within 30 days after surgery|Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L) at month 3, Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L) will be administered at months 3., at month 3 after surgery|Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-VAS) at month 3, Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) will be administered at months 3., at month 3 after surgery|Postoperative pain, Pain levels were assessed and recorded using the VAS score more than three times daily during the hospitalization period., during hospitalization
Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L), Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) will be administered at 2 weeks before surgery, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months, as well as at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 after surgery., At 2 weeks before surgery, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months, as well as at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 after surgery.|Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-VAS), Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) will be administered at 2 weeks before surgery, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months, as well as at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 after surgery., At 2 weeks before surgery, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months, as well as at years 2, 3, 4, and 5 after surgery.|Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (LCQ), Questionnaires for HRQOL of life (LCQ) will be administered at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery., at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery.|Perioperative outcomes (Conversion rate), Conversion rate = conversion to open thoracotomy / total number of surgery, during hospitalization|Perioperative outcomes (number of lymph nodes harvested), Total number of lymph nodes harvested during the surgical procedure., during hospitalization|Perioperative outcomes (total operative time), the time taken from skin incision to completion of skin closure, during hospitalization|Perioperative outcomes (duration of chest tube drainage, postoperative hospital stays), duration of chest tube drainage: the time from the date of the operation to the date of chest tube removal

postoperative hospital stays: the time from the date of the operation to the date of discharge, during hospitalization|Perioperative outcomes (transfusion rate), The transfusion rate was defined as the percentage of patients who received an allogeneic blood transfusion within 30 days after surgery., within 30 days after surgery.|Perioperative outcomes (estimated blood loss ), estimated measurement of intraoperative blood loss (ml), during surgery|5-year overall survival and disease-free survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death. Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization to recurrence of tumor or death., 5 years
Investigators initially began single-port robotic thoracic surgery using the SP robotic system for simple procedures, such as thymectomy and mediastinal mass excision. As their expertise grew, they expanded to more complex procedures, including major pulmonary resection and esophagectomy. However, the long-term outcomes of SP robotic anatomical pulmonary resection using the SP robotic system have not yet been studied.

The aim of this study is to compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of SP robotic anatomical pulmonary resection using the SP robotic system with those of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SP-VATS) anatomical pulmonary resection.

This trial is a single-center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SP-VATS) or single-port robotic thoracic surgery.
