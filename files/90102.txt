Phase I Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerate Dose (MTD) of BGT226 in Advanced Solid Tumors in Japan
This study will confirm safety and tolerability and determine the MTD of BGT226 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumor.
Cancer|Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: BGT226
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at each dose level, 22-28 days
Safety measured by type, frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions, Safety measures by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Every 4 weeks|Preliminary Efficacy od BGT226, Measured by Response Evaluation criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Every 8 weeks|Percent of patients in which an altered molecular status is detected for markers related to Pl3K signaling, Baseline, every 3 weeks|Biomarkers: Percentage of change, pre- versus post-treatment, Every month
This study will confirm safety and tolerability and determine the MTD of BGT226 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumor.
