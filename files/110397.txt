(Summit) a Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CGT9486 Versus Placebo in Patients with Indolent or Smoldering Systemic Mastocytosis
This is a multi-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study comparing the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib (CGT9486) plus best supportive care (BSC) with placebo plus BSC in patients with nonadvanced systemic mastocytosis (NonAdvSM), including indolent systemic mastocytosis and smoldering systemic mastocytosis, whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by BSC. This study will be conducted in three parts. Patients in Parts 1a, 1b and 2 will receive bezuclastinib or placebo, and may roll over onto Part 3 to receive treatment with bezuclastinib.

Part 1: Determine recommended dose of bezuclastinib (CGT9486) in subjects with NonAdvSM, Selection of the recommended dose to be used in subsequent parts of the study., 3 months|Part 2: Efficacy of bezuclastinib at the selected dose versus placebo, Mean absolute change on the Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary (MS2D2), 24 Weeks|Part 3: Safety and tolerability of bezuclastinib as assessed by number of adverse events, CTCAE v5, Up to 5 years
Part 2: Proportion of subjects who had at least 50% reduction in serum tryptase, 24 weeks|Part 2: Proportion of subjects who had at least a 50% reduction in peripheral blood D816V allele fraction, 24 weeks|Part 2: Determine responder rates of subjects treated with bezuclastinib at the selected dose versus placebo, Proportion of subjects with at least a 30% reduction of the total symptom score (TSS) on the MS2D2.

Proportion of subjects with at least a 50% reduction of the total symptom score (TSS) on the MS2D2., 24 weeks|Part 2: Proportion of subjects who had at least 50% reduction in mast cell burden, 24 weeks|Parts 1 & 2: Safety and tolerability of bezuclastinib as assessed by number of adverse events, CTCAE v5, Up to 24 weeks|Parts 1, 2, & 3: Change and percent change in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures, Up to 5 years|Parts 1 & 3: Change and percent change in serum tryptase, Up to 12 months|Parts 1 & 3: Change and percent change in bone marrow mast cells, Up to 18 months|Part 1: Assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of bezuclastinib in subjects with NonAdvSM, Plasma concentrations of CGT9846, 3 months|Part 2: Determine mean change from baseline in predetermined PRO sub-domain and individual item scores, 24 weeks|Parts 2 & 3: Determine change of the lead (most severe) symptom and lead (most severe) subdomain of the MS2D2 in subjects treated with bezuclastinib versus placebo, Change and percent change from baseline in the symptom score of the subject's most severe symptom.

Change and percent change from baseline in the MS2D2 subdomain score of the subject's most severe subdomain., Up to 5 years|Part 3: Change and percent change in the levels of KIT D816V mutation allele burden, Up to 12 months|Part 3: To determine the efficacy of bezuclastinib at the selected dose, Proportion of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in MS2D2 TSS from baseline at 1 year and 2 years from start of bezuclastinib

Change and percent change from baseline in the MS2D2 TSS, subdomain, and individual item scores, Up to 2 years|Part 3: Usage of concomitant medications as rescue therapy for NonAdvSM and changes from baseline in rescue therapy and best supportive care medications regimen, Up to 5 years
