Relationship Between Tumor Mutation Burden and Predicted Neo-antigen Burden in Patients With Advanced Melanoma or Bladder Cancer Treated With Nivolumab or Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab (CA209-260)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the characteristics of tumors in patients treated with nivolumab and to identify features that help to predict a good or bad response to this drug.
Bladder Cancer|Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab
Confirmed objective response to 1) nivolumab monotherapy and 2) ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy in patients progressing on initial nivolumab monotherapy, Primary clinical endpoint was proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed objective response rate (per RECIST 1.1) to 1) nivolumab monotherapy and 2) ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy in bladder cancer patients progressing on initial nivolumab monotherapy., From treatment start, up to 2 years from initial dose of nivolumab.
Tumor Mutational Burden, Primary correlative objective was to obtain information on mutational load and obtain preliminary prospective data on whether this factor is predictive of response to immunotherapy. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with mutational load as a continuous measure was used to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) to assess the detectability of responders. This was applicable to Bladder cohort., At baseline
