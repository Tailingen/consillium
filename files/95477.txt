Taxotere New Indication - Gastric Cancer Treatment Registration Trial
Primary objective:

To detect a statistically significant increase in time to progression (TTP) of disease for the test group (Taxotere® \[Docetaxel\] combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \[TCF\]) relative to the control group (Cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil\[CF\])

Secondary objectives:

* To detect a statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS) for the test group relative to the control group.
* To compare response rate (RR), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of responses, safety profiles, quality of life (QOL), and disease-related symptoms.
