FGF19 Overexpression Combination Unified Study in HCC-19
This study is designed prospectively to investigate the safety and efficacy of ABSK-011 and ABSK043 in patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) harboring FGF19 overexpression. ABSK-011, an oral, selective FGFR4 inhibitor which can irreversibly bind to the target. ABSK043, is an orally available, selective and potent inhibitor targeting the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1, Safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ABSK-011 or ABSK043 were explored in a phase 1 trial ABSK-011-101 (NCT04906434) and ABSK043-101 (NCT04964375) trial, respectively. This trial focuses on the efficacy of the combination of ABSK-011 and ABSK043 in patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic HCC harboring FGF19 overexpression.
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ABSK-011
To evaluate the objective response rate of ABSK-011 plus ABSK043 in patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic HCC harboring FGF19 overexpression, Objective response rate (ORR): complete response and partial response determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 and to be confirmed, 10 months
The patients that meet the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will treat with ABSK-011 RP2D and ABSK043 RP2D until the disease progression
