This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, multi-center, parallel group study to evaluate the PK of oral JDQ443 in participants with mild, moderate, and/or severe hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy control participants.

The study comprises a 28-day Screening period (Days -28 to -2), a baseline evaluation period (Day -1), a single dose administration of 200 mg of JDQ443 (Day 1), and a follow-up period of 4 days (Days 2 to 4) for PK sample collection. All participants should have a post-study safety follow-up contact conducted approximately 30 days after last administration of study treatment. The study will be considered complete once all the participants have finished the required assessments or have dropped out or been lost to follow-up.

A total of up to 48 participants will be enrolled in this study. Approximately 8 participants will be enrolled in each of mild (Child-Pugh A; Group 2), moderate (Child-Pugh B; Group 3), and severe (Child-Pugh C; Group 4) hepatic impairment groups (to have at least six evaluable participants in each group). Each participant in the healthy control group (Group 1) will be matched to one or more evaluable participants with hepatic impairment with respect to age, body weight and sex. All participants will receive a single JDQ443 dose. Upon completion of mild and moderate impairment groups, as well as matching control participants, an interim analysis will be conducted to compare the PK exposure of the two hepatic impaired groups (Groups 2 and 3) to that of the control participants. The interim analysis is to mitigate the potential safety risks in participants with severe hepatic impairment. If the interim analysis results do not show a clinically relevant increase in exposure of JDQ443 and is well tolerated from a safety perspective, then severe hepatic impairment participants may be enrolled. Participants with severe hepatic impairment will be enrolled only after the completion of the interim analysis.
