Can Alternative Treatment Have an Impact on Cervical Dysplasia?
In this study two questions will be answered:

* can mindfulness meditation help cell-changed on the cervix to disappear?
* can mindfulness meditation lower the psychological distress when women have abnormal cervical cancer screening results?

200 women, who have participated in cervical cancer screening and have mild dysplasia, will be randomized into two groups; an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group will be asked to do mindfulness meditation twice a week listening to instructions from a CD. 200 additional women having normal cervical screening results will also be included in the project.
