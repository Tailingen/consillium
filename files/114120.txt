Assessment of Tumor Vascular Effects of Axitinib With Dynamic Ultrasonography in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate and quantify the dynamic modifications of tumor blood perfusion on axitinib therapy in patients with refractory mCRC for each dose of Axitinib.
