Cardiometabolic Status in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a prospective cohort study assessing measures of cardiometabolic status, body composition, IR and GH response to stimulation after therapy in children (age 7-21 years) treated for ALL. Patients and sibling controls will be recruited from the Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Clinic at the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Cardiometabolic Profile, To determine the cardiometabolic profile (as measured by a single score based on adiposity, serum lipids, and vascular function) shortly after therapy (6 months after completion of therapy \[Visit 1\]) and again 2.5-3 yrs after completion of therapy (Visit 2) in 300 ALL patients, and compare with 200 sibling controls., up to 2.5-3 Years
Prevalence of Blunted Stimulated Growth Hormone Response, To determine the prevalence of blunted stimulated GH response suggesting GH deficiency (peak GH \<7mcg/L) in ALL survivors and controls: GH level will be obtained at baseline, then +30, +60, +90 and +120 minutes after clonidine (5 mcg/kg up to 200 mcg by mouth), followed by infusion of arginine (0.5 grams/kg up to 30 grams) with a series of GH levels at +140, +160, +180, +210, and +240 minutes. Blunted response to GH stimulation will be defined as peak GH level\<7 mcg/L., Between 2.5 and 3 Years
This is a prospective cohort study with two groups: survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have recently completed therapy (cases) and healthy siblings (controls) frequency matched by age and sex. Subjects in each group will have two visits. For cases, the first visit will be approximately 6 months after completion of treatment for ALL; for their siblings, the first visit occur at approximately the same time. For both cases and controls, the second visit will be 2 to 2.5 years after the first visit.
