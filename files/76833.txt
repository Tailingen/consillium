Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the dose level at which "no more than 1 of 6 participants experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) following de-escalation from the maximum administered dose (MAD)." DLT includes grade (Gr) 2 or greater gastrointestinal toxicities, Gr 3 anemia, nonhematological toxicities (excluding nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) or Gr 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and inability to resume axitinib (AG-013736) dosing within 14 days of stopping due to treatment related toxicity., Baseline up to Day 28
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours (hrs) post-dose on Day (D) 1 and 15 of Cycle (C) 1 and Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2); pre-dose on Day 43 (Day 15 of Cycle 2) and Day 57 (Day 1 of Cycle 3)|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2); pre-dose on Day 43 (Day 15 of Cycle 2) and Day 57 (Day 1 of Cycle 3)|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to 12 Hours [AUC (0-12)], AUC (0-12)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to time of last quantifiable concentration (0-12)., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2); pre-dose on Day 43 (Day 15 of Cycle 2) and Day 57 (Day 1 of Cycle 3)|Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F), Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2); pre-dose on Day 43 (Day 15 of Cycle 2) and Day 57 (Day 1 of Cycle 3)|Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2), Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2); pre-dose on Day 43 (Day 15 of Cycle 2) and Day 57 (Day 1 of Cycle 3)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) in Fed State Versus Overnight Fasting, Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2) and Day 30 (Day 2 of Cycle 2)|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) in Fed State Versus Overnight Fasting, Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2) and Day 30 (Day 2 of Cycle 2)|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours [AUC (0-24)] in Fed State Versus Overnight Fasting, AUC (0-24)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to time of last quantifiable concentration (0-24)., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2) and Day 30 (Day 2 of Cycle 2)|Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) in Fed State Versus Overnight Fasting, Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2) and Day 30 (Day 2 of Cycle 2)|Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2) in Fed State Versus Overnight Fasting, Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hrs post-dose on Day 29 (Day 1 of Cycle 2) and Day 30 (Day 2 of Cycle 2)
