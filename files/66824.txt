A Bidirectional Study in Exploring the Dynamic Changes of Plasma and Urine Metabolites of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
The transformation process of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is complex, so it is particularly important to explore the relationship between various disease states on its clinical pathway. Therefore, we carried out this study to explore the changes of plasma and urine metabolites at different stages during the occurrence and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
