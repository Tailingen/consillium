Cinacalcet stUdy for Peritoneal Dialysis Patients In Double Arm on the Lowing Effect OF iPTH Level
This study is designed in order to investigate the effect of cinacalcet in combination with routine conventional medical management for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and Ca, P control. This study will compare the efficacy of a cinacalcet-based regimen with unrestricted conventional care (vitamin D and phosphate binders) for achieving the stringent National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) targets for dialysis patients.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
DRUG: cinacalcet|DRUG: control
> 30% reduction from baseline of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 20 weeks
Achievement of treatment goal of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (150~300 pg/ml), 20 weeks|Achievement of targets for mean Ca x P (<55 mg2/dL2), Ca (<9.5 mg/dL), P (<5.5 mg/dL), 20 weeks|Achieving targets for intact PTH (150-300 pg/ml) and calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P) (<55 mg2/dl2) simultaneously, 20 weeks|Vascular calcification score, Abdominal aortic calcification score (AAC, 0-24) will be measured at baseline and at 20 weeks according to Kauppila et al (Atherosclerosis 2004), 20 weeks|Normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase, Serum alkaline phosphatase measured at baseline and 20 weeks, 20 weeks|Serum FGF-23, Elevated serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is associated with adverse outcomes in dialyzed patients. Therefore, we added analysis of change in FGF23 levels between two treatments to explore the cinacalcet effect in lowering FGF23., baseline and 20th week
