Iron Isomaltide for Iron-deficiency Anemia Patients With Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Primary purposeï¼š To evaluate the difference of hematopoietic response rate at 1 month after concurrent chemoradiotherapy between iron isomaltide and oral iron supplement for treating iron-deficiency anemia patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Secondary purpose:

To evaluate the difference of hematopoietic response rate, tolerance, acute side effects, qualtiy of life at 2 months and 3 months after concurrent chemoradiotherapy between Iron Isomaltide and oral iron supplement for treating iron-deficiency anemia patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Iron-deficiency anemia patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be enrolled and receive iron Isomaltide or oral iron supplement after randomised. The hematopoietic response rate, tolerance, acute side effects, qualtiy of life and long time survival would be evaluated.
