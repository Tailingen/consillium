Influenza Vaccine Post Allogeneic Transplant
Study Design:

This is a randomized, single center study to evaluate immune responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who receive one vaccine or two vaccine doses one month apart. In addition, a cohort of healthy adult volunteers will be recruited as controls to confirm immune response to a single influenza vaccine.
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant|Hematologic Malignancy
BIOLOGICAL: Influenza vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Influenza vaccine
Number of Subjects With T-Cell Based Immune Response to Vaccine, The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the response to the vaccine with laboratory studies including viral specific T cell immune responses. Response is defined as 4 times above the background after a filter plate was developed. Response is listed as a number of subjects (evaluable) that successfully responded., 8 Weeks After Vaccination
Number of Subjects With H3 Based Immune Response to Vaccine, The secondary endpoint of this study is to measure the response to the vaccine with laboratory studies including viral specific H3 immune responses (IFN-y Elispot). Response is defined as 4 fold increase in H3N1. Response is listed as a number of subjects (evaluable) that successfully responded., 8 Weeks After Vaccination
