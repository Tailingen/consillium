Efficacy, Immunogenicity, and Safety Study of the 9vHPV Vaccine in Japanese Males (V503-064)
The purposes of this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study are to evaluate the efficacy of V503 (9-valent human papillomavirus \[9vHPV\] vaccine) in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anogenital persistent infection, and to evaluate the safety/tolerability of V503, in Japanese males who are 16 to 26 years of age. It is hypothesized that administration of a 3-dose regimen of V503 reduces the combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related anogenital persistent infection, as well as the combined incidence of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related anogenital persistent infection, compared with placebo.

The study includes a Base Study to assess efficacy and safety of V503, and an Extension Study. Participants who received placebo in the Base Study will be eligible to receive V503 vaccine on Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6 of the Extension Study. Participants who received less than 3 doses of V503 in the Base Study will be offered the opportunity to complete the 3-dose regimen in the Extension Study.

Combined Incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11/16/18-related Anogenital Persistent Infection, Combined incidence of HPV type(s) 6/11/16/18-related anogenital persistent infection was defined to have occurred in a participant; 1) who is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive to at least one applicable HPV type(s) in 2 consecutive anogenital or biopsy samples from at least 2 consecutive visits 6 months (±1 month visit) or longer apart, or 2) who has a pathology diagnosis of condyloma, penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia, or penile, perineal or perianal cancer and PCR detection of at least one applicable HPV type(s) in an adjacent section and PCR positive for the same HPV type at a separate adjacent visit with regardless of visit interval, prior to or following the biopsy showing HPV disease. Incidence was defined as the number of cases per 100 person-years of follow-up in both V503 and placebo arms. Per protocol, cases per 100 person-years is reported for applicable HPV type eligible participants with data available in the per-protocol efficacy population (PPE)., Up to approximately 36 Months|Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The participant recorded the presence of any vaccination report card (VRC)-prompted injection-site AEs that occurred in the 5 days after any vaccination. The percentage of participants with an injection-site AE prompted on the VRC (redness/erythema, tenderness/pain, and swelling) is reported here for all randomized participants in the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population., Up to 5 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With ≥1 Systemic AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 systemic AE is reported here for all randomized participants in the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population., Up to 15 days after any vaccination|Percentage of Participants With ≥1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention, that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization, results in persistent/significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital birth defect, or is another important medical event. The percentage of participants who experienced at least 1 SAE is reported here for all randomized participants in the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population., Up to approximately 37 months|Number of Participants With Elevated Oral Body Temperature, Participants collected their oral body temperature in the evening of their vaccination day and at the same time each day thereafter for 4 days. The maximum body temperature obtained within 5 days of any of the 3 vaccinations was recorded using the vaccination report card (VRC). Per protocol, fever was defined as an oral temperature of ≥99.5°F(37.5°C). The number of participants who had at least 1 oral body temperature reading that was, \<99.5°F (\<37.5ºC), ≥99.5°F (≥37.5ºC) and \<100.4°F (38.0°C), or ≥100.4°F (38.0°C) and \<101.3°F(38.5°C), or ≥101.3°F(38.5°C) is reported here for all randomized participants in the APaT population with temperature data available., Up to 5 days after any vaccination
Combined Incidence of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related Anogenital Persistent Infection, Combined incidence of HPV type(s) 31/33/45/52/58-related anogenital persistent infection was defined to have occurred in a participant; 1) who is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive to at least 1 applicable HPV type(s) in 2 consecutive anogenital or biopsy samples from at least 2 consecutive visits 6 months (±1 month visit) or longer apart, or 2) who has a pathology diagnosis of condyloma, penile/perineal/perianal intraepithelial neoplasia, or penile, perineal or perianal cancer and PCR detection of at least 1 applicable HPV type in an adjacent section and PCR positive for the same HPV type at a separate adjacent visit with regardless of visit interval, prior to or following the biopsy showing HPV disease. Incidence was defined as the number of cases per 100 person-years of follow-up in both V503 and placebo arms. Per protocol, cases per 100 person-years is reported for applicable HPV type(s) eligible participants with data available in the per-protocol efficacy population (PPE)., Up to approximately 36 Months|Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 - All Randomized Participants, Antibodies to the HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 contained in V503 were measured using a competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA).
