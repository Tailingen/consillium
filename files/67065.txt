Phase 1/2 Study of CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CD19 CAR-T; PL001) for Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a multiple center, non-randomized, open-label, phase 1/2 study. The primary objective of Phase 1 is to evaluate the safety of PL001 and find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19 CAR-T(known as PL001).

Cluster of differentiation (CD) 19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) has been a very promising treatment option for multiple types of B-cell lymphoma. Kymriah速 (tisagenlecleucel, Novartis) and Yescarta速 (axicabtagene ciloleucel, Gilead) were licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2017 to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL). A third anti-CD19 CAR-T product, Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel, Gilead) was approved by the US FDA for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in July 2020. In February 2021, another product, Breyanzi速 (lisocabtagene maraleucel, Juno Therapeutics, Inc.), was approved by the US FDA for relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified (including DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMLBCL), and Gr. 3b FL.

Currently, in Taiwan, no CD19 CAR-T therapies are available commercially.This Phase 1/Phase 2 study will test PL001, a CD19 CAR-T therapy manufactured by Pell Bio-Med Technology Co., Ltd., as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. The Phase 1 of the study will be conducted to establish a dose range that is well tolerated by the majority of patients and to provide a safety profile of PL001 in the target patient population. The results of the Phase 1 of the study will recommend the dose selection for the Phase 2 of the study. Phase 2 of the study will assess the efficacy and safety of PL001 in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma.
