Non-Helium Magnetoencephalography in Pediatric Brain Tumors
This observational study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the preoperative assessment of pediatric brain tumors, particularly in determining the extent of resection, and compare it with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

What is the consistency between MEG and CT/MRI in localizing pediatric brain tumors? What is the clinical efficacy of MEG in determining the extent of resection of pediatric brain tumors preoperatively?

Participants will:

Undergo both MEG and CT/MRI examinations for preoperative assessment, and the extent of tumor resection will be determined by the comprehensive results of the above examinations.

Be followed up with MEG and CT/MRI at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, along with neurological and quality-of-life assessments.
Pediatric Brain Tumor
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Magnetoencephalography plus Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Consistency in Tumor Localization Between Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CT/MRI) (Kappa Coefficient), The primary outcome will measure the agreement between MEG and CT/MRI (gold standard) in localizing pediatric brain tumors. Consistency will be quantified using the Kappa coefficient (κ), with sensitivity and specificity calculated for MEG against CT/MRI. Data will be aggregated by comparing preoperative MEG localization results (e.g., tumor location categorized by brain regions) with CT/MRI findings. Statistical analysis will include calculation of κ values (95% confidence interval), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) using SPSS version 27.0., From enrollment to 12 months after surgery.
