Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimens in Resected Biliary Tract Cancers (TOG/GI-SAFRADJU-2501)
The goal of this observational study is to compare chemotherapy types that are given after surgery for biliary tract cancers. The main question it aims to answer is:

Are any of the chemotherapy regimens more effective in preventing recurrence, providing longer survival, or having less toxicity?

Nationwide multicenter retrospective data will be collected.

Recurrence-free survival, The length of time from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of the first loco-regional or systemic recurrence or death, From the date of adjuvant chemotherapy initiation until the date of first documented recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 180 months|Overall survival, The length of time from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death, From the date of adjuvant chemotherapy initiation until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 180 months
2-year recurrence-free survival, The length of time from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of recurrence or date in the first 2-years, From start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of recurrence or death in the first 2 years|2-year overall survival, The length of time from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death in the first 2 years, From start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death in the first 2 years|The number of patients experienced toxicities, The rates of grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 toxicities, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From the date of initiation of the first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy until 1 month after the last cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy
Recurrence-free survival analyses in subgroups, Recurrence-free survival (The length of time from start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of the first loco-regional or systemic recurrence or death) will be analysed and compared in different subgroups.

Subgroups

* Age ( below 65 vs. 65 and above 65)
* ECOG performance score (0 vs. 1)
* Lymph node status (Positive vs negative)
* Resection (R1 vs. R0)
* Anatomical subtype (intrahepatic vs perihilar vs. distal vs gallbladder), From the date of adjuvant chemotherapy initiation until the date of first documented recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 180 months|Overall survival analyses in subgroups, Overall survival (The length of time from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death) will be analysed and compared in different subgroups.
