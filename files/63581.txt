Front-line Therapy With Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Induction
The purpose is to determine whether induction and consolidation treatment with Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (CRd), within an intensive program, warrant further investigation in clinical trials.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone
rate of stringent complete response, completion of consolidation, 12 months
The primary objective is to evaluate the sCR rate of the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients at the completion of consolidation therapy.

It's a multicenter, open label, non randomized, phase II study. 46 patients will be enrolled.

Induction: 4 cycles of 28 Days with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide and dexamethasone Stem Cell Harvest: High dose Cyclophosphamide with intensification consolidation: 4 cycles of 28 Days with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide and dexamethasone Maintenance : Lenalidomide 13 cycles of 28 days
