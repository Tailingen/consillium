Capecitabine With Digoxin for Metastatic Breast Cancer
To evaluate the Growth Modulation Index (GMI) of the combination of metronomic capecitabine with oral digoxin in metastatic breast cancer
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Digoxin
Metronomic Capecitabine With Oral Digoxin, Evaluate the Growth Modulation Index (GMI) of the combination of metronomic capecitabine with oral digoxin in metastatic breast cancer, One year
Combination Overall Clinical Benefit by RECIST 1.1, Assess the activity of this combination in terms of overall clinical benefit rates (CBR), including complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), One year
In this phase II study, the Investigators will combine metronomic capecitabine with digoxin to treat metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed on both anthracyclines and taxanes. We hypothesize that the combination of digoxin with metronomic capecitabine may lead to increased efficacy and duration of treatment without progression with decreased side effects than standard regimen.
