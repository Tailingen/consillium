A Phase Ib Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of FMT and Nivolumab in Subjects With Metastatic or Inoperable Melanoma, MSI-H, dMMR or NSCLC
A Phase Ib trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) in combination with Nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or inoperable melanoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) cancer, or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Melanoma Stage IV|Unresectable Melanoma|NSCLC Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: Fecal Microbial Transplantation by capsules
Incidence of FMT-related Adverse Events, Number of patients with adverse events that emerged post FMT. The AE severity grading scale for the NCI-CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for assessing AE severity, 3 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients with objective responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients, according to imaging studies (RECIST 1.1) and iRECIST, 3 years
Changes in immune activation in the gut, Immune activation in gut is defined as a 20% or more increase in cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) cell counts pre and post FMT, 3 years|Changes in immune activation in the tumor, Changes in the relative abundance of different immune cell population (such as the proportion of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and T cell in the tumor pre and post FMT, 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration of progression free status evaluated according to imaging studies (RECIST 1.1) and iRECIST., 3 years|To assess Overall survival (OS), The proportion of patients remaining alive from initiation of study treatment until completion of two year follow-up from End of Treatment (EOT), 3 years|To assess Duration of response (DoR), Time from initial response to disease progression or death among patients who have experienced a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, 3 years|Incidence of immune related toxicities induced by anti-PD-1, Number and Grade of immune related Adverse events (irAE) reported that emerged post anti-PD1 treatment, 3 years
This study is a Phase I single-center adaptive design study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FMT in combination with Nivolumab for adult subjects with treatment-refractory or inoperable melanoma, MSH-H, dMMr or NSCLC.

FMT will be conducted with fecal capsules, originating from patients that have achieved a durable complete response with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of FMT with Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-1 (anti PD-1) treatment and explore different biomarkers.
