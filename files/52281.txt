Effects of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) on Peritoneal Tumor Tissue
There are to date no studies available that have examined the effects of CAP on tumor tissue in patients. The aim of this study is to investigate these effects in patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases. Tumor nodules will be treated with different durations and intensities of CAP before being surgically removed. The resected nodules will be analyzed for tumor vitality.

DEVICE: J-plasma
- Histology:, Following resection, FFPE sections will be assessed morphologically, particularly for the extent of tumor necrosis using haematoxylin and eosin staining. IHC staining will be performed to investigate mechanisms of autophagia (p62 and LC3B), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) and proliferation (ki67).

* Extent of tumor necrosis: morphological assessment
* Proliferation: Ki67 via MIB1
* Autophagia: p62 or LC3B
* Apoptosis: Caspase 3 antibodies, 1 year
