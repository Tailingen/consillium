Cancer Development In Organ Transplant Recipients
The investigators will determine the cancer risk in organ transplant recipients compared to the general population with the help of statistical analysis. Secondly the investigators will try to characterize the different cancer types.
Heart Cancer|Kidney Cancer|Lung Cancer|Pancreas Cancer|Liver Cancer
Number of solid cancers, Number of solid cancers, Ten Year followup
This cohort analyses will focus on incident and recurrent cases of development of non-skin cancer over time. We will consider time to first formation of non-skin solid cancer after solid organ transplantation as well as the cumulative number of non-skin solid cancer formation over time. Both aspects are equally important and will be reflected in the analytic methods of this study. Theses analyses will be restricted to the most prevalent transplantation types of heart, kidney, liver, and lung.
