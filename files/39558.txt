Study to Evaluate Relacorilant (CORT125134) in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of the combination of relacorilant (CORT125134), a novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, and nab- paclitaxel in participants with solid tumors and to determine the preliminary efficacy of the combination of relacorilant and nab-paclitaxel. The structure for the study was a single arm, non-randomized, open- label, multicenter trial with no control group.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Relacorilant with nab-paclitaxel
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity, The Maximum Tolerated Dose and the development regimen of relacorilant with nab-paclitaxel was determined by the number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities as defined in the protocol., Up to completion of Cycle 1 (up to 28 days)
Number of Participants With One or More Adverse Events Related to Treatment With Relacorilant, Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (Segment I: up to approximately 2.5 years, Segment II: up to approximately 1.5 years)
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from the start of relacorilant or nab-paclitaxel, whichever is earliest, across all time points during study observation period (including both confirmed and unconfirmed responses)., Up to 512 days|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate is defined as the participants who have achieved CR or PR (including both confirmed and unconfirmed responses), or stable disease for 16 weeks or greater., Up to 512 days|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the date that criteria are met for CR or PR until the first date that progressive disease or death is objectively documented, whichever occurs first. Participants with no documentation of disease progression or death on-study are censored at the date of last available tumor assessment, From the time of response up to the last disease assessment (up to 512 days)|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from date of first dose of relacorilant or nab-paclitaxel, whichever is earliest, to the date of documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death for any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants with no documentation of disease progression or death on-study are censored at the date of last available tumor assessment., Up to 512 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of the first dose of relacorilant or nab paclitaxel, whichever is earliest, to the date of death for any cause. Participants with no documentation of death on-study are censored at the date at which they are last known to be alive., Up to 512 days|Best Response Rate in Participants With Tumor Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Above or Below the Median Overall Level, Best response is defined by RECIST v1.1 as the best response recorded from the date of the first dose of relacorilant or nab-paclitaxel, whichever is earliest, across all time points during study observation period (including both confirmed and unconfirmed responses)., Up to 512 days|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Zero to 24 Hours (AUC0-24) of Plasma Relacorilant, Segment I: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 8; Segment II: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics: AUC0-24 of Plasma Nab-Paclitaxel, Segment I: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 8; Segment II: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Plasma Relacorilant, Segment I: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 8; Segment II: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax of Plasma Nab-Paclitaxel, Segment I: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 8; Segment II: before dosing and up to 24 hours after dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1
The study consisted of two segments to evaluate alternative dosing schedules of relacorilant administered at escalating dose levels. Segment I was to evaluate a continuous-dosing regimen and Segment II was to evaluate an intermittent-dosing regimen. Enrollment in Segment I and Segment II were mutually exclusive, and the two segments enrolled participants concurrently.

In Segment I continuous-dosing cohorts, participants received a single nab-paclitaxel lead-in infusion on Day 1 of Week -2 before Cycle 1, and oral relacorilant lead-in once-daily of Week -1 before Cycle 1. After the Data Review Committee review of data for 2 dose levels, the nab-paclitaxel lead-in was discontinued. The lead-in period was followed by oral relacorilant administered continuously once daily, in combination with nab-paclitaxel infusions on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Segment 1 enrolled a total of 64 participants.

In Segment II intermittent-dosing cohorts, participants received a single relacorilant lead-in dose on Day -1 before Cycle 1, followed by oral relacorilant, administered intermittently the day before, the day of, and the day after nab-paclitaxel infusions on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Segment II enrolled a total of 21 participants.
