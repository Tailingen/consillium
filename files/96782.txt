Liposomal Irinotecan With TAS102 and Bevacizumab for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study is being done to see if combining liposomal irinotecan with TAS102 and bevacizumab confers clinical benefit for patients with treatment refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Liposomal irinotecan|DRUG: TAS102|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from D1 of treatment with the study combination until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria or death as a result of any cause., up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR will include confirmed complete response (CR) + confirmed partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 divided by the number of patients receiving at least one dose of proposed combination., up to 2 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities, Grade 3 and 4 toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0) (CTCAE v5.0), up to 30 days post-treatment (approximately 6 months on study)|Summary of Grade 3 and 4 Toxicities by Count of participants, Grade 3 and 4 toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0) (CTCAE v5.0), up to 30 days post-treatment (approximately 6 months on study)|Efficacy of irinotecan measured by PFS for patients with and without irinotecan containing regimens, PFS will be compared between those subjects who were treated in the last 4 months with an irinotecan containing regimen versus those who were not, up to 2 years
This prospective phase II, single arm, single site trial will evaluate the efficacy of the combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI), TAS102, and bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with mismatch repair proficient, metastatic or unresectable colorectal cancer that has previously been treated with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and if RAS wild-type an anti-EGFR agent. A total of 25 patients will be accrued at UW Carbone Cancer Center. Subject enrollment will occur over 12 months with the total duration of the trial expected to be 3 years.

Primary Objective

* To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated in the treatment refractory setting with liposomal irinotecan in combination with TAS102 and bevacizumab.

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of liposomal irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab and TAS102.
* To assess the safety and tolerability of these regimens in this setting.
* To determine the impact of the timing of irinotecan use in prior lines of therapy on the ORR and PFS observed with these nal-IRI containing treatment regimens
