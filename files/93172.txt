Comparison Study of Dendritic Cell Vaccine With and Without Cyclophosphamide to Treat Stage IV Melanoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide) and CD34-DC vaccines results in the improved rate of clinical responses for stage IV melanoma patients.
Malignant Melanoma Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: DC Vaccine & Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: DC Vaccine & Placebo
Induction of melanoma-specific CD8+T Cell Immunity., 2 years
Rate of objective clinical responses., 2 years
Vaccination of patients with metastatic melanoma using ex vivo generated dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigen(s) have been shown to induce tumor-specific immunity against melanoma antigens measured by in vitro assays and, in some cases, tumor regression. At the present time, the numbers of recorded patients with metastatic melanoma who have been treated with DC vaccinations are too small to predict with certainty the future of overall therapeutic value of DC vaccinations in the management of patients with metastatic melanoma. The purpose of this study is to gather data on feasibility and efficacy of novel combination therapy of CPA and a DC vaccine outlined in this protocol to treat metastatic melanoma.
