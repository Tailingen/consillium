A Study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion in Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Following Initial Therapy
This is an event driven, adaptive design, a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label, parallel groups, Phase 3 study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion plus Bevacizumab versus Bevacizumab alone in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity, The number of participants with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) who were enrolled into Part 1 - the safety set., Dose-limiting toxicity will be evaluated and applied from Day 1 through Day 29|Overall Survival (OS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treated With DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone, The effect of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone on the OS of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy., 4 weeks after the patient has been off study treatment, every 3 months thereafter until death, the study closes, up to 24 months.
Overall Survival (OS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treated With DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone at 12 Months, The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone on the OS of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy., 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive GBM, The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus Bevacizumab (BEV) versus BEV alone on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy. PFS is defined as the interval between randomization and progression or death from any cause any cause as determined by the central radiology body., The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive GBM at 6 Months, The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus Bevacizumab (BEV) versus BEV alone on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy. PFS is defined as the interval between randomization date and progression or death from any cause as determined by the central radiology body. The percentage of patients who achieved PFS at 6 months are summarized., The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause at 6 months|The Effect of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone on the Response Rate of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive GBM, Assessment of the objective response rate (ORR) of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM. The response rate is defined as the percentage of patients exhibiting a response (complete response \[CR\] plus partial response \[PR\]) based on the Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria as determined by the central radiology body., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 24 months|Duration of Response in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive GBM Treated With DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone, The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone on the duration of response of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM. The duration of response is defined as the interval between first documented oncological response and progression of disease or death from any cause., From the date of first treatment up to 24 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Assessment of safety of DSP7888 dosing emulsion plus Bevacizumab (BEV) versus BEV alone in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is on treatment, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, an average of 4 months
