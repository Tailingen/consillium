Safety and Efficacy of Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T Cells (Meta10-19) in the Treatment of r/r B-NHL Clinical Research
A Study of Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T Cells Therapy for Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-hodgkin Lymphoma,B Cell
DRUG: Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T cells
MTD, Determine the Maximal Tolerable Dose(MTD)., MTD will be determined based on DLTs observed during the first 35 days of study treatment.|Objective response rate (ORR), Measure Tumor response rate (including CR and PR)., Within 3 months following infusion of Meta10-19.
Concentration of CAR-T cells, Concentration of CAR-T cells measured by Flow cytometry after CAR-T infusion., Up to 12 months after CAR-T treatment.|Pharmacodynamics of CAR-T cells, Concentration levels of CAR-T related serum cytokines such as CRP, IL-6, INF-Î³ at each time point., Up to 28 days after infusion.
This is a single arm,open-label study.This study is indicated for relapsed and/or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products and our earlier disclosed clinical trials.

1. Main research objectives:

   To evaluate the safety and efficacy of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells in the treatment of r/r B-NHL.
2. Secondary research objectives:

   * To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics(PD) characteristics of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells after infusion.
   * To evaluate tumor remission after infusion of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells.
