Phase II Study of Gleevec/Imatinib Mesylate (STI-571, NCS 716051) in Neurofibromatosis (NF1) Patients With Plexiform Neurofibromas
THe primary objective is to estimate the response rate at 6 months to Gleevec® in patients with plexiform neurofibromas
Neurofibromatosis
DRUG: Gleevec
Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Volume at 6 Months, Volumetric measures were performed using MRI scan analysis. Response criteria include greater than 20 percent decrease in tumor volume as responsive. Greater than 20 percent increase in tumor volume as tumor progression. Less then 20 percent increase or decrease in tumor volume is stable disease, baseline to 6 months
Serum Bioactivity, The investigators will quantitate the biologic activity of patient serum on fibroblast proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis pre and post-Gleevec (7 days and 1 month), 7 days and 1 month
This is an open-label Phase II Study to determine the efficacy of Gleevec® in neurofibromatosis (NF1) patients with plexiform neurofibromas with the secondary goals of determining the toxicity, and tumor markers in this genetically defined population. The rationale for this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to Gleevec® in vitro and the response of a single NF1 patient treated with Gleevec® for airway compression by a plexiform neurofibroma with a dramatic response not previously seen in NF1 therapy. The plan of therapy will include oral dosing of Gleevec® at 440 mg/m\^2/day (max 800 mg/day) for pediatric subjects and 800 mg/day for adult patients. (with 25% dose reduction for significant toxicity). Treatment will continue for 6 months with an option to continue as long as the patient remains on study provided the patient shows benefit from treatments with Gleevec® and there are no safety concerns.
