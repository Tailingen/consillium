Optimization of the Bowel Preparation Regimen for the PillCam速 COLON 2 Capsule Endoscopy Procedure
This study is designed to determine the optimal bowel preparation regimen for PillCam速 COLON 2 Capsule Endoscopy System (CCE) procedures in average risk patients.

Patients will be randomized to receive one of two bowel preparation regimens prior to PillCam CCE.

Bowel Cleansing Level of Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam速 Colon Capsule Endoscopy (CCE), The primary endpoint is the bowel cleansing level, as determined by a standardized 4-point grading scale, assessed in total and by segment (cecum, ascending, transverse, descending/sigmoid, and rectum)., Within two weeks of study procedure
Comparing Polyp Detection Rate of Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam CCE, Will be assessed from RAPID video in total and by segment, an expected average of 3 weeks from study procedure|Colonic Transit Time of Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam CCE, Colonic transit time of two different bowel preparation was assessed from RAPID video in total and by segment, an expected average of 3 weeks from study procedure|Comparing of Completion Rate of Capsule of Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam CCE, Will be assessed from RAPID video in total and by segment, an expected average of 3 weeks from study procedure|Excretion Rate of Capsule Within 12 Hours of Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam CCE, Will be assesses by applicable case report form (CRF), an expected average of 3 weeks from study procedure|Adverse Events Rate Between Two Different Bowel Preparation Methods for PillCam CCE, Will be assesses by applicable CRF, Adverse Events (AE) were collected starting from the screening visit and until 5-9 days following the PillCam procedure day.
This is a multicenter, prospective, consecutive, randomized study. Average-risk subjects undergoing CCE without optical colonoscopy will be consecutively enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive one of two bowel preparation regimens prior to PillCam CCE.

Subjects will be enrolled at 5-10 clinical sites in the United States. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be screened for study participation at a baseline visit and will be evaluated on the procedure day or until capsule excretion. A telephone follow-up will be conducted 5 to 9 days post-capsule ingestion to verify capsule excretion, assess patient well-being, and capture any adverse events.
