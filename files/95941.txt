Immediate Curative Vs Conservative Treatment in Older Men with M0, High-risk Prostate Cancer
It is currently unclear if immediate curative treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) of high-risk prostate cancer without metastasis in older men (\>=75 years) generates the same survival benefits as in younger patients or if the harms/ side-effects of immediate curative treatment outweigh the benefits. In this study the investigators randomize older patients with high-risk, non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer to either immediate curative therapy or to conservative, more problem-oriented therapy to investigate if immediate curative treatment prolongs life, improves quality of life and is cost-effective.

There is a lack of both level 1 evidence and consensus regarding the optimal treatment strategy for older men (\>=75 years) with non-metastatic, high-risk prostate cancer. Currently, in Scandinavia, the majority of older patients are treated conservatively, i.e. with hormone therapy or watchful waiting while some centers recommend immediate curative therapy regardless of patient age. Older patients thus risk both undertreatment and overtreatment of their cancer. This randomized clinical trial investigates if immediate curative therapy of high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer prolongs life (as it does in younger patients) and improves health-related quality of life. Furthermore, this trial investigates if the early side effects of immediate curative therapy are compensated by better long-term tumor control, better quality of life, functional status and improved survival.
