A Study of SYS6010 and Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Patients With EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYS6010 versus platinum-based chemotherapy in participants with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
EGFR-mutated Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: SYS6010|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by independent review committee (IRC), Defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death was assessed by IRC according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 1.5 years
Investigator-assessed PFS, Defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death was assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 1.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of subjects who have a best overall response of CR or PR or SD based on IRC and investigator according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), : Defined as the proportion of patients with response (including CR and PR) assessed by the investigator and the IRC according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 1.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), AEs graded by CTCAE version 5.0, Up to approximately 2 years|Serious adverse events (SAEs), SAEs graded by CTCAE version 5.0, Up to approximately 2 years|EORTC QLQ-LC13 questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-LC13 incorporates one multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis., Up to approximately 2 years|EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30 is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions., Up to approximately 2 years|Plasma concentrations of toxin-bound antibodies, Tests are conducted after single and continuous administration of SYS6010., Up to approximately 2 years|Plasma concentrations of total antibodies, Tests are conducted after single and continuous administration of SYS6010., Up to approximately 2 years|Plasma concentrations of free toxin (JS-1), Tests are conducted after single and continuous administration of SYS6010., Up to approximately 2 years|anti-SYS6010 antibodies (ADA), Incidence of SYS6010 anti-drug antibodies, Up to approximately 2 years
This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III clinical study, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYS6010 versus platinum-based chemotherapy in participants with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have failed EGFR TKI therapy.
