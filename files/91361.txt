Almonertinib in the First-line Treatment of Patients of NSCLC With Poor Performance Status
Most of the lung cancer patients treated in hospitals in China are in advanced stage, accounting for more than 2/3 of all lung cancer patients, and some of the patients have a poor performence status.At present, most of the patients included in clinical trials are patients with good PS score, and the NCCN guidelines for advanced lung cancer patients with poor performence status recommend the best supportive care.Therefore, the investigator wanted to explore the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib in lung cancer patients with poor performance status.

Most of the lung cancer patients treated in hospitals in China are in advanced stage, accounting for more than 2/3 of all lung cancer patients, and some of the patients have a poor performence status.In recent years, systemic treatments with good efficacy and low toxicity, such as gene-targeted therapy, anti-angiogenic therapy and immunotherapy, have largely replaced single chemotherapy, and have great potential to benefit from existing treatments for poor PS scores of advanced lung cancer patients can adopt more aggressive treatment strategies.At present, most of the patients included in clinical trials are patients with good PS score, and the NCCN guidelines for advanced lung cancer patients with poor performence status recommend the best supportive care.Therefore,the investigator wanted to explore the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib in lung cancer patients with poor performance status.
