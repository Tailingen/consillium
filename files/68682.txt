LBH Phase II in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
SCLC is the most aggressive and lethal form of lung cancer, typically very sensitive to cytotoxic therapy when first diagnosed, but associated with a high incidence of tumour relapse and a very poor life expectancy. Combination chemotherapy based on cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide represents the most widely used regimen. Despite of the high response rate, approximately 80% of patients with limited disease and nearly all patients with extended disease develop disease relapse or progression. Topotecan is, at present, the only approved second line treatment in Europe.

The search of a new therapeutic agent that could alter the natural history of SCLC would be an important goal to be reached. LBH589 (Panobinostat) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor available for intravenous and oral administration. LBH589 could be classified as PAN-DAC inhibitor targeting both histone and non histone proteins and as such it could be suitable for combination with cytotoxics. Three phase I dose escalation studies with both the intravenous and the oral formulation of LBH589, examining various dose schedules of administration have been conducted in advanced solid tumours and haematological malignancies.

Single agent activity was observed in phase I in patients with haematological cancer. In solid tumours one response (Hormone-refractory Prostatic Cancer) and some prolonged stabilizations have been observed with intravenous formulation. Phase II studies are now in progress.
