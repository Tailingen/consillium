Assessment of Awake Surgery With Electrocorticographic Recordings in the Management of Gliomas and Correlation With Imaging Data (ECoG)
This study proposes to analyze data from intraoperative ECoG recordings acquired during wakefulness interventions in order to identify the connection networks involved in cognitive functions. This study also proposes to correlate the ECoG data with the imaging data and to analyze the disturbances of the electrophysiological signals induced by the cortical and subcortical brain lesions: this will make it possible to establish a more detailed mapping of the tumor areas and to compare disturbances recorded to those recorded in healthy areas. Thus, this approach should make it possible to improve the quality of excision of glial lesions located in eloquent areas, while reducing the risk of neurological sequelae and thus improve the survival and quality of life of patients.

PROCEDURE: ECoG : electrocorticography
electrocorticographic recordings, Intraoperative ECoG recordings (raw signals) acquired during awake surgery which in clinical practice couples cortical stimulation and simultaneous ECoG recordings with behavioral tests. The regions defined as electrophysiologically "connected" to the stimulated region will be those for which an afterdischarge is recorded (short-duration rhythmic activity following the stimulation) and/or a cortico-cortical evoked potential is obtained after a average of 5 successive stimulations., 12 months
