Pain Control Using Neuromodulation in Patients Undergoing Definitive Chemoradiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can reduce pain perception associated with the effects of receiving definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients.
Cancer of Head and Neck
DEVICE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
Visual Analog Scale (VAS), A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to assess patient-reported odynophagia at weekly Radiation Oncology on-treatment visits (OTVs). The VAS is a traditional pain assessment tool that has been used and validated widely in both clinical and research settings, including studies of oral mucositis pain. This scale ranges from 0-100, in which 0 means no odynophagia, and 100 means highest level of odynophagia ever., Pre-treatment (baseline), throughout treatment (once a week for 7 weeks), 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)|EEG Power Spectrum Week1/Week7, EEG data power spectrum analysis. Week1 and Week 7 difference. Note: the control participant's data was not reported due to limited number of participant in the control group. The report was divided into five frequency bands:

* Delta = 0-4 Hz
* Theta = 4-7 Hz
* Alpha = 8-15 Hz
* Beta= 16-31 Hz
* Gamma 32-50 Hz

The data was recorded at P3, Fz, Cz, F3, Fp1, Fp2 points in the international 10-20 system.

The analysis was done using EEGLab V 14.1.1., Week1/Week7|EEG Spectrum Pre-Post tDCS Session, EEG data power spectrum analysis. Pre/Post-tDCS session. The report was divided into five frequency bands:

* Delta = 0-4 Hz
* Theta = 4-7 Hz
* Alpha = 8-15 Hz
* Beta= 16-31 Hz
* Gamma 32-50 Hz

The data was recorded at P3, Fz, Cz, F3, Fp1, Fp2 points in the international 10-20 system.

Note: the control participant's data was not reported due to limited number of participant in the control group., Pre/Post-tDCS Session
Oral-Mucositis Weekly Evaluation - Overall, 1-7 scale grading self-evaluated overall physical condition, 7= Excellent, 1 = Very poor., Pre-treatment (baseline), throughout treatment (once a week for 7 weeks), 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)|Patient Weight, Participant's weight each measurement time point. Note: 0 means data missing., Pre-treatment (baseline), throughout treatment (once a week for 7 weeks), 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, The General Positive and General Negative scores in the PANAS forms are reported for both pre- and post- treatment. The General Positive (GP) and General Negative (GN) scores were reported. Each score ranges from 10-50, in which 10 = lowest (positive/negative emotional level) and 50 = highest (positive/negative emotional level)., Pre-treatment (baseline), throughout treatment (once a week for 7 weeks), 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)|Washington Quality Of Life Questionnaire, The Washington Quality Of Life questionnaire (QOL) is one of the most frequently reported health-related QOL questionnaires in head and neck cancer. This questionnaire scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the hierarchy of response., Pre-treatment (baseline), Week 7 of treatment, 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)|Present Pain Intensity Index in McGill Questionnaire Pre-tDCS Treatment, The Present Pain Intensity (PPI) index is recorded as a number ranges from 0 to 5, in which each number is associated with the following words: 0 no pain, 1 mild, 2 discomforting, 3 distressing, 4 horrible, 5 excruciating., Pre-treatment (baseline), throughout treatment (once a week for 7 weeks), 1 week and 1 month follow-ups (post-treatment)
The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of tDCS as a novel pain relief modality for odynophagia due to mucositis in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer undergoing definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be randomized into one of two arms: (1) Treatment: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care + tDCS neuromodulation or (2) Control: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care only.

Patients in the treatment arm will undergo tDCS stimulation on the day of their radiation/chemoradiotherapy appointments, prior to receiving treatment when doing tDCS session in clinic or after to receiving treatment when doing tDCS session at home. This will occur daily (5 days per week) during the second and third weeks of therapy, three times per week during the fourth and fifth weeks, and twice per week during the sixth and seventh weeks.

Patients will also have EEG and fNIRS recordings during the study. This will occur at the pre-study visit, the first stimulation appointment, the third week, the 7th week, and during the follow-up appointments (one-week and one-month).
