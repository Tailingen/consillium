A Study of AK117 in Combination With Azacitidine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AK117 or placebo, combined with azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS).
