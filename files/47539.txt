Utidelone Capsule Combined with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in First-line Treatment of PD-L1-negative Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma Patients
This is a multi-national, open-label, randomized, seamless phase II/III clinical study of UTD2 combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients with PD-L1-negative locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma untreated with systemic treatment in advanced setting.

Safety and tolerability of UTD2 and capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in Phase II, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as any toxicity meeting the criteria outlined in the protocol during Cycle 1 in a 21-days cycle, From Day 1 to Day 21|Overall Survival (OS), From the first dosing until death (from any cause), follow-up began after the end of treatment, 12 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Response rate is the proportion of evaluable patients who are evaluated as having a CR or PR., 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), refers to the time from first dosing to the occurrence of tumor progression or death (whichever occurs first), 12 months|Maximum (or peak) serum concentration (Cmax), Cmax of Utidelone Capsule, 12 months|Time to peak drug concentration (Tmax), Tmax of Utidelone Capsule, 12 months|the area under the concentration-time curve from dosing (time 0) to time t (AUC0-t), the AUC0-t of Utidelone Capsule, 12 months|the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf), the AUC0inf of Utidelone Capsule, 12 months|the time required for plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50% (t1/2), the t1/2 of Utidelone Capsule, 12 months|Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), Until 28 days after the last dose of treatment
Patient reported outcomes (PRO), A questionnaire derived from NCI-PRO-CTCAE version 1.0 will be used to assess patient reported safety, 12 months
