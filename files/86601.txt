Optimizing Prostate Biopsy Schemes in Men With Multiple mpMRI Visible Lesions
The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of different prostate biopsy schemes in prostate cancer diagnosis among men with multiple mpMRI visible lesions, including combination of targeted and perilesional/regional biopsy (PB/RB) (TPLBx) and combination of systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy (CTSBx).

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does TPLBx promote the accurate diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) among men with multiple mpMRI visible lesions? What's the value of TPLBx in improving the evaluation of prostate cancer when developing the treatment plan for patients with multiple mpMRI visible lesions? What's the value of TPLBx in avoiding the adverse pathological outcomes after the radical prostatectomy such as upgrade, upstage, capsule invasion, and positive surgical margin among patients with multiple mpMRI visible lesions? Researchers will compare the cancer detection rates of TPLBx and CTSBx to explore the efficacy of different prostate biopsy schemes. They will evaluate the occurrence rates of adverse pathological changes of different prostate biopsy schemes after the radical prostatectomy (RP).

Participants will:

Receive TPLBx or CTSBx.

PROCEDURE: Targeted and perilesional biopsy (TPLBx)|PROCEDURE: Combined targeted and systematic biopsy (CTSBx)
The clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection rate for TPLBx and CTSBx schemes, The csPCa was defined as prostate cancer (PCa) with a grade group ≥2 or Gleason score (GS) ≥3+4. The reference standard was the pathological result., One month after the biopsy procedure.
The PCa detection rate, The PCa detection rate for TPLBx and CTSBx schemes., One month after the biopsy procedure.|The clinically insignificant PCa (ciPCa) detection rate, The ciPCa was defined as PCa with a grade group \<2 or GS \<3+4. The reference standard was the pathological result., One month after the biopsy procedure.|The higher-grade PCa detection rate for TPLBx and CTSBx schemes, The higher-grade PCa was defined as PCa with a grade group ≥3 or GS≥4+3. The reference standard was the pathological result., One month after the biopsy procedure.|The Gleason score (GS) of the biopsy sample, The Gleason score was reported by senior uropathologists according to the Standards of Reporting for MRI Targeted Biopsy Studies (START) criteria and interpreted according to the recommendations of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group., One month after the biopsy procedure.|The GS of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, The overall grade was assigned based on the part with the highest Gleason score according to the recommendations of the ISUP. For the RP specimens, the overall grade was assigned based on the part with the highest Gleason score according to the recommendations of the ISUP., One month after the RP.|The adverse pathological outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, The adverse pathological outcomes such as upgrading, upstaging, positive surgical margin, and capsule invasion were assessed and reported by the senior uropathologists based on RP specimens., One month after the RP.
Prostate biopsies have been the cornerstone of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. The optimal biopsy scheme should achieve the highest csPCa detection rates with the most accurate core sites and the least biopsy-cores. The combined targeted and systematic biopsy (CTSBx) could effectively detect clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and was the standard scheme for patients with visible suspicious lesions on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in the past. However, some limitations existed in the CTSBx scheme, including the detection of clinically insignificant PCa (ciPCa), the risk of post-biopsy complications, and adverse pathological changes such as upgrade, upstage, capsule invasion, and positive surgical margin after the radical prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, more and more radiologists and urologists focused on the issue of optimization of prostate biopsy schemes. Recent studies demonstrated that the majority of csPCa were found within a band of 10-mm radius outside MRI lesions (the penumbra). Focusing biopsy cores within and around the region of interest (ROI), known as targeted and perilesional biopsy (TPLBx) scheme, is recommended by the latest EAU guideline for the diagnosis of patients with visible suspicious lesions on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI).

Prostate cancer generally occurs multifocally. The incidence of multiple lesions among different cohorts in previous studies ranges between 20% and 50%. Though the CTSBx schemes are usually utilized for these patients, some previous studies suggested that additional systematic biopsy is of limited informative value in terms of overall csPCa detection. Therefore, the optimal prostate biopsy scheme for patients with multiple visible mpMRI suspicious lesions is still a matter of debate. Compared with the CTSBx scheme, the TPLBx changed the distribution of the biopsy-core according to the location of visible suspicious lesions. Many studies have preliminarily verified that the diagnostic efficacy of TPLBx was not inferior to that of CTSBx with the benefits of decreasing the detection of ciPCa and reducing biopsy cores. TPLBx scheme focuses biopsy cores within and around the ROI, which may evaluate the pathological characteristics of mpMRI visible suspicious lesions more accurately, benefiting for the treatment planning and reducing the occurrence rates of adverse pathological changes after the radical prostatectomy (RP). However, current data for TPLBx schemes are mostly retrospective, and few studies focused on the application of TPLBx for patients with multiple mpMRI visible lesions. Thus, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the efficacy of TPLBx and CTSBx schemes for patients with multiple mpMRI visible lesions, provide high-quality evidence for the optimization of prostate biopsy schemes.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does TPLBx promote the accurate diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) among men with multiple mpMRI visible lesions?
