Open-label of Loncastuximab Tesirine (ADCT-402) in Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma
The purpose of this research study is to see if loncastuximab tesirine has any benefits at dose levels researchers found acceptable in earlier studies in patients with related forms of immune cell cancers. The researchers want to find out the effects (good and bad) that loncastuximab tesirine has on the participant and the participant's condition.

DRUG: Loncastuximab tesirine 150 µg/Kg|DRUG: Loncastuximab tesirine 75µg/Kg
Complete Response (CR) rate of Loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed/refractory at 6 months, CR rate is defined as the Complete Response (CR)/n, where n is the number of participants. The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR), per Cheson criteria if disease is not PET (Positron emission tomography)-avid in initial screening and by revised Lugano criteria if screening PET-CT demonstrated PET-avid disease.CR will be defined by a Deauville score of ≤ 3., 6 months.|Complete Response (CR) rate of Loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed/refractory at 12 months, CR rate is defined as the Complete Response (CR)/n, where n is the number of participants. The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR), per Cheson criteria if disease is not PET-avid in initial screening and by revised Lugano criteria if screening PET-CT demonstrated PET-avid disease.CR will be defined by a Deauville score of ≤ 3., 12 months.
Partial Response rate at 6 months, PR rate Partial Response rate: (PR)/n, where n is the number of participants.The proportion of patients with best overall response of partial response (PR), per Cheson or revised Lugano criteria (based on PET avidity), among evaluable patients, 6 months|Partial Response rate at 12 months, PR rate Partial Response rate: (PR)/n, where n is the number of participants.The proportion of patients with best overall response of partial response (PR), per Cheson or revised Lugano criteria (based on PET avidity), among evaluable patients, 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months, Overall response rate (ORR): (CR+PR)/n, where n is the number of participants. The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete or partial responses, per Cheson or revised Lugano criteria (based on PET avidity) modified for MZL (marginal zone lymphoma), among evaluable patients, 6 months|Overall response rate (ORR) at 12 months, Overall response rate (ORR): (CR+PR)/n, where n is the number of participants. The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete or partial responses, per Cheson or revised Lugano criteria (based on PET avidity) modified for MZL, among evaluable patients., 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS),which is defined as the elapsed time from start of treatment to documented progressive disease or death from any cause. For patients alive and progression-free, follow-up will be censored at the last date of document progression-free status., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), defined as the elapsed time from start of treatment to death from any cause. Alive patients will censored at last date known to be alive., 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR), defined as elapsed time from achievement of objective response (Complete Response or Partial Response) to progression, relapse, or death from any cause., 2 years|Number of Treatment Related Toxicities, Defined as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment as assessed by treating physician., 7 months
