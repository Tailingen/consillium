Number of Participants With Objective Response Rate Assessed by Investigator Following DS-1103a Combination Therapy (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate based on investigator (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors v1.1) and confirmed by a second assessment., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 44 months|Disease Control Rate Following DS-1103a Combination Therapy Assessed by Investigator (Dose Escalation) or Blinded Independent Central Review (Dose Expansion), Disease control rate is defined as the sum of the CR rate, PR rate, and stable disease (SD) rate based on investigator assessment (Dose Escalation) or blinded independent central review (BICR)(Dose Expansion)., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 44 months|Clinical Benefit Rate Following DS-1103a Combination Therapy (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the sum of the CR rate, PR rate, and ≥6 months SD rate based on investigator assessment (Dose Escalation) or BICR (Dose Expansion)., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 44 months|Duration of Response Following DS-1103a Combination Therapy (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) (based on investigator assessment \[Dose Escalation\] or blinded independent central review (BICR) \[Dose Expansion\]) or death. The DoR will be calculated for responding participants (PR or CR) only., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 44 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve for DS-1103a (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable time (AUClast) and Area under the plasma concentration-time curve during dosing interval (AUCtau) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Dose Escalation: Cycles 1,2, and 4: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 3 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 5 and beyond Day 1; Dose Expansion: Cycles 1 and 3: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 2 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 4 and beyond Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Plasma Concentration for DS-1103a (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Dose Escalation: Cycles 1,2, and 4: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 3 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 5 and beyond Day 1; Dose Expansion: Cycles 1 and 3: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 2 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 4 and beyond Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration for DS-1103a (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Dose Escalation: Cycles 1,2, and 4: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 3 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 5 and beyond Day 1; Dose Expansion: Cycles 1 and 3: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 2 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 4 and beyond Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Minimum Plasma Concentration for DS-1103a (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods., Dose Escalation: Cycles 1,2, and 4: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 3 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 5 and beyond Day 1; Dose Expansion: Cycles 1 and 3: Days 1,2,4,8,15; Cycle 2 Days 1,8,15; Cycle 4 and beyond Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Anti-drug Antibodies Following DS-1103a Combination Therapy (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Predose on Cycles 1 to 2 (Days 1, 15), Cycles 3 and 4 (Day 1), thereafter every 2 cycles (Day 1), end of treatment, 40-day safety follow-up, and every 3 months, up to 1 year from last dose or until anti-drug antibodies are negative (each cycle, 21 days)
DS-1103a, a recombinant humanized IgG4 anti-SIRPα antibody designed to block the SIRPα-CD47 interaction, is being developed for the treatment of advanced cancers in combination with other anticancer therapies. This is the first-in-human, dose-escalating clinical study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of DS-1103a combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
