A Phase II Combination of Trastuzumab and Ixabepilone Versus Trastuzumab and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this randomized, Phase 2 open-label study was to assess the response rate of participants with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (Her2+) locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer (not previously treated with chemotherapy or trastuzumab) to treatment with ixabepilone plus trastuzumab and/or docetaxel plus trastuzumab.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: ixabepilone|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: trastuzumab
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR; Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Version 1.1), Percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the investigator. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks after initial assessment. A two-sided confidence interval (CI) was computed using the Clopper-Pearson method., Assessed every 6 weeks from initiation of study therapy up to 12 months; then every 3 months until disease progression (maximum time that any participant was on therapy was 108 weeks)|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, BOR was the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the LD of all lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks after initial assessment. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. Refer to Outcome Measure 3 for definition of PD., Assessed every 6 weeks from initiation of study therapy up to 12 months; then every 3 months until disease progression (maximum time that any participant was on therapy was 108 weeks).
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time in months from randomization until first date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause without prior documentation of progression. PD=≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to smallest sum LD recorded at or following baseline or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesion(s) overall.

Estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. A two-sided 95% CI for median duration was computed by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From randomization until the first date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause without prior documentation of progression (maximum participant PFS of 39.7 months).|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the time in weeks from randomization until the measurement criteria are first met for a CR or PR, whichever is recorded first.

CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the LD of all lesions. CR and PR criteria should be met again after 4 weeks and before 6 weeks after initial assessment. Estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. A two-sided 95% CI for median duration was computed by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From randomization every 6 weeks for first 12 months and thereafter every 3 months until CR or PR whichever was recorded first (maximum participant time to response of 18.4 weeks.)|Duration of Response, Period measured in months from time that measurement criteria were first met for CR or PR until first date of documented PD or death from any cause without prior documentation of progression.

PD=≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to smallest sum LD recorded at or following baseline or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesion(s) overall. Refer to Outcome Measure 1 for definitions of CR and PR. Estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. A two-sided 95% CI for median duration was computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method., From the date of first PR or CR assessment to the date of documented progressive disease or death without prior documentation of progression (maximum participant duration of response of 38 months.)|Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs), and AEs Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy Per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0, AE: New untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not have causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: Untoward medical event that at any dose: results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, drug dependency/abuse; life-threatening, an important medical event, a congenital anomaly/birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization/prolongs existing hospitalization.
