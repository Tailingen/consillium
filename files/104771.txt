Trabectedin and Irinotecan for Refractory Pediatric Sarcomas
The purpose of the study is to evaluate patients with refractory childhood sarcomas, who have been treated with a combination therapy of trabectedin and irinotecan (within compassionate use), to determine, if this is a promising treatment option with acceptable toxicity and if the results warrant a prospective study.
