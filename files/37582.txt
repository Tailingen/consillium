Bacterial Cellulose-monolaurin Hydrogel for Acute Radiation Dermatitis
Acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) is almost universally experienced by patients with cancer during or after radiation therapy. This condition potebtxallt leads to detrimental clinical outcomes as it adversely affects adherence to prescribed subsequent management and further worsens quality of life. Nevertheless, there remains no consensus on the appropriate intervention for ARD. This pilot two parallel-group randomized trial aims to clinically assess the potential of bacterial cellulose-monolaurin hydrogel, compared to placebo cream, to prevent high-grade ARD among Filipinos with breast cancer up to four weeks after last radiotherapy session.
Acute Radiation Dermatitis
OTHER: Bacterial cellulose-monolaurin hydrogel|OTHER: Placebo cream
Incidence of high grade acute radiation dermatitis, High-grade acute radiation dermatitis is defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade of at least 3, Baseline to Week 4 post-radiotherapy
Distribution of participants in terms of ARD CTCAE grades, Distribution of participants across the ARD CTCAE grades (0-5) in the two interventions will be compared, Baseline to Week 4 post-radiotherapy|Patient-reported quality of life, Outcome will be assessed using the Skindex-16 (SD-16) questionnaire, administered on a weekly basis from baseline up to two weeks post-radiotherapy, Baseline to Week 4 post-radiotherapy
