Single Incision Plus One Port Laparoscopic Surgery Assistant Enhanced Recovery After Surgery on Colorectal Cancer
Conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colorectal cancer has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible and present minimally invasive benefits including faster recovery, reduced postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay, also acquiring comparable oncologic outcomes with open surgery. To achieve further minimally invasive outcomes, SILS plus one port surgery was attempted by some surgeons. Preliminary results showed that SILS+1 could achieve better minimally invasive benefits than CLS while preserving oncologic feasibility.

Till now, ERAS has been practiced in colorectal cancer surgery for approximately 20 years. Studies have proven that ERAS is safe and significantly improved the recovery course of patients during perioperative period, meanwhile, the expense could be greatly reduced.

Based on ERAS studies protocols and SILS+1 trials, investigators tried to combine SILS+1 with ERAS, hopefully to provide patients with more safe, economic, feasible and rapid surgery and perioperative strategies.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Single incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery
Rehabilitative rate, The percentage of patients who met discharge criteria in the fourth day after surgery, 4 days|Postoperative hospital stays, Days from surgery to discharge, 1 month
Medical cost, The patient's expenses from surgery to discharge are recorded in RMB "yuan", 1 month|Postoperative pain score, Postoperative pain is recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score tool on postoperative day . On a scale of 1 to 10, the higher the score, the greater the pain., Once a day from 6 hours to the fourth day after surgery|Postoperative recovery index, The first Time to early mobilization(hour), flatus(hour), liquid diet(hour), soft diet(hour), removal of the Nasogastric tubes(hour) , removal of the peritoneal drainage(hour) are used to assess the postoperative recovery, 1 month|Postoperative inflammatory immune response, It includes the number of white blood cells and lymphocytes,CRP, IL-6, 3 days|compliance with ERAS measures, It is defined as if the patients complete every ERAS measure or not. We can defined it "yes " or "not"., perioperative|6 min postoperative walking test(6MWT), Study site, subject preparation, trial procedures, and medical monitoring refer to the 6MWT guidelines issued by the American thoracic society in 2002., Once a day from the frist to the fourth day after surgery|hospital readmissions, It can be defined as the number of patients readmitted within 30 days because of postoperative complications., 30days|Morbidity and mortality rates, Morbidity and mortality rates are defined as postoperative complications graded according to Clavien-Dindo within 30 days., 30 days
