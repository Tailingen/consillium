Pembrolizumab in Patients With Leptomeningeal Disease
This is an open-label phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMD). Approximately 18 subjects in this study will receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses.

This is an open-label phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMD). Patients may have received any number of prior therapies for their respective solid tumors, but must not have received prior anti-PD-1 therapy and developed progressive disease. Approximately 18 subjects in this study will receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses. In patients who derive clinical benefit from therapy, pembrolizumab may be continued until documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdrawal of consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or for administrative reasons.
