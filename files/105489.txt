A Phase 2 Study of Ivosidenib in Previously Treated Japanese Subjects With Nonresectable or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma With an IDH1 Mutation
This study will enroll participants with nonresectable or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an Isocitrate dehydrogenase protein, 1 (IDH1) mutation, who have previously received at least 1, but no more than 2, prior regimens for advanced disease. All participants will receive ivosidenib daily throughout multiple 28 day cycles. Study treatment will be administered until participant experiences unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or other discontinuation criteria are met. Study visits will be conducted every week during Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), every other week during Cycles 2 and 3, and Day 1 of each cycle thereafter. After the last dose of treatment, participants will attend an end of treatment and a post-treatment follow-up visit, and participants will be followed to assess overall survival. Study visits may include a tumor assessment, physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine analysis, and questionnaires.
