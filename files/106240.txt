Study of IMC-3G3 in Patients With Tumors That Are Not Responding to Standard Therapies or No Therapy is Available
The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-3G3 is safe for patients, and also to determine the best dose of IMC-3G3 to give to patients.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: IMC-3G3
Summary of Participants Reporting Adverse Events, Approximately 36 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), After all patients complete a cohort, toxicity data is reviewed before the next cohort of patients is treated at the next higher dose level, Approximately 36 months
Pharmacokinetics, 6 weeks|Anti-IMC-3G3 Antibody Assessment, Approximately 36 months|Antitumor Activity of IMC-3G3 as Monotherapy, 6 weeks|Pharmacodynamics, 6 weeks
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the anti-PDGFRÎ± monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in patients with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.
