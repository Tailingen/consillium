AZD1390 in Recurrent and Newly Diagnosed WHO Grade 4 Glioma Patients
This is an open-label, single-center Phase 0/1b study that will enroll at least 27 participants with recurrent WHO Grade 4 Glioma requiring re-radiation and approximately 35 participants with newly-diagnosed WHO Grade 4 glioma (nGBM). The trial will be composed of a Phase 0 component (subdivided into Arms A - C), and an expansion Phase 1b. Patients with tumors demonstrating a positive PK response in the Phase 0 component of the study will be eligible to graduate to an expansion phase that combines therapeutic dosing of AZD1390 plus standard-of-care fractionated radiotherapy (RT).

Phase 0: The relative pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD1390 in tumor tissue from Grade 4 glioma participants treated with AZD1390, For PK analysis, total and unbound AZD1390 concentration in Gd-enhancing and Gd-non-enhancing tumor tissue., Phase 0 Intraoperative|Phase 1b: Examine the rate of 6-month progression-free survival glioma participants with demonstrated PK effect., The rate of 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) measured from time of surgery to date of recurrence or death, whichever occurs first, will be summarized., From the date of Phase 0 surgery to the date of progression
Phase 0: To evaluate the relative pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD1390 in CSF, AZD1390 level in CSF will be determined., Phase 0 Intraoperative|Drug-related toxicity, Incidence of drug-related toxicity, Through study completion, an average of once a week|Adverse events, Number of adverse events through study completion, Through study completion, an average of once a week|Deaths, Number and incidence of deaths, Every 3 months for up to 12 months after completing study treatment|Incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities per CTCAE, Number of clinical laboratory abnormalities per CTCAE, Through study completion, an average of once a week|Phase 1b: Overall survival, Median overall survival, From the date of Phase 0 surgery to the date of death due to any cause
