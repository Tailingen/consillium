Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin Adjuvant Study in Stomach Cancer
Primary:

* To demonstrate that capecitabine/oxaliplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy is superior to observation alone in terms of 3 year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in chemotherapy-naïve patients who underwent potentially curative resection for gastric cancer.

Secondary:

* To compare the overall survival of surgery and capecitabine/ oxaliplatin as adjuvant therapy versus surgery alone. To evaluate the safety profile of capecitabine/oxaliplatin adjuvant therapy.
