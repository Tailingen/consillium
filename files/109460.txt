Patterns of Breast Cancer Management and Prognosis of Breast Cancer in China
This is a multicenter, prospective, e, real-world cohort survey initiated by researchers to focus on the patterns of breast cancer management and prognosis of breast cancer in China, and to establish the multicenter, prospective breast cancer data platform. A total of 18 sites in Guangdong and Henan have cooperated to build a cooperative network unit. The sites will conduct prospective and standardized records concerning the clinical pathological features, treatment and prognosis of the early breast cancer patients who are treated in their own site each year, registering in the REDCap system.This real-world cohort study aims to provide a representative and reliable survey data of epidemiological characteristics, clinical treatment and prognosis of patients with early breast cancer in China and explore the establishment of a national multi-center breast cancer data platform model.
