pTVG-HP and Nivolumab in Patients With Non-Metastatic PSA-Recurrent Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational DNA vaccine, pTVG-HP, a plasmid DNA encoding human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), in combination with nivolumab, and the efficacy of this combination in decreasing serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in patients with non-metastatic, non-castrate prostate cancer (clinical stage D0/M0).
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: pTVG-HP|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: GM-CSF
Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events Grade 3 or Higher, Subjects will be evaluated at each visit by a review of systems based on the most recent version of the NCI common toxicity criteria. Safety and Tolerability of this intervention is defined as following: a toxicity rate p0 of at most 15% of Grade â‰¥ 3 toxicity events (CTCAE v.4.0) will be considered as acceptable while a toxicity rate p1=35% or more will be considered as unacceptably high. See Adverse Events Section for full summary of data., up to 48 weeks|Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Complete Response (CR) Rate, A PSA CR will be defined as the percentage of participants with a serum PSA \<0.2 ng/mL and confirmatory PSA \<0.2 ng/mL at least 4 weeks later, as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) recommendations. To qualify as a PSA CR, there must be no evidence of radiographic progression., up to 48 weeks
Metastasis-free Survival Rate, The 5-year metastasis-free survival will be determined by investigator review of radiographic studies (CT/MRI and bone scintigraphy) performed 5 years after study initiation in subjects who have not already met criteria for radiographic progression., Up to 5 years|Median Radiographic Progression-free Survival, All participants will undergo radiographic imaging prior to treatment and at 6-month intervals (or as clinically required). The appearance of lesions consistent with metastatic disease will be used to define radiographic progression., Up to 5 years|PSA Doubling Time, Post-treatment doubling time will be calculated from: 1) All PSA values obtained from the same clinical laboratory using the same PSA assay beginning with the PSA value at day 1 (week 0) and continuing until the end-of study (or month 24) value (PSADT 0-24). 2) All PSA values obtained from the same clinical laboratory using the same PSA assay beginning with the PSA value at day 85 (month 3) to the day 253 (month 9) value (PSADT 3-9)., Up to 2 years|PSA Response Rate (</= 50% of Baseline), The percentage of participants with PSA values less than or equal to their baseline value after 2 year., Up to 2 years|Number of Participants Receiving GM-CSF as an Adjuvant After Week 4, GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant if the PSA at week 4 is higher than baseline., up to week 4
