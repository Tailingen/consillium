Clinical Investigation on the Treatment of Radiation Induced Dermatitis With FR-101 Chest Dressing
Breast cancer is the top one incidence of cancer in women. Whole breast radiation therapy plays an indispensable role in the course of breast cancer treatment, and the radiation dermatitis is the major side effect affected quality of life. Radiation dermatitis can be divided into acute and chronic. Severe acute radiation dermatitis affects the quality of life of patients during the course of treatment, and may cause treatment interruption and affect the efficacy. Chronic radiation dermatitis may cause irreversible skin problems, and lead to so-called "radiation-irritated skin" (radiation-irritated skin) seriously affects the quality of life of breast cancer patients after treatment.

This study will enroll 30 breast cancer patients who received whole breast radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. Subject will receive FR-101 chest dressing and be instructed to use the product on the target skin area accepted radiation therapy once every 2 days, taking care of avoiding applications from 1 to 4 h before treatment to prevent "Build-up" effect.

Subjects will need to come back to clinics for assessment weekly during radiotherapy, 2 weeks after radiotherapy, and 6 weeks after radiotherapy. The evaluation includes physical examinations, questionnaire surveys, skin observation and measurements, and photographs. The total study time is at least 3 months. The target area of radiation-irritated skin condition will be observed and graded according to CTCAE rate. The skin physiological parameters will be detected by MoistureMeter SC, Vapometer, SkinColorCatch and HX-YL001 infrared thermometer.

Statistical analysis of skin physiological parameters is used to evaluate the efficacy of FR-101 chest dressing on the prevention of acute radiation dermatitis after radiotherapy.

Worst skin toxicity during treatment and until 2 weeks after according to CTCAE grading., Skin toxicity at the radiotherapy site will be assessed by investigator and NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be used for grading, on a scale of:

Grade 1 (faint erythema or dry desquamation);

Grade 2 (moderate to brisk erythema;patchy moist desquamation,mostly confined to skin foldsand creases; moderate edema);

Grade 3 (moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion);

Grade 4 (life-threatening consequences; skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site; skin graft indicated);

Grade 5 (death), 1-Week (Day0), 2-Week (Day7), 3-Week (Day14), 4-Week (Day21), 5-Week (Day28), 6-Week (Day35), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later
To compare the skin moisture percentage., To compare the skin moisture percentage at the radiotherapy site and normal site from baseline to follow-up visit., 1-Week (Day0), 3-Week (Day14), 5-Week (Day28), 6-Week (Day35), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later, Post-radiotherapy 6 Week later|To compare the skin trans-epidermal water loss., To compare the skin trans-epidermal water loss at the radiotherapy site and normal site from baseline to follow-up visit., 1-Week (Day0), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later, Post-radiotherapy 6 Week later|To compare the skin temperature of target region., To compare the skin temperature of target region at the radiotherapy site and normal site from baseline to follow-up visit., 1-Week (Day0), 3-Week (Day14), 5-Week (Day28), 6-Week (Day35), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later, Post-radiotherapy 6 Week later|The score of quality of life with the Skindex-16 questionnaire., The score of quality of life will be assessed using the Skindex-16 questionnaire every two weeks. Participants answer 16 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (always). The quality of life is calculated by summing the scores for all questions, resulting in a maximum of 96 and a minimum of 0; higher scores indicate a more impaired quality of life., 1-Week (Day0), 3-Week (Day14), 5-Week (Day28), 6-Week (Day35), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later, Post-radiotherapy 6 Week later|Median time to G2 radiation dermatitis development, Median time to G2 radiation dermatitis development according to CTCAE., 1-Week (Day0), 2-Week (Day7), 3-Week (Day14), 4-Week (Day21), 5-Week (Day28), 6-Week (Day35), Post-radiotherapy 2 Week later, Post-radiotherapy 6 Week later
