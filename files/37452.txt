TachoComb S Versus Standard Surgical Treatment in Surgical Resection of Renal Tumour (TC-015-IN)
The overall objective is to compare efficacy and safety of TachoComb S and standard surgical treatment for the control of local bleeding in patients undergoing surgical resection of renal tumours. Specific objectives include the comparison between test treatments of intra-operative haemostatic efficacy as well as post-operative blood loss, haematoma formation, and surgeon's rating of usefulness of test treatment.
Surgical Resection of Superficial Renal Tumour
PROCEDURE: Fibrinogen (human) + thrombin (human) (TachoSil)
Primary efficacy endpoint is overall time to intraoperative haemostasis from start of test treatment until haemostasis is obtained following 1 or 2 rounds of randomised treatment,and other haemostatic treatment, if necessary.
Secondary efficacy endpoints are: 1) proportion of patients with haemostasis 10 minutes after start of test treatment; 2) haematoma formation on day 2 after surgery (sonography).|Adverse events will be recorded from screening until follow-up.
