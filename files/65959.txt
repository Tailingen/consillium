Dasatinib With Fludarabine and Rituximab in Relapsed and Refractory CLL and SLL
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) are similar diseases of the white blood cells and are typically treated the same way. Recent research shows that a key enzyme in CLL cells is responsible for cell survival. This enzyme is called LYN kinase. Laboratory studies show that inhibition of LYN kinase in CLL cells results in the death of CLL cells. Dasatinib has the ability to inhibit LYN kinase and, therefore, should have some effect on CLL cells. The purpose of this study is to see of the study drug dasatinib, in combination with fludarabine and rituximab, is safe and effective to use for people with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: dasatinib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: fludarabine
Response Rate, To describe the response rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) to treatment with this drug combination (SD=stable disease, PD=progressive disease), 2 years
Progression-Free and Overall Survival, To describe the progression-free and overall surivial, 2 years|Toxicities, Dasatinib may enhance the myelosuppression expected from fludarabine. This toxicity will be monitored with frequent CBC's. If after Day 21 of a cycle there is a grade 4 cytopenia, a dose reduction will occur in the next cycle of treatment, and that cycle cannot start until the ANC \> 1,000 and the platelets \> 25,000. There is also a risk for pleural effusions with dasatinib, but the risk will be low, since there is a break from dasatinib dosing on days 15-28 of each cycle. Nevertheless, if a grade 2 pleural effusion occurs, there will be a dose reduction in the next cycle of treatment., 2 years
* Since the purpose of the study is to determine the response rate of the 3 drug regimen, everyone who participates will receive the same dose of the study drug, dasatinib and the 2 standard drugs, fludarabine and rituximab.
* Participants will receive the drugs dasatinib, fludarabine, and rituximab at the following time points through each cycle of treatment. A cycle of study treatment is 28 days. Dasatinib pills will be taken orally each day for the first 2 weeks of each cycle. Fludarabine will be give intravenously on three days of each cycle (Days 3-5 in the first cycle, days 1-3 after that). Rituximab will be given intravenously with a total dose of 375 mg/m2 each cycle (split on Days 3+4 in the first cycle and at the discretion of the treating physician after that on Days 1-3).
* The following procedures will be repeated throughout the study: medical history review; physical exam; performance status test; blood tests and EKG. They will occur daily during the first week of treatment, then weekly for the rest of cycle 1. After cycle 1 these procedures will be done once a week for 4 weeks then once a month for 6 months.
* Tumor assessments will be repeated once every 2 months for the first six months of the study, and then once every 6 months after that.
* Blood samples will be obtained in the first 5 days of treatment for pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacodynamic studies.
* Participants that are benefiting from the study treatment after the first cycle can continue to receive an additional 6 cycles of study treatment.
