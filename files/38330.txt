IM83 Clinical Study of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study, a single-center, open, single-dose clinical study, was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of IM83 CAR-T cells in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma
Refractory Osteosarcoma|Recurrent Osteosarcoma

This study is planned to enroll 9-18 patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma in a modified "3+3" design for dose escalation, with three dose groups of 5×10\^8 cells, 1×10\^9 cells, and 2×10\^9 cells.3-6 subjects are planned to be enrolled in each dose group to assess their safety. Each dose group is planned to enroll 3-6 subjects to assess safety, and if the incidence of horizontal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is ≤1/6 within 28 days after transfusion in a dose group, the transfusion of cells from the next dose group can be initiated.

This study will be divided into a screening period, a cell collection period, a chemotherapy pretreatment period, a return infusion and a follow-up period, and within 28 days of return infusion the investigator will assess whether a DLT (Dose limited toxicity) event has occurred to confirm the safety of this dose group.
