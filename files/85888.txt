Understanding Engagement Trends in Chondrosarcoma Clinical Trials
Taking part in medical research usually favors a particular demographic group. But there is limited research available to explain what trial attributes affect the completion of these specific demographic groups.

This study will admit a wide range of data on the clinical trial experience of chondrosarcoma patients to determine which factors prevail in limiting a patient's ability to join or finish a trial.

It will also try to analyze data from the perspective of different demographic groups to check for recurring trends which might yield insights for the sake of future chondrosarcoma patients.
