Master Protocol to Study Treatment Patterns, Medication Adherence, Health and Economic Outcomes and Unmet Needs in RCC
The study aims to assess treatment patterns and outcomes in advanced RCC patients in real world clinical practices across various real world databases. Four databases will be evaluated

Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Continuation, Treatment continuation was considered when there was no more than (\>) 30-day gap (i.e., persistent treatment) for the index medication during follow-up period. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Interruption, Treatment Interruption was considered in participants with gaps in treatment greater than allowable gap but who restart the same medication with no indication of switching or augmentation. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Time to Treatment Interruption, Time from index medication to treatment discontinuation for those within treatment interruptions (\>30 day gaps). Represents the time between index and end of last treatment, including any treatment gaps. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Switch or Augmentation, Number of participants who had treatment switch or augmentation were reported in this outcome measure. Augmentation was defined as addition of treatment to initial therapy prescribed, i.e, initiation of a new therapy different from the initial therapy while continuation of the initial therapy. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants According to Lines of Therapy, Number of participants as per the lines of treatment were reported in this outcome measure. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants According to Sequence of Therapies for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC), Number of participants according to the sequence of therapies received for mRCC were reported in this outcome measure. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Number of Participants According to Their Status at End of Follow-up, Number of participants according to their status (death, end of enrollment and end of data availability) at end of follow-up were observed and included in this outcome measure. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., At end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months) (data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months)|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF was defined as the time from first-line therapy start to treatment discontinuation for any reason, including switched, augmented therapy, end of enrollment or death. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Discontinuation, Percentage of participants with treatment discontinuation was defined as the percentage of participants with gap in therapy greater than 30 days and who did not begin a new treatment. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months|Percentage of Participants Alive at 3 Months, Percentage of participants who were alive at 3 months is reported in this outcome measure., At 3 months (data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months)|Percentage of Participants Alive at 6 Months, Percentage of participants who were alive at 6 months is reported in this outcome measure., At 3 months (data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months)|Percentage of Participants Alive at 12 Months, Percentage of participants who were alive at 12 months is reported in this outcome measure., At 3 months (data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months)|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the length of time from index date to participant's death. Index date was defined as the date of initiation of the aRCC treatment., From the index date until end of enrollment, follow-up or death (maximum of 52 months); data collected and observed retrospectively over 35 months
