FLOR3 Gene Polymorphism in Predicting Outcomes of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor（TKI）Stopping in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
For patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) who have achieved a stable deep molecular response (DMR) using BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), treatment-free remission (TFR) following TKI cessation is an emerging goal. However, about half of the patients relapsed after TKI discontinuation. There is no definite examinations to predict the outcome of TKI discontinuation. Investigators aim to study the relationship between FLOR3 SNP rs139130389 and the outcome of TKI discontinuation.
Folate|CML|Treatment-free Remission
treatment-free remission or relapse, Observe whether the patients were in remission or relapse 1 year after drug withdrawal, 1 year
Investigators aim to detect FOLR3 SNP rs139130389, and establish its correlation with patients' treatment response, remission time, TKI resistance and the outcome of TKI stopping.
