AQCS for Detection of Early Cancer and Precancerous Lesions on Upper Gastrointestinal Tract
The purpose of our study was to assess the performance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy automatic quality-control system in real-time quality control of EGD.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
DEVICE: Computer-aided Real-time Automatic Quality-control System
Detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract confirmed by pathological examination, The primary outcome is the detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract confirmed by pathological examination per group., 6 months
Detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract in tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals., Effect of detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract from tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals with assistance of AQCS., 6 months|Mean inspection completeness of two groups., Inspection completeness includes taking standard images of each parts of esophageal and gastric cavity., 6 months|Mean inspection time of EGD procedure of two groups., Inspection time of EGD procedure is the time endoscopy inserting to withdrawing the mouth and does not include the time of biopsy., During procedure|Detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract from senior, intermediate and primary endoscopist with assistance of AQCS., Effect of detection rate of early cancer and precancerous lesions on upper gastrointestinal tract from senior, intermediate and primary endoscopist with assistance of AQCS., 6 months
Investigators developed a real-time quality control system of esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD) named EGD automatic quality-control system (AQCS). Investigators carried a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the performance of this system in quality control of real-time EGD, including detecting the early upper gastrointestinal cancer and precancerous lesions, assessing inspection completeness, mucosal visibility, time of EGD procedure and other indicators.
