Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This pilot phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

DRUG: Erlotinib Hydrochloride|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Participants With a Response, Overall Response is complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) + Partial remission (PR) + Hematologic improvement (HI) + Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLF). (CR) is Bone marrow; \</=5% blasts, no Auer rods or extramedullary disease and peripheral blood counts \>/= 1.0x10\^9/L Neutrophils, \>/= 100x10\^9/L platelets and no circulating blasts. (CRi), same as CR for bone marrow and \<1.0x10\^9/L neutrophils and \< 100x10\^9/L platelets in peripheral blood counts. PR is all CR criteria if abnormal prior to treatment except \>/= 50%reduction in bone marrow blast but still \> 5%. MLF is \</=5% myeloblasts on bone marrow . HI response must be described by the number of positively affected cell lines.., Up to 3 months post-treatment|Incidence of Clinically Significant, Non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 Toxicities at Least Possibly Related to Erlotinib Hydrochloride, Safety summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables and listings. The number of participants affected by treatment-emergent adverse events will be reported., Up to 30 days|Overall Survival, Time from date of treatment start until date of death due to any cause or last Follow-up., Up to 97 weeks|Event-free Survival, Time from date of treatment start until the date of first objective documentation of disease-relapse., Up to 21 weeks
Biomarker Expressions, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the expression of biomarkers and the concentrations of plasma erlotinib hydrochloride. The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the expressions of biomarkers and concentrations of plasma erlotinib hydrochloride between patients with and without response., Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the efficacy of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

II. To determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib in this patient population.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate inhibitory effect of this drug on spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and its down-stream targets such as mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk).

II. To evaluate its role in janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and to investigate erlotinib-mediated cell death and/or differentiation.

III. To quantitate concentrations of plasma erlotinib.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
