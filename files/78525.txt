Timing of Surgery and the Evolution of Postoperative Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgical Intervention Following Recovery From SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increases the risk of postoperative complications and mortality, while also exerting long-lasting impacts on multiple organs and systems. Due to the curtailment or cessation of non-emergency surgeries during the initial phase of the pandemic, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal timing and medium- to long-term postoperative outcomes of surgical intervention in breast cancer patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly after vaccination. We aim to investigate whether prior SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of postoperative adverse outcomes in breast cancer patients and determine the optimal timing for surgical intervention during the pandemic, as well as to longitudinally assess the evolution of postoperative adverse outcomes within one year after COVID-19 and identify associated risk factors.

This study employs a prospective cohort design with longitudinal and matched characteristics, focusing on breast cancer patients who underwent surgery after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were stratified by the time of surgery relative to COVID-19 diagnosis. The Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) method was used to match a control group (COVID-19 negative) based on patient, tumor, and surgical factors in order to compare composite indicators (including death, pneumonia, thrombosis, cardiac complications, and unplanned hospitalization) for evaluating the optimal timing of surgery. We investigated the longitudinal evolution of postoperative adverse outcomes and identified the relevant risk factors through logistic regression analysis.
