HLA-A2-Restricted Glioma Antigen-Peptides Vaccinations With Poly-ICLC for Recurrent WHO Grade II Gliomas
This is a pilot vaccine study in adults with recurrent WHO Grade II gliomas. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an experimental tumor vaccine made from peptides in combination with the study drug Poly-ICLC.

Poly-ICLC, manufactured by Oncovir, Inc., has already been received and is generally well tolerated by subjects in earlier studies and has been shown to decrease the size of brain tumors in some cases.

The immunological and safety data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted.
Astrocytoma|Oligoastrocytoma|Oligodendroglioma
BIOLOGICAL: Peptide vaccine + Poly-ICLC
Both immunological and safety data will serve as bases to decide whether a larger follow-up study is warranted., 4 years
Clinical response: 6 month and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) will be evaluated based on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans., 4 years|Tumor tissues for biological correlates: for patients who develop progression, biopsy/resection will be encouraged and analyzed for GAA expression status and infiltration of GAA-specific T-cells, 4
This is a pilot study of a vaccination regime that is designed to efficiently induce anti-tumor T-cell responses in patients with recurrent WHO grade II glioma. The proposed regime combines subcutaneous injections of glioma-associated antigen (GAA)-derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope-peptides with simultaneous intramuscular (i.m.) administration of poly-ICLC.

The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data that will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted in these patients. All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the actual 2-year overall survival (OS), 6-month and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates can be determined in an exploratory manner.
