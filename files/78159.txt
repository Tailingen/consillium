A Phase 2 Study of MM-141 Plus Nab-paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Front-line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of MM-141 plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine is more effective than nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine alone based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with high serum levels of free IGF-1.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: MM-141|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival, Approximately 2 years
Overall Survival, Approximately 2.5 years|Objective Response Rate according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Duration of Response according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Rate of adverse events reported with the combination of MM-141 with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus the comparator arm, Approximately 2 years
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of MM-141 plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer. All patients will be initially screened for free IGF-1 status. Eligible patients with high free IGF-1 will be randomized to receive MM-141 plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and patients. Patients with low free IGF-1 or patients who have high free IGF-1 but are not otherwise eligible will be followed in an observational group.
