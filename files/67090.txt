A Study to Evaluate Lenvatinib Plus Tislelizumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Biomarker Analyses
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib Plus Tislelizumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Biomarker Analyses.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Lenvatinib at a dose of 8 mg or 12 mg based on body weight + tislelizumab for one 21-day cycle
Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of participants who got a complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., 12 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events were evaluated in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0, from first dose to within 30 days after the last dose|Duration of response (DOR), time from CR or PR (RECIST v1.1) achievement with investigational therapy, until documented progression, relapse, or death due to disease progression, time from CR or PR (RECIST v1.1) achievement with investigational therapy, until documented progression, relapse, or death due to disease progression|Disease Control Rate (DCR), the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR, and SD., 12 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the period from treatment initiation until the date of disease progression, death, or study cutoff, whichever occurred first., From date of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall survival(OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. For subjects who were alive or lost to follow-up by the data analysis cut-off date, survival was censored at the subject's last known survival time., From date of treatment until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib Plus Tislelizumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Biomarker Analyses.
