MONET1-MOtesanib NSCLC Efficacy and Tolerability Study
To determine if treatment with AMG 706 (motesanib diphosphate) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin improves overall survival compared to treatment with placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in subjects with advanced non-squamous NSCLC and in subjects with adenocarcinoma histology (adenocarcinoma subpopulation).
