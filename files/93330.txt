A Study of Attention and Memory Processes in Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to observe the attention and memory processes in breast cancer survivors. Both cancer survivors and healthy volunteers (who are the same age as the cancer survivors) will participate in this study so we can compare the results of testing on each group of participants.

test early attentional deficits, Using EEG measures of brain activity during a cognitive-experimental long-term memory task to evaluate the mechanisms underlying attention, initial learning, retrieval, and metamemory performance. P3 amplitude as measured by EEG at the Pz electrode., baseline|abnormal event-related potential (ERP) during initial learning, During passive tasks (such as a paired-click paradigm)The proposed paradigm is adapted from previous work using EEG to measure the relationship between attention, learning, and subsequent performance on a verbal long-term memory task in healthy adults41. Relative to standard neuropsychological measures, this technique provides a more finely grained approach to investigating the effect of attentional mechanisms on subcomponents of initial learning and retrieval processes in long-term memory., baseline
