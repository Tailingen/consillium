Clinical and Histopathologic Characteristics of BAP1 Mutations
The goal of this protocol is to determine the prevalence of somatic and germline mutations in BAP1 (BRCA associated protein-1) among patients with mesothelioma , choroidal nevus, primary uveal melanoma (UM), or metastatic UM seen at our institution.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM)|Choroidal Nevus|Primary Uveal Melanoma (UM)|Metastatic Uveal Melanoma (UM)|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma
OTHER: tumor specimens
determine the prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations, Prevalence will be estimated as the proportion of all specimens who tested positive for mutation, and reported along with the corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals., 2 years
prevalence of somatic BAP1 mutations in disease mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma., The frequency of somatic mutations will be tabulated by factors of interest such as:

* personal and familial risk factors: age, smoking, and asbestos mesothelioma, personal and family history of cancer or of related diseases (mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma)
* disease characteristics: histology, stage, location, site of metastasis (if present) (for mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma); COMS criteria, GEP class, number of clinical risk factors (for metastatic uveal melanoma), 2 years
