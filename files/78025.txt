A Study to Investigate the Effect of Single Dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) on Cardiac Repolarization in Healthy Volunteers
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-way crossover phase I study being conducted on healthy volunteers to investigate the effect of single dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) on cardiac repolarization under well-controlled conditions in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines. An open-label Moxifloxacin (400 mg), a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibiotic will be used as a appositive control for the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave (QT) prolongation in accordance with ICH E14 guidelines, to establish assay sensitivity. The core study consists of screening period, 3 treatment period (AZD6094, placebo and moxifloxacin; with a minimum washout period of 14 days between each treatment period) and follow-up. The study drugs will be administered orally. The study is planned to determine effect of AZD6094 at therapeutic dose, safety and tolerability. This study provides adequate and well-controlled mechanisms to deal with potential bias, facilitate identification of effects related to investigational product (IMP) administration and tolerability issues.

Visit 5: Follow-up - Participants will have clinical visit 14 days after discharge from the treatment period 3.

Participants will be randomized to 6 treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA). In each sequence, participants will receive single oral dose of all 3 treatments (A - AZD6094 600 mg (3X 200 mg tablet), B - Placebo tablet, C - Moxifloxacin 400 mg capsule) with a washout period (14 days) between each treatment period.
