Pacritinib for Biochemical Relapse After Definitive Treatment for Prostate Cancer
This is a single-arm, open-label study using pacritinib for patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma, status post definitive treatment and biochemical recurrence.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Pacritinib
The Number of Patients With Six-month PSA Progression-free Survival., PSA progression-free survival is defined as the length of time that a subject will be alive and free from PSA progression per PCWG3 guidelines., Six months
PSA Levels, PSA level in blood is measured in units of nanograms per milliliter., Screening, every month for six months, then every two months until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months.|Testosterone Measurement, Serum testosterone will be measured in nanograms per deciliter., Baseline and four months
This phase 2, single-arm, open-label study using pacritinib will treat patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma, status post definitive treatment and biochemical recurrence.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of pacritinib on the time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer (defined as the length of time that a given subject will be alive and free from PSA progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines.
