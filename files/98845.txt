Detection and Metabolic Characterization in DOPA PET/CT of Brain Metastases
About 20 to 30% of patients treated for cancer will have brain metastases. These brain metastases are found more frequently in patients with lung cancer, breast cancer or melanoma. The prognosis of these patients is unfavorable but prolonged survival can be obtained with the local and systemic treatments currently available.

Brain MRI is the gold standard for evaluating brain metastases but has limitations in therapeutic evaluation, partially offset by PET imaging of amino acid metabolism.

Our work aims to compare the performance of PET-DOPA with standard MRI for the detection of brain metastases (≥ 5mm) in lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma; and to characterize these lesions using dynamic acquisitions obtained with a digital PET camera with high spatial resolution. Having better knowledge of the metabolic characteristics of newly discovered brain metastases, the objective of subsequent studies will be to better assess the per- or post-therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and the various systemic therapies available (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy).
Brain Metastases|MRI
RADIATION: F-DOPA PET/CT
Assess the sensitivity of 18F DOPA PET-CT for the detection of no treated brain metastases (breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma), newly diagnosed by MRI and measuring at least 5 mm in diameter., The sensitivity of PET-DOPA to detect brain metastases greater than 5 mm is determined by the number of metastases detected with PET-DOPA compared to the number of metastases greater than 5 mm detected by MRI, Within 8 months of PET-CT
Assess the sensitivity of 18F DOPA PET-CT according to the site of the primary tumor (lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma) and its characteristics, The sensitivity per site will be calculated for 8 primary tumor categories: 3 for lung cancer (EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement; PDL1 +; others), 2 for melanoma (BRAF V600 mutation; others), 3 for breast cancer (triple negative; Her2 + RH-; others), Within 8 months of PET-CT
