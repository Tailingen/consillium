The Rapid Study: Randomized Phase II Study To Expedite Allogeneic Transplant With Immediate Haploidentical Plus Unrelated Cord Donor Search Versus Matched Unrelated Donor Search For AML And High-Risk MDS Patients
The study seeks to compare time from formal search to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients 18 years and older, randomized between haplo-cord search and matched unrelated donor (MUD) search for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
BIOLOGICAL: Haplo-Cord Transplant|PROCEDURE: Matched Unrelated Donor Transplant
Time to Transplant, Time to transplant will be measured from time of date of formal request to stem cell infusion date. Will also capture time from preliminary search to both formal search and transplant date., Through one year after formal search
Percentage of Patients Who Undergo Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), Compare percentage of patients who undergo HCT in each study cohort, Through one year after formal search|Estimated Survival Time, Overall survival time was estimated from date of randomization and from date of transplant using Kaplan-Meier method., From date of randomization up to 3 years
Primary Objectives

To compare time from formal search to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients 18 years and older, randomized between haplo-cord search and matched unrelated donor (MUD) search for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

Secondary Objectives

* To compare the percentage of patients who undergo HCT in each study cohort
* To evaluate overall survival from time to randomization by study cohort
