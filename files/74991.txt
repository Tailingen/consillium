Biomarker-based Study in R/M SCCHN
This is a biomarker-driven trial that will enroll patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Based on potential biomarkers and molecular alterations identified in the biopsy from the central platform, patients will be allocated in different cohorts. There will be biomarker-positive patient cohorts and immunotherapy cohorts.
