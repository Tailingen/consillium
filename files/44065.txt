Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Liver Metastasis From a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of imatinib mesylate and to see how well it works in treating patients with liver metastasis from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: imatinib mesylate
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time from date of starting protocol treatment until date of comfirmation of progressive disease (PD) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 7.5 years
Tumor response, Tumor response is defined as best overall response by RECIST v1.0 from date of starting protocol treatment until 48 weeks after starting protocol treatment., 48 weeks|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as time from date of starting protocol treatment until date of death from any cause., 7.5 years|Types and severities of adverse events, Types and severities of adverse events from date of starting protocol treatment until 30 days after date of finishing the treatment are evaluated according to Japanese version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) by Translational Research Informatics Center., 7.5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib mesylate in patients with resectable hepatic metastasis secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
