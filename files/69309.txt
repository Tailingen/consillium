First Line Atezolizumab, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab (Avastin®) in mTNBC
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first line atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC)
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Advanced Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab
PFS (Progression-free Survival), From a clinical point of view, the primary endpoint for this study is the PFS (progression-free survival) defined as the period of time from treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined locally by the investigator using RECIST v.1.1., 24 months
Efficacy (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the treatment initiation to time of the first objective tumor response (tumor shrinkage of ≥30%) observed for patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 24 months|Efficacy (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of CR and PR relative to the number of patients in the analysis set with measurable disease at baseline., 24 months|Efficacy (CBR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of participants with CR, PR or SD ≥24 weeks relative to the number of patients in the analysis set., 24 months|Efficacy (DoR), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of disease progression, death due to any cause or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first., 24 months|Efficacy (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of treatment initiation to date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored to last date the participant was known to be alive., 24 months|Efficacy (Best percentage of change of target tumor lesions), Best percentage of change from baseline in the size of target tumor lesions is defined as the biggest decrease, or smallest increase if no decrease will be observed., 24 months|Safety AEs and SAEs, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.5.0, including dose reductions, delays, and treatment discontinuations., 24 months|Exploratory objectives (irPFS), Immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) is defined as the period of time from the date of treatment initiation to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (irPD) or death due to any cause in absence of documented irPD., 24 months|Exploratory objectives (irORR), Immune-related objective response (irORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with irCR or irPR relative to the number of patients in the analysis set with measurable disease at baseline., 24 months|Exploratory objectives (molecular markers), Changes in mutation and copy number in oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and/or other genes associated with disease progression assessed in liquid biopsy., 24 months
Men and women age ≥ 18 years with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is not amenable to resection with curative intent regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.

The number of patients to be included is 100 patients. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy -in terms of progression-free survival (PFS)- of first line atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC.

After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will begin treatment on 28 days cycles: Atezolizumab (840 mg) intravenously on days 1 and 15; Paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) via IV infusion on days 1, 8 and 15; Bevacizumab (Avastin® 10mg/kg) intravenously on days 1 and 15.

Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.

Patients discontinuing the study treatment will enter a post- treatment follow-up period until death, withdrawal of consent, patient is lost to follow-up, or study termination.
