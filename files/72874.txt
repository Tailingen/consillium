Study of OSI-774 (Tarceva) in Previously Untreated Elderly Lung Cancer Patients
The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug OSI-774 is less toxic and potentially as good as or better than standard chemotherapy drugs, when given to subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, who are 70 years of age or older.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: OSI-774 (Tarceva)
To determine how well non-small cell lung cancer cells in the body respond to OSI-774, 2 years|To determine the survival rate of patients treated with OSI-774
To determine the safety of OSI-774 in people 70 years of age or older, 2 years|To see how OSI-774 affects overall quality of life, 2 years
Patients will receive OSI-774 once daily without interruption. There are no pre-determined number of cycles or planned dose interruptions. For the purposes of evaluation, toxicity and efficacy, a four week (28 day period) will be considered 1 cycle.

Patients will continue to receive OSI-774 until they develop progressive disease, unacceptable side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study.

Patients will have radiographic evaluations after every two cycles of therapy. After cycle 2, patients will also be evaluated by FDG-PET scanning.

Patients will also be asked to fill out a Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) on the first day of each cycle.

Bloodwork will also be performed on day 1 of each cycle as well as at the end of the study.
