This trial will provide an opportunity to further evaluate the safety profile and efficacy of durvalumab + EP in patient population that is reflective of real-world clinical practice, Durvalumab will be concurrently administered with first-line chemotherapy (EP) on an every 3 week (q3w) schedule for 4 to 6 cycles, and will continue to be administered as monotherapy post-chemotherapy on an every 4 week (q4w) schedule until confirmed progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is allowed in patients showing complete or partial responses after the durvalumab + EP combination cycles, at the discretion of the investigator according to their local clinical practice.
