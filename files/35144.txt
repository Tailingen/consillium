The Ability of Adipose Flap Over the NVB to Improve Sexual and Urinary Function Following Radical Prostatectomy
Despite technological advances, incontinence and impotence remain significant side effects of radical prostatectomy (RP). Strategies have been developed to reduce the injury to the erection nerves (i.e. neurovascular bundle - NVB)during surgery to further improve functional outcomes after RP. Adipose tissue is known for its stabilizing and even healing potential. These features include reducing the inflammatory process and improving blood supply to an injured nerve. We hypothesized that covering the NVB with periprostatic fat during surgery may potentially improve neural recovery and enhance functional recovery after RP. We sought to examine our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial.

PROCEDURE: Technical modification during radical prostatectomy
Erectile function, IIEF erectile function score, Change from Baseline IIEF score at 12 months
Continence status, King's Health Questionnaire score, Change from Baseline King's score at 12 months
