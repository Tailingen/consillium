Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. According to Hans' algorithms, DLBCL can be identified as 2 subtypes: germinal b-cell-like(GCB) and non-germinal b-cell-like(non-GCB). Approximately 50 to 60% of DLBCL was non-GCB subtype DLBCL.The non-GCB DLBCL revealed poor clinical outcomes. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors have established therapeutic activity in B cell malignancies, with potential activity in non-GCB DLBCL. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in combination with R-CHOP for newly diagnosed untreated Non-GCB DLBCL Patients.
