Regorafenib in Combination With Multimodal Metronomic Chemotherapy for Chemo-resistant Metastatic Colorectal Cancers
The main objective is to evaluate the impact of a Regorafenib combined with metronomic chemotherapy (capecitabine and cyclophosphamide) and low-dose aspirin compared to standard Regorafenib treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer by assessing progression-free survival.

To evaluate the impact of a Regorafenib combined with metronomic chemotherapy and low-dose aspirin compared to standard Regorafenib treatment by assessing progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS): defined as the time from the randomization to objective disease progression as per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The time of the progression or recurrence event is determined using the first date when there is documented evidence that the criteria have been met, even in situations where progression is observed after one or more missed visits, treatment discontinuation, or new anti-cancer treatment.

Patients with no defined events observed during the follow up period will be censored at the date of last news, 5 months average
