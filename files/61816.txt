A Proof-of-concept Study to Assess the Ability of [18F]AH-111585 PET Imaging to Detect Tumours and Angiogenesis
This proof-of-concept study is designed to assess the ability of \[18F\]AH-111585 PET imaging to detect tumors and angiogenesis. Up to 30 evaluable subjects are planned to be included at up to 2 study centers in the US. Subjects are considered evaluable if they undergo administration of AH-111585 (18F) Injection, dynamic and static PET imaging, and tumor tissue acquisition. The targeted population is adult subjects at initial diagnosis or recurrence with tumors ≥2.5 cm in diameter who are scheduled to undergo resection or biopsy of the tumor as a result of routine clinical treatment. The tumors must belong to one of the following 5 types:

* High-grade glioma, including glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma
* Lung cancer, including small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer
* Head and neck (H\&N) tumors, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, well-differentiated thyroid and oral cavity carcinoma
* Sarcoma
* Melanoma

Safety will be assessed from the rates of adverse events, changes in vital signs, changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, changes in physical examination findings, and changes in clinical laboratory findings.

Efficacy will be assessed as the correlations between parameters derived from the PET images and the reference standards. The reference standards will be immunohistology for αvβ3 integrins and other biomarkers specific for oncology and angiogenesis and from the standard of care imaging.

Measures obtained from optional DCE-CT imaging may also be used to compare the uptake and retention of \[18F\]AH-111585 in tumors obtained from the dynamic PET to assess functional status of the vascular system of the tumor.
