Evaluation of Difficulty Score for Robotic Pancreatoduodenectomy
Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy is the most complex surgery for a general surgeon and consequently a pancreatic surgeon can aspire to. Due to the close proximity of the pancreas to the large vessels, great skill and experience in the field of pancreatic surgery, robotic surgery and also vascular surgery is essential. The ability to predict the depth of robotic pancreatoduodenectomy in each individual patient would be extremely important, for patient selection and for the implementation of the learning curve. This study aims to provide a difficulty score (DS) for robotic pancreatoduodenectomy to be used to select cases based on the experience and expertise of the surgeon.

correlation to post-operative complication, the score increase as complications increase, 6 months
Our Robot DIFFICULT Score was developed starting from factors evaluated by surgeons with experience in performing robotic pancreatoduodenectomy in high-volume centers. Based on the univariate and multivariate analysis, the elevated BMI, ASA 3, the need for venous resection and vascular variations in arterial liver supply were considered significant in increasing the degree of "difficulty" in the robotic pancreatoduodenectomy. The Robot ADDICT Score will be calculated in all cases of the International Consortium on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery (I-MIPS; www.i-mips.com).
