Evaluation of Central Compartment Dissection Without Thyroidectomy
In accordance with the current guidelines,papillary thyroid microcarcinoma such as turmo invasive nerve or trachea, requires total thyroidectomy for follow-up iodine-131 treatment.In the course of clinical work, if the patient can achieve R0 resection, most of the patients do not need iodine-131 treatment,Therefore, there is no need to continue total thyroidectomy.To evaluate the practicable, thoroughness and Clinical value of bilateral central compartment dissection while preserve contrary thyroid glands.

In accordance with the current guidelines,papillary thyroid microcarcinoma such as turmo invasive nerve or trachea, requires total thyroidectomy for follow-up iodine-131 treatment.In the course of clinical work, if the patient can achieve R0 resection, most of the patients do not need iodine-131 treatment,Therefore, there is no need to continue total thyroidectomy.This study assesses new procedures by adjusting the sequence of procedures. complications and the thoroughness of the operation were evaluated, thus Clinical value of bilateral central compartment dissection with preserve contrary thyroid glands were ananlyed.
