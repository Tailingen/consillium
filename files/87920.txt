Phase II Study of the Combination of Blinatumomab and Asciminib in Patients With Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
To learn if the combination of blinatumomab and asciminib can help to control Ph+ ALL.
Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab|DRUG: Asciminib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives

* Phase I: To determine the minimum safe and biologically effective dose of asciminib in combination with asciminib
* Phase II: To evaluate the rate of NGS measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity using the clonoSEQÂ® assay in cohort 1 (newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL) and the overall response (CR+CRi) rate in cohort 2 (relapsed/refractory disease).

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate other clinical efficacy endpoints (complete molecular response \[CMR\] rate, CR rate, relapse-free survival and overall survival)
* To determine the safety of the combination regimen

Exploratory Objectives

* To characterize the role of ABL1 kinase domain mutations on treatment failure and relapse
* To assess concordance/discordance between MRD assessed by PCR for BCR::ABL1 and next-generation sequencing MRD
* To determine the effect of the combination regimen on immune cell subsets
