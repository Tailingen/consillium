Study of Faslodex With or Without Concomitant Arimidex Versus Exemestane Following Progression on Non-steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors (NSAI)
A partially-blind, randomised, multicentre phase III trial of Faslodex plus concomitant Arimidex versus Faslodex plus Arimidex-Placebo versus exemestane in postmenopausal locally advanced / metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed on NSAIs. Randomisation to Faslodex ± Arimidex / Arimidex-Placebo or exemestane will be open (1:1:1). For Faslodex treated patients the randomisation to Arimidex or Arimidex-Placebo will be double-blind.
