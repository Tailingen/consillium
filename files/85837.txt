A Retrospective Data Analysis of Therapy With PRRT Combined With Lanreotide Autogel® for Neuroendocrine Tumours
The objective of the PRELUDE study is to describe the use of lanreotide Autogel® (LAN ATG) combined with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in the treatment of progressive neuroendocrine tumours located in the lung or in the digestive system as there is currently limited data on these treatments used together for these types of neuroendocrine tumours.
Neuroendocrine Tumours
Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate according to the central reading using RECIST (Version 1.1), Approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle
PFS rate as per RECIST (Version 1.1), Up to 12 months post-treatment|Best Overall Response as per RECIST (Version 1.1), Baseline, until disease progression or end of treatment period (generally 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle) whichever is earlier|Objective Response Rate as per RECIST (Version 1.1), Approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle and up to 12 months post-treatment|Change from baseline (i.e. from Day 1 of the first PRRT/LAN ATG cycle prior to any administration) in the presence and in the severity of diarrhoea and flushing, if any, Baseline, approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle and up to 12 months post-treatment|Change from baseline (i.e. from Day 1 of the first PRRT/LAN ATG cycle prior to any administration) in the tumour biomarker CgA, Baseline, approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle|Change from baseline (ie from Day 1 of the first PRRT/LAN ATG cycle prior to any administration) in body weight, Baseline, approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle and up to 12 months post-treatment|Incidence of nephrotoxicity, haematotoxicity and hepatotoxicity events (based on a predefined list of disorders), Baseline, approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle and up to 12 months post-treatment|Incidence of vomiting (during infusion only), Approximately 3 to 6 months after the last PRRT/LAN ATG cycle
