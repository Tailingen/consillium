The objectives of this project are to prospectively assess quality of life (QOL) and psychosocial adaptation in patients undergoing treatment for carcinoma of the oral cavity, including squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (SCCOC) and to validate new instruments (shame \& stigma, demoralization) that will guide quality of life assessment of patients with cancer of the oral cavity. We will utilize modifications of previously described and validated questionnaires that will be administered to eligible patients before the start of their therapy and at several predefined time points during the post-therapy period. This prospective longitudinal assessment will allow us to study the impact of patient demographic, tumor, treatment and lifestyle related variables on the quality of life of patients treated for oral cavity cancer.
