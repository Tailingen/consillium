Identifying biomarkers predictive of immune-related toxicity associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy., Difference in baseline inflammatory/autoimmune marker(s) in patients developing immune-related adverse events on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy according to CTCAE v 4.0 versus those who do not, 30 Months
Change in inflammatory/autoimmune markers., To evaluate the change in inflammatory/autoimmune markers prior to and at 3 time points on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, with comparison to patients treated with standard chemotherapy, 6 Months|Change in inflammatory/autoimmune markers, To evaluate the impact of change in these markers on patient reported adverse events using the PRO-CTCAE, 6 months
This is a single-center, correlative pilot study evaluating potential biomarkers predictive of immune-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The study includes a control population of patients receiving standard chemotherapy as a comparator. Patients will undergo blood draws at 4 time-points while on standard of care treatment. There are no study-related medications or interventions beyond blood sampling.
