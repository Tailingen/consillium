Nutritional Course of Care After Surgical Treatment at the Patients Affected by a Cancer of the Head and by the Neck
Whatever are the strategies of coverage, the consideration of the state of bad nutrition is not often the priority. According to the last recommendations (2012) of the French Society Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP), the surgeries of the cancers of the VADS are not listed among surgeries with high morbidity. So the specific recommendations for the patients undernourished with surgery with low morbidity, only a personalized dietary advice and oral nutritional supplements are recommended in preoperative. There is no specific recommendation in post-operative.

Two groups of cancer patients of the VADS will be compared: a control group benefiting from a nutritional coverage based on the current recommendations of the SFNEP, an experimental group benefiting from an improved nutritional coverage.

In preoperative, all the patients of experimental group will benefit from dietary advice during a multidisciplinary specific consultation. In post-operative, a dietetic consultation will be set up in 7 days at the exit of hospitalization and call phone at M1, M2, M4 and M5. And for the undernourished patient will benefit a multidisciplinary consultation at the rate of a consultation a month during 6 months.

In the Group control, the patients will be followed according to the current recommendations of the SFNEP.
