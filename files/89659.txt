Prognostic Study of Via Dynamic Change of PCA3 mRNA in Drainage Fluid After Radical Prostatectomy
This study investigates the prognostic value of dynamic changes in PCA3 mRNA levels found in the abdominal cavity drainage fluid after radical prostatectomy. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, and radical prostatectomy is a standard treatment. While PSA levels in the blood are commonly used as a marker for diagnosis, this study focuses on the significance of PCA3 mRNA levels in the prognosis of prostate cancer. The findings may provide insights into improved post-surgical monitoring and more tailored therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer patients.

PCA3 mRNA Levels in Drainage Fluid, PCA3 mRNA Levels in The Drainage Fluid Drained from The Abdominal Cavity, Measured daily for up to 3 days post-surgery
This study examines the prognostic significance of PCA3 mRNA levels in the drainage fluid collected from the abdominal cavity following radical prostatectomy, a common surgical treatment for prostate cancer. PSA is widely used as a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment response, and recurrence monitoring in the blood. However, this research seeks to explore the prognostic value of PCA3 mRNA in the drainage fluid. The study involves continuous monitoring of PCA3 mRNA levels in the drainage fluid after radical prostatectomy, with the hypothesis that dynamic changes in these levels could serve as an early warning system for potential tumor recurrence, residual disease, or metastasis. The research will correlate these fluid PCA3 mRNA levels with patient outcomes, recurrence rates, and other clinical factors to determine their predictive value.

By investigating this novel source of PCA3 mRNA monitoring, the study aims to reduce invasive tests, enhance post-operative surveillance, and improve early detection of disease recurrence for prostate cancer patients. This research could contribute to refining post-surgical care protocols, offering a new tool for predict long-term outcomes for individuals undergoing radical prostatectomy.
