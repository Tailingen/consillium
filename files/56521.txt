Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab in Combination With Disitamab-vedotin as Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-positive High-risk Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC)
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment can be used for specific UTUC patients, especially for highly staged and/or grade tumors, such as kidneys with potentially decreased renal function after RNU. Neoadjuvant therapy is a series of treatments administered preoperatively for UTUC, mainly chemotherapy, and in recent years, novel therapies of immunotherapy have emerged. Since conventional cisplatin neoadjuvant regimens also require high preoperative renal function, neoadjuvant therapy regimens such as immunotherapy provide more effective and feasible treatments for patients who are intolerant to current cisplatin chemotherapy regimens. The aim of this study was to explore a novel preoperative neoadjuvant immunotherapy for UTUC. To further observe the feasibility and safety of this regimen in the field of UTUC.
