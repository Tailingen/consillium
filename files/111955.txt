Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Combined With PD-1 Blockers for Locally Advanced or Locally Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy combined with PD-1 blockers for LAPC and LRPC. The patients, diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) or locally recurrent pancreatic cancer (LRPC). LRPC or LAPC, undergoing SABT and PD-1 blockers in our hospital from December 2020 to April 2023 were reviewed consecutively. All patients provided written informed consent before treatment. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and it was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Peking University Third Hospital.

The goal of this observational study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with PD-1 blockers for LAPC and LRPC. The patients, diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) or locally recurrent pancreatic cancer (LRPC). LRPC or LAPC, undergoing SBRT and PD-1 blockers in our hospital from December 2020 to April 2023 were reviewed consecutively. The schedule of SBRT is 25 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions and the PD-1 blockers are monoclonal antibodies targeted to PD-1 molecules on the T lymphocytes.
