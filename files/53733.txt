Glioma: Biomolecular Aspects
Main limitations in Glioma studies are due to the wide heterogeneity and genetic instability of the tumor and to the fact that the molecular informations are static, i.e. obtained on the tumor at its onset. Instead, spontaneous or therapy-induced variations are difficult to evaluate and they would need further sampling of the tumor throughout the clinical history. Currently these data are more and more routinely used not only for diagnostics but also in the clinical management of the patient.

Furthermore, microenvironment study is becoming increasingly important. It is also important correlate morpho-functional pathway and brain Magnetic Resonance.

Therefore, the main goal of the study is to correlate the data obtained with morphological (site, signal intensity, margins, behavior after contrast medium infusion, mismatch between T2 and FLAIR sequences) and non-morphological MR imaging through a radiomic approach and Diffusion and Perfusion study, with molecular data relating to the IDH mutation, MGMT gene promoter methylation, 1p/19q co-deletion and EGFRvIII expression.

Furthermore, it is proposed to carry out a correlation between the radiological data and the mutations found in the NGS panel.
