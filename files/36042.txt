A Prospective, Single-arm, Multicenter Clinical Trial of Safety and Effectiveness of EUS-LA for Liver Cancer
This trial is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial. Four hospitals with national medical trial institution qualifications are selected as clinical trial centers. Qualified participants will receive endoscopic ultrasound-guided laser ablation by LaserPro Diode Laser System according to the routine procedures. The results will be recorded according to the requirements of the primary and secondary efficacy indicators. After then, statistical comparisons of effectiveness and safety of the procedure will be made according to groups.

The prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial is to evaluate whether the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided laser ablation (LA) by LaserPro Diode Laser System can achieve the safety and effectivenessof liver cancer ablation treatment. Four hospitals with national medical clinical trial institution qualifications are selected as clinical trial centers. This clinical trial requires 69 subjects. Qualified participants will receive EUS-guided LA by LaserPro Diode Laser System according to the routine procedures. The results will be recorded according to the requirements of the primary outcome (the complete ablation (CA) rate and the effective rate of EUS-guided LA by LaserPro Diode Laser System for liver cancer) and secondary outcomes (technical success rate, major complication rate, partial response rate, secondary ablation rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival rate (OS), local tumor progression (LTP), distant tumor recurrence (DTR), quality of life score and alpha-fetoprotein levels). The one-month follow-up after the operation, three-phase MRI, liver function and tumor markers were reviewed monthly to observe the lesion necrosis and tumor marker changes. After that, tumor markers, three-phase MRI of liver were examined every 2 to 3 months. After then, statistical comparisons of safety and effectivenessof the producedure will be made according to groups.
