Polymeric Micellar Paclitaxel for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This trial is a multi-center, randomized, open, parallel-group and positive-controlled phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection plus gemcitabine as first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer compared with nab-Paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.
Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride for Injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel for Injection (albumin bound )|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride for Injection
Progression-Free-Survival, PFS(Progression-Free-Survival) is the time from randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization to measured PD or date of death from any cause（up to 36 months)
Overall Survival(OS), The time from randomization to death., Randomization to date of death from any cause（up to 36 months)|Objective Response Rate(ORR), Proportion of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (RECIST 1.1), Baseline to measured PD（up to 36 months)|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, Proportion of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) (RECIST 1.1), Baseline to measured PD（up to 36 months)|Incidence of adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0"., up to 36 months
Based on the widespread use of paclitaxel in pancreatic cancer, this study aims to develop a clinical protocol of paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection in combination with gemcitabine as first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer, in order to find a more effective treatment option for pancreatic patients and thus improve survival outcomes.
