Cobiprostone for the Prevention of Oral Mucositis in Subjects With Head and Neck Cancer Receiving Concurrent Radiation and Chemotherapy
Treatment for head and neck cancer often involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.

One of the unfortunate consequences of standard care for head and neck cancer is the development of painful mouth sores, known as oral mucositis.

This study will evaluate the use of cobiprostone spray to prevent oral mucositis, when given for the duration of radiation and chemotherapy (RT/CT) standard care.
