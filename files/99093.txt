Naloxegol in Cancer Opioid-Induced Constipation
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of naloxegol versus the patient's usual care in treating opioid-induced constipation, as well as the effect on the patient's quality of life and how much pain is experienced. Also, the purpose of this study is to compare whether treatment with naloxegol versus usual care has any impact on the number of hospital or clinic visits or telephone calls to the patient's physician that are related to constipation, and to determine the patient's preference for continuing to receive naloxegol as treatment for opioid-induced constipation.
Constipation
DRUG: naloxegol
Number of Participants That Completed Naloxegol 25mg and the Number of Participants That Completed Standard of Care, completion of treatment defined as participants receiving all single daily doses for 2 weeks, 4 weeks
Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common symptom in patients with cancer-related pain and requires burdensome self-titration of laxatives for prophylaxis and treatment. Consequently, naloxegol may have an important role in this setting. Naloxegol has been evaluated in relieving OIC with cancer patients in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial over 4 weeks with a 12-week extension phase. However, accrual was challenging and the trial was closed early. Given the complexity of cancer and its treatment, a key first step is to determine if evaluating naloxegol versus standard of care is feasible in the management of OIC in this setting.

Subjects will receive naloxegol 25mg daily or usual care for a 2-week initial treatment period followed by 3-day washout period, then a 2-week crossover treatment period where subjects will receive naloxegol or usual care. Treatment assignment during the initial and crossover treatment periods will be dictated by the randomization arm. Subjects will also have the option to participate in a 12-week extension phase of naloxegol.
