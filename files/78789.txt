Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ASA404 When Given Together With Fluvoxamine, a Selective Serotonin Receptor Reuptake Inhibitor and CYP1A2 Inhibitor
This trial is designed to study the drug-drug interaction between ASA404 and fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of its metabolic pathway (CYP1A2). The study will consist of two phases. The purpose of the Core Phase is to study the drug drug interaction between fluvoxamine and ASA404. The purpose of the Extension Phase is to provide continued treatment for those patients that have not progressed during the Core Phase and to collect safety data on ASA404 when given in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or the paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy regimen.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Vadimezanâ„¢
evaluate the effect of administration of fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, after 2-cycles of ASA404, on the pharmacokinetics of ASA404, approximately 2 months
evaluate the effect of administration of fluvoxamine on the safety profile (incidence of AEs or SAEs generated) of ASA404, 4 months|assess the safety (incidence of AEs and SAEs) of ASA404 in combination with paclitaxel, doctaxel or the paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy regimen in patients with solid tumor malignancies, 12 months
