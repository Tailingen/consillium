Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody Followed by Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Recurrent or Metastatic NSCLC
Immunotherapy has made rapid progress in melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer, etc. Preclinical data suggested that the use of anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with CTLA-4 receptor blockers may increase antitumor activity. The CheckMate-012 study showed that nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy achieved an overall response rate of 43% in unselected patients with non-small cell lung cancer, compared with 23% in the nivolumab monotherapy group; and in the PD-L1 positive subgroup, nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab showed a response rate of 57%, while nivolumab alone was 28%. This showed that the combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab can increase the efficacy, but the adverse events of grade 3 or above of combination therapy reach 37%. The toxic side effects limit the widespread use of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab therapy.

However, since the action of ipilimumab is limited to the initiation of the immune response (antigen presentation and immune cell activation), and its long half-time of 15.4 days, ipilimumab can used as an induction therapy, following by the PD1 monoclonal antibody. This phase I study is aimed to evaluated the safety and efficacy of CTLA-4 antibody followed by PD-1 antibody in patients with recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
