The SPOT-HPV Study
The purpose of this research is to evaluate a new test for oral HPV DNA in saliva ('oral rinse test').
HPV Infection|HPV Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Salivary TTMV-HPV DNA Test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood TTMV-HPV DNA Test
Prevalence of salivary TTMV-HPV DNA, Percentage of controls without cancer compared with percentage of cancer patients who have TTMV-HPV DNA detected in their saliva, 12 months
This cross-sectional study will characterize the prevalence of salivary TTMV-HPV DNA among participants with and without HPV-positive throat cancer

Oral HPV infection is common among healthy adult men, but most of these infections resolve spontaneously and only a very small percentage of oral HPV infections turn into HPV-positive throat cancer. This study is trying to understand whether this new oral rinse test detects HPV DNA from infection, cancer cells, or both. If this test is ONLY positive in people WITH cancer, it may be useful for diagnosing HPV-positive throat cancer in the future.

Along with the oral rinse test study participants will complete brief surveys and participants with a positive salivary TTMV-HPV DNA tests may have repeat saliva testing, blood tests and head/neck exam.

It is expected that about 360 people will take part in this research study.

An external laboratory called Naveris is supporting this research study by providing testing for HPV DNA.
