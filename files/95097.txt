Postoperative Conformal Radiotherapy for Stage II-III B Type Thymoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether postoperative conformal radiotherapy are effective in the treatment of Masaoka stage II-III B type thymoma.
Thymoma
RADIATION: radiotherapy
3 year local control rate, local control: tumor recurrence in the tumor bed 3 year local control rate: number of patients with tumor recurrence in the tumor bed at 3 years, 3 year after the end of all enrollment
3 year failure-free and overall survival, failure-free survivail: the interval from the surgery and the recurrence within or out the tumor bed overall survival: the interval from the surgery and the death or lost of follow-up, 3 year after the end of all enrollment
rate of acute and late radiation toxicity, toxicity: including the acute radition-induced lung toxicity and the late lung toxicity at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 month after radiation or observation, within 3 year after the end of all enrollment|quality of life score, quality of life: FACT-Lung and EORTC QOL C30 before and after radiation, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months after radiation or observation, within 3 years after all enrollment
The role of postoperative radiotherapy in thymoma is controversial. Some retrospective studies were for the radiotherapy, but others were against. However, more inherent biases existed in these trials. Resection, Masaoka stage and pathology were widely accepted as the prognostic factors for thymoma. Furthermore, the frequency of local failure after radical resection was still high in Masaoka stage II-III B type thymoma. With the conformal technique appearing, conformal radiotherapy can escalate the dose without increasing the risk of normal tissue toxicities.
