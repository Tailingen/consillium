Development of an EORTC Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-specific Quality of Life Item List: Phase 1 & 2
Over the past 20 years, the views and experiences of patients in the field of oncology (through patient-reported outcomes, PROMs) have become increasingly important. When used in clinical trials, PROMs contribute to better detection and are used in clinical trials to improve the detection and management of treatment side effects. The Health-related quality of life assessments are widely used in oncology research, and the development of reliable and valid measurement instruments has become a major challenge.

In this context, health-related quality of life in cancer patients covers various aspects (functional status, physical or psychological symptoms) and several cancer-specific measurement instruments have been developed, including the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life questionnaire.

Among the different therapies used to treat cancers, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been gaining momentum in recent years. Commonly used to treat a wide variety of cancers, it also has a wide range of known side effects.

However, little is known about the health-related quality of life of patients patients who receive this therapy: specific self-questionnaires are almost non-existent or inadequate, not covering all the effects related to immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity. As for the data currently collected, they suffer from methodological problems.

In view of the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment, their known side effects and the lack of valid questionnaires specific to these treatments, it appears important to provide a valid questionnaire to take into account these impacts on the quality of life of patients.

To assess the need for an additional EORTC quality of life module, or item list, to measure health-related quality of life in cancer patients who have received or are receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors., Provisional item list(s) of quality of life issues important to people treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Development of a strategy for the measurement of health-related quality of life in cancer patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitors, alongside existing EORTC quality of life scales for cancer patients., At inclusion
