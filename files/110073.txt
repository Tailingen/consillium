Analysis of the Incidence of Expression of Tumor Antigens in Pathologically Proven Stage I, II and III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC) in Asiatic Patients
This study aims to investigate the expression of Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3), Melanoma-associated antigen C2 (MAGE-C2), New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1), L antigen family member 1 (LAGE-1), Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) and PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen of MElanoma) tumor antigens in a large number of pathologically proven stage I, II and III NSCLC samples of Asiatic patients.
Pathologically Proven Stage I, II and III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
OTHER: Data acquisition and analysis
Determination of the expression of MAGE-A3, MAGE-C2, NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, WT1 and PRAME antigens in tumor tissue from Asiatic patients with pathologically proven stage I, II or III NSCLC (as defined by the International Staging System)., Up to 6 months approximately.|Determination ofthe correlation of expression levels and co-expression patterns as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC; protein expression) and as detected by RT-PCR (gene expression) for tumor antigens for which specific antibodies are available., Up to 6 months approximately.
This study will be based upon the analysis of samples and patient-related data already available at the various investigation sites. There will be no study treatment and no study-specific procedure carried out on the patients.

Clinical data collected will include patient demographics (age, gender), Tumor, Node, Metastasis (staging system) \[TNM stage\], histopathologic description and the patient smoker status. Strict anonymity of patient data will be maintained.

This retrospective study is based upon the analysis of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples and patient-related data already available at the investigational site.
