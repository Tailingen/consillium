Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Blood Concentration of PMC-309
This is a Phase 1a/1b, first-in-human (FIH), open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PMC-309, a mAb against the human VISTA ligand, in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors administered as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

To assess the clinical efficacy of PMC-309 in the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), RECIST consisting of overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) will be graded following CT/MRI of chest, abdomen and pelvis., Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|The plasma pharmacokinetic endpoints of the study is assessed by peak serum concentration (Cmax), Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 Days)|The plasma pharmacokinetic endpoints of the study is assessed by time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax), Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 Days)|PK parameter assessed by serum concentration at specified timepoints for area under curve (AUC), Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 Days)|To assess the clinical efficacy of PMC-309 at the RP2D as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, This will be assessed by RECIST v1.1., Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 Days)|PK parameter assessed by serum concentration over time of PMC-309 at the RP2D as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Upto 35 Cycles (each cycle is 21 Days)
Phase 1a is a 2-part dose escalation; both part will adopt the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 30% for dose finding.

* Part A is planned as a PMC-309 dose escalation.
* Part B: is planned as a PMC-309 dose escalation in combination with pembrolizumab.

Phase 1b is planned as a cohort expansion with PMC-309 administered as a monotherapy (Cohort A) at the preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) found at Phase 1a (Part A) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Cohort B) with PMC-309 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) found at Phase 1a (Part B).

A minimum of 67 participants are to be enrolled to the study.

Treatment Groups: Phase 1a Part A: PMC-309 Phase 1a Part B: PMC-309 + Pembrolizumab Phase 1b Cohort A: PMC-309 Phase 1b Cohort B: PMC-309 + Pembrolizumab Estimated overall study duration: approximately 2 to 6 years Dosing Cycle: the duration of a treatment cycle is 3 weeks/21 days.
