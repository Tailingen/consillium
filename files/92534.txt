Comaprison of 68Ga-FAP-2286 and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Patients With Various Types of Cancer
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-FAP-2286 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in various types of cancer, and compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.
Tumor, Solid|Positron-Emission Tomography
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-FDG
Diagnostic accuracy, The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy., 90 days
Standardized uptake value (SUV), Standardized uptake value (SUV) of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET/CT for each target lesion of subject or suspected primary tumor or/and metastasis., 30 days|Number of lesions, The numbers of positive primary and metastatic lesions of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation., 90 days
Subjects with various types of cancer underwent contemporaneous 68Ga-FAP-2286 and 18F-FDG PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The numbers of positive tumor lesions of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAP-2286 PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 68Ga-FAP-2286, 18F-FDG PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.
