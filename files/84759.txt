Cryotherapy -BEATS-RF Ablation Trial
The purpose of this study is to determine whether cryotherapy is effective in the treatment of persistent high grade dysplasia (HGD) or early esophageal adenocarcinoma (IMCA) in patients who have not responded to radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
Barrett's Esophagus With Persistent Dysplasia or|Early Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Post Radio Frequency Ablation
Response, To assess efficacy of achieving elimination of dysplasia in patients with RFA-refractory BE with HGD or IMCA, 2 years
Predictors of response, To identify potential predictors of CE-D and CE-IM in patients requiring rescue CSA treatment after failed RFA therapy, 2 years
