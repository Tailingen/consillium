Detection of Microplastics and Nanoplastics in Neurosurgery Patients (DT-MiNi)
Plastic particles are a ubiquitous pollutant in the living environment and food chain, so far, plenty of studies have reported the internal exposure of microplastics and nanoplastics in human tissues and enclosed body fluids.

Neurosurgery is the only department that can open the skull. In addition to blood and cerebrospinal fluid, there are brain tissue and tumors in the presence of lesions. Whether any of these microplastics and nanoplastics are present remains a mystery. This prospective observational study will harvest biological samples of neurosurgery patients.

The objective of this research is to be able to detect microplastics and nanoplastics on blood and operation samples of neurosurgery patients.
