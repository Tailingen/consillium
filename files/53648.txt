Micro-UltraSound In Cancer - Active Surveillance
This study will compare the two imaging modalities (MRI and micro-ultrasound) during Active Surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). Progression to clinically significant PCa will be assessed by first taking micro-US targeted samples (while blinded to MRI results), followed by MRI targeted samples, finishing with 12 systematic biopsy cores. The primary goal is to compare microUS to MRI for the detection of ≥GG2 PCa at confirmatory biopsy. This study will also collect blood samples from participants to be used for future biomarker studies.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: High-resolution micro-ultrasound
Cancer upgrading during Active surveillance by micro-ultrasound and MRI, The primary outcome will be detection of ≥Grade Group 2 by each biopsy, technique in combination with the systematic biopsy., Immediately after biopsy.
Cancer upgrading during Active surveillance between imagine-guided versus systematic biopsy., Secondary outcome will compare each imaged-guided biopsy technique to the standard-of-care 12 core systematic biopsy simultaneously obtained., Immediately after biopsy.
