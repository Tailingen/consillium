Extension of a Study of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation From One Haplotype Mismatch Related Donor or From an Unrelated Donor to Younger Patients Eligible for Reduced-intensity Conditioning Regimen
This study is an extension to younger patients of the currently ongoing national, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III HAPLOMUDELDERLY which evaluates elderly patients with hematological malignancies, justifying an allo-HSCT from an alternative donor when a MRD has not been identified. It will extend the investigation of these two modalities of allo-HSCT to younger patients which are eligible to RIC.
Acute Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic stem cells transplantation
Event-free survival, the time from randomization to the time of a first occurrence of an event with death, relapse or occurrence of severe cGVHD as event and considered as censored at the time of last follow-up visit, 5 years
