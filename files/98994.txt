A Study of Imatinib and Nilotinib in Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Chronic Phase
The extension study followed the core study CAMN107ECN02 (NCT01275196). which is an open-label, two armed study. All patients enrolled in this extension study were able to benefit from the treatment given in CAMN107ECN02 per investigator's evaluation. Therefore, in this extension study patient continued treatment of the drug (imatinib or nilotinib) which they were taking at the end of CAMN107ECN02. Treatment arms in CAMN107ECN02 were retained.

Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Clinically significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs were reported as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. Only descriptive analysis., From first dose of study treatment to 30 days after last dose of study treatment, up to 31 months

The patients continued receiving the open-label drugs that they were taken by the end of core study. Treatment arms in the core study were retained. No crossover between the arms was allowed.

The extension study started from the first patient last dose date in the core study and ends at the time of nilotinib was commercially available in China as a first line treatment. Eligibility evaluations were given for each patient before the enrollment. Follow-up visits at a frequency of 6 months were required to report AE, SAE and pregnancy only. No efficacy data were collected in the extension study since full efficacy had already been analyzed in the core study.
