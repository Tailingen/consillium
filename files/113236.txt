Deployment and Clinical Evaluation of an AI-powered Digital Oncology Biomarker Tool to guidE Treatment in TNBC
TILs have been shown to be predictive for response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC in multiple studies (Level-1B evidence for clinical validity as per REMARK criteria). TNBC patients with excellent survival outcome and low incidence of metastasis can be identified using a manual TIL score.

Furthermore, a fully end-to-end blinded evaluation of the same algorithm to be used in this study achieved \>90% accuracy for predicting disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the pooled analysis of seven adjuvant phase-III TNBC trials.
