A Phase 2 Multicenter Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will enroll approximately 160 adult participants who have relapsed or refractory (r/r) iNHL to be infused with the study treatment, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to see if their disease responds to this experimental product and if this product is safe. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is made from the participants own white blood cells which are genetically modified and grown to fight cancer. An objective response rate of 70% is targeted.

All enrolled participants will be screened for eligibility then will undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for manufacturing. In preparation for the infusion with axicabtagene ciloleucel, participants will undergo conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for 3 days to help the study treatment be effective. After the product is manufactured and conditioning chemotherapy period is complete, participants will be infused with axicabtagene ciloleucel and then monitored in a hospital for a minimum of 7 days. After completing at least 60 months (FL participants) or at least 24 months (MZL participants) of assessments in this study since the initial axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and after agreement by the Sponsor, participants will transition to a long-term follow-up (LTFU) study, KT-US-982-5968 where they will complete the remainder of the 15 year follow-up assessments.
