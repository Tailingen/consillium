SeqUential GeMcitabine and MITomycin Treatment for Favorable High-Risk Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
This Phase II clinical trial, titled "A Phase II Trial of Sequential Gemcitabine and Mitomycin Treatment for Favorable High-Risk Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (SUMMIT)," aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination chemotherapy treatment for patients with favorable papillary high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). The study focuses on sequential administration of two drugs, gemcitabine and Jelmyto (a gel-based form of mitomycin), to potentially preserve kidney function and avoid nephroureterectomy (kidney removal), which is the current standard of care for participants with non-endoscopically resectable tumors.

DRUG: Sequential Gemcitabine and Jelmyto Treatment (Gem/Jel)
Complete Response (CR) Rate, The proportion of participants who achieve a complete response, defined as the absence of detectable high-grade disease via ureteroscopy, imaging (CTU/MRU), and urine cytology following the completion of the initial Gem/Jel treatment regimen. A complete response indicates no visible tumor during endoscopic evaluation and no evidence of cancer cells in collected samples, At the end of the initial 6-week induction phase (up to 12 weeks if re-induction is necessary)
Safety and Incidence of Adverse Events, Frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the sequential Gem/Jel treatment, including drug-related toxicities and complications related to the nephrostomy tube, evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria CTCAE) guidelines, which categorize the severity of side effects on a scale from mild (grade 1) to severe (grade 5)., Throughout the study period (up to 3 years)
Participants enrolled in the study will receive six weekly doses of gemcitabine and Jelmyto delivered directly into the affected kidney through a nephrostomy tube. Based on the tumor's response, patients may receive an additional six doses or transition to a standard maintenance regimen. The primary goal is to assess the complete response rate of this treatment and determine its effectiveness in preserving kidney function while managing cancer recurrence. Secondary objectives include evaluating safety, recurrence-free survival at 12 and 24 months, and patient-reported outcomes over time.

The study is expected to last approximately 3 years, with participants undergoing regular follow-up evaluations. If the treatment is ineffective, standard procedures such as nephroureterectomy may still be performed.
