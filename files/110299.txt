EBV CAR-T Cells for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of EBV CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed/refractory NPC
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T Cell Injection|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: cyclophosphamide
Dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）, Adverse events related to cell therapy were observed on 28 days after CAR-T cell injection , as specified in the protocol, From day 0 to day 28
Cmax, The amplification of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood peaked after administration, 12 months|Tmax, Number of days of peak CAR-T cell expansion after administration, 12 months|AUC(Day 0 to Day 28), The area under the curve of CAR-T cells from day 0 to day 28 after administration was plotted by the visit time of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood, From day 0 to day 28|ORR, Proportion of patients who achieved pre-defined tumor volume change and maintained the minimum time limit.Imaging examination was performed after administration, and RECIST1.1 evaluation criteria was used for evaluation, 12 months|PFS, The time from the onset of leukocyte apheresis to the appearance of tumor progression or death, 12 months|OS OS, The time between leukocyte apheresis and death from any cause, 12 months
The investigators designed a single-arm, open-label, "3+3" dose-escalation exploratory study. According to the subject and dose escalation test, the maximum dose or the best effective dose was determined to verify the safe and effective number of cells per body weight. A "3+3" dose escalation design was used to set three dose groups of gradually increasing CAR-T cells for therapeutic evaluation. The dose groups were 3.0×10\^6cells/kg, 9.0×10\^6cells/kg and 1.5×10\^7cells/kg, respectively. Cell reinfusion will take place on day 0 (d0) and each subject will be observed for at least 4 weeks after receiving cell reinfusion (DLT observation period).
