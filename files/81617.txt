Using MRI-Guided Laser Heat Ablation to Induce Disruption of the Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier to Enhance Delivery and Efficacy of Treatment of Pediatric Brain Tumors
By employing a combination of advanced MRI techniques and correlative serum biomarkers of blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, the investigators plan to develop a powerful, first of its kind clinical algorithm in pediatrics whereby the investigators can measure and identify the window of maximal BBB disruption post MLA to 1) allow for an alternative to surgery in incompletely resected tumors, 2) allow for optimal chemotherapeutic dosing to achieve the greatest benefits and the least systemic side effects and 3) distinguish subsequent tumor progression from long-term MLA treatment effects. Preliminary data in adult imaging studies have shown that the BBB disruption lasts for several weeks following treatment before returning to a low baseline. This pilot therapeutic study will provide preliminary validation in pediatric patients.

Arm A Only: Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is followed from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years from date of registration (median length of follow-up, full range 196 days-1801 days)|Arm A Only: Overall Survival (OS) as Measured by Number of Participants Alive at 5 Years, Up to 5 years from date of registration (median length of follow-up, full range 196 days-1801 days)|Arm B Only: Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is followed from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., At 6 months
Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Karnofsky or Lansky Performance Status, Score ranges from 100% to 10%. A higher score indicates that the patient has a more normal quality of life., At 1 year post-MLA|Serum Biomarkers of Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption as Measured by Change in Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE), * Arm A patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, 2-4 weeks post-MLA, and every 12 weeks thereafter for 12 months post-MLA
* Arm B patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6, and every 8 weeks for the first 2 years or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
* Neuron specific enolase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, which is localized in neurons and axonal processes. Potentially, it escapes into the blood and CSF at the time of neural injury. Elevated serum NSE seemed to correlates with disruption in BBB following MLA and transient increase in BBB permeability., Up to 48 weeks post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm A) or up to 2 years post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm B)|Serum Biomarkers of Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption as Measured by Change in S100B, * Arm A patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, 2-4 weeks post-MLA, and every 12 weeks thereafter for 12 months post-MLA
* Arm B patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6, and every 8 weeks for the first 2 years or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
* S100b is a low-molecular-weight Calcium-binding protein primarily found in astrocytic glial cells of the CNS. It is secreted by astrocytes for neuroprotective and -trophic cellular functions in the CNS. Elevated serum values can be associated with temporal changes in BBB integrity following MLA., Up to 48 weeks post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm A) or up to 2 years post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm B)|Serum Biomarkers of Peritumoral Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption as Measured by Change in GFAP, * Arm A patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, 2-4 weeks post-MLA, and every 12 weeks thereafter for 12 months post-MLA
* Arm B patients had blood drawn at the following time points: baseline, 3 days post-MLA, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6, and every 8 weeks for the first 2 years or until disease progression, whichever occurs first.
* The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a classic intermediate filament protein specific to astrocytes in the CNS. GFAP is characteristic of astrocyte- and neural stem cell-derived gliomas in CNS tumors and is used to identify malignancies of glial origin, such as astrocytomas and GBM. Serum GFAP values can be increased with temporal disruption of BBB post-MLA., Up to 48 weeks post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm A) or up to 2 years post MRI-guided laser heat ablation (Arm B)|Correlation of MR Imaging With Peritumoral BBB Disruption, The linear regression model will used to investigate the correlation between MR imaging and peritumoral BBB disruption. To account for correlation among the repeated measures from the same patient, the longitudinal data will be analyzed with the use of linear generalized estimating equation (GEE). Whether the average measurements differ at the multiple time points will be evaluated through GEE model. Least-square means at each time points will be presented and standard errors will be calculated within the use of the GEE sandwich method when accounting for within-patient correlation., 1 year from MLA|Predictive Value of the Peritumoral Permeability Score for Patient Outcome as Measured by PFS, Biomarkers with higher correlation coefficient (r approaching 1) will be given higher priority. A minimum r=0.5 is required for inclusion for further analysis and will be used as a peritumoral permeability score. This score will then be correlated with the patient outcome data (as measured by 6 month PFS rate) to determine whether it has a predictive value., 6 months
