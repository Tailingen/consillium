Percent of Participants With Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) at 6 Months Follow-Up, Cytogenetic response (CyR) was based on the number of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) metaphases among cells in metaphase on a Bone Marrow (BM) sample. The criteria for CyR were as follows: Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM; Partial cytogenetic response (PCyR): \>0 to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM; Minor cytogenetic response: \>35 to 65% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM; Minimal cytogenetic response: \>65 to 95% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM; No cytogenetic response: \>95 to 100% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM; Best CyR was defined as the best response obtained at any time during the study; MCyR was defined as a best CyR of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR). Baseline=closest to, but no later than, the first day of study drug for treated participants and closest to, but no later than, the date of randomization, for those who were randomized but who never received treatment, unless otherwise specified., 6 months

Hematologic responses were counted anytime following 14 days after the dosing start date., 6 months, 24 months|Time to MCyR in Participants With MCyR at 6 Months Follow-Up, Time to MCyR was defined as the time from the first dosing date until criteria were first met for CCyR or PCyR, whichever occurred first. Non-responders were censored at the maximum time of all participants in their respective group (ie, maximum between time to MCyR response for responders and time to last cytogenetic assessment for non-responders)., 6 months|Time to CHR in Participants With CHR at 6 Months Follow-Up, Time to CHR was defined as the time from the first dosing date until criteria are first met for the response. Non-responders were censored at the maximum time of all participants in their respective group (ie, maximum between time to CHR response for responders and time to last hematologic assessment for non-responders)., 6 months|Time to MCyR in Participants With MCyR at 24 Months Follow-Up, Time to MCyR was defined as the time from the first dosing date until criteria were first met for CCyR or PCyR, whichever occurred first. Non-responders were censored at the maximum time of all participants in their respective group (ie, maximum between time to MCyR response for responders and time to last cytogenetic assessment for non-responders).

Non-responders were censored at the maximum time of all participants in their respective group (ie, maximum between time to CHR response for responders and time to last hematologic assessment for non-responders). Cytogenetic assessments were not done after the 2 Year Follow-up., 24 months|Number of Participants With MCyR Whose Disease Progressed by 24 Months, Progression in a participant=participant achieved a CHR and no longer met the criteria consistently over consecutive 2-weeks after starting their maximum dose; had no CHR after receiving their maximum dose and had an increase in white blood count (WBC) defined as a doubling of the count from the lowest value to \>20,000/mm\^3 or an increase by \> 50,000/mm\^3 on two assessments performed at least 2 weeks apart; participant met criteria of accelerated or blast phase CML at any time; had a MCyR and subsequently no longer met the criteria for MCyR after starting their maximum dose; had a ≥ 30% absolute increase in the number of Ph+ metaphases.

After the 2-year analysis and Protocol Amendment 02, those on a BID dosing schedule were allowed to switch to a QD dosing schedule. Due to the large number of participants switching from BID dosing to QD dosing, the abbreviated dosing data collection method incorporated in Amendment 03, the overall safety data are presented for the 100 mg QD group and combined for the other treatment groups., Baseline to 30 days post last dose, up to 7 years (study closure July 2014)
