Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer Surveillance With Cytosponge
Surveillance and early detection of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with minimally-invasive Cytosponge™ cell collection device coupled with molecular biomarkers.

DEVICE: Cytosponge cell collection device
Discovery of suitable biomarkers for squamous intraepithelial neoplasia to inform future trials., RNA-seq expression analysis will be used to measure the abundance of the previously identified biomarkers of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, including genes TP53, NFE2L2, MLL2, ZNF750, NOTCH1, TFNAIP3, and CHN1. The study will include these biomarkers, but will not be limited to them., 4 years
Acceptability of the Cytosponge™ cell collection device in patients with ESCC and high-risk for ESCC, % of Participants that have scored the Cytosponge experience of at least 6 points on a 0 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) acceptability scale whereby 0 denotes "worst experience in life" and 10 denotes "best experience in life"., 4 years|Safety of the Cytosponge™ cell collection device in patients with ESCC and high-risk for ESCC: rate of Participants with adverse events within 30 days after application, The rate of Participants with adverse events within 30 days after application of the Cytosponge cell collection device, which is defined as any event that require admission to the hospital. E.g. retention of the device in the GI tract, chest pain or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring admission to the Ward, 4 years
The goal of the study is to identify molecular abnormalities at each developmental stage of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and early squamous cell carcinoma) in order to establish new molecular biomarkers with potential for early detection and surveillance of the disease using the minimally-invasive Cytosponge™ cell collection device. Firstly, tissue samples after endoscopic treatment (endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection) for squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and early squamous cell carcinoma will be analyzed with the use of the next-generation sequencing to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Afterward, patients with- and at risk- of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma will be recruited to undergo a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies (the gold standard) and Cytosponge procedure. The diagnostic accuracy of Cytosponge coupled with molecular biomarkers will be evaluated to compare with the gold standard.
