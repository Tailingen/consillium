Fitness Assessment in Young Adults Recovered From Lymphoma
Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with maintaining body composition, increased cardiorespiratory capacity, muscle mass and bone mineral density. In the event of a cancer, the development of physical capacities and metabolism may therefore be disturbed by cancer, these associated treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) but also undernutrition and the reduction in physical activity or even a sedentary lifestyle.

Although the benefits of PA in oncology are now well identified for adult populations, studies are still rare in the population of children, adolescents and young adults, and the results are still difficult to generalize. As a result, there is no recommendation on the practice of physical activity in pediatric oncology or adolescents and young adults and the levels of physical activity of cured patients remain lower than those of the general population.

Fitness is a marker of health in adults as well as in adolescents. Physical condition is a set of components such as cardiorespiratory capacity (transport and use of O2), body composition (distribution of bone, muscle and fat masses) and muscle function (strength, power, fatigue, energy metabolism) .

The investigators hypothesize that, compared to young adults, recovered from lymphoma are expected to exhibit impaired physical condition, due to physical deconditioning.
