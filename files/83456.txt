A Study of SHR-A2102 in Combination With Adebrelimab and SHR-8068 in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding/efficacy-expanding Phase IB/II clinical trial to evaluate SHR-A2102 in combination with adebelimab in combination with SHR-8068 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The study consists of two phases: Phase IB to explore the safety/tolerability of SHR-A2102 in combination with adebelimab in combination with SHR-8068 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; Phase II: To explore the efficacy of SHR-A2102 in combination with adebelimab in combination with SHR-8068 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

DRUG: SHR-A2102|DRUG: Adebelimab (SHR-1316)|DRUG: SHR-8068
Determination of Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), From first dose of study treatment until the end of Cycle 1（up to 21 days）|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of participants with a confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., From time of first dose of SHR-A2102 or Adebrelimab or SHR-8068 until the date of objective disease progression or death (up to 12 months)|Incidence and severity of AEs, The observation period ended at the end of the 21-day period after the first dose of SHR-A2102 or Adebrelimab or SHR-8068 (up to 21 days)
Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of participants who have a best objective response of confirmed CR or PR or who have SD after start of treatment., From time of first dose of SHR-A2102 or Adebrelimab or SHR-8068 until the date of objective disease progression or death (up to 12 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the date of first response until date of disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression., From time of first dose of objective disease progression until the date of objective disease progression or death (up to 12 months)]|Progression free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death., From time of first dose of objective disease progression until the date of objective disease progression or death (up to 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), The time until death due to any cause., From time of first dose of objective disease progression until the date of death (up to 24 months)
