Phase 1 Study of PTX-100 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies With PTCL Expansion Cohort
This is an open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the PD, PK, and safety of 500 to 2000 mg/m2 PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies.

PTX-100 will be administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes on days 1 to 5 of a 14-day cycle for 4 cycles unless toxicity is observed.

Dose escalation is complete and the expansion is open and actively recruiting PTCL patients.

Investigate the time- and dose-dependent PD of multiple doses of PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies (RAP-1), PD endpoints will be based on analysis of level of RAP-1 geranylgeranylation proteins in PBMNCs and tumor biopsies:, One Cycle (cycle = 14 days)|Investigate the time- and dose-dependent PD of multiple doses of PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies (PD endpoints), PD endpoints will be based on analysis of the level of DJ2 farnesylation proteins in PBMNCs and tumor biopsies:, One Cycle (cycle = 14 days)|Investigate the time- and dose-dependent PK of multiple doses of PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies (cmax), Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by PK parameters calculated from plasma concentrations of PTX 100. Individual and mean plasma concentrations of PTX-100 versus time as well as individual and mean PK parameters will be determined, for the following:

• Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), One Cycle (cycle = 14 days)|Investigate the time- and dose-dependent PK of multiple doses of PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies (Tmax), Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by PK parameters calculated from plasma concentrations of PTX 100. Individual and mean plasma concentrations of PTX-100 versus time as well as individual and mean PK parameters will be determined, for the following:

• Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), One Cycle (cycle = 14 days)|Investigate the time- and dose-dependent PK of multiple doses of PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies (half life), Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by PK parameters calculated from plasma concentrations of PTX 100. Individual and mean plasma concentrations of PTX-100 versus time as well as individual and mean PK parameters will be determined, for the following:

• Apparent elimination half-life (t1/2), One Cycle (cycle = 14 days)
