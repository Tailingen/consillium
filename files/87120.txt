Trial of NanoPac Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer
This study evaluates the use of NanoPac injected directly into the prostate lesion in men with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Prostate Cancer Adenocarcinoma|Prostatic Neoplasm|Urogenital Neoplasms|Genital Neoplasms, Male|Localized Cancer
DRUG: NanoPac (sterile nanoparticulate paclitaxel) Powder for Suspension
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment emergent adverse events (including changes in laboratory assessments, physical examination findings, and vital signs), Day 1 to Day 85
Tumor Response Based on Histologic Evaluation of Biopsied Prostate Samples (Gleason Score), Prostate tissue samples obtained from a biopsy performed prior to baseline and prostatectomy. Histologic evaluation of these samples will be used to determine the Gleason score, and the results at baseline and Day 92 will be used to evaluate the tumor response to NanoPac. The Gleason score is calculated by adding together the two grades of cancer cells that make up the largest areas of the biopsied tissue sample. The Gleason score usually ranges from 6 to 10. The lower the Gleason score, the more the cancer cells look like normal cells and are likely to grow and spread slowly; a higher Gleason score is likely to indicate a worse outcome. The Gleason score is used to help plan treatment and determine prognosis., Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 92|Tumor Response Based on Change in Percentage of Sample Considered Adenocarcinoma, Tissues excised from the dominant lesion during prostatectomy (Day 92) will be evaluated for the percentage considered adenocarcinoma and compared to biopsy sample obtained at baseline., Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 92|Tumor Invasion Into Surrounding Tissues, The proportion of subjects with local invasion as measured by mpMRI at the final study visit will be compared to screening (baseline), Up to 1 month prior to Consent and Day 85|Tumor Response Based on Change in Image Volume on mpMRI, Tumor response to treatment with NanoPac will be determined by evaluating the change in image volume with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) obtained prior to consent and again at the final study visit., Up to 1 month prior to Consent and Day 85|Change in PSA Density, PSA density (PSAD), is a calculation of the serum PSA level divided by the volume of the prostate gland. PSA density has been used as a prognostication tool in helping decide treatment approach. PSA density measured at the final study visit will be compared to screening (baseline), Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 85|Change in PI-RADS Score, The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) assessment uses a five-point scale based on the probability that a combination of mpMRI findings on T2 weighting (T2W), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DCE) correlates with the presence of a clinically significant cancer in the prostate gland. A PI-RADS score of 1 is considered to be most probably benign and a score of 5 is considered to be highly suspicious of prostate malignancy. PI-RADS score will be measured at screening (baseline) and at the final study visit., Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 85|Effect on Tumor Presence in Lymph Nodes, Optional PSMA PET scan performed prior to first NanoPac injection and prior to prostatectomy, Up to 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and Day 92|Concentration of Paclitaxel in the Systemic Circulation Post-injection, Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained on days of NanoPac injection and other clinic visits., Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 85|Presence or Absence of Paclitaxel in Ejaculate, Ejaculate samples will be collected for analysis of the presence or absence of paclitaxel., Days 15, 43, 57, and 85|Presence or Absence of Paclitaxel in Tissues Obtained at Prostatectomy, At the time of prostatectomy, available tissues including the tumor, the ipsilateral lobe of the prostate, the contralateral lobe of the prostate, and pelvic lymph nodes, will be evaluated for the presence or absence of paclitaxel, Day 92
NanoPac is very small (submicron) particles of the chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, which is administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, this submicron particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into the prostate lesion in men with prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy on up to three different occasions. All subjects in the study will receive NanoPac and will be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe, well-tolerated, and has an impact on prostate cancer.
