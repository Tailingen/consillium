A Study of Indoximod or Placebo Plus Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab for Subjects With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
This is an adaptive clinical trial that includes a dose escalation phase followed by a randomized controlled Phase 3 trial. The purpose of the dose escalation phase is to establish the Phase 3 dose of indoximod in combination with pembrolizumab or nivolumab in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and evaluate PK. Subsequently the efficacy, safety and tolerability of indoximod plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab versus placebo plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab will be studied in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the Phase 3 portion of the trial.

The phase 3 study will not proceed per Sponsor decision.
