Blinatumomab Intensification for MRD-Negative Acute B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia Before Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate whether short-term blinatumomab intensification before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can improve survival outcomes in adults with high-risk BCR::ABL1-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who have achieved measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity. Blinatumomab, a CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, has shown promising efficacy in eradicating MRD and prolonging survival in B-ALL patients. In this study, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either short-term blinatumomab consolidation prior to allo-HSCT or proceed directly to allo-HSCT. The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival (RFS). This study aims to optimize treatment strategies and improve long-term outcomes for patients with high-risk BCR::ABL1-negative B-ALL.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, B-precursor
DRUG: Blinatumomab|OTHER: Consolidation Chemotherapy or Direct Allogeneic HSCT
2-year Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), Relapse-free survival is defined as the time from transplantation to either disease relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who are alive and relapse-free at 2 years will be considered as having achieved 2-year RFS., 2 years after transplantation
Cumulative Incidence of Relapse (CIR), Defined as the cumulative incidence of hematologic relapse, accounting for competing risks such as non-relapse mortality., Up to 2 years after transplantation|Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM), Death from any cause without prior hematologic relapse., Up to 2 years after transplantation|Incidence of Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Adverse Events, Safety evaluation based on CTCAE v5.0 criteria, including treatment-related cytopenias, infections, neurotoxicity, and other adverse events., From first dose of study drug to 100 days post-transplant|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) Status, MRD status assessed using multi-parameter flow cytometry or PCR prior to HSCT. Evaluated as MRD-negative or MRD-positive., From enrollment to up to 2 years after transplantation|2-year Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from HSCT to death from any cause. Patients alive at 2 years are considered to have achieved 2-year OS., 2 years after transplantation
