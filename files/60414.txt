Endometrial Cancer|Endometrioid Tumor|Cancer|Tumor|Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma|Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: nab-sirolimus
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) from the time of study treatment initiation until progression of disease (PD) as determined by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1., 12 Months
Duration of response (DOR), Determined for patients with BOR of confirmed CR or PR, 12 Months|Disease Control Rate (DCR): CR or PR, BOR of confirmed CR or PR (either of any duration) or stable disease (SD) following study treatment initiation (by IRR), 12 Months|Time to response (TTR), Time from study treatment initiation to initial measurement of CR or PR, where CR or PR is subsequently confirmed, 12 Months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Number of months from study treatment initiation to the date of disease progression 3 or death due to any cause, 12 Months|Overall survival (OS), Number of months from study treatment initiation to the date of death due to any cause or last follow up date if alive, 24 Months|Incidence and severity, Of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 12 Months
This is a prospective phase 2, open-label, multi-institutional study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-sirolimus + letrozole in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who have received 0-1 prior lines of chemotherapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting. Patients will be treated with nab-sirolimus (given IV on Days 1 and 8 in a 21-day cycle, combined with letrozole (orally, daily) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, or until in the opinion of the Investigator the patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at patient discretion.
