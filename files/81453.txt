Evaluate the safety and tolerability of GC001, Number of participants in dose escalating cohorts with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)，treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and/or changes in clinical laboratory abnormalities., DLT Observation Period，Up to 28 days from GC001 injection|Maximal tolerable dose, During the DLT observation period, the number of cases with DLT is less than or equal to the maximum dose of 1/6 of the total number of cases, and six evaluable participants are required to determine MTD., DLT Observation Period,Up to 28 days from GC001 injection
Anti-tumor activity of GC001: response assessment of neuro-oncology(RANO)., To evaluate the response assessment of neuro-oncology(RANO) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., Up to 2 years|Anti-tumor activity of GC001: immunotherapy response assessment for neuro-oncology (iRANO)., To evaluate the immunotherapy response assessment for neuro-oncology (iRANO) as a measurement of tumor response and disease progression., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection
Evaluate the viral biological distribution and shedding of GC001, Viral biodistribution and shedding analysis for GC001 injection are performed based on the viral Biodistribution and shedding Analysis Set (BVSS). Biological collection samples include blood, urine, throat swabs, omaya cyst aqueous ,injection site and injection site dressing samples (for tumor injection at the percutaneous puncture site only),and determination of viral DNA copy number in the above samples., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection|Pharmacodynamic analysis of cytokine levels in the peripheral blood and omaya cyst aqueous., To assess the levels of cytokines including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-5、 IL-6 and IL-10 in the peripheral blood andomaya cyst aqueous., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection|Pharmacodynamic analysis of PD-1 and lymphocyte in the peripheral blood and omaya cyst aqueous, To assess the ratio of PD-1 and lymphocyte in the peripheral blood and omaya cyst aqueous., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection|immunogenicity, Immunogenicity analysis will measure the concertation of antidody (anti-VV antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (Nab) )in the peripheral blood., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection|Pharmacodynamic analysis of immune cells in the peripheral blood and omaya cyst aqueous, The lymphocyte ratio of CD3 + / CD4 + , CD3 + / CD8 + and the ratio of CD4 + / CD8 + are measured in the peripheral blood and omaya cyst aqueous., Up to 2 years from GC001 injection
The ongoing trial is structured as an open, single-arm Phase I clinical study consisting of dose-escalation and dose-expansion.

The main objective of dose-escalation is:

To evaluate the safety and tolerability i.e. dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MFD) of GC001 injection in patients with with recurrent or progressive gliomas,and will be determining the recommended phase II dose(PR2D).

The initial phase of the study, Part I, utilizes a 3+3 design to meticulously evaluate the escalation of the dose of GC001. The total enrollment of participants will be determined by the observed toxicity levels and the extent of dose cohorts explored, with a maximum enrollment of 42 cases. A critical 28-day period post-administration has been established for the observation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) to ensure participant safety. It is essential to maintain this standardized 28-day observation window for all enrolled groups to uphold the highest safety standards.

The secondary aims of this dose-escalation are to assess the biodistribution and shedding of the virus, the pharmacodynamic characteristics, immunogenicity, and the initial antitumor efficacy of the GC001 injection in patients suffering from advanced with recurrent or progressive gliomas.

Following the completion of the DLT assessment for all participants within each dose cohort, the SMC may decide whether to proceed with dose escalation, explore intermediate/higher doses, or terminate the dose escalation study based on the data obtained on safety, tolerability, biodistribution, and shedding of the virus (if any), pharmacodynamics (if any), immunogenicity (if any), and antitumor activity (if any). The SMC may also decide to adjust doses, administration schedules, and the time of biospecimen collection.

To further evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of GC001 Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus Injection in the treatment of patients with With recurrent or progressive gliomas during the dose-expansion phase.
