Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Older Women With Breast Cancer
This research trial studies phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation analysis in tissue samples from older patients with stage I breast cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with stage I breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Breast cancer-free interval for patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumors, baseline|Tumor size, baseline|Estrogen receptor status, baseline|Lymph node status, baseline|Treatment group associated with PIK3CA expression, baseline
Overall survival associated with PIK3CA, baseline|Breast cancer specific survival associated with PIK3CA expression, baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

To assess the relapse free-survival difference between patients with PIK3CA mutated and wild-type (WT) tumors and therefore validate PIK3CA mutation status as an important biomarker in women 70 years or older diagnosed with breast cancer.

OUTLINE:

Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via mutation analysis of PIK3CA.
