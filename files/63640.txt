Clinical Study of ICP-192 in Solid Tumors Patients
Open-label, non-randomized, Phase I/IIa, dose-escalating, dose-extension, first-in-man study.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ICP-192
Adverse events(Phase 1 dose escalation), Adverse events graded by CTCAE V5.0 as a measurement of the safety and tolerability profile of ICP-192, From the time a signed and dated ICF until 28 days after last dose of study drug|Objective Response Rate(ORR)(Phase 2a dose expansion), Objective response based on assessment of confirmed Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST)., At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)
Cmax, Single dose PK parameters include the peak plasma concentration (Cmax), At the end of Cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|AUC, Area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), At the end of Cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (tÂ½), will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin, At the end of Cycle 1(each cycle is 21 days)|Food effect, ICP-192 concentrations in plasma and urine after dosing in fed and fasted condition, Day 1 - 6 after single dose|Objective Response Rate(ORR) (Phase 1 dose escalation), Objective response based on assessment of confirmed Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST)., At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR based on assessment of confirmed Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease(SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST)., At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), Duration of objective response is time interval from the first date that criteria for complete response or partial response are met to the first date of progression of disease, At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is the time period from start of study medication till the disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)|Correlationship between FGFR aberrations with efficacy. (Phase 2a dose expansion), Correlationship between FGFR mutation/refusion with ORR, At the end of Cycle 4(each cycle is 21 days)
The study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period with 21 days of repeated treatment per cycle (duration treatment with ICP-192), and a follow-up period (28 days after last dose). The recruited patients receive a single dose on day 1, then after a 3-day washout period, repeated dosing will be followed. The starting dose is 2 mg, QD, and dose escalation will follow accelerated titration and modified 3+3 dose-finding schema. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period consisted of Cycle 0 (single dose and washout period) and Cycle 1 (21-day cycle).
