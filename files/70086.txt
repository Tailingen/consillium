UARK 2014-21 A Phase II Trial of Oncolytic Virotherapy by Systemic Administration of Edmonston Strain of Measles Virus
The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of MV-NIS (measles virus-sodium iodide symporter) therapy for people with relapsed/refractory myeloma when given with cyclophosphamide
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: MV-NIS
The Effectiveness of MV-NIS Therapy as Measured by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Guidelines, The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MV-NIS therapy for people with relapsed/refractory myeloma when given with cyclophosphamide, 1 year
The drug used in this trial is a modified version of the measles virus used to vaccinate children. The virus has been altered by having an extra gene (piece of DNA) added to it to allow a protein called NIS to be inserted into it. NIS is normally found in the thyroid gland ( a small gland in the neck) and helps the body concentrate iodine. Having this additional gene will make it possible to track where the virus goes in the body.
