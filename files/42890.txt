Phase II Study of Erlotinib With Concurrent Radiotherapy in Unresectable NSCLC With Activating Mutation of EGFR in Exon 19 or 21
Erlotinib with concurrent radiotherapy has superior efficacy and comparable safety profile in unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in exon 19 or 21 versus etoposide plus cis-platin with concurrent radiotherapy.
