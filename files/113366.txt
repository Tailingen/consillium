To Assess Safety and Effect of Olaparib on the Pharmacokinetics of Anastrozole, Letrozole & Tamoxifen, and Their Effect on Olaparib, in Patients With Advanced Solid Cancer
This is an open-label 2-part Phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A of the study (mandatory) will assess the effect of olaparib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of anastrozole, letrozole and tamoxifen and vice versa; Part B will allow patients (if eligible) continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.
