A Study of XZP-3621 in Chinese Patients With ALK Positive NSCLC
This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ALK inhibitor XZP-3621 when used as single agent in patients with ALK-rearranged stage IIIB, IIIC or IV NSCLC previously treated with other ALK inhibitors or non-previously treated.
ALK-positive NSCLC
DRUG: XZP-3621
Overall Response Rate(ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as evaluated by investigator assessment per RECIST 1.1.CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions., From Cycle 1 Day 1 to documented progression of disease by Investigator (up to 20 months)[Note:Each cycle is 28 days]..
Progression-Free Survival(PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in months) from first dose to the first documentation of disease progression, as Determined by Investigator Using RECISTv1.1., or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From Cycle1 Day1 to the date of the first documented disease progression(up to overall period of approximately 20 months)[Note:Each cycle is 28 days]..|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from date of first dose to date of death due to any cause,as Determined by the investigator Using RECISTv1.1., From Cycle 1 Day 1 until death (up to approximately 20 months)[Note:Each cycle is 28 days]..|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR defined as the time from date of first documented CR or PR to date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause,whichever occurred first., From first documentation of CR or PR to documented progression of disease by Investigator( up to approximately 20 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)., Baseline, Week 8, thereafter every 8 weeks until disease progression, death or withdrawal from the study (up to overall period of approximately 20 months)|Intracranial Objective Response Rate(IC-ORR), Intracranial objective response rate(IC-ORR) was defined as the same as ORR (defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1 relative to the total participants in the analysis population), but limited to Intra Cranial lesions only on participants with central nervous system metastases., From Cycle 1 Day 1 to documented progression of disease by Investigator (up to 20 months).|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of XZP-3621 and Its Metabolite, AUC was collected for both XZP-3621 and its major metabolite, and was based on their concentrations in plasma over time., Predose and 4 hours post dose on Day 1 of Cycle1;Predose on Day15 of Cycle1; Predose on Day1 of Cycle2,Cycle3 and Cycle4(each cycle is 28 days);|Maximum Plasma Concentration Observed (Cmax) of XZP-3621 and Its Metabolite, Cmax was collected for both XZP-3621 and its major metabolite, and was based on their concentrations in plasma over time., Predose and 4 hours post dose on Day 1 of Cycle1;Predose on Day15 of Cycle1; Predose on Day1 of Cycle2,Cycle3 and Cycle4(each cycle is 28 days);|Percentage of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Percentage of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product., From Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) through and including at least 30 days after the last administration of the investigational product, up to 23 months(each cycle is 28 days).
This is a Phase 2, China only, multi center, open label, three cohorts study, in ALK positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients will be enrolled to receive XZP-3621 monotherapy.

(in Cohort 1) Treatment-Naive with any ALK inhibitor. (in Cohort 2) Disease progression after crizotinib as the only ALK inhibitor. (in Cohort 3) Disease progression after other ALK inhibitors,including or not including crizotinib previously treated.

The patients will receive XZP-3621 at 500 mg orally once daily (QD), taken with food.Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. After disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1), patients should discontinue the study medication. After disease progression, patients will be treated at the discretion of the investigator according to local practice. Information regarding the nature and the duration of subsequent therapies will be collected.
