ISPY-P1.01:Evaluating the Safety of Weekly Paclitaxel With Trastuzumab Duocarmazine (SYD985) in Patients With Metastatic Cancer
This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site phase I/Ib trial with SYD985, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER2 on the cell membrane, combined with paclitaxel.

Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 5.0), To determine safety and tolerability of the weekly paclitaxel with tri-weekly trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985) combination in patients with certain advanced solid tumors

Toxicity, incidence and grade, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), up to 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) at 6 months, To obtain Preliminary efficacy data of the weekly paclitaxel with tri-weekly trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985) combination in patients with certain advanced solid tumors

Outcome measure: RECIST 1.1, up to 6 months|Overall response rate (ORR), To obtain Preliminary efficacy data of the weekly paclitaxel with tri-weekly trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985) combination in patients with certain advanced solid tumors

Outcome measure: RECIST 1.1, up to 6 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients treated with the weekly paclitaxel with tri-weekly trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985) combination, Endpoint: PFS

RECIST 1.1, up to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR) of patients treated with the weekly paclitaxel with tri-weekly trastuzumab duocarmazine (SYD985) combination, Endpoints: Duration of response

Outcome measures:, up to 12 months
The study contains 2 cohorts. Cohort A is a 3+3 de-escalation cohort. Participants with certain HER-positive advanced solid tumors or HER2-low breast cancer will be enrolled in this cohort. Eligible participants will receive infusions of SYD985 every three weeks and of paclitaxel weekly. Participants will be monitored for safety and for the occurance of DLTs. Cohort B dose expansion will proceed at the identified dose from Cohort A (RP2D). Cohort B will only enroll patients with HER2-positive or HER2-low breast cancer.
