A Secondary Study Evaluating Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED)
Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) will be compared to the current gold standard for temporary CSF management in a hospital setting.

* Evaluate the number of subjects requiring to be switched to a standard of care EVD
* Evaluate subject transport while on the SED
* Evaluate SED system control from initiation of SED through discharge of external drain system

DEVICE: Smart External Drain - SED
The number of subjects which require switching to a standard of care external drain., Evaluating the number of subjects which require switching to a standard of care external drain versus the number of subjects which remain on the SED until study completion or discharge of the external drain., The study review and data collection period will begin at the time SED is connected to the ventriculostomy catheter until discharge of ventriculostomy catheter; when subject no longer requires an external drain, assessed up to 90 days.
Subject transport while on the SED system., Evaluating subject transport while on the SED system, specifically, the number of minutes a subject will require clamping of the drain while being transported., Subject transport review and data collection will begin when the patient is moved from their primary hospital bed location until they reach a new secondary location or are returned to the primary location. Assessed up to 90 days.|Evaluating SED system control throughout duration of study., SED system control will be evaluated from initiation of ICP management through discharge of the subject's external drain., The study review and data collection period will begin at the time SED is connected to the ventriculostomy catheter until discharge of ventriculostomy catheter; when subject no longer requires an external drain, assessed up to 90 days.
This clinical trial will evaluate Aqueduct's Smart External Drain (SED) upon implementation of ventriculostomy or lumbar drain placement for temporary CSF external management in a hospital setting. Subjects will remain on study from the time of SED application through discharge of the external drain or switch to standard of care extraventricular drain.
