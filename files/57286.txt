Nimotuzumab and Radiotherapy in Pediatric Patients With Glioma
The study consists in only one treatment group, which will receive the first-line therapy for the disease - standard radiotherapy and a 150 mg/m2 dose of the investigational product (nimotuzumab)
Diffuse Intrinsic Brainstem Gliomas
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: Nimotuzumab
Tumor Volume, A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used for measuring the tumor volume and it will be performed before the enrollment in the clinical study and every 12 weeks. The patient follow-up will be performed for 2 years after his/her inclusion in the investigation. The final evaluation will be performed 2 years after the inclusion of the last patient.

The main response variable will be the progression-free survival by 6 months., 6 months
General Purpose

1. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with nimotuzumab in combination with radiotherapy in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic of the brainstem glioma

Specific Purposes

1. To determine the efficacy regarding the event-free survival (EFS) rate by 6 months of treatment.
2. To determine the overall survival time of the patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic tumors of the cerebral trunk treated with combined radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.
3. To determine the antitumoral objective response of the patients treated with combined radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.
4. To determine the duration time of the response in the cases of objective response reached (CR or PR) or disease stabilization.
5. To assess the toxicity of the combination AcM h-R3-nimotuzumab and radiotherapy in the patients enrolled in the clinical study.
