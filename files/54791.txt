Study Evaluating CMP-001 in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, two part (Part A and Part B) clinical study of CMP-001 administered intratumorally (IT) and subcutaneously (SC) in combination with atezolizumab with or without radiation therapy in participants with NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: CMP-001|DRUG: Atezolizumab|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Part A and B: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs will be evaluated and assigned a grade using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., From first dose of CMP-001 (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last CMP-001 injection (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: DLT, First 30 days of therapy starting from Week 1 Day 1
Part A and B: Oral Temperature, Oral temperature should be measured in supine or seated position, following at least 3 minutes of rest., From screening up to end of treatment (EOT) (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Respiratory Rate, Respiratory rate should be measured in supine or seated position, following at least 3 minutes of rest., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Blood pressure should be measured in supine or seated position, following at least 3 minutes of rest., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Body Weight, Physical examination included body weight measurement., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Body Mass Index (BMI), Physical examination included BMI measurement., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters, ECG parameters will include heart rate and PR, QRS, QT, and QT corrected for heart rate (QTc) intervals. QT will be corrected using Fridericia's (QTcF) formula. ECG will be performed after the participant has been resting in supine or semi-supine position for at least 5 minutes., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Clinical laboratory parameters include serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis., From screening up to EOT (up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Concentration of Chemokine IP-10, Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, 8, and Day 2 of Weeks 3, 8|Part A and B: Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Percentage of Participants With Objective Response) as per RECIST V1.1 or iRECIST Using CT/PET or MRI Scans, ORR will be calculated as the number of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of participants dosed., Baseline until confirmed disease progression (CR or PR) or death, whichever occur first (assessment at every 9 weeks throughout the study from Week 1 Day 1, up to approximately 2 years 9 months|Part A and B: Time to Response (TTR) as per RECIST V1.1 or iRECIST Using CT/PET or MRI Scans, From first dose of CMP-001 until disease progression or death, whichever occur first (assessment at every 9 weeks throughout the study from Week 1 Day 1, up to approximately 2 years 9 months)|Part A and B: Duration of Response (DOR) as per RECIST V1.1 or iRECIST Using CT/PET or MRI Scans, From the date of first confirmed CR or PR until the first date of recurrent or progressive disease (assessment at every 9 weeks throughout the study from Week 1 Day 1, up to approximately 2 years 9 months)

This study will be conducted in two parts, run sequentially: Part A of the study will evaluate the safety and preliminary signs of efficacy for the combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab. Part B of the study will evaluate the addition of radiation therapy to the combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab.

Each part of the study will follow a Simon 2-stage Optimal Design approach. Part A and Part B of the study will commence with a safety run in of 5 participants treated with the combination treatment (CMP-001 and atezolizumab in Part A; and CMP-001, atezolizumab and radiation therapy in Part B). After the first 5 participants have passed a safety dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period of 30 days and upon approval from the Safety Review Committee (SRC), both parts of the study will continue with enrollment of an additional 7 participants in each part to complete Stage 1 of respective parts. If an acceptable safety profile is established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable participants (that is, complete and partial responders based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] version 1.1 \[v1.1\] or RECIST v1.1 for immune-based therapeutics \[iRECIST\] criteria) in Stage 1), the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable participants in Stage 2 of each part. A maximum of 35 evaluable participants will be enrolled in each Part A and Part B.

Participants enrolled in Part A with documented progression per RECIST v1.1 on the combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab have the option to receive radiation therapy add-on treatment after documented disease progression per computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The total number of participants enrolled into the Part A optional radiation therapy add-on may not exceed the total number of participants enrolled in Part A. Enrollment of participants in Part A optional radiation therapy add-on will not affect enrollment in Part B of the study as these participants will be evaluated separately.

Participants will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab as long as they do not experience unacceptable toxicities and when, according to the Investigator, continued treatment is in the participant's best interest.
