A Study to Evaluate Escalating Doses of ASP1235 (AGS62P1) Given as Monotherapy in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP1235 (AGS62P1) given at three dosing schedules (Schedule A, every three weeks \[Q3W\] or Schedule B, every other week of a 4 week cycle \[Q2W\] or Schedule C once a week for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle) in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In addition, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), the immunogenicity and the anti-leukemic activity of ASP1235 (AGS62P1).
