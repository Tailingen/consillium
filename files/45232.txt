Treatment of Bevacizumab Followed by Steroid in RN
Treatment of bevacizumab followed by steroid may have a better effect on patients with radiation-induced brain injury.This randomized trial aims to investigate whether treatment of bevacizumab followed by steroid may alleviate radiation-induced brain injury in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The effect will be compared with outcomes in patients receiving steroid therapy
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Adverse Effect of Radiation Therapy|Brain Injuries
DRUG: Bevacizumab and steroid|DRUG: Bevacizumab and placebo
Change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients, Change in MRI of radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients, Change form baseline to evaluation at 12 weeks
Change of neurologic function of patients after treatment, Change of neurologic function assessed using LENT/SOMA sacle of patients after treatment, Change from baseline to evaluation at 12 weks.|Change of quality of life of patients after treatment, Change of quality of life using QOL scale of patients after treatment, Change from baseline to evaluation at 12 weeks.
Radiation-induced brain injury is a severe complication of radiotherapy in patients with Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy. This study is a randomized, single blind clinical study. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether treatment of bevacizumab followed by steroid can alleviate radiation-induced brain injury in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to compare the treating effect between combination of bevacizumab and steroid and bevacizumab alone.
