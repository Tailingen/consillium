Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effect of DS-8201a on the QT/QTc Interval and Pharmacokinetics in HER2-Expressing Breast Cancer
This study will look at the effect on the QTc interval and pharmacokinetics after multiple dosing in subjects with HER2-expressing metastatic and/or unresectable breast cancer.
Malignant Neoplasm of Breast
DRUG: DS-8201a
Changes in QTcF After Treatment With DS-8201a in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, The number of participants with notable electrocardiogram changes meeting predefined criteria is being reported., Screening (within 7 days before enrollment) up to Cycle 3 Day 15 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) After Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Treatments With DS-8201a in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of DS-8201a and total anti-HER2 antibody was assessed., Cycles 1 and 3: Day 1: before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 2 hours, 4 hours, 7 hours; Days 2 and 4: 24 hours, 72 hours; Days 8 and 15; Cycle 2: Day 1 BI, EOI; Cycles 4, 6, and 8: Day 1 BI and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of MAAA-1181 After Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Treatments With DS-8201a in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of MAAA-1181 was assessed., Cycles 1 and 3: Day 1: before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 2 hours, 4 hours, 7 hours; Days 2 and 4: 24 hours, 72 hours; Days 8 and 15; Cycle 2: Day 1 BI, EOI; Cycles 4, 6, and 8: Day 1 BI and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameters Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve After Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Treatments With DS-8201a in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Area under the concentration versus-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) and during the dosing interval (AUCtau) of DS-8201a and total anti-HER2 antibody were assessed., Cycles 1 and 3: Day 1: before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 2 hours, 4 hours, 7 hours; Days 2 and 4: 24 hours, 72 hours; Days 8 and 15; Cycle 2: Day 1 BI, EOI; Cycles 4, 6, and 8: Day 1 BI and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameters Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve of MAAA-1181 After Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Treatments With DS-8201a in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Area under the concentration versus-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) and during the dosing interval (AUCtau) were assessed., Cycles 1 and 3: Day 1: before infusion (BI), end of infusion (EOI), 2 hours, 4 hours, 7 hours; Days 2 and 4: 24 hours, 72 hours; Days 8 and 15; Cycle 2: Day 1 BI, EOI; Cycles 4, 6, and 8: Day 1 BI and EOI (each cycle is 21 days)
Objective Response Rate Based on The Investigator's Assessment (Unconfirmed) Following DS-8201a Treatment in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as unconfirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 12 months post-dose|Objective Response Rate Based on The Investigator's Assessment (Unconfirmed) Following DS-8201a Treatment in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as unconfirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to 38 months post-dose|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Any Grade by System Organ Classes and Preferred Term Following DS-8201a Treatment in Participants With HER2-expressing Metastatic and/or Unresectable Breast Cancer, Adverse events (AEs) were to be coded using MedDRA Version 20.1 and assigned severity grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or seriousness after initiating the study drug until 47 days after last dose of study drug., Baseline up to withdrawal of consent, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 12 months post-dose
