A Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacokinetic Profile of HLX13 with YERVOY As a First-Line Treatment for Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled integrated phase I/III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of HLX13 and YERVOY® in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.

This study includes three treatment groups. Patients will be randomly assigned at a 2:1:1 ratio to the HLX13, US-sourced YERVOY®, or EU-sourced YERVOY® group to receive the treatment of IMPs in combination with nivolumab.

Patients with good tolerability and disease control will receive HLX13 or YERVOY® in combination with nivolumab on the first day of every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles. PK and immunogenicity blood sampling will be conducted during the treatment period. After the four treatment cycles, all subjects will be subsequently treated with nivolumab monotherapy until investigator-assessed disease progression, initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, withdrawal of informed consent, death, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 1 year after randomization, whichever occurs first.
