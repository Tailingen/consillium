ACS-NSQIP Calculator for Liver Surgery
The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's (ACS-NSQIP) calculator has been endorsed by the surgeons' community to counsel patients and relatives regarding estimated postoperative complications. However, it does not include organ-specific risks. The aim of this study was to assess the ACS-NSQIP calculator's ability to predict complications, mortality and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for liver tumors

PROCEDURE: Liver resection
ACS-NSQIP calculator's ability, The primary study endpoint was to assess the ACS-NSQIP calculator's ability to predict complications, mortality and length of stay in patients undergoing hepatectomy for liver tumors, From the date of surgery up to three months from the date of surgery
This is an observational retrospective study conducted in a tertiary-referral university hospital. An established classification of complications, including post-hepatectomy insufficiency and bile leak, was adopted. The endpoint was the rate of complications, mortality and LOS as expected by the ACS-NSQIP calculator and as observed within 90-day after surgery.
