A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Carboplatin+Paclitaxel-albumin in Subjects With Resectable NSCLC
This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, prospective, single-center phase II clinical study. Target population is patients with stage II and IIIA resectable non-small cell lung cancer who had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to evaluate the major pathologic response of SHR-1210 + carboplatin + paclitaxel-albumin in subjects with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody.
Lung Cancer Stage II|PD-1 Antibody|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: Carboplatin and Paclitaxel-albumin
Major pathologic response, It is defined as residual tumors less than 10% after neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 3.5 months
Objective Response Rate, It is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink to a predetermined size and maintain a minimum time limit. It includes the cases of CR and PR., 6.5 months|Pathological complete response, No histologic evidence of malignancy or only the ingredients of carcinoma in situ was found in primary tumors., 3.5 months
In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept study treatment. Subjects who randomized into control will have the opportunity to receive the treatment of carboplatin + paclitaxel-albumin therapy after confirmed disease progression. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be 2.
