DC Vaccine Therapy Combined With Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell in Treating Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate in combination with Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell (CIK) can induce a measurable immune response in patients with renal cell carcinoma, and to evaluate the clinical effect of the regimen.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: DC-CIK|DRUG: IL-2/IFN-α
Objective tumor response (complete and partial response), Time to recurrence (TTR), Progression-free(PFS) and overall survival(OS) as measured by RECIST criteria., every 3 months
Immunity as measured by T-cell functionality (immuknow assay )to the tumor. Safety as measured by NCI common toxicity table （CTC） at completion of study., at screening, baseline, weeks 4 , 12 and years 1 after first vaccination, and at completion of study treatment
The purpose of this study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate in combination with Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell (CIK) can induce a measurable immune response in patients with renal cell carcinoma, and to evaluate the clinical effect of the regime.

Primary

1. Determine the clinical responses(objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival) in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) in combination with Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell (CIK).

Secondary

1. Determine cellular immune response response in terms of immuknow assay, and correlate immune response with objective clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.
2. Determine safety of multiple administrations of this regimens in these patients.
