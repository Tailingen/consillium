Quality of Life After Esophagectomy for Cancer - Step 2
Background: A recent systematic review showed that patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer had scores of physical function, vitality and performance of health in general significantly lower than those obtained from the reference population. The analysis of the quality of life at six months follow-up showed that the total score and physical function were better before surgery and symptoms-based scales indicated that the fatigue, dyspnoea and diarrhea were worse six months after esophagectomy. The objective of this study is therefore to assess the impact of esophageal resections for cancer on the quality of life of patients and to improve it through simple interventions of post operative care.

The study is divided into two steps.

This is step 2.

At hospital discharge, patients will be randomized into 4 groups receiving respectively: nutritional and respirology counseling; nutritional counseling alone; respirology counseling alone; standard care. All the patients fill in the questionnaires QLQ C30, OES18, INPAT32 at 1 and 3 months after the surgical operation. Primary end-points are the items DY (dyspnoea), AP (appetite loss) and QL2 of QLQ C30. Secondary end point is the item EA (eating) of OES18.
