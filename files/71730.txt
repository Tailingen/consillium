A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine (Called PF-07220060 in Combination With PF-07104091) In Participants With Breast Cancer and Solid Tumors
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine (called PF-07220060 and PF-07104091) in people with breast cancer. This clinical study consists of 2 parts (part 1 and part 2). In part 1, we are seeking participants who:

* Have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer (BC) of either types:
* Have HR+, HER2- BC
* Refractory HR-positive/HER2-positive BC
* Have other solid tumors other than BC

In part 2, we are seeking participants who:

-Have HR-positive/HER2-negative BC Part 1 will include increasing doses of PF-07220060 with PF-07104091. In part 2, participants will take 1 of 2 study medicine combinations. This will help us decide the highest amount of study medicines that can be safety given to people. All participants in this study will receive PF-07220060 with PF-07104091 by mouth. We will compare participant experiences to help us determine if PF-07220060 with PF-07104091 is safe and effective. Participants will take part in this study for about 2 years. During this time, they will receive the study medicine, an x-ray imaging, and will be observed for safety and effects of the study medicines.
