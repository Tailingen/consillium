Barbed Suture in Single-port Laparoscopic Myomectomy
The aim of this study is to test our hypothesis that the use of unidirectional knotless barbed suture in single-port laparoscopic myomectomy could facilitate the suture of uterine wall defect after myoma enucleation as multi-port laparoscopic myomectomy did.
Uterine Myoma
PROCEDURE: Single-port laparoscopic myomectomy|PROCEDURE: Multi-port laparoscopic myomectomy
Suturing time, the time duration for the suture of uterine wall defect after myoma enucleation during laparoscopic myomectomy, Intra-operative
Cosmetic satisfaction, We will compare patient's cosmetic satisfaction through self-reported questionnaire (Body image Questionnaire)., Post-surgery 1 month and 3 month
The investigators plan to perform a multi-center randomized clinical trial on women scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy. All women will get the same preoperative and postoperative care. Women will be assigned by chance to one of two groups: one group will receive single-port laparoscopic myomectomy using V-Loc™ suture material (study group). The other group will receive conventional multi-port laparoscopic myomectomy using V-Loc™ suture material (control group). The investigators will collect information on suturing time and complications related to surgery.
