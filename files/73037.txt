uPAR-PET for Prognostication in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma and Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung
uPAR PET/CT as a prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma|Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Lung
OTHER: 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/CT
Study Ia: Overall survival (OS), Study Ia: OS is evaluated after clinical follow-up for 18 months (stage IV disease)|Study Ib: Overall survival (OS), Study Ib: OS is evaluated after clinical follow-up for 60 months (operable disease)|Study II and III: Uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in primary tumor lesion (dichotomized +/-), Study II and III: Uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is evaluated based on PET/CT scans performed within 1 hour post injection of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105
Study Ia: Progression free survival (PFS), Study Ia: PFS is evaluated after clinical follow-up for 18 months (stage IV disease)|Study Ib: Disease free survival (DFS), Study Ib: DFS is evaluated after clinical follow-up for 60 months (operable disease)
Study I: uPAR PET/CT with 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 will be evaluated as a prognostic tool in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage IV (Ia) operable disease (Ib)) by observer-blinded readings and compared to the prognostic performance of FDG PET/CT and prognostic biomarkers as uPAR.

Furthermore, uPAR PET/CT will be evaluated in a pilot study in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (Study II) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC) (Study III) and correlated with immunohistochemical uPAR expression.
