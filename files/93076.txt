Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Tilelizumab in Stage III（cTNM-IIIA.IIIB）Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
This is a prospective, one-arm, phase II study aimed at evaluating tislelizumab combined with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment, supplemented with tislelizumab after surgery in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Stage III|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: tislelizumab
Rate of radical resection (R0), In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set, the rate of radical resection (R0) is evaluated by the investigator, which is the number of people who can undergo R0 resection after the evaluation criteria established by the MDT team divided by the total number of enrolled groups, 2 weeks after neoadvant
PFS, The investigator evaluated the 24-month PFS to evaluate tislelizumab combined with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment, and tislelizumab was added as an adjuvant treatment, up to 24-month
Biomarker level of PD-L1, A PDL1 test measures the amount of PDL1 protein on cancer cells, 2 weeks after surgery|Biomarker count of CD8+T cell, 2 weeks after surgery
The study included a screening period, a treatment period (including neoadjuvant treatment, surgery and postoperative adjuvant treatment), and a survival follow-up period.

Patients who meet the admission criteria will receive the following treatments according to disease stage (IIIA/IIIB) and histology (squamous or non-squamous) Tilelizumab + platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy, every 3 weeks as a cycle , for 2 cycles, followed by surgical resection, and postoperative adjuvant Tilelizumab + platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy 2cycles,every 3 weeks as a cycle, and Tilelizumab every 3 weeks up to 15cycles maintenance treatment.

The rate of radical resection (R0) was evaluated through the research center of the investigator, which is expected to be 20% higher compared with historical controls, and the effectiveness of tislelizumab combined with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment was evaluated.
