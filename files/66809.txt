Phase 1b: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Maximum Tolerated Dose, defined as the dose level below which dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is manifested in â‰¥33% of the patients or at dose level 3 if DLT is manifested in \<33% of the patients., Up to 12 months|Phase 2: Complete Response (CR) Rate, Complete Response Rate as defined by the 2006 International Working Group (IWG) criteria., Up to 12 months
Phase 2: Duration of Response, Duration of response defined as the time between achieving response and progression of disease., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS:The length of time from the start of treatment until death by any cause., Up to 24 months|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate, Proportion of participants achieving hematological improvement (HI), partial response (PR), complete response (CR), and/or marrow CR (mCR) by the IWG 2006 criteria., Up to 24 months
Participants will be treated for a total of 6 cycles. For participants responding or who have stable disease following cycle 6, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:

* Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
* Unacceptable adverse event(s),
* Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or
* General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.
* Evidence of disease progression by the International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria.

Participants who wish not to continue treatment at time of disease assessment at end of cycle 6 will complete their end of treatment visit upon completion of cycle 6.
