Safety Study of Itacitinib (INCB039110) in Combination With Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
Test the hypothesis that itacitinib (INCB039110) can be administered safely in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic cancer.
Solid Tumors|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: itacitinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: filgrastim
Safety and tolerability of combination therapy study treatment itacitinib (INCB039110) plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as measured by the number of participants with adverse events, Baseline and weekly for Cycle 1 and then Day 1, Week 8 and Week 15 for all subsequent cycles until the End of Treatment visit (approximately 6 months).|Identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Pharmacologically Active Dose (PAD) within a defined dose range for itacitinib (INCB039110) in the treatment regimens administered, Each cohort will be observed for a minimum of 28 days.
Pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and paclitaxel administered with or without concurrent itacitinib (INCB039110), Baseline up to 6 months.|Clinical activity as measured by the greatest decrease in tumor burden compared to baseline., Baseline and approximately every two cycles throughout the study until study completion or early termination (approximately 6 months).
Study Part 1: This is a dose optimization phase designed to find a tolerated regimen that includes identifying the MTD of itacitinib (INCB039110) (within a defined pharmacologic range) in combination with doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel that have established safety and tolerability in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Study Part 2 and Part 2A: This phase will explore the safety and tolerability of the MTD or PAD of itacitinib (INCB039110) when administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with untreated advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
