SARC029: Trametinib and Pazopanib in Patients With GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor)
This study evaluates the combination of trametinib and pazopanib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Pazopanib|DRUG: Trametinib
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to study treatment, 16 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Date of first dose of drug to date of imaging demonstrating disease progression., Up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from first date of drug administration to date of death from any cause, up to 10 years|Number and type of adverse events, up to 2 years
Trametinib and pazopanib are independently approved for other cancers. Both drugs work to inhibit tumor development in different ways. Combining these drugs may lead to improved disease control. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of both drugs on advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
