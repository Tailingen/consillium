A Study of Atezolizumab as First-line Monotherapy for Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This was a Phase II, open-label, prospective, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent atezolizumab as a first-line therapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the primary biomarker objective was to measure blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB) and evaluate whether it can predict for improved clinical outcome with atezolizumab.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as Determined by Investigator, Investigator-assessed objective response rate was defined as the proportion of participants who had a confirmed best overall response of either PR or CR per RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to 32 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST v1.1 as Determined by Investigator, by Positive Versus Negative bTMB Groups, Investigator-assessed PFS by RECIST v1.1 was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of PD or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 32 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST v1.1 as Determined by Investigator, Investigator-assessed PFS by RECIST v1.1 was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of PD or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 32 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST v1.1 as Determined by Investigator, Investigator-assessed DOR by RECIST v1.1 was defined as the time from initial occurrence of documented CR or PR until documented disease progression as determined by the investigator, or death, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 32 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per RECIST v1.1 as Determined by Investigator, Confirmed disease control rate (cDCR) was defined as the rate of patients with CR or PR as the best response, or SD maintained for 24 weeks, per RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to 32 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of death from any cause during the study., From baseline until death (up to 32 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered atezolizumab, regardless of causal attribution., Baseline up to 32 months|Percentage of Participants Who Are Alive and Progression-Free (Per RECIST v1.1) at 6, 9, 12, and 18 Months by Various bTMB Quantiles, A summary of the number of patients at risk and survival rate for the time points of 6, 9, 12, and 18 months., Months 6, 9, 12, and 18|OS by Various bTMB Cutoff Points 16 and 20, OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of death from any cause during the study., From baseline until death (up to 32 months)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (Per RECIST v1.1) by Various bTMB Quantiles, Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of participants who had a confirmed best overall response of either PR or CR per RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to 32 months
