Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma
The study is aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of re-irradiation for patients with recurrent high grade gliomas after other treatment.
Recurrent High Grade Glioma
RADIATION: IMRT with or without radiosensitive therapy|DRUG: Radiosensitive therapy
Progression free of participants, 4 years|Overall survival of participants, 4 years
Incidence of radionecrosis, 3 months|Questionnaire assessment of neurocognitive function, 6 months
Investigators designed this study of a re-irradiation with single radiosurgery or hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without temozolomide.

Objective of the study is evaluating efficacy and safety of re-irradiation for patients with recurrent high grade gliomas after other treatment.
