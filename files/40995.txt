A Study of Circulating Endothelial Cell as Marker for Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Docetaxel Plus Xeloda (Capecitabine) as First Line Treatment for Patients With Locally Recurrent and Metastatic Breast Cancer
This single arm study will evaluate the correlation between circulating endothelial cell levels and treatment efficacy in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer given first line treatment with Avastin in combination with docetaxel + Xeloda.Patients will be treated with docetaxel 60mg/m2 iv on day 1, and Xeloda 900mg/m2 po on days 1-14, of each 3 week cycle, plus Avastin 7.5 mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week cycle. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is \<100 individuals.
