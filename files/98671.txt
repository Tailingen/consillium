A Multiple Ascending Dose Study of MEDI7247 in Patients With Selected Relapsed/Refractory Hematological Malignancies
To assess safety and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose (maximum administered dose) in the absence of establishing the MTD, and a recommended dose for further evaluation of MEDI7247 in patients with selected hematological malignancies who have relapsed after, or are refractory to prior standard therapy, and for whom there is no standard salvage regimen available.
