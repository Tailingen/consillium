Validation of ClarityDX Prostate as a Reflex Test to Refine the Prediction of Clinically-significant Prostate Cancer
This study is designed to determine the accuracy of blood test ClarityDX Prostate to predict the results of prostate biopsies in men who have PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) greater or equal to 3 ng/mL.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood test: ClarityDX Prostate
Diagnostic Clinical Performance: prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer at biopsy, Training Phase: Processed clinical features of each patient will be analyzed using machine learning to predict clinically significant prostate cancer, with the output being the ClarityDX Prostate Risk Score.

Validation Phase: The models created during the Training Phase will be locked down and then used to determine the probability of approximately 1,400 patients in the investigational Validation Phase having clinically significant prostate cancer., 3 years|Active Surveillance: prediction of Gleason Grade Group on confirmatory/follow-up biopsies for participants on Active Surveillance, 4 years|MRI: prediction of PI-RADS pre-diagnostic biopsy, 4 years
The main objective of this study is to validate ClarityDX Prostate as a reflex test to PSA to refine the prediction of clinically-significant prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of men to be recruited in North America when they are scheduled for a biopsy as a result of on an elevated PSA or other suspicion of prostate cancer and in retrospective databases from selected sites in the United States of America and the world.

This prospective training and validation cohort study will consist of up to 2,800 consenting men from Alberta in addition to up to 5,000 men from external institutions, between ages 40-75 (inclusive) years old, without prior diagnosis of prostate cancer, who have been selected to undergo a prostate biopsy to rule out prostate cancer.
