Brentuximab Vedotin for Newly Diagnosed CHL in Chinese CAYA Based on PET/CT Assessment
Generally, pediatric patients tolerate acute toxicities but are vulnerable to late effects. Thus, increasing chemotherapy intensity to achieve more rapid complete early response to limit radiation therapy is worth testing. In this CCCG-HL-2024 study, Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) was used to replace VCR and bleomycin in the ABVE-PC regimen in the previous CCCG-HD-2018 study, respectively, to form a Bv-AEPC regimen for the treatment of newly diagnosed classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in children, adolescents and young adults. On the premise of maintaining a 4-year event free survival (EFS)\>90% in the low-, intermediate-and high-risk groups, increase the early assessment complete response rate (the overall early complete response rate increased by 20%, that is, from 54.0% to 74.0%) to further reduce the proportion of children receiving radiotherapy to benefit them.

In this CCCG-HL-2024 study, Brentuximab vedotin (Bv) was used to replace VCR and bleomycin in the ABVE-PC regimen in the previous CCCG-HD-2018 study, respectively, to form a Bv-AEPC regimen for the treatment of newly diagnosed classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in children, adolescents and young adults. Bv is currently the most widely used "new drug" in childhood cHL.

For patients in the intermediate/high-risk group who did not achieve metabolic complete remission rate (CMR) at the early assessment based on PET/CT results, an intensive regimen of Bv-Dac-APC (Bv-APC plus dacarbazine) was applied for 2 or 3 courses to further improve event-free survival without increasing long-term reproductive toxicity.

For patients in the intermediate/high-risk group who did not achieve CMR after the Bv-Dac-AEPC regimen, a modified Check Mate 744 regimen (PD-1 monoclonal antibody, Bv,+/-bedamostine, autologous stem cell transplantation/radiotherapy) was applied to improve the CMR of patients before irradiation, hoping to reduce the primary treatment failure rate to almost zero.
