This study is a prospective, multicenter, exploratory clinical trial. It involves patients with resectable locally advanced thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by histopathology or cytology. The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 cycles versus 4 cycles of Adebrelimab combined with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for these patients.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the 2-cycle group or the 4-cycle group. The primary endpoint is pathological complete response (pCR), with a planned enrollment of 80 patients.

The study consists of a screening period (from the signing of the informed consent form to the first administration of the drug, not exceeding 21 days), a treatment period (including neoadjuvant therapy and surgery), and a follow-up period (including safety follow-up, tumor progression/recurrence follow-up, and survival follow-up).
