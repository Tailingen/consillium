Preoperative Therapy With Oxaliplatin/Docetaxel/Capecitabine and Radiation in Resectable Esophagus Cancer
In this phase I/II trial, we will evaluate a novel combination of chemotherapy, used concurrently with radiation therapy, in the preoperative therapy of locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. In the brief phase I portion of this trial, we will determine whether 2 drugs (docetaxel/oxaliplatin) or 3 drugs (docetaxel/oxaliplatin/capecitabine) can be used concurrently with radiation therapy. If the 3-drug regimen is tolerated, the phase II portion will proceed with this regimen. If the 3-drug combination is considered too toxic, the phase II study will proceed with docetaxel/oxaliplatin in combination with radiation therapy.
Esophagus Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Radiation therapy
Pathologic Complete Response Rate (PCRR), the Percentage of Patients Who Have No Evidence of Cancer in Their Surgical Specimen Following Surgery, The absence of any residual tumor cells in a histologic evaluation of a tumor specimen following surgery is defined as a complete pathologic response, 18 months
Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Defined as the interval between the start date of treatment and the date of occurrence of progressive disease or death from any cause., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Length of time, in months, that patients were alive from their first date of protocol treatment until death., 36 months
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

Oxaliplatin + Docetaxel + Capecitabine + Radiation therapy

If the three-drug chemotherapy regimen, with radiation therapy, is tolerable, this regimen will be taken forward into the phase II portion of the trial. If the three-drug regimen is too toxic, the phase II portion will proceed with the two-drug regimen Oxaliplatin + Docetaxel + Radiation therapy
