Study of BTK Inhibitor Zanubrutinib in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Non-GCB Type Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
Screening (up to 28 days); daily treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or study termination from sponsor; treatment (up to 2 years), safety follow-up (30 days); survival follow-up until data cutoff for final analysis.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) as determined by investigator according to the 2014 modification of the International Working Group (IWG) in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) Criteria., Up to approximately 23 months
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from first dose of zanubrutinib until first documentation of progression (by IWG on NHL criteria) or death, whichever occurred first., Up to 3 years and 2 months|Duration Of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the date that the response criteria were first met to the date that progressive disease was objectively documented or death, whichever occurred first. Duration of response was summarized for responders (with a best overall response of CR or PR) only., Up to 3 years and 2 months|Time To Response, Time to response was defined as the time from the first dose of zanubrutinib to the documentation of first response. Time to response was summarized for responders (with a best overall response of CR or PR) only., Up to 3 years and 2 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the date of first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation (Safety Follow-up Visit) or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first., From the time of informed consent to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately Up to 3 years and 2 months)
Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from first dose of zanubrutinib until death due to any cause., Up to 3 years and 2 months
This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability of BGB-3111 (zanubrutinib) in participants with relapsed/refractory non-germinal center B-cell (GCB) type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The study will enroll approximately 40 participants treated with zanubrutinib (160 milligrams \[mg\]) twice daily (BID). All participants in the study were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or the study was terminated by the sponsor for final analysis. At the time of final analysis, participants who remained on treatment were considered for participation in the extension study when eligible. A treatment cycle consisted of 28 days.
