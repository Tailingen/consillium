Autologous CD22 CAR T Cells in Adults w/ Recurrent or Refractory B Cell Malignancies
The primary purpose of this study is to test whether CD22-CAR T cells can be successfully made from immune cells collected from adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma).
B-ALL|B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|DLBCL|Follicular Lymphoma Grade 3B
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: CD22 CAR
Rate of successful manufacture of CD22 CAR T cells, The percentage of apheresis samples (fresh or frozen) that are successfully processed and expanded to manufacture CD22 CAR T cells will be determined for each dose cohort., 7-11 days from start of manufacturing|MTD/RP2D of CD22-CAR T cells in subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL, Incidence and severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy preparative regimen and infusion of CD22 CAR T cells, as recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, at each dose level tested in subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL, 28 days after infusion of CD22 CAR T cells|Safety evaluation of CD22-CAR T cells in subjects with ALL, Incidence and severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy preparative regimen and infusion of CD22 CAR T cells, as recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, at each dose level tested in subjects with ALL, 2 years after infusion of CD22-CAR T cells
Clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory CD22-expressing B-cell ALL at target dose, Clinical activity will be assessed by modified International Working Group response criteria for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Results will be reported as best response (i.e. complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease )SD), or progressive disease \[PR\]) at Day 28 for adult subjects with ALL treated at the target dose., 28 months after infusion of CD22-CAR T cells|Clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL at MTD/RP2D, Clinical activity will be assessed by Lugano response criteria for lymphoma (see Appendix 13.3.2). Results will be reported as best response (i.e. complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], or progressive disease \[PR\]) at Month 3 for adult aggressive B-cell NHL subjects treated at MTD/RP2D., 3 months after infusion of CD22-CAR T cells
Primary Objective:

* Determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD22 CAR T cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS ProdigyÂ® system for administration to adults with relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing B-cell ALL or relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).
* Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD22 CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.
* Determine the safety of an established dose of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing B-cell ALL and the safety of the MTD/RP2D of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

Secondary Objective:

- Assess the clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell ALL and R/R aggressive B-cell NHL, including overall survival (OS) and progressive free survival (PFS).
