Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS. In this method, every participant had a follow-up time which was associated with an indicator, 1=event (death in our case), and 0 =censored. If the participants were not known to have died, time to date of last known to be alive was used as to calculate the follow-up time and indicator was 0 for these participants. KM method estimates the median OS based on the K-M curve. The K-M curve only drops when we had an event and censor data are the ticks in the graph. To estimate median OS, the K-M curve usually will be smoothed first and a line will be drawn at 50%. The median OS is the point when K-M curve and the horizontal hit. Survival status was collected every month for the first 2 months after discontinuation of study treatment and thereafter every 2 months until death or 4 years from time of randomization for each participant., Randomization to Follow-up (4 years)

Treatment Emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication and occurred within 28 days post last dose. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE., 4 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs at Phase 1B (Treatment-related), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily had a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.
