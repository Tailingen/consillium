Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cell Therapy for R/R Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are limitations of CAR-T cells, the consuming manufacturing time and expensive price exclude the majority of patients. therefore, we designed this trial to manifest the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR NK cell therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
