A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Phase III Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of HLX10 + Chemotherapy (Carboplatin- Etoposide) in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)
This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of HLX10+ Chemotherapy vs placebo+Chemotherapy in Previously Untreated Patients with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

Eligible subjects in this study will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B at 2:1 ratio as follows:

Arm A (HLX10 arm): HLX10 + chemotherapy (Carboplatin-Etoposide) ; Arm B (placebo arm): Placebo + chemotherapy (Carboplatin-Etoposide); The three stratification factors for randomization include: PD-L1 expression level (negative, positive, not available), Brain metastasis (yes versus no), Age (≥ 65 years versus \< 65 years)
Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: HLX10|DRUG: carboplatin and etoposide|DRUG: placebo
OS, Overall survival (OS), A period from randomization through death regardless of causality (approximately up to 24 months).
