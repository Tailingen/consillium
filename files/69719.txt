A Study to Determine the Activity of Robatumumab (SCH 717454, MK-7454) in Participants With Relapsed or Recurrent Colorectal Cancer (P04721, MK-7454-003)
The purpose of this study was to determine the activity of two doses of robatumumab (SCH 717454, MK-7454) in participants with relapsed or recurrent colorectal cancer.

The primary study hypothesis was that decreases in Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-assessed tumor glucose metabolism (i.e., fluorodeoxyglucose \[FDG\] standardized uptake value \[SUV\]) following administration of 10 mg/kg robatumumab will exceed those following administration of 0.3 mg/kg robatumumab in participants with relapsed or recurrent colorectal cancer who had progressed after first-line chemotherapy.

Investigator choices of standard chemotherapy: irinotecan as a single agent +/- cetuximab OR capecitabine as a single agent, OR FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium \[folinic acid\]\[FOL\] + fluorouracil \[F\] + oxaliplatin \[OX\]) OR CAPEO(capecitabine \[CAPE\] or XelodaÂ® \[XEL\] + oxaliplatin \[OX\]) OR FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium \[folinic acid\]\[FOL\] + fluorouracil \[F\] + irinotecan \[IRI\]) +/- cetuximab OR cetuximab as a single agent.

Number of Participants With a >20% Decrease in Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Assessed Tumor Glucose Metabolism: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) in the Target Lesion, FDG-PET was used in this study to detect the biological activity of modulation of the target within the tumor. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 was used to select the target lesion. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs were identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at Baseline. The changes in SUVmax were calculated using the formula: (endpoint SUVmax - baseline SUVmax)/baseline SUVmax as a percentage. If multiple lesions had been measured at a visit, percentages calculated for all target lesions were averaged to find the decrease during the treatment period per participant. FDG SUVmax responder was defined as participants with \>20% decrease in SUVmax after the first cycle of robatumumab in Period 2., After the first robatumumab dose in Period 2 (Up to approximately 4 weeks after first robatumumab dose in Period 1)
Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 22 weeks)|Best Overall Tumor Response Per Investigator Review, Tumor response was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using RECIST v 1.0 criteria at Screening, at every 8 weeks of robatumumab treatment during Period 2 and at post study. A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions was calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. Overall tumor responses were defined as: Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or Stable Disease (SD) - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 22 weeks)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions., Up to last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 18 weeks)|Best Overall Tumor Response Per Central Review, Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI scan using RECIST v1.0 criteria at Screening, at every 8 weeks of robatumumab treatment during Period 2 and at post study. A sum of the LD for all target lesions was calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. Overall tumor responses were defined as: Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or Stable Disease (SD) - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 22 weeks)|Change From Baseline in Tumor Growth Rate, Tumor growth rate was assessed by CT or MRI scans using RECIST criteria at Screening, at every 8 weeks of robatumumab treatment and at post study. For Pre Baseline 1, tumor growth rate=(sum of longest diameter of target lesions at Baseline - the most recent prior to Baseline)/duration between Baseline and Pre Baseline. For all other cycles, tumor growth rate=(sum of longest diameter of target lesions at a cycle - Baseline)/ duration between Baseline and the cycle. The cycles presented below are relative to the first dose of robatumumab in Period 1., Baseline and up to approximately 22 weeks
Standard chemotherapy was used as a positive validation arm. Randomization was performed so that there could be no bias in the selection of participants for enrollment into the fixed-sequence arms. Once three chemotherapy-treated participants demonstrated decreases in FDG-PET SUV in the target lesion (i.e., \>20% decrease in SUVmax in the defined target lesion) in the PET/computed tomography (CT) scan performed following Cycle 1 Period 1 treatment, it was concluded that this positive validation arm had accomplished its purpose, and all subsequent participants enrolled in the study were assigned treatment with robatumumab for Period 1. There was no intention to compare the data in either period across participants who received chemotherapy with those who received robatumumab.
