A Study of D3S 001 Monotherapy or Combination Therapy in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors With a KRAS p.G12C Mutation
This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of D3S-001 or combination therapy in subjects with advanced KRAS p.G12C mutant solid tumors. D3S-001 will be taken daily by oral administration in 21-day treatment cycles.
