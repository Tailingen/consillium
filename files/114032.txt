Efficacy and Safety of Combination Therapy With Bojungikki-tang and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with Bojungikki-tang(BJIKT) and pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 positive with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

Based on prior pre-clinical studies, the combination of Bojungikki-tang and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can be expected to improve survival and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ICIs by modulating the systemic tumor-immune environment.

Therefore, this clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of the combined therapy with BJIKT and pembrolizumab and establish clinical evidence for an integrative cancer treatment strategy by examining the survival rate and immune status following combined ICI and BJIKT treatment.

The equipment used in this study has an algorithm to increase repeatability and diagnostic accuracy by using indirect illumination and feedback gridlines. Also, it was designed to meet the international standards ISO 20498-1, 20498-2, 20498-3, 20498-4, and 20498-5., Baseline, Visit 4(week 10), End of Treatment(EOT) visit(week 46)
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with Bojungikki-tang(BJIKT) and pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 positive with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. A total of 70 patients aged 19 or older will be enrolled in the study and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed as the primary endpoint.

In a pre-clinical study, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs) and Bojungikki-tang extended the survival of mice compared to the administration of ICIs or BJIKT alone and reduced tumor volume and weight. In addition, it was confirmed that various immune-related factors in the tumor microenvironment were controlled to improve the immunosuppressed microenvironment and to strengthen the tumor immune response by increasing major immune cytokines in the blood. Furthermore, the combination of ICIs and BJIKT did not cause pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug interactions, and significant side effects of Bojungikki-tang were not observed in most clinical reports on long-term administration of Bojungikki-tang. Based on the results, the combination of BJIKT and ICIs is expected to improve survival and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ICIs by modulating the systemic tumor-immune environment.

In order to evaluate efficacy, variables including PFS, disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and quality of life will be used. The incidence rate of adverse events (AEs) and AEs with CTCAE grade 3 or higher will be assessed for safety. Most variables will be followed up during and after 45-week treatment, and the safety of interventions will be monitored consistently. Immune profiling and multi-omics analyses, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic evaluations of PBMCs, will be conducted for exploratory purposes. In addition, pattern identification, a traditional diagnostic method in East Asian medicine, will be utilized as an exploratory variable. A validated questionnaire assessing Cold-Heat patterns, tongue diagnosis data, and pulse diagnosis data will be used to investigate their correlation with clinical and laboratory data.
