Biomarker Study of Pts With Metastatic ccRCC Undergoing Sequential Therapy With 1st Line Sunitinib and 2nd Line Axitinib
This is a prospective single arm phase II study to evaluate potential prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in patients with metastatic ccRCC undergoing treatment with 1st line sunitinib on a 4/2 schedule followed by axitinib on 2nd line therapy.
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
1st line Response Rate (RR) with Sunitinib in patients with VEGF pathway mutation, First Line Response Rate (RR) With Sunitinib (RECIST 1.1) in patients with VEGF pathway mutation, through study completion (up to 2 years)
1sr line RR with Sunitinib, First Line Response Rate (RR) with Sunitinib (RECIST 1.1), through study completion (up to 2 years)|2nd Line RR with Axitinib, Second Line Response Rate (RR) with Axitinib (RECIST 1.1), through study completion (up to 2 years)|1st line PFS with Sunitinib, First Line Progression Free Survival (PFS) with Sunitinib, through study completion (up to 2 years)|2nd PFS with Axitinib, Second Line Progression Free Survival (PFS) with Axitinib, through study completion (up to 2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival, through study completion (up to 2 years)|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, CTCAE v.4.0, through study completion (up to 2 years)
In this study, all included patients will receive sunitinib until disease progression and/or limiting toxicity. If patients develop toxicities â‰¥ Grade 2 on 50 mg per day 4 weeks-on / 2 weeks-off schedule, a modified schedule of 50 mg/day 2 weeks-on / 1 week-off will be offered. After disease progression on sunitinib, all eligible patients will receive axitinib 5 mg twice a day. The investigators plan to assess, by next generation sequencing, the prevalence of mutations in several cancer related genes in baseline archived tissue from the patients included in the study, and the potential correlations between these somatic mutations and anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy efficacy.
