A Clinical Study of SHP674 (Pegaspargase) in Participants With Newly Diagnosed, Untreated Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of SHP674 in Japanese participants (dose confirmation) in the tolerability assessment period of Part 1 and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SHP674 dose in Part 2 (found to be tolerated in Part 1) in the treatment of newly diagnosed untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Japanese participants.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: SHP674
Part 1: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and SHP-674-Related TEAEs During the Tolerability Assessment Period, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant after signing informed consent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease, whether or not it is related to the investigational product. TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received an investigational product which occurs during the period from Day 1 of the pre-treatment phase to 30 (+7) days after the last dose of investigational product, or until the start of a new therapy, whichever occurs first. A related adverse event signifies that there is a reasonable causal relationship between study treatment and an AE., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (approximately 49 weeks)|Part 2: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Plasma Asparaginase Activity of ≥0.1 International Units Per Milliliter (IU/mL) 14 Days (336 Hours) After the First Dose of SHP674, 14 days after the first dose of SHP674
Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug (SHP674) Antibody (ADA) (Part 1 and Part 2), Predose and 25 days post dose (Part 1 and Part 2)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Antibody (Part 1 and Part 2), Predose and 25 days post dose (Part 1 and part 2)|Part 1: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Plasma Asparaginase Activity of ≥0.1 IU/mL 14 Days (336 Hours) After the First Dose of SHP674, 14 days after the first dose of SHP674|Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Plasma Asparaginase Activity of ≥0.1 IU/mL or <0.1 IU/mL, Day 1 (pre-dose, 5 min, 4 hours, 24 hours post dose), Days 2, 4, 11, 14, 18, 25 post dose|Survival Rate at 1 Year After the Start of Study Treatment, Survival rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who survived at 1 year after the start of study treatment., 1 year after the start of study treatment (from first dose up to 12 months)|Event-free Survival Rate at 1 Year After the Start of Study Treatment, Event-free survival rate is defined as percentage of subjects who did not experience any event and survived at 1 year after the start of study treatment., 1 year after the start of study treatment (from first dose up to 12 months)
The objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of SHP674 in Japanese participants (dose confirmation) in the tolerability assessment period of Part 1 and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SHP674 dose in Part 2 (found to be tolerated in Part 1) in the treatment of newly diagnosed untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Japanese participants.
