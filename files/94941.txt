Gut Microbiome Components Predict Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients : A Prospective Study
In this study the characteristics and alterations of the gut microbiome during neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer patients are studied, as well as the relation between the gut microbiome and probability of pCR.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: stool and blood collection
Pathologic complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0), The primary objective of this study is to determine if the probability of pCR (pathologic complete response) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with standard of care neoadjuvant therapy is correlated with variability in the composition of intestinal microbiota and subsequent short-term alterations in that composition., 2 years
Correlations between Pathologic complete Response, Determine if specific microbiota correlated with the probability of pCR are associated with the anti-tumor innate and adaptive immune responses in the peripheral blood, 2 years|Side effects, Correlation of the microbiome to incidence of at least grade 3 toxicity using the CTCAE version 4.0 scoring, 2 years
Although systemic treatment for early stage HER2-positive breast cancer is becoming increasingly effective, resistance and side effects of current treatment modalities are substantial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies, and in addition, better predictive tools are needed to select the right drug to the right patient. New data suggest that modulation of the microbiome of the gut might provide opportunities to increase anti-tumor efficacy of cancer therapies.

A better understanding of the composition, function and dynamics of the gut microbiome before and during trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant treatment might help to identify factors that can be influenced during the treatment of patients with primary HER2-positive BC .

This study will prospectively enroll 100 participants with newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer patients undergoing standard of care trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant treatment and correlate gut microbiome composition with pCR.

Patients will be treated with the standard of care neoadjuvant therapy. Stool and peripheral blood (PB) samples will be collected at time of consent for therapy, mid-treatment, after the completion of neoadjuvant treatment (at the discretion of the medical oncologist). Correlation of changes in gut microbiome and metabolic changes, as well as inflammation and microbiome metabolites, will be assessed and possible connection with pCR and side effects will be explored.
