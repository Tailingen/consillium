DRUG: CX-2009
The Number of Subjects Experiencing a Dose Limiting Toxicity at Various Dose Levels When Given CX-2009 as a Monotherapy, All AEs will be captured according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 and considered for assessment of DLTs as outlined by the criteria in Protocol Table 5., 21 days for the Q3W schedule, 28 days for the Q2W schedule
Subjects Experiencing Anti-cancer Activity (ORR) at Various Dose Levels When Given CX-2009 as a Monotherapy, Efficacy will be assessed via objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST version 1.1. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive tumor assessments with scan dates at least 4 weeks apart according to RECIST (version 1.1, refer to SAP section 13.1.1). Complete criteria for RECIST 1.1 are provided as an appendix to the protocol.

\>

\> For as long as a subject continues follow-up for response in the study, CT/MRI/Tumor assessment are to be conducted every 8 (+/- 1) weeks from the first dose of CX 2009 with assessment for response per

\> RECIST Version 1.1, Median total on-study follow-up of 18.4 weeks.
