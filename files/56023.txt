A Study to Assess Safety and Pharmacokinetics of MOXR0916 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MOXR0916 administered intravenously in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have progressed after all available standard therapy or for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective or intolerable, or is considered inappropriate. This study will consist of a screening period, an initial treatment period, a re-treatment period (for participants who discontinue MOXR0916 after demonstration of prolonged clinical benefit), and a post-treatment follow-up period. Participants will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage. The planned duration of the study is approximately 3 years.
