PDT vs Peels for Treatment of Actinic Keratoses
The purpose of this study is to to compare photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus the combination of Jessner's solution and 35% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) chemical peels for the treatment of actinic keratoses on upper extremities.

This is a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 60 participants with actinic keratoses on both upper arms will be randomized to have one arm receive photodynamic therapy, while the contralateral arm receives Jessner's solution followed immediately by 35% TCA. AKs will be counted before treatment and 2-8 weeks after treatment. This study is a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of this procedure.

Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment.
