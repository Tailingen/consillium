VEGF Signaling Promotes Cell Growth and Metastasis in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma in a VEGF Receptor Mediated Pathway (ECC)
The investigators study the VEGF signaling in ECC cell lines,patients and its mechanism in ECC growth, proliferation and apoptosis.
Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: surgical treatment
the variation of the quantity of VEGF signal pathway genes in normal liver tissue,peri tumor,tumor and metastasis., the sections would be collected as previously described.Western blot,immunohistochemistry,PCR would be conducted to find out the variation between the normal liver tissue and tumor,tumor and meta(if have)., the day when conducting surgery (day 1)
Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in cancer cell lines. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and early stage liver cancer. Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ECC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ECC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ECC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.
