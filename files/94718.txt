Hyperion Is A Prospective, Multicenter, Non-Interventional, Two-Cohort Study Collecting Primary Data In Patients With Locally Advanced Or Metastatic NSCLC Of Squamous Or Non-Squamous Histology After Prior Chemotherapy Being Treated With Atezolizumab In Routine Clinical Practice.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Time to loss of clinical benefit (TTLCB) from Atezolizumab treatment, Time from first dose to loss of clinical benefit as assessed by the treating physician, through the end of study (approximately 5 years).|Duration of response (DOR) to Atezolizumab treatment, Time from first documentation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever occurs first, until progressive disease (PD), as evaluated by the physician according to routine practice or death; through the end of study (~ 5 years)
Disease control rate (DCR) of overall population, Percentage of patients who achieved a CR, a PR, or stable disease (SD) as evaluated by the physician according to clinical practice at the time of the fifth Atezolizumab infusion; (until the end of study, approximately 5 years)|Progression-free survival (PFS) of overall population, Time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as evaluated by the physician according to clinical practice, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|Time to response (TTR) of overall population, Time from first dose to first response as assessed in clinical routine, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|Overall response rate (ORR) of overall population, Rate of CR and PR in patients as assessed in clinical routine, through end of study (approximately 5 years)|Best overall response (BOR) of overall population, Best response achieved within 12 weeks as assessed in clinical routine, through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|Best overall response of patients in cohort 2 ("Coh2 BOR"), Baseline through the end of study (approximately 5 years)|Overall survival of cohort 2 ("Coh2 OS"), Time from initiation of Atezolizumab treatment to death from any cause (until the end of study, approximately 5 years).|Percentage of participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Baseline through the end of study (approximately 5 years)
