Non-pharmacological Care for Depression in Cancer Patients Using VR and TMS
Despite its significant impact on individuals and healthcare systems, substantial gaps remain in the clinical and rehabilitative management of depression in oncology patients.

Depression in cancer patients is often under-recognized and untreated, and screening tools and structured healthcare pathways are lacking. Even when depression is identified in oncology patients, evidence of effective treatments is limited. There are no specific guidelines for psychotropic drug use in cancer patients, and antidepressant efficacy is uncertain despite their frequent use.

Emerging strategies like transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive rehabilitation show promising findings. However, the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic strategies is understudied.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is already used for the treatment and relapse prevention of depression both as monotherapy and as an add-on to antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and it appears effective in improving cognitive performance. However, it has not yet been applied to treat depressive disorders in oncology patients.

Virtual reality-based cognitive behavioral intervention (VR-COG) is designed to improve cognitive functioning, a central feature of depression in oncological conditions. VR-COG enhances learning and skill acquisition with better ecological efficiency than traditional cognitive remediation programs. VR approaches are well-received by oncology patients and show promise in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms.

The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of highly specialized, nonpharmacological interventions on depressive symptoms and quality of life in oncology patients. Specifically, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Virtual Reality-based Cognitive Remediation (VR-COG) will be analyzed, alongside standard Treatment as Usual (TAU), in comparison to TAU alone. This trial also aims at evaluate cognitive functioning, depression-related conditions and the cost-effectiveness of the interventions under study.

Cost-effectiveness, The cost effectiveness will be computed as the ratio of total costs divided by the mean improvements of quality of life across interventions (TAU, TAU+rTMS, TAU+VRCOG).

Total costs will include the costs of the healthcare consultations (visits in the TAU condition), psychotropic drugs, equipment and staff.

Total costs will be computed as the sum of these costs of each intervention, divided by the number of patients.

Quality of life improvements will be computed as the difference between baseline (T0) vs endpoint (T3) quality of life., T0 (0 months - baseline); T3 (6 months after T1-post intervention)
