(EXPLORER) Study of BLU-285 in Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM) and Relapsed or Refractory Myeloid Malignancies
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of avapritinib (also known as BLU-285), administered orally (PO), in adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis and other relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts:, dose-escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2).
