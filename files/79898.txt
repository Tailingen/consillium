A Study of Fluzoparib Combined With Apatinib as Second-Line Treatment of Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer（FA-ES-SCLC）
This open-label, dose finding phase Ib trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and to see how well these two drugs work together as second-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be explored. Both dose escalation and dose expansion parts are included in this study.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
DRUG: Fluzoparib|DRUG: Apatinib
Phase Ⅰb: Determination of Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Escalating Dose of Fluzoparib with Apatinib, The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for the dose expansion arms, based on safety, tolerability and efficacy data collected during the dose escalation portion of the study, Up to 28 days after the first dose of Fluzoparib and Apatinib combination therapy|PhaseⅠb: Incidence of Adverse Events [safety and tolerability], Adverse events defined according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, From screening up to 28 days after end of treatment|Phase Ⅱ: Objective Response Rate(ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Objective Response Rate(Complete response + Partial response (CR+PR)), determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, defined as best overall response (complete or partial response) across all assessment time points., up to approximately 2 Years
Progression Free Survival（PFS）, Progression Free Survival, defined as first assessment of disease progression or death, whichever is earlier., Up to approximately 2 Years|Overall survival（OS）, Overall survival is the time from intervention to death due to any reason or lost of follow-up, Up to approximately 2 Years|Duration of Response（DoR）, Duration of Response, determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 2 Years|Adverse Event Rate（AER）, Adverse events defined according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, Up to approximately 2 Years|Biomarker Detection, Evaluation of TP53 gene status through next-generation sequencing technology, Up to approximately 2 Years
The degree of malignancy of small cell lung cancer is extremely high. About 60% to 70% of patients are diagnosed as extensive. The median survival time of the disease is only 9 to 10 months, and the 2-year survival rate is less than 10%. Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 inhibitor. Apatinib is an oral selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor.This open-label, dose finding phase Ib trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib as second-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be explored.
