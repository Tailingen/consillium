Phase 1/2 Study of S-1 and Cisplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of the phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the safe dose of S-1 and cisplatin that can be administered in gastric cancer patients.

The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the antitumor activity of the S-1 and cisplatin regimen established from phase 1 in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: cisplatin
S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine which combines tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug) with two classes of modulators which:

* inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and
* block phosphorylation of 5-FU in gastrointestinal tissues.

S-1 is designed to enhance the the clinical utility of an oral fluoropyrimidine while ameliorating the disadvantage of gastrointestinal toxicity.

5-Fu and cisplatin have been used as a standard treatment in gastric cancer and preliminary data indicate that S-1 plus cisplatin may result in superior tolerability and efficacy in advanced gastric cancer.

S-1 is currently approved in Japan for treatment of gastric cancer and head and neck cancer.
