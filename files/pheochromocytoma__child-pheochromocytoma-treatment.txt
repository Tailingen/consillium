Anatomy
Tumors arising within the adrenal gland are known as pheochromocytomas, whereas morphologically identical tumors arising elsewhere are termed paragangliomas. Paragangliomas are further divided into the following subtypes:[
1
,
2
]
Sympathetic paragangliomas that predominantly arise from the intra-abdominal sympathetic trunk and usually produce catecholamines.
Parasympathetic paragangliomas that are distributed along the parasympathetic nerves of the head, neck, and mediastinum and are rarely functional.

Molecular Characterization of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
Comprehensive molecular profiling of 173 cases of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (mean age at diagnosis, 47 years) identified three well-defined molecular subgroups: pseudohypoxia-related clusters 1A and 1B, kinase signaling–related cluster 2, and WNT signaling–related cluster 3.[
1
] About 70% of patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma can be assigned to one of these clusters. Each cluster has unique clinical, biochemical, and imaging characteristics that may help guide the treatment and follow-up of patients.[
2
,
3
]
Cluster 1:
These tumors account for about 25% to 35% of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, are usually extra-adrenal, and tend to have a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype because these tumors lack the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine.[
3
,
4
] Variants in this cluster stabilize HIF-2 alpha and promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. Patients with tumors in this cluster present at a younger age, especially those with
SDHB
variants (<20 years). Clinically, these patients have sustained hypertension. Patients with cluster 1 tumors develop multiple and recurrent tumors that have the potential for metastatic spread, particularly for patients with
SDHA
and
SDHB
variants. With a median follow-up of 5 years, 3 of 30 asymptomatic children (10%) who were carriers of an
SDHB
variant developed abdominal paragangliomas identified on surveillance imaging. This cluster can be further subdivided into clusters 1A and 1B, as described below.[
5

Cluster 1A
tumors have variants in the Krebs cycle–associated genes
SDHA
(
AF2
),
SDHB
,
SDHC
,
SDHD
,
FH
,
MDH2
,
IDH1
,
IDH2
,
GOT2
,
SLC25A11
, and
DLST
. Most of these are germline pathogenic variants and have a higher metastatic risk.[
5
]
Cluster 1B
tumors have variants in
VHL
- and
EPAS1
-related genes such as
EGLN2
,
EGLN1
,
VHL
,
EPAS1
, and
ACO1
. About 25% of these are germline pathogenic variants.[
5
]
Cluster 2:
These tumors usually arise in the adrenal gland and have an adrenergic biochemical phenotype. Cluster 2 tumors affect older patients, with a peak age of 40 years for clinical manifestations. Clinically, they present with an intermittent catecholamine secretion pattern. This cluster includes variants in tyrosine kinases, including
RET
,
NF1
,
HRAS
,
TMEM127
,
MAX
, and
FGFR1
.[
5
]
Cluster 3:
These tumors have somatic variants of the WNT signaling pathway, which includes variants in the
CSDE1
gene and
MAML3
gene fusions. These variants are associated with an aggressive clinical course. Cluster 3 tumors are located mainly in the adrenal gland and account for 5% to 10% of all pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. They have an intermediate metastatic risk and can secrete normetanephrine and metanephrines. Genomic alterations in this cluster are somatic.[

Genetic Factors and Syndromes Associated With Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
Up to 30% of all pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are estimated to be familial, and several susceptibility genes have been described (see
Table 2
).  The median age at presentation in most familial syndromes is 30 to 35 years, and up to 50% of patients have the disease by age 26 years.[

Genetic factors and syndromes associated with an increased risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma include the following:
von Hippel-Lindau  (VHL) disease:
Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma occur in 10% to 20% of patients with VHL. For more information, see
Von Hippel-Lindau Disease
.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome type 2:
Codon-specific variants of the
RET
gene are associated with a 50% risk of development of pheochromocytoma in individuals with MEN2A and MEN2B. Somatic
RET
variants are also found in those with sporadic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1):
Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are a rare occurrence in patients with NF1. They typically have characteristics similar to those of sporadic tumors, with a relatively late mean age of onset and rarity in pediatrics.
Familial pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromes:
These syndromes are commonly caused by pathogenic variants in
SDHA
,
SDHB
,
SDHC
, and
SDHD
and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Pathogenic
SDHB
variants are the most common, followed by
SDHD
,
SDHC
, and
SDHA
. Other genes implicated in this syndrome include
SDHAF2
,
TMEM127
,
FH
, and
MAX
.
Tumors from patients with
SDHB
and
SDHC
variants mainly arise in extra-adrenal locations, whereas tumors from patients with
SDHD
variants are mainly found in the head and neck area.
SDHA
variants are linked to sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas. For more information, see
Table 2
.
For more information, see the
Familial Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Syndrome
section in Genetics of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Neoplasias.
Other syndromes:
Carney triad syndrome:
This condition includes three tumors: paraganglioma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and pulmonary chondromas. Pheochromocytomas and other lesions, such as esophageal leiomyomas and adrenocortical adenomas, have also been described. The syndrome primarily affects young women, with a mean age of 21 years at time of presentation. Approximately one-half of patients present with paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma, although multiple lesions occur in approximately 20% of the cases. About 20% of patients have all three tumor types; the remainder have two of the three, most commonly GIST and pulmonary chondromas. This triad doesn’t appear to run in families. However, approximately 10% of patients have germline pathogenic variants in the
SDHA
,
SDHB
, or
SDHC
genes.[
5
,
6
]
Carney-Stratakis syndrome:
Also called Carney dyad syndrome, this condition includes paraganglioma and GIST but not pulmonary chondromas. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance. It is equally common in men and women, with an average age of 23 years at presentation.  Most patients with this syndrome have been found to carry germline pathogenic variants in the
SDHB
,
SDHC
, or
SDHD
genes.[
6
] For more information, see
Genetics of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Neoplasias
.
Pacak-Zhuang syndrome:
This syndrome results from somatic gain-of-function variants in the  hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) protein, which is encoded by the
EPAS1
gene. This syndrome is characterized by congenital polycythemia, multiple paragangliomas, and duodenal somatostatinomas.[
7
] One patient with Pacak-Zhuang syndrome was treated with belzutifan, a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of the HIF-2 alpha protein. This treatment led to a rapid and sustained tumor response, along with a resolution of hypertension, headaches, and long-standing polycythemia.[

Correlation Between Clinical and Molecular Features
In This Section
Clinical Presentation
Diagnostic Evaluation
Studies of germline variants in young patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma have shown that these patients have a high prevalence (70%–80%) of germline pathogenic variants and have further characterized this group of neoplasms, as follows:
In a study of 49 patients younger than 20 years  with a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma, 39 (79%) had an underlying germline pathogenic variant that involved the
SDHB
(n = 27; 55%),
SDHD
(n = 4; 8%),
VHL
(n = 6; 12%), or
NF1
(n = 2; 4%) gene.[
1
] The incidence and type of variant correlated with the site and extent of disease.
The germline pathogenic variant rates for patients with nonmetastatic disease were lower than those observed in patients who had evidence of metastases (64% vs. 87.5%).
Among patients with metastatic disease, the incidence of
SDHB
variants was high (72%), and most presented with disease in the retroperitoneum. Five patients died of their disease.
All patients with
SDHD
variants had head and neck primary tumors.
In another study,  the incidence of germline pathogenic variants involving
RET
,
VHL
,
SDHD
, and
SDHB
in patients with nonsyndromic  paraganglioma was 70% for patients younger than 10 years and 51% among those aged 10 to 20 years.[
2
] In contrast, only 16% of patients older than 20 years  had an identifiable variant.
It is important to note that these two studies did not include systematic screening for other genes that have been recently described in paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma syndromes, such as
KIF1B
,
EGLN1
,
TMEM127
,
SDHA
, and
MAX
(see
Table 2
).
In a retrospective review of 55 patients younger than 21 years referred to the National Cancer Institute, 80% of patients had a germline pathogenic variant.[
3
]
Most patients were found to have either the
VHL
(38%) or the
SDHB
(25%) variant. Pheochromocytoma was present in 67% of the patients (37 of 55) and was bilateral in 51% of patients (19 of 37).
Most patients with bilateral pheochromocytomas had
VHL
variants (79%).
Similarly, in a study of 88 children with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma identified in the German Pediatric Oncology Hematology–Malignant Endocrine Tumor registry, the following was observed:[
4
]
Pathogenic variant screening from 66 patients revealed that 96% of the variants were confined to the   pseudohypoxia cluster (66% affecting the
VHL
and
EPAS1
genes and 33% affecting the
SDHB
and
SDHD
genes).
In this analysis, extent of resection was a significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival.
A retrospective analysis from the European-American-Asian-Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma-Registry identified 177 patients with paraganglial tumors who were diagnosed before age 18 years.[
5
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Eighty percent of registrants had germline pathogenic variants (49% with
VHL
, 15% with
SDHB
, 10% with
SDHD
, 4% with
NF1
, and one patient each with
RET
,
SDHA
, and
SDHC
).
A second primary paraganglial tumor developed in 38% of patients, with increasing frequency over time, reaching 50% at 30 years from initial presentation.
Prevalence of second tumors was higher in patients with hereditary disease.  Sixteen patients (9%) with hereditary disease had malignant tumors, ten at initial presentation and another six during follow-up.  Malignancy was associated with
SDHB
variants.  Eight patients (5%) died, all of whom had a germline pathogenic variant.  Mean life expectancy was 62 years for patients with hereditary disease.
A large retrospective review from tertiary medical centers identified 95 of 748 patients whose tumors first presented in childhood.[
6
]
Compared with adults, children showed higher prevalence of hereditary (80.4% vs. 52.6%), extra-adrenal (66.3% vs. 35.1%), multifocal (32.6% vs. 13.5%), metastatic (49.5% vs. 29.1%), and recurrent (29.5% vs. 14.2%) pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
Tumors caused by cluster 1 variants, which are associated with the absence of epinephrine production, were more prevalent among children than adults (76% vs. 39%;
P
< .0001). This difference paralleled a higher prevalence of noradrenergic tumors in children, characterized by a relative lack of increased plasma metanephrine (93.2% vs. 57.3%).
The U.S. National Institutes of Health reported the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 64 pediatric patients who had pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma with
SDHB
germline pathogenic variants. There were 38 males and 26 females diagnosed at a median age of 13 years.[
7
]
Most patients displayed norepinephrine hypersecretion, and 73% of patients initially presented with a solitary tumor.
Metastasis developed in 70% of patients at a median age of 16 years. Most patients were diagnosed with metastasis in the first  2 years after the initial diagnosis and in years 12 to 18 postdiagnosis.
The presence of metastasis at the time of diagnosis had a strong negative impact on survival in males but not in females.
The estimated 5-year survival rate was 100%; the 10-year survival rate was 97.14%; the 20-year survival rate was 77.71%.
These tumors are relatively slow growing, which explains the late deaths and the need for prolonged follow-up.
The authors recommended that the initial diagnostic evaluation of
SDHB
variant carriers should begin at age 5 to 6 years, with initial work-up focusing on the abdominal region. Thorough monitoring of patients is crucial in the first 2 years after diagnosis, and more frequent follow-up evaluations are needed in years 10 to 20 postdiagnosis because of the increased risk of metastasis.
Immunohistochemical
SDHB
staining may help triage genetic testing. Tumors of patients with
SDHB
,
SDHC
, and
SDHD
variants have absent or weak staining, while sporadic tumors and those associated with other constitutional syndromes have positive staining.[
8
,
9
] Therefore, immunohistochemical
SDHB
staining can help identify potential carriers of
SDH
variants early, obviating the need for extensive and costly testing of other genes. Early identification of young patients with
SDHB
variants using radiographic, serological, and immunohistochemical markers could potentially decrease mortality and identify other family members who carry a germline
SDHB
pathogenic variant.
Given the higher prevalence of germline alterations in children and adolescents with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, genetic counseling and testing should be considered in this younger population.
Clinical Presentation
Patients with pheochromocytoma and sympathetic extra-adrenal paraganglioma usually present with the following symptoms of excess catecholamine production:
Hypertension.
Headache.
Perspiration.
Palpitations.
Tremor.
Facial pallor.
In one study, 2,291 adult patients were evaluated for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Patients were tested because of initial signs or symptoms, detection of an incidental mass on imaging or during routine surveillance because of a previous history of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, or a hereditary risk associated with a variant of a tumor susceptibility gene. The study used a 7-point clinical scoring system that included pallor, hyperhidrosis, palpitations, tremor, nausea, body mass index of less than 25 kg/m
2
, and heart rate of 85 beats per minute or higher to identify patients at risk of having pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. A score of 3 or higher was associated with a  5.8-fold higher likelihood of being diagnosed with a paraganglioma or a pheochromocytoma,  compared with patients who had a lower score.[
10
] This scoring system may not be applicable to pediatric patients.
Symptoms of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma can be paroxysmal, although sustained hypertension between paroxysmal episodes occurs in more than one-half of patients. These symptoms can also be induced by exertion, trauma, induction of anesthesia, resection of the tumor, consumption of foods high in tyramine (e.g., red wine, chocolate, cheese), or urination (in cases of primary tumor of the bladder).[
11
]
Parasympathetic extra-adrenal paragangliomas do not secrete catecholamines and usually present as a neck mass with symptoms related to compression, but also may be asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally.[
11
] Epinephrine production is also associated with cluster genotype. Cluster 1 tumors are characterized by absence of epinephrine production (noradrenergic phenotype), whereas cluster 2 tumors produce epinephrine (adrenergic phenotype).[
6
]
The pediatric and adolescent patient appears to present with symptoms similar to those of the adult patient, although with more frequent sustained hypertension.[
12
]  The clinical behavior of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma appears to be more aggressive in children and adolescents than in adults, and metastatic rates of up to 50% have been reported.[
1
,
12
,
13
] As previously discussed, children and adolescents with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have a higher prevalence of hereditary, extra-adrenal, multifocal, metastatic, and recurrent pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. They also have a higher prevalence of cluster 1 variants, which is paralleled by a higher prevalence of noradrenergic tumors than in adults.[
6
]
Diagnostic Evaluation
The diagnosis of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma relies on the biochemical documentation of excess catecholamine secretion coupled with imaging studies for localization and staging:
Biochemical testing:
Measurement of plasma-free fractionated metanephrines (metanephrine and normetanephrine) is usually the diagnostic tool of choice when a secreting paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma is suspected. A 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and fractionated metanephrines can also be performed for confirmation.[
14
,
15
]
Catecholamine metabolic and secretory profiles are impacted by hereditary background. Both hereditary and sporadic paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma differ markedly in tumor contents of catecholamines and corresponding plasma and urinary hormonal profiles. About 50% of secreting tumors produce and contain a mixture of norepinephrine and epinephrine, while most of the rest produce norepinephrine almost exclusively, with occasional rare tumors producing mainly dopamine. Patients with epinephrine-producing tumors are diagnosed later (median age, 50 years) than those with tumors lacking appreciable epinephrine production (median age, 40 years). Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndromes, all with epinephrine-producing tumors, are typically diagnosed at a later age (median age, 40 years) than are patients with tumors that lack appreciable epinephrine production secondary to variants of
VHL
and
SDH
(median age, 30 years). These variations in ages at diagnosis associated with different tumor catecholamine phenotypes and locations suggest origins of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma for different progenitor cells with variable susceptibility to disease-causing variants.[
16
,
17
]
Imaging:
Imaging modalities used for the localization of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma include the following:
Computed tomography (CT).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Iodine I 123 or iodine I 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (123/131I-MIBG) scintigraphy, fluorine F 18-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET-CT, and fluorine F 18-6-fluorodopamine (18F-6-FDA) PET.[
18
,
19
]
For tumor localization, 18F-6-FDA PET and 123/131I-MIBG scintigraphy perform equally well in patients with nonmetastatic paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. However, metastases are better detected by 18F-6-FDA PET than by 123/131I-MIBG.[
20
,
21
] For patients with cluster 1A tumors, the most sensitive modality is 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT. For patients with cluster 1B tumors, 18F-FDOPA PET is preferred. Cluster 2 tumors are usually identified using CT or MRI, and the most sensitive functional imaging method is 18F-FDOPA PET.[
22
] Other functional imaging alternatives include indium In 111-octreotide scintigraphy and fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, both of which can be coupled with CT imaging for improved anatomic detail.
A single-institution retrospective evaluation of consecutive pediatric patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (aged, ≤20 years) compared functional imaging with 131I-MIBG, 18F-FDG PET-CT, and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT.[
23
]  In a cohort of 32 patients (16 males; age at diagnosis, 16.4 ± 2.68 years), lesion-wise sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT (95%) was higher than that of both 18F-FDG PET-CT (80%,
P
= .027) and 131I-MIBG (65%,
P
= .0004) for overall lesions. Lesion-wide sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT was also higher than that of 18F-FDG PET-CT (100% vs. 67%,
P
= .017) for primary paraganglioma and that of 131I-MIBG (93% vs. 42%,
P
= .0001) for metastases.
An international panel of experts has published consensus guidelines on the initial screening and follow-up of adults and children who are asymptomatic carriers of a germline pathogenic variant in one of the
SDH
genes.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Treatment

Treatment of Childhood Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
Treatment options for childhood paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma include the following:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease.
High-dose iodine I 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG).
Lutetium Lu 177-DOTATATE and Yttrium Y 90-DOTATOC.[
1
]
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (sunitinib and cabozantinib).[
1
]
mTOR inhibitors.[
1
]
Immunotherapy.[

]
Treatment of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma is surgical. For secreting tumors, alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade must be optimized before surgery. A single-institution study reviewed the experience of  laparoscopic partial adrenalectomy for bilateral pheochromocytoma in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.[
2
]  In eight patients, all 16 adrenalectomies were performed laparoscopically. Fourteen of the procedures were partial adrenalectomies, and two patients required a contralateral total adrenalectomy because of tumor size and diffuse multinodularity.  Two patients had new ipsilateral tumors identified after a median follow-up of 5 years (range, 4–6 years), with one patient who underwent repeat partial adrenalectomy. There were no deaths during the study period.
For patients with metastatic disease, responses have been documented to some chemotherapeutic regimens such as gemcitabine and docetaxel or different combinations of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine.[
3
-
5
] Chemotherapy may help alleviate symptoms and facilitate surgery, although its impact on overall survival is less clear.
Responses have also been obtained with high-dose 131I-MIBG and sunitinib.[
