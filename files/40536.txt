A Study of OKI-179 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This study is a Phase 1, single center, open-label study, assessing single agent dose escalation of OKI-179.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: OKI-179
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Tolerability, 2 years|Determine the safety of the drug according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5, * Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5
* Incidence and severity of Serious Adverse Events
* Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
* Findings of changes in clinical laboratory abnormalities
* Changes in triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters
* Changes in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS)
* Changes in physical examination findings, 2 years
Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of OKI-179 and OKI-006 in Plasma, Plasma concentrations of OKI-179 and OKI-006 will be measured to determine the maximum observed concentration for each compound., 2 years|Area Under the Curve (AUC) for OKI-179 and OKI-006 in Plasma, Plasma concentrations of OKI-179 and OKI-006 will be measured to determine the AUC for each compound., 2 years|Area Under the Curve (AUC) for OKI-179 and OKI-006 in Urine, Urine concentrations of OKI-179 and OKI-006 will be measured to determine the AUC for each compound., 2 years|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for OKI-179 and OKI-006 in Plasma, Plasma concentrations of OKI-179 and OKI-006 will be measured to determine the Tmax for each compound., 2 years|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) for OKI-179 and OKI-006 in Urine, Urine concentrations of OKI-179 and OKI-006 will be measured to determine the Tmax for each compound., 2 years|Efficacy as measured by periodic CT/MRI scans using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, * Fraction of patients who have a Complete Response
* Fraction of patients who have a Partial Response
* Duration of response (DOR)
* Progression free survival
* Overall survival, 2 years
