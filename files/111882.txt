Long-term Outcomes of Ablation, Liver Resection, and Liver Transplant as First-line Treatment for Solitary HCC of 3 cm or Less
Curative-intent therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), liver resection (LR), and liver transplantation (LT). Controversy exists in treatment selection for early-stage tumors. We sought to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of patients who received either RFA, LR, or LT as first-line treatment for solitary HCC ≤ 3cm in an intention-to-treat analysis.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation|PROCEDURE: Liver resection|PROCEDURE: Liver transplantation
Intention-to-treat (ITT) overall survival, ITT was evaluated from the first treatment modality that was selected for curative intent. In the case of RFA and LR this was recorded as the time of the treatment. In the case of LT, the intention-to-treat was recorded at the time of listing for transplantation. The ITT analysis thus accounted for patients who were placed on the waitlist but dropped out., Overall (median length of follow up of entire cohort 6.6 years)|Disease-free survival (DFS)., DFS was defined as the time after treatment during which the patient was alive and free of disease. For DFS, patients were censored at recurrence, death, or loss to follow up., Overall (median length of follow up of entire cohort 6.6 years)
