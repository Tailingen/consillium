Studying Gene Expression in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at gene expression in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Quantification of the expression of EVI1 splice variants
OBJECTIVES:

* Examine mRNA from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia with 11q23 translocations by reverse transcriptase-PCR to quantify expression of EVI1 splice variants.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved mRNA from diagnostic samples is analyzed for gene expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR.
