This study consists of 2 parts: First in Human (FIH) dose escalation and dose optimization (Part 1a and Part 1b, respectively) and dose expansion (Part 2). Part 1 will evaluate LB101 monotherapy in participants with selected, advanced solid tumors and determine the Recommended Dose(s) for Expansion (RDE(s)) for Part 2. The design of Part 2 depends on the results of Part 1 and will further evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immune response of LB101.
