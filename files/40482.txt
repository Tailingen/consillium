This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous claudin18.2 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in patients with advanced gastric, pancreatic or other specified digestive system cancers.

Following consent, patients must have tumor tissue evaluated by CLDN18.2 IHC assay. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (CT041). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive preconditioning prior to CT041 infusion. All subjects will be asked to continue to undergo long-term gene safety follow-up.
