Reduced Intensity Conditioning Regimens for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare outcomes of two reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (fludarabine plus busulfan and fludarabine plus melphalan) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The safety of two reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (fludarabine plus busulfan and fludarabine plus melphalan) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adult AML/MDS patients with HCT-CI≥3 or aged ≥55 years.
* The efficacy of two reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (fludarabine plus busulfan and fludarabine plus melphalan) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for adult AML/MDS patients with HCT-CI≥3 or aged ≥55 years.

Participants will be randomized to one of two reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens (fludarabine plus busulfan and fludarabine plus melphalan)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Adult|Myelodysplastic Syndrome(MDS)|Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
DRUG: Fludarabine and Busulfan|DRUG: Fludarabine and Melphalan
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Survival without relapse or progression of the primary disease. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median PFS., 18 months post-randomization
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as survival duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate median OS, 18 months post-randomization|Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM), Death not due to recurrence or progression of the primary disease. Recurrence was considered as a competing risk event, and the Gray test was used for statistical analysis., 18 months post-randomization|Disease Relapse, Relapse of the primary disease. Non-relapse mortality (TRM) was considered as a competing risk event, and Gray's test was used for statistical analysis., 18 months post-randomization|Percentage of Participants With Severe Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD), Acute GVHD is graded according to the scoring system proposed by Przepiorka et al.1995:

Skin stage:

0: No rash

Rash \<25% of body surface area Rash on 25-50% of body surface area Rash on \> 50% of body surface area Generalized erythroderma with bullous formation

Liver stage (based on bilirubin level)\*:

0: \<2 mg/dL

2-3 mg/dL 3.01-6 mg/dL 6.01-15.0 mg/dL \>15 mg/dL

GI stage\*:

0: No diarrhea or diarrhea \<500 mL/day

Diarrhea 500-999 mL/day or persistent nausea with histologic evidence of GVHD Diarrhea 1000-1499 mL/day Diarrhea \>1500 mL/day Severe abdominal pain with or without ileus \* If multiple etiologies are listed for liver or GI, the organ system is downstaged by 1.

GVHD grade:

0: All organ stages 0 or GVHD not listed as an etiology I: Skin stage 1-2 and liver and GI stage 0 II: Skin stage 3 or liver or GI stage 1 III: Liver stage 2-3 or GI stage 2-4 IV: Skin or liver stage 4, Day 100 post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD is classified as the occurrence of mild, moderate, or severe chronic GVHD per 2005 NIH Consensus Criteria (Filipovich et al. 2005), 18 months post-transplant
Percentage of Participants With Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment, Neutrophil engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500x10\^6/liter for 3 continuous measurements on different days. The first of the 3 days will be labeled as the day of neutrophil engraftment. Platelet engraftment is defined as achieving platelet counts greater than 20,000/microliter for continuous measurements over 7 days without requiring platelet transfusions. The first day of the 7 days will be marked as the day of platelet engraftment., Days 7 to 60 post-transplant|Incidence and Percentage of Severe Infection, List the type, number, and severity of infection events, 18 months post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Toxicities, The severity of oral ulcer or diarrhea in the early stage after transplantation, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings., Days 1 to 60 post-transplant|Number of Lymphocyte Subsets, Number of Lymphocyte Subsets of Participants, Days 28, days 60, 3 months post-transplant, 6 months post-transplant, 12months post-transplant, 18 months post-transplant
Patients are randomized to one of two reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens: the combination of fludarabine (30 mg/m\^2/day, days -6 to days -2, the total dase is 150 mg/m\^2) and busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day, days -3 to days -2, the total dose is 6.4 mg/kg) (Flu/Bu) or fludarabine (30 mg/m\^2/day, days -6 to days -2, the total dose is 150 mg/m\^2) and melphalan (70 mg/m\^2/day, days -3 to days -2, the total dose is 140 mg/m\^2) (Flu/Mel). A total of 200 patients (100 to each arm) will be recruited in this study over a period of two years. Patients will be followed for up to 18 months from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
