Neuropsychological Changes in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases
Background:

* There are no standardized sets of tests to measure changes in neuropsychological functioning in patients treated for brain metastasis (cancer that has spread beyond the original site to the brain).
* Neuropsychological function has an important effect on quality of life and should be included when determining treatment options.

Objectives:

* To find out if there is a change in patients cognitive (thinking) and daily functioning after standard radiation treatment for brain metastasis that can be measured with tests.
* To see if any changes on these tests are related to patients response to radiation therapy.

Eligibility:

- Patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer that has spread to the brain.

Design:

* Patients receive a 2-week course of radiation therapy to the brain, given daily 5 days a week. Some patients may require stereotactic radiosurgery (an additional boost of radiation therapy to specific sites of brain metastasis).
* Patients have the following evaluations before and after treatment to determine changes in cognition and functioning:
* Neuropsychological testing to measure cognitive (thinking) abilities like memory, attention, processing speed, and reading, and fine motor skills.
* Questionnaires to assess quality of life and daily living skills.
* Patients have MRI scans and blood and urine tests.
* At the completion of radiation treatment, patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months for blood and urine tests, physical examination, MRI of the brain, neuropsychological testing and assessments of quality of life and daily living skills.

Background:

* Metastatic brain tumors occur more frequently than primary brain tumors and occur in approximately 25 percent of patients who die of cancer each year.
* The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) developed three prognostic classes using a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) of a large database. These classes are based on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), age and disease status.
* The RTOG RPA classes do not include neuropsychological function as a measure of outcome.
* There is no consensus of standardization of test selection to measure changes in neuropsychological functioning in this patient population.
* Neuropsychological function has an important effect on quality of life and should be included when determining prognosis and treatment options for patients.
* Neuropsychological functioning is important when determining the effects of treatments and for measuring outcomes in clinical trials.

Objectives:

* To identify the neuropsychological test scores which detect significant change in neuropsychological functioning in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.
* To examine the relationship between neuropsychological function and survival in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.

Eligibility:

* Patients aged 18 years and older.
* Pathologically confirmed primary malignancy with at least one intraparenchymal brain metastasis as identified on brain MRI scan with intravenous contrast.
* The patient must communicate in English in order to complete the neuropsychological evaluations.

Design:

* This is a longitudinal study that will administer serial neuropsychological assessments to patients with brain metastases who receive radiation therapy.
* Patients will undergo a battery of neuropsychological tests prior to radiotherapy (WBRT or WBRT followed by SRS), 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy, then every 3 months for up to 12 months.
* The test battery will involve approximately 40 minutes of direct cognitive testing and 15 minutes of questionnaires.

There will be three cohorts of 20 patients each for a total of 60 patients. The three cohorts will be made up of differing histologies and will be sorted on the basis of their RTOG RPA Class.
