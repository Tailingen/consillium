The Application of Serum DNA Methylation for Patients With HCC
The goal of this single-arm prospective study is to evaluate the application of serum DNA methylation for HCC patients with normal alpha-fetoprotein. The main question it aims to answer is

. Is the dynamic change of serum DNA methylation correlated to recurrence or treatment response of HCC
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Serum DNA methylation
The correlation between serum DNA methylation and HCC recurrence or treatment response, The correlation between serum DNA methylation and HCC recurrence or treatment response, 96 weeks
The enrolled individuals with HCC and normal serum alpha-fetoprotein level would receive serum DNA methylation test before their treatment (including all kinds of recommened HCC treatment). Then regularly serum DNA methylation test would be done at 4th\~8th weeks, 16th week, 32th week and 48th week. If the enrolled patients did not have HCC recurrence during at 48th week. The regular check of serum DNA methylation would be canceled. The enrolled patients would be observed till 96th week. If there is any recurrence during 48\~96th week, one time of serum DNA methylation would be checked at the time of recurrence. The observation and intervention would be completed at 96th week.
