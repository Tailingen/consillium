Big Data and Models for Personalized Head and Neck Cancer Decision Support (BD2Decide)
The purpose of this study is to determine new multiscale signatures for the prediction of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients disease outcome, in particular for advanced stage (stage III, IV) human papillomavirus (HPV) negative patients and to validate prognostic models for overall survival.
Cancer of Head and Neck
PROCEDURE: Standard treatment of SCCHN patients
Realizes and validates an Integrated Decision Support System (BD2Decide platform), The primary endpoint of this study is the accuracy of the prediction of prognosis based on the BD2Decide platform compared to Tumor Node Metastasis staging (in a population consisting of patients with different subtypes of head and neck cancer)., through study completion, an average of 3 year
Improved Quality of Life, To measure patients' QoL in relation to the new prognostic stratification, baseline, month 6, month 18, month 24 after primary treatment|Assess survival time, Overall survival and disease free survival will be assessed to verify the accuracy of the prediction of BD2Decide platform, at 2, 3 and 5 years
The clinical study is devoted to the validation of a decision support system for HNC patients management in the frame of a H2020 project.
