Validation of MMS Test for Cancer Monitoring
The purpose of this study is the validation of MMS test to detect active tumor growth in different cancer types before and after therapy, as well as in the course of therapy and for subsequent relapse control compared to standard methods (clinical examination, imaging, tumor markers). It should be consider whether the MMS test has comparable diagnostic accuracy, and thus can replace more expensive or invasive procedures in future.
