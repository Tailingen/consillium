Bilateral Ultrasound Guided Intramuscular Quadratus Lumborum Plane Block Versus Bilateral Lateral Quadratus Lumborum Plane Block in Controlling Postoperative Pain in Cancer Patients Undergoing Open Nephrectomy
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral ultrasound-guided intramuscular quadratus lumborum plane block (QL4) versus bilateral lateral quadratus lumborum plane block (QL1) in controlling postoperative pain in cancer patients undergoing open nephrectomy.
Bilateral|Ultrasound|Intramuscular Quadratus Lumborum Plane Block|Lateral Quadratus Lumborum Plane Block|Postoperative Pain|Cancer Patients|Open Nephrectomy
DRUG: Intramuscular quadratus lumborum block|DRUG: Lateral quadratus lumborum block|DRUG: General anesthesia
Degree of pain, The degree of pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0 (no pain) and 10 (the worst pain). VAS score in each technique at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively, 24 hours postoperatively
Total amount of morphine consumption, Rescue analgesia will be provided in the form of IV morphine 3 mg boluses if the patient indicates Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ≥ 4. The total amount of morphine given in 24 hours will be recorded for the two groups. A maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/24hours of morphine is allowed., 24 hours postoperatively|Total amount of fentanyl consumption, Rescue analgesia of fentanyl 1 μg/kg will be given if the mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate rises above 20% of baseline levels., Intraoperatively|Change in heart rate, Change in heart rate will be recorded intraoperatively at 5-minute intervals and record the average of each three successive readings, then at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively., 24 hours postoperatively|Change in mean arterial blood pressure, Change in mean arterial blood pressure will be recorded intraoperatively at 5-minute intervals and record the average of each three successive readings, then at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively., 24 hours postoperatively|Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting will be recorded., 24 hours postoperatively|Time of first rescue analgesia, Time of first rescue analgesia will be recorded from the end of surgery till first dose of morphine administrated., 24 hours postoperatively|Incidence of complications related to block, Incidence of complications related to block such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity and arterial puncture will be recorded., 24 hours postoperatively|Incidence of morphine related complications, Incidence of morphine-related complications such as respiratory depression, urine retention or pruritis will be recorded., 24 hours postoperatively|Degree of patient satisfaction, The patient will be classified in this group to be satisfied or not., 24 hours postoperatively
Post-surgical somatic pain is very distressing to patients, which may lead to significant complications.

Practitioners initially used these as ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, rectus sheath blocks, and in the early 21st century, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks. A recent variation of the TAP block is known as the quadratus lumborum block (QLB).

The QL block effectiveness is believed to result from the spread of Local Anesthetic cranially from the lumbar deposition into the thoracic paravertebral space (TPVS). So, the QLB seems to relieve somatic and visceral pains.
