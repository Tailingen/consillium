Study of Epcoritamab in Relapsed and Refractory Primary Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma of the CNS Treated With Lenalidomide and Rituximab
The purpose of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of epcoritamab in subjects with relapsed or refractory primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the Central Nervous System treated with rituximab and lenalidomide.
Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL)
DRUG: Epcoritamab

Primary CNS DLBCL has an altered prognostic compared to systemic DLBCL mostly due to an increased relapse rate. PCNSL patients for whom the global prognostic remains poor, calling for improved treatment at relapse.

Considering the good results of R2 regimen in R/R PCNSL and the efficacy and favorable safety profile of epcoritamab in R/R systemic DLBCL, the addition of Epcoritamab to the combination of R2 might significantly improve the prognosis of PCNSL patients at relapse. In addition, it is expected that IMiDs could potentially increase the efficiency of epcoritamab by stimulating the immune system.
