FDA018-ADC Vs Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy to Treat Locally Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, multicentre, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of FDA018-ADC compared with Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy(ICC) in participants with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer(TNBC) who are resistant to, or recurring during or after taxane therapy.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from randomisation until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause, up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause., up to 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator assessment, PFS is defined as time from randomisation until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause, up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR, as determined by BICR/investigator assessment, per RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months|Duration of Response Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed response until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR/investigator assessment or death due to any cause., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved complete responseï¼Œpartial response and stable disease assessed by BICR/investigator according to RECIST v 1.1, up to 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs (graded by CTCAE version 5.0)., up to 24 months|Immunogenicity of FDA018-ADC, Presence of ADAs for FDA018-ADC, up to 24 months
The primary objectives of the study are to demonstrate the superiority of FDA018-ADC relative to ICC by assessment of PFS per Blinded Independent Central Review(BICR) and OS in participants with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC who are resistant to, or recurring during or after taxane therapy.
