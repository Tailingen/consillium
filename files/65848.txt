Study of Alofanib in Patients With Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This is a non-randomized multicenter phase 1b clinical trial of the safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as the preliminary efficacy of monotherapy with alofanib, an allosteric fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have exhausted the resource of standard therapy.
