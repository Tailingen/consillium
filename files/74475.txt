A Phase 1 Study of FD-001 in Recurrent /Refractory (R/R)AML/NHL/MM/MDS
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I clinical trial aimed at assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary efficacy of FD-001 capsules in the treatment of recurrent/refractory hematologic malignancies(AML/MDS/NHL/MM). The trial consists of two phases: the initial phase (dose escalation) and the subsequent phase (dose expansion). The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FD-001 in subjects with recurrent/refractory hematologic tumors and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for FD-001 in this patient population.
AML|NHL
DRUG: FD-001
Phase Ⅰa:Dose limiting toxicity(DLT), DLT are assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 during the first cycle and defined as occurrence of any of the toxicities in DLT definition if judged by the investigator to be possibly,probably or definitely related to study drug administration, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 32 days|Phase Ⅰa:Maximum tolerated dose(MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 in 3 participants experienced a DLT during the first cycle, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 32 days|Phase Ⅰb:Recommended Phase Ⅱ Dose(RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase Ⅱ study,based on safety,tolerability,efficacy,PK,and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of FD-001., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 32 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants,who has a CR or PR, Up to approximately 12 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration(Cmax) of FD-001 will be investigated, Hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on single dose;Hour 0 of day 7,day8 on multiple dose and hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on multiple dose of day 9|Tmax, To characterize the pharmacokineties of FD-001by assessment of time to reach maximum plasma concentration, Hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on single dose;Hour 0 of day 7,day8 on multiple dose and hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on multiple dose of day 9|Area Under the Curve (AUC)0-t, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of FD-001 by assessment of area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity, Hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on single dose;Hour 0 of day 7,day8 on multiple dose and hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on multiple dose of day 9|T1/2, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of FD-001 by assessment of the duration required for the peak plasma concentration to be reduced by half, Hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on single dose;Hour 0 of day 7,day8 on multiple dose and hour 0,0.5,1,2,3,4,6,12,24,48,72hours post-dose on multiple dose of day 9
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I clinical trial aimed at assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, and preliminary efficacy of FD-001 capsules in the treatment of recurrent/refractory hematologic malignancies(AML/MDS/NHL/MM).The trial process consists of three periods: the screening period, the treatment period, and the follow-up period. The screening period occurred from D-28 to D-1. The treatment period (DLT observation period) includes a single administration phase (C0D1-C0D4) (oral administration on D1, followed by safety observation from D2-D4), as well as multiple administration phase 1 (C1D1-C1D28) (oral administration on D1-D2 and D7-D9, with withdrawal for the remaining time). Blood samples were collected in the first cycle (C1D1\~C1D28) for PK study, and part of the PK test blood samples may be used for metabolite identification.After completion of the DLT evaluation, subjects without intolerable toxicity may enter the maintenance treatment period if determined by the investigator that continued treatment outweighs risks. The maintenance treatment period lasts for 28 days per cycle (CND1-CND28), with oral administration on D1-D3 and D8-D10 per cycle, while withdrawing for the rest of the time.
