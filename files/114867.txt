Breast Cancer Risk Reduction: A Patient Doctor Intervention
The proposed research combines the scientific advances in breast cancer research with health information technology (IT) to design a personalized intervention that assesses breast cancer risk for women, disseminates important breast health information, and facilitates discussion of breast cancer risk reduction practices. Our goal is to implement a tablet-PC (personal computer) based breast cancer risk education (BreastCare) intervention in the primary care setting that estimates a woman's individual risk for breast cancer and provides her and her physician with personalized breast cancer risk information and recommendations for action.
