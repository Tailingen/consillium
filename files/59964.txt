The study will consist of an ascending monotherapy dose, the doses are pre-defined.

The decision to escalate will be made upon the assessment of safety and tolerability data in the first cycle of treatment.

Module 1 will commence with a 3+3 dose escalation design up to a recommended Phase 2 monotherapy dose. Patients being monitored for dose limiting toxicities at each dose level.

Characterisation of the PK profile, MTD and/or recommended Phase 2 dose will be defined on the emerging data.

Module 2: RXC004 and Nivolumab - Follows a similar 3+3 dose escalation design using RXC004 plus Nivolumab. The MTD and/or Phase 2 dose will be defined based on the PK profile, emerging safety and the appearance of any dose limiting toxicities.

Module 3: Intermittent dose schedules of RXC004 will be investigated. The intermittent schedules will utilize the module 1 dose which was shown to be safe and tolerated when used continuously. Characterisation of the PK profile; Wnt pathway inhibition; incidence/severity of Wnt pathway related AEs and anti-tumor activity will be evaluated at 2 different dosing schedules.
