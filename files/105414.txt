Gene Expression Analysis of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Oxaliplatin Based Chemotherapy Regimen
1.1 To collect pathological tumor specimens of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in a prospective fashion for correlative studies of response to an oxaliplatin based chemotherapy regimen.

DRUG: Oxaliplatin
To collect pathological tumor specimens of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in a prospective fashion for correlative studies of response to an oxaliplatin based chemotherapy regimen, The cycle length is 3 weeks, consisting of 2 weeks of capecitabine treatment followed by 1 week without treatment.
This is a single-arm, non-randomized trial of oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Patients that are placed on other studies that utilize the same chemotherapy regimen can enter this study. Those patients will be treated according to the clinical study on which they have been entered. For patients not on another clinical trial, the treatment outlined below should be followed.
