(i) Cancer pain deterioration (2-point deterioration from baseline according to the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form \[BPI-SF\] questionnaire; initiation of opioid therapy, or a ≥30% increase in opiate use) (ii) Any deterioration of physical function measured using the 4-IADL assessment tools (Lawton, 1969) (iii) A deterioration in ECOG performance status of at least 2 points from baseline (iv) Death from any cause., From randomisation to clinical progression or death, up to 18 months|Overall survival, Time from randomisation to the time of death from any cause, From randomization to death from any cause, up to 10 years.|Frequency and severity of adverse events, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders, From inclusion until 100 days after last dose of investigational product|Time to worsening in prostate cancer-related urinary symptoms, Time from randomisation to first increase from baseline of greater or equal to 8 points in the urinary symptom scale/score (PRURI) measured using the prostate cancer module of the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-PR25).

This EORTC prostate cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30. The prostate cancer module is a 25-item questionnaire designed for use among patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer. It includes subscales assessing urinary symptoms (9 items), bowel symptoms (4 items), treatment-related symptoms (6 items) and sexual functioning (6 items). Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms., On treatment day 1 and every 120 days during first years of treatment and every 180 days thereafter if treatment is continued for more than 1 year|Time to next symptomatic skeletal event, Time from randomisation until first occurrence of one of the following: a symptomatic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone or a spinal cord compression, From randomisation to occurence of a skeletal event, up to 18 months|Complete prostate specific antigen (PSA) response, Defined according to PCWG3 criteria as PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, At 6 months|Prostate cancer-specific survival, Time from randomisation to the date of death due to prostate cancer (deaths due to other causes will be censored), From randomization to death from prostate cancer, up to 10 years.|Time to first subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT), Time from randomisation to the date of initiation of any SACT for CRPC, following initiation of the study treatment, From randomization up to 10 years.|Second line radiographic progression-free survival, Time from the date of initiation of a second SACT for CRPC to radiographic progression or death, whichever occurs first., From randomization up to 10 years.|Second line overall survival, Time from the date of initiation of a second SACT for CRPC to death, From randomization up to 10 years.|Progression-free survival after next line of treatment (PFS2), Time from randomisation to second objective disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever first, From randomization up to 10 years.|Geriatric status, Evaluated using the G-CODE (Paillaud, 2018), a core set of commonly used tools/items for geriatric assessment which has been validated for the collection of geriatric data in clinical cancer trials of older adults, enabling comparison across trials. The tools/items proposed in G-CODE are:

(i) Social assessment: living alone or support requested to stay at home; (ii) Functional autonomy: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaire and short instrumental ADL questionnaire (4-IADL); (iii) Mobility: Timed Up and Go test; (iv) Nutrition: weight loss during the past 6 months and body mass index; (v) Cognition: Mini-Cog test; (vi) Mood: mini-Geriatric Depression Scale; (vii) Comorbidity: updated Charlson Comorbidity Index., At baseline and every 120 days during first years of treatment and every 180 days thereafter if treatment is continued for more than 1 year|Time to deterioration for EORTC QLQ-PR25 symptom subscales, Defined as the first decline in the HRQoL score from baseline equal to or greater than the minimally important difference (MID; a measure of clinical significance) defined as half the standard deviation of the baseline value for each subscale. The prostate cancer module QLQ-PR25 is a 25-item questionnaire designed for use among patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer. It includes subscales assessing urinary symptoms (9 items), bowel symptoms (4 items), treatment-related symptoms (6 items) and sexual functioning (6 items). Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms., On treatment day 1 and every 120 days during first years of treatment and every 180 days thereafter if treatment is continued for more than 1 year|Health related quality of life questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30, Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., On treatment day 1 and every 120 days during first years of treatment and every 180 days thereafter if treatment is continued for more than 1 year|Health related quality of life questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-PR25, This EORTC prostate cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The Short Form of the questionnaire (BPI-SF) has been specifically developed for clinical trials., On treatment day 1 and every 120 days during first years of treatment and every 180 days thereafter if treatment is continued for more than 1 year
This is a Phase III, international, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded placebo controlled trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ADT +/- darolutamide in castration-naïve de novo metastatic prostate cancer patients with vulnerable functional ability who have not elected for docetaxel or other androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. The study plans to enroll 300 patients who will be randomized (1:1) to receive either: (i) Experimental arm: ADT + darolutamide 600 mg po bid, or (ii) Control arm: ADT + placebo po bid. Response to treatment will be assessed according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria (Scher, 2016). Treatment will be continued until radiographic disease progression. Treatment may also be terminated at the initiative of either the patient or the investigator for any reason that would be beneficial to the patient, including: unacceptable toxicity, intercurrent conditions that preclude continuation of treatment, or patient request. Following treatment discontinuation patients will enter the follow-up period and will be monitored for up to 10 years with regards to survival status, subsequent antineoplastic treatments and the status of ongoing adverse events (AEs) and/or new investigational product related AEs.
