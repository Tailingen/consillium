Real-world Elecsys® GAAD Implementation and Validation to Improve Surveillance and Early Detection of HCC
Patients with liver cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which implies significant mortality. At present current surveillance methods detect hepatocellular carcinomas at a late stage resulting in few treatment options for patients and, in the majority of cases, premature death.

The goal of this study is to implement Elecsys® GAAD in real-world hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance for those with liver cirrhosis.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the introduction of the Elecsys® GAAD algorithm to the surveillance pathway increase early detection of HCC?
* Does the introduction of the Elecsys® GAAD algorithm to the surveillance pathway reduce false positive tests and unnecessary confirmatory investigations?
* Does the new surveillance pathway improve adherence?

Researchers will compare Elecsys® GAAD with standard of care tests to see if it results in earlier detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and will explore potential improvements to the surveillance pathway.
Liver Cirrhosis|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Elecsys® GAAD
Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis, Incidence recorded as number of cases per study cohort, 2 years|Stage of hepatocellular carcinoma at diagnosis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-D, 2 years
Rates of false positives for each combination of diagnostic tests, Count (%) of True/False positives for each test (against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) / computerised tomography (CT)) will be reported.

Results from different tests (and their (meaningful) combination) will be tabulated against each other:

* Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) vs GAAD
* Ultrasound scan (USS) vs GAAD
* AFP+ USS vs GAAD
* AFP+USS vs GAAD +USS
* AFP/GAAD/USS/AFP+USS/GAAD+USS vs MRI/CT for those who proceed to confirmatory imaging., 2 years|Rates of curative treatment, Rates of curative treatment being offered (%) will be recorded on an intention to treat (ITT) basis from Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meeting outcomes., 2 years|Rates of adherence, • Attendance rates for biannual surveillance appointments (%), within predefined tolerance of 5-9 months post previous appointment., 2 years|Rates of discontinuation, • Count (%) of surveillance discontinuation, defined as no visit \>12 months., 2 years|Survival rates, Long-term follow up data will be collected to determine rates of survival following HCC diagnosis at 1-year, 3-years and 5-years., 7 years
