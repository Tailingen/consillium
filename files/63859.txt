An open-label, Phase 1b study of R289, an IRAK 1/4 Inhibitor, to determine tolerability and preliminary efficacy in patients with LR MDS who are relapsed/refractory/resistant, intolerant, or have inadequate response to prior therapies such as erythropoietin (EPO), luspatercept, or hypomethylating agents (HMAs) for MDS.
