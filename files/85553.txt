Phase II Study of Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Life Threatening Malignant Rare Diseases
Exploratory study to examine the effect(s) of Imatinib mesylate treatment on life threatening rare diseases with known associations to one or more Imatinib mesylate -sensitive tyrosine kinases, and to identify the contribution of specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of that specific disease.
