Clinical Study of SHR-1701 Plus Chemotherapy as Perioperative Treatment in Subjects With Gastric Cancer
This is a multi-center phase II/III clinical study consisting of two stages: Stage I is a single-arm open-label phase II study to preliminarily explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-1701 plus S-1 and oxaliplatin mainly by the endpoint of pCR rate.

Stage II is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III study of SHR-1701 plus S-1 and oxaliplatin versus placebo plus S-1 and oxaliplatin as perioperative treatment in subjects with resectable GC or GEJC. A total of 846 treatment naïve subjects will be enrolled, and primary endpoint of this stage is Independent Review Committee (IRC)-assessed EFS.
Perioperative Treatment in Subjects With Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1701 injection|DRUG: Placebo
Phase II : Pathological Complete Response pCR rate., pCR rate is defined as the proportion of subjects whose specimens (including primary lesion and lymph nodes) obtained during GC or GEJC radical surgery are pathologically assessed to be free of residual live tumor cells after neoadjuvant therapy., Up to approximately 23 months|Phase III : Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as time from randomization to PD or death (whichever occurs first), detailed that tumor progression/recurrence or new lesion confirmed by RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 57 months
Disease-free Survival (DFS)., DFS is defined as time from R0 resection to PD or death (whichever occurs first), detailed that tumor recurrence or new lesion confirmed by RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 57 months|Preoperative Objective Response Rate (ORR)., Preoperative ORR is defined as proportion of enrolled or randomized subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria during neoadjuvant therapy period., Up to approximately 57 months|Major pathological response (MPR) rates., MPR rate is defined as proportion of subjects whose primary lesion specimens obtained during GC or GEJC radical surgery are pathologically assessed to have \< 10% residual live tumor cells relative to the primary tumor tissue (Becker grade 1a or 1b) after neoadjuvant therapy., Up to approximately 23 months|R0 resection rate, R0 resection rate is defined as proportion of subjects without gross or microscopic residual tumor (negative margin) after neoadjuvant therapy and GC or GEJC radical surgery., Up to approximately 23 months|Overall Survival (OS)., OS is defined as time from randomization to death of any cause., Up to approximately 57 months|Percentage of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs)., An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The percentage of participants who experience at least one AE will be presented., Up to approximately 57 months|30-day postoperative mortality., 30-day postoperative mortality is defined as proportion of subjects who died due to any reason within 30 days after radical surgery for GC., Up to approximately 24 months
