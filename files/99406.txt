This study aims to propose an intelligent health robot that utilizes remote intelligent robots to assist patients with disease-related issues, enabling them to address their problems promptly.
Myasthenia Gravis
DEVICE: Mobile device.(phone)
Can the use of a mobile device [Disease Assistance Consultation] enhance the understanding of disease care and increase knowledge related to diseases in traditional Chinese medicine?, Each patient will be followed up after using the application system for 4 weeks. Each patient will be interviewed for 20 minutes, and the data will be compiled and written later., 4 weeks
Utilizing an information architecture system, a voice-based artificial intelligence program will be developed. The symptoms of major diseases and related knowledge will be input into this system to construct a dedicated disease platform. This platform will allow patients to remotely access it, enabling them to promptly understand and address disease-related issues, thereby improving convenience for patients.
