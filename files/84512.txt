Selective Extended Dissection in Different Types of Pancreatic Head Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly malignant tumor with relatively poor survival. Surgery is the first choice for the treatment of patients with early pancreatic cancer. However, the surgical approach and the extent of resection for patients with pancreatic cancer are controversial at present.

The investigators optimized the procedure of standard pancreaticoduodenectomy to selective extended dissection (SED), which is based on the extra-pancreatic nerve plexus (PLX) potentially invaded by tumor. The investigators retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent radical surgery in our center from 2011 to 2020. Patients who underwent standard dissection (SD) were matched 2:1 to those who underwent SED using propensity score matching (PSM). The log-rank test and cox regression model were used to analyze survival data. In addition, statistical analyses were performed for the perioperative complications, postoperative pathology and recurrence pattern.
Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal
PROCEDURE: Selective extended dissection of pancreaticoduodenectomy
Disease-free survival (DFS), From the day the patient received surgery to the time the patient was diagnosed with postoperative recurrence, assessed up to 36 months.
