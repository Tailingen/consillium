An Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of an Anti-CD19 CAR-T Product in Patients with B-cell Lymphoproliferative Disorders
This follow-up study is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of a treatment called anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in adults with certain B-cell blood cancers. These cancers include types that have returned after treatment or have not responded to other therapies. CAR-T cell therapy involves using a patient's own immune cells, which are modified in a lab to specifically target and destroy cancer cells with a marker called CD19. The study will look at how well patients tolerate this treatment over time, as well as its ability to keep cancer in remission or reduce its severity.

Patients who have previously received CAR-T therapy in an earlier clinical trial and meet specific criteria can participate in this study. The research will include regular follow-up visits over approximately 11 months to monitor for side effects, assess cancer response, and track the activity of CAR-T cells in the body. This study does not involve additional treatments but focuses on understanding the long-term outcomes of CAR-T therapy to provide better care for patients in the future.

This is a Phase I/II open-label, non-interventional, single-arm follow-up study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. CAR-T cell therapy is an advanced immunotherapy that modifies a patient's T cells to target the CD19 antigen on B cells. This follow-up study focuses on assessing the durability of treatment responses and monitoring potential late-onset adverse events in patients who previously received anti-CD19 CAR-T cells during the HemC101-01-01 trial (NCT06705530).

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety profile of second-generation anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, including the incidence, duration, and severity of adverse events. Secondary objectives include assessing the durability of clinical responses, such as overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS). Additionally, the study aims to monitor the persistence and expansion of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood and detect the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) that may impact therapeutic efficacy.

Eligible participants include adults aged 18-70 who completed the HemC101-01-01 trial and meet all inclusion criteria, such as sufficient organ function and negative pregnancy tests where applicable. This study involves periodic follow-up visits over 11 months post-CAR-T cell infusion, during which clinical assessments, laboratory evaluations, and safety monitoring will be conducted. No additional CAR-T cell infusions will be administered in this follow-up study.

The trial is conducted at a single clinical center in Russia under the sponsorship of the National Medical Research Center of Hematology, Ministry of Health of Russia. The data collected will provide insights into the long-term safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy, contributing to the development of treatment protocols and improving outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.
