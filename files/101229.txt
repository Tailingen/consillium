CS-7017 in Combination With Erlotinib in Subjects With Stage IIIb/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CS-7017 administered orally twice a day in combination with erlotinib, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of CS-7017 in combination with erlotinib.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: CS-7017|DRUG: Erlotinib
CS-7017-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring During the Study of Administration of CS-7017 Combined With Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First-line Therapy, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the drug treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the drug treatment. A CS-7017-related TEAE is an TEAE that is related to CS7017 in the relationship., From post first dose to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 1.5 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) After CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, After the first CS-7017 administration, area under the concentration-time curve from zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) and area under the concentration-time curve during dosing interval (AUCtau) were assessed., Cycle 1, Week 1 and Cycle 2, Week 4|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) After CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, After the first CS-7017 administration, observed serum concentration (Cmax) and observed serum concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss) were assessed., Cycle 1, Week 1 and Cycle 2, Week 4|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) After CS-7017 and Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, After the first CS-7017 administration, time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and time of maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Tmax,ss) were assessed., Cycle 1, Week 1 and Cycle 2, Week 4
Best Overall Response and Response Rate Following Administration of CS-7017 in Combination With Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Failed First-line Therapy, As per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.1, best overall response was characterized as complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) defined as

≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Response rate was defined as CR + PR., From screening and after completion of every 2 cycles (6 weeks) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, or loss to follow-up, up to approximately 1.5 years|Progression-free Survival Time Following Administration of CS-7017 in Combination With Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Failed First-line Therapy, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first objective documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death resulting from any cause, whichever came first., From randomization to PD or death, up to approximately 1.5 years|Erlotinib-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring During the Study of Administration of CS-7017 Combined With Erlotinib in Participants With Metastatic or Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Failed First-line Therapy, A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the drug treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the drug treatment. An erlotinib-related TEAE is an TEAE that is related to erlotinib in the relationship, From post first dose to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 1.5 years
