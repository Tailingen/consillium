A Study of Short-Course Radiation Therapy With Chemotherapy in People With Endometrial Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether short-course radiation therapy (1 week instead of the usual 5 weeks) with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) is practical (feasible), meaning that most participants are able to complete the treatment schedule.
