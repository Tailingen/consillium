Covered vs Uncovered Metal Stents for Palliative Biliary Decompression in Inoperable Malignant Distal Bile Duct Obstruction
The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of long-term stent failure, defined as need for repeat biliary intervention following placement of C-SEMS vs U-SEMS for palliation of inoperable malignant distal bile duct obstruction.
Distal Bile Duct Obstruction
DEVICE: Covered Self-expanding metal biliary stents (C-SEMS)|DEVICE: Uncovered Self-expanding metal biliary stents (U-SEMS)
Rate of Long-term Stent Failure, Compare the rate of long-term stent failure, defined as need for repeat biliary intervention (endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical) following placement of C-SEMS vs U-SEMS for palliation of inoperable malignant distal bile duct obstruction., One year
Rates of Adverse Stent-related or Intervention-related Outcomes, Participants will be monitored for adverse stent-related or intervention-related outcomes such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, perforation., One Year
