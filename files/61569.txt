PD-1 +/- IL-4 Inhibition in ER+ Breast Cancer
This proposal is for a Window of Opportunity (WOO) clinical trial using a novel combination of two Health Canada approved agents, cemiplimab (Libtayo) and dupilumab (Dupixent), for off label use in early-stage estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Arm A: Cemiplimab, Arm B: Cemiplimab + Dupilumab
Immune Cell Population Analysis, The % change in various immune cell populations (CD3, CD8, macrophages and DC cells) in the tumor and microenvironment, Defined as the post-treatment value / pre-treatment value \* 100%, up to 6 months
Study Participant Assessment of Adverse Effects, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse effects of patients treated with short term cemiplimab + dupilumab, using NCI-CTCAE, up to 6 months
PD-1 Gene Expression, PD-1 Gene expression analysis in pre treatment tissue samples expression and its effect on the immune response in treated and untreated patients, up to 6 months
This is a phase II, open-label, randomized window of opportunity trial evaluating the immunologic effects within the tumour, microenvironment, and host blood of patients treated with either

* Arm A: Cemiplimab (n=10)
* Arm B: Cemiplimab + Dupilumab (n=10) administered prior to surgery. Randomization will be at 1:1 ratio in patients newly diagnosed with primary operable ER+\* HER2- invasive breast cancer awaiting surgery in the next 4-6 weeks who are not planned for neoadjuvant therapy.

Primary Hypothesis: In ER+ breast cancer, blockade of IL-4 signalling using dupilumab enhances anti-tumor immunity (through reduced Th2 skewing) when used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors (Cemiplimab) compared to PD-1 inhibition alone in ER+ breast cancer

Primary Objective:

• To determine whether addition of dupilumab to cemiplimab reduces TH2 skewing of the tumor, tumor microenvironment (TME) and blood in patients with ER+ breast cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate dynamic changes in immune cell populations as measured by in situ proteomics
* To characterize the safety of a short-term duration of the combination of dupilumab with cemiplimab in patients with ER+ breast cancer awaiting surgery

Exploratory Objective:

• To test the effect of tumor PD-1 gene expression and its effect on the immune response in treated and untreated patients

This is a window of opportunity trial which will require administration of cemiplimab or combination of cemiplimab + dupilumab prior to surgery. Surgery will be a minimum of 96 hours to 2 weeks after the cemiplimab. Patient follow-up after surgery will be for a period of 30 days post-surgery.

Target: 20 patients (10 in Arm A and 10 in Arm B). Accounting for screen failures and withdrawals (20%), 24 patients will be accrued.
