Uveal Melanoma - Comparative Study
The progress of uveal melanoma is typically monitored with sonography by experienced onco-ophthalmologists. However, there is evidence that twodimensional measurements in color fundus photography match precisely with sonography measurements. This study aims to compare sonography and color fundus photography measurements in order to evaluate the feasibility of monitoring of uveal melanoma with color fundus photography.
