Anti-cancer MUC1-specific Immunotherapy for Unresectable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Phase Ib study investigating whether liposome BLP25 mucin-1 (MUC1) peptide-specific immunotherapy (L-BLP25) administered as weekly subcutaneous doses over 8 weeks following a single dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CPA) induces a reproducible cytokine pattern measured in the serum of unresected Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects after first-line chemo-radiation therapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Stage III
OTHER: Biological: MUC1 peptide specific immunotherapy|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide (CPA)
Immune response defined as change from baseline in serum cytokine levels after L-BLP25 administration at Week 1, 4 and 8, Pre-dose (Day -3) up to 24 hours after L-BLP25 administration at Week 1, 4 and 8
Evaluation of a cellular immune response following treatment with L-BLP25, Pre-dose (Day -3) and at 24 hours after L-BLP25 administration at Week 4 and 8|Change from baseline in alternative immune or inflammatory serum soluble immune mediators such as interferon alpha (IFNα), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), or C-reactive protein (CRP) at 6, 12, and 24 hours after L-BLP25 administration., Pre-dose (Day -3) up to 24 hours after L-BLP25 administration at Week 1, 4 and 8|Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), Up to 6 weeks after the last dose of L-BLP25
