Clinical Study on 5-aminolevulinic Acid Hydrochloride (5-ALA) for Fluorescence-guided Resection of Malignant Gliomas
This study is planned to detect a dose-efficacy relationship between the chosen dose levels of MC506/1 and the extent and quality of fluorescence in the tumour core in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.
Brain Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: Gliolan
Detection of a dose-efficacy relationship between the dose levels and the extent and quality of fluorescence in the tumour core (of newly diagnosed malignant glioma)., After completion of resection, global fluorescence extent in the tumour core will be assessed by the first and second surgeon. It will be estimated whether approx. 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 or 3/3 of the tumour core is identified using standard white operation light were fluorescent (irrespective of fluorescence quality). The global quality of Gliolan induced tissue fluorescence within the tumour core will be recorded as being strong, weak or missing. As an objective control of the subjective assessment of the fluorescent quality, selected areas will be measured spectrometrically., Within 3 hours
