Selective Neck Dissection Versus Modified Neck Dissection in PTC
This study is a phase III, randomized controlled, open label non inferiority study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria are randomly assigned 1:1 to either the experimental group (selective neck dissection) or the control group (modified neck dissection), with LRFS as the primary endpoint. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety of selective neck dissection in papillary carcinoma with limited number of lymph node metastases in the lateral neck, and the quality of life compared with modified neck dissection.
Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Lymph node tracer navigated selective neck dissection|PROCEDURE: Modified neck dissection
Local-regional Recurrence Free Survival，LRFS, The time from surgery to the recurrence based on RECIST 1.1,. The definition of local-regional areas includes thyroid area, cervical I-VII lymph nodes, and retropharyngeal lymph nodes., 5 years
Local-regional Recurrence Rate，LRR, The percentage of patients with local-regional recurrence in the total number of patients., 5 years|Progression Free Survival，PFS, The time from surgery to tumor progression, including local-regional recurrence and distant metastasis., 5 years|Overall Survival，OS, The time from surgery to patient death, 5 years|Adverse Events，AE, The name of AE (based on NCI-CTCAE V5.0 criteria), severity, duration, and correlation with surgery., 5 years|Quality of Life as assessed by UW-QOL V4.1, Quality of life assessments will be conducted at 1 week, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery. The QoL evaluation scale adopts the Washington University Quality of Life Questionnaire V4.1 (UW-QOL V4.1)., 5 years|Quality of Life as assessed by QoL/Thyroid, Quality of life assessments will be conducted at 1 week, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery. The QoL evaluation scale adopts the Thyroid Cancer Quality of Life Scale QoL/Thyroid., 5 years
