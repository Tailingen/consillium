HAIC Compared With TACE in Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study intends to compare the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemical embolization (TACE) with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for patients with intermediate-advanced huge hepatocellular carcinoma.

PROCEDURE: TACE|PROCEDURE: HAIC
Objective response rate, ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to mRECIST, is defined as the proportion of all included patients whose best overall response (BOR) is either a complete response or partial response., 6 months
Progression-Free-Survival, Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review, 12 months|Overall survival, OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 24 months
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) are effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For huge HCC (≥10 cm), the prognosis of this high tumor-burden subtype usually indicates poor outcome and big challenge. TACE is difficult to completely embolize all tumor arteries, so patients have limited benefit from pure hepatic artery embolization. At the same time, excessive embolization will lead to massive tumor necrosis in a short time, and inflammatory necrosis factor will enter the blood, resulting in systemic inflammatory response. HAIC have showed good efficacy especially for advanced huge HCC (≥10 cm) complicated with portal vein tumor thrombus and arteriovenous fistula, and HAIC therapy can be performed with better and higher tumor control.
