Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) of Suspicious Breast Cancers - A Clinical Feasibility Study
After locating the suspicious lesion/mass with standard of care mammography and/or ultrasound, a photoacoustic scan will be performed in the breast where the lesion is located. After the PA scan a biopsy will be performed, if clinically indicated (based on the mammogram and ultrasound only).
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI)
The lesion visibility on PAI, described using a five-level scale: 1. Not visible 2. Barely visible 3. Fair (or moderately visible) 4. Visible 5. Clearly visible., 6 months
Measures of hypoxia in the lesion, 6 months
