A Study of Ramucirumab and Docetaxel in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of concomitant ramucirumab on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors.

Participants who do not complete both Cycle 1, Day 1, and Cycle 2, Day 1 according to schedule will be replaced for the purpose of analysis; these participants may continue to receive study therapy. No dose reductions, delayed or missed doses are allowed during Cycles 1 and 2.
Malignant Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Docetaxel From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] Following a Single Dose in Cycle 1, Cycle 1: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 24, 48 and 72 hours post docetaxel infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Docetaxel From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] Following a Single Dose in Cycle 2, Cycle 2: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 24, 48 and 72 hours post docetaxel infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Docetaxel in Cycle 1, Cycle 1: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 24, 48, and 72 hours post docetaxel infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Docetaxel in Cycle 2, Cycle 2: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 24, 48 and 72 hours post docetaxel infusion
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Participants with treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies were participants with a 4-fold increase (2 dilution increase) in immunogenicity titer over baseline titer, or participants who tested negative at baseline and positive post-baseline (at titer of ≥1:20)., Cycle 1, Day 1 through Cycle 2, Day 1 and 30 days after last dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Ramucirumab From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] in the Presence of Docetaxel, Cycle 2: 1 hour prior to ramucirumab infusion, 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 25, 49, 73, 169, 265 and 337 hours post ramucirumab infusion|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab in the Presence of Docetaxel, Cycle 2: 1 hour prior to ramucirumab infusion, 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 25, 49, 73, 169, 265 and 337 hours post ramucirumab infusion
