An Open-Label Study of Ruxolitinib Given With Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a study of ruxolitinib in combination with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel administered to patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts.

Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ruxolitinib when given as described to patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. A goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib when given with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel. This dose will be selected for use in Part 2 of the study.

Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary clinical activity of ruxolitinib at the dose defined in Part 1 used in combination with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

After multiple challenges of trial conduct, by mutual agreement between investigators and sponsor, dose escalation ended after Cohort B1, RUX 10 mg twice daily (BID) - GCSF in October 2014. Therefore, the MTD was not reached. No safety issues led to the decision to stop further enrollment.

Because of the early study termination, samples for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and computed tomography for tumor burden were collected, but not analyzed; analysis data are not available. The data cutoff for this posting is 22 SEP 2015. As of the data cutoff, 1 subject was receiving treatment in the study and had been enrolled for 47 weeks. This subject had their end of treatment visit in AUG 2016. A comparison of this subjects' safety data after the cutoff date showed no clinically meaningful differences (eg, adverse events) compared with safety results that are summarized here.
Solid Tumors|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: ruxolitinib|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: filgrastim
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events That Are Defined as Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Toxicities occurring during the first treatment cycle (Cycle 1) defined tolerability. Within each cohort, subjects were considered evaluable if they had received at least 40 of 56 planned doses of RUX during the 28-day surveillance period and received 2 of the 3 planned doses of chemotherapy (gemcitabine and/or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) at the assigned dose level, or they had experienced a DLT., Approximately 28 days
Plasma Concentrations Will be Used to Estimate Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC)., Day 1 and Day 8|Plasma Concentration of Tumor Specific Biomarkers and Cytokines Before and During Treatment., Up to 6 months|Clinical Activity as Measured by the Greatest Decrease in Tumor Burden Compared to Baseline., Approximately 6 months|Percentage of Participants With a Best Response by RECIST Criteria, Best response was determined on the subject level using the highest overall response achieved post-baseline. In the case of stable disease (SD), measurements had to meet the SD criterion at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 49 days. Subjects who failed to meet this criterion had best response of progressive disease (PD) if the next available RECIST evaluation after the initial scan indicated PD or not evaluable (NE) if no additional RECIST evaluations were available.

Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, or persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., every 2 cycles starting at Cycle 3 Day 1 up to approximately 4 to 6 months|Percentage of Responders, Duration of response was measured as the time from the first overall response contributing to an objective response to the first overall response of progressive disease (PD) occurring after the first overall response contributing to the objective response., Randomization to clinical cutoff 22Sept2015 (approx 244 days)|Duration of Response, Duration of response was the time from the first overall response contributing to an objective response to the first overall response of progressive disease (PD) occurring after the first overall response contributing to the objective response. Confidence intervals for median duration of response were calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982)., Randomization to clinical cutoff 22Sept2015 (approx 244 days)
