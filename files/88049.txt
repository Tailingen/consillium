uPAR PET/CT in Radium-223-dichloride Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) / CT molecular imaging in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
Prostate Cancer Metastatic|Bone Metastases
DRUG: Injection of PET tracer 68Ga-NOTA-AE105|DEVICE: PET/CT
uPAR PET/CT imaging, Standard uptake values (SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 evaluated on uPAR-PET/CT scan performed within 1 hour following injection of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, 1 hour post injection|Change in uPAR PET/CT after two cycles of Radium-223, Change in Standard uptake values (SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 evaluated on uPAR-PET/CT scan performed after 2 cycles of Radium-223 therapy, 8 weeks
uPAR PET/CT as prognostic factor for overall survival, Patients will be followed for 12 months after uPAR PET/CT, 12 months|uPAR PET/CT as prognostic factor for progression free survival, Patients will be followed for 12 months after uPAR PET/CT, 12 months
68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/CT will be applied in patients with mCRPC during treatment with Radium-223. PET/CT will be performed before initiation of Radium therapy and after two treatment cycles. The initial semiquantitative uptake (standard uptake values, SUVs) of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in metastases as well as the change in these parameters after therapy will be correlated with overall survival and progression free survival.
