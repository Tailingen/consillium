Study of XNW5004 Tablet in Combination With Enzalutamide in Subjects With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
In this phase Ib/II study, participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who failed prior novel hormone therapy will be treated with XNW5004 in combination with enzalutamide.
Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer|mCRPC (Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer)
DRUG: XNW5004|DRUG: enzalutamide
Ph Ib/IIa: Overall safety profile including adverse events, Adverse Events will be graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version \[5.0\]), Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Ph Ib/IIa: Recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of XNW5004 in combination with enzalutamide, RP2D of XNW5004 as administered orally twice daily (BID), continuously in 28-day cycles, in combination with enzalutamide in subjects with mCRPC by safety data, pharmacokinetic data, pharmacodynamic data and efficacy data, Approximately 6 months|Preliminary efficacy determination as evaluated by disease specific response criteria, Radiographic Progression-free survival（rPFS）was defined as the time from the date of first administration of the study drug to the date of radiographic progression base on the investigator assessment per PCWG3 criteria or death due to any cause (whichever comes first) in Phase IIa/IIb., Baseline until disease progression or death or through study completion (approximately 2 years)
Ph Ib/IIa: Pharmacokinetic Parameters, The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Ph Ib/IIa: Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Ph Ib/IIa: Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Elimination half-life (t1/2), The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Ph Ib/IIa: Pharmacokinetic Parameters, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Ph Ib: Pharmacodynamic Parameters, The relative change from baseline in H3K27me3 (trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3)/ total histone H3., The first 28-day cycle of therapy|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). ORR was based on RECIST 1.1 response for patients with measurable disease at baseline reviewed by the investigator., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 reviewed by the investigator., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Evaluate overall survival, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of first administration to the date of death due to any cause., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Proportion of patients with a PSA response at week 12, Proportion of patients with a PSA response (a decrease of PSA ≥ 50% compared to baseline) after 12 weeks of treatment, which need to be confirmed more than one time consecutively by PSA test with a minimum of 3 weeks time interval., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Prostate-specific Antigen 50 (PSA50) Response, Proportion of patients with a PSA response greater than or equal to 50% throughout the entire treatment course., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), The time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the first occurrence of a SSE, including the use of external radiation therapy (EBRT) to prevent or alleviate bone symptoms, the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological fractures (vertebrae or non vertebrae), the occurrence of spinal cord compression, and tumor related orthopaedic surgical intervention, whichever comes first., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Ph IIb：Overall safety profile including adverse events, Adverse Events will be graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology ACriteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version \[5.0\]), Baseline up to approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, phase Ib/II clinical trial, divided into three parts:

The part1 is the dose escalation study of XNW5004 combined with Enzalutamide (Dose escalation in phase Ib) .

The part2 is the dose expansion study of XNW5004 combined with Enzalutamide (Dose expansion in phase IIa).

The phase Ib and IIa will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XNW5004 in combination with enzalutamide to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

The part3 is an open label, randomized phase 2 study (Phase IIb). The patients with mCRPC will be enrolled to assess the efficacy of XNW5004 at the RP2D in combination with Enzalutamide in comparison with Enzalutamide alone.
