Oral TEAD Inhibitor Targeting the Hippo Pathway in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of IK-930, an oral TEAD inhibitor, administered orally (PO) as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors with or without gene alterations in the Hippo pathway for whom there are no further treatment options known to confer clinical benefit. The study consists of two phases, an initial Dose Escalation phase followed by a Dose Expansion phase.
