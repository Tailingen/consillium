SWE-NEO: Swedish NeoAdjuvant Trial Comparing Monotherapy to Combined Immunotherapy in Resectable Stage III Melanoma
At present two studies (SWOG S1801 and NADINA) have demonstrated superiority when using neoadjuvant treatment compared to adjuvant treatment only, but no studies have compared PD-1 monotherapy (SWOG 1801 regimen) to the PD-1/CTLA-4 combination (NADINA regimen) therapy. The SWE-NEO study aims to compare these two regimens, where the PD-1/CTLA-4 combination is potentially more effective, but also associated with more side effects.

Correlation of different biological markers with treatment efficacy and safety, The explorative endpoints of this trial are:

Correlation of different biological markers analyzed from sequential blood and tumor samples with treatment efficacy and safety., From start of neoadjuvant therapy to last blood/tumour sample taken, until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months
A phase III randomized controlled multicenter open-label trial. Patients will be randomized after a diagnosis of resectable stage III melanoma to have either two courses of CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitor combination therapy or PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy, before the pre-planned operation. In both arms, adjuvant treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor or with BRAF+MEK inhibitors in patients with a BRAF V600E mutation, will be given only to patients with no major pathological response in the operated tumor, with PD-1 inhibitor, or with BRAF+MEK inhibitors in patients with BRAF V600E mutation. Active follow-up will be performed for 3 years from surgery and followed for survival up until 10 years. Sequential blood and tumor samples will be collected for biomarker analyses.
