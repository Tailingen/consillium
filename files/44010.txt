A Survey for Factors That Influence Postoperative Treatment Decision-making for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a non-interventional and questionnaire survey study. The investigators try to find out patient's willingness and expectation for post-operative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as patients' willingness to participate in clinical trials using a questionnaire. The ultimate goal is to assist physicians in clinical treatment decision, clinical research, and government health and economic decision-making, as well as to help investigators understand how to increase public awareness of the HCC and the treatment course and efficacy of HCC, and the awareness of clinical trials.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
HCC patients' willingness and expectation for post-operative treatment., Use questionnaires to understand the willingness and expectation of patients for post-operative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as their willingness to participate in clinical trials., 6 months
There is no world widely accepted adjuvant therapy for HCC and the guidelines from AASLD or EASL did not recommend any adjuvant therapy to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence of HCC. The goal of an adjuvant therapy is to meet the requirements of patients, which are influenced by many factors such as the strength of doctors' recommendation, economic affordability, tolerance of adverse reactions to treatment, and expectation of efficacy. Therefore, understanding patients' expectations for an adjuvant therapy after surgery will help doctors give more reasonable treatment. Participating in clinical trials is a new process of understanding and acceptance for each patient, so investigators try to understand the willingness and ideas of patients to participate in clinical trials, so as to provide more information for designing clinical trials and recruiting subjects for clinical trials.
