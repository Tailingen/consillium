Preliminary Assessment of [18F]BL40 in PET/CT Scans
CXCR4 is type of receptor that has been detected in more than twenty different subtypes of cancers. Most of these cancers are associated with negative symptoms that worsen over time resulting in great disability and poor function. There is a need for novel tracers to image CXCR4-expressing tumors for better detection, staging, and monitoring of aggressive cancers without the need for invasive biopsy procedures that may not always properly capture the extent of a patient's disease.

This study looks to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel radiopharmaceutical known as 18F-BL40 through its use in a PET/CT scan. Participants will receive 2 PET/CT scans:

18F-BL40 and 18F-FDG as part of this study.

This is a prospective registry study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-BL40 PET/CT to stage patients with CXCR4-expressing tumors, localize sites of tumors and assess safety and biodistribution of this drug in PET/CT scans.

Each subject will receive two PET/CT scans, one using 18F-BL40 and the other using 18F-FDG. The 18F-BL40 radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada. 18F-FDG is considered standard care and has been approved by Health Canada.

Follow-up assessments: All subjects will be contacted by phone the day after the injection of 18F-BL40. The subjects will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects during the 18-72 hours after the administration of 18F-BL40. The local site attending nuclear medicine physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects are likely related to 18F-BL40 administration.

All subjects will be followed for at least 6 months following the 18F-BL40 PET/CT exam. The evaluation will include a chart review of available imaging, laboratory tests, and treatment. The data required can be obtained from a review of the patient's paper and electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact as needed to complete the information.
