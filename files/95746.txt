Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Receiving Ibrutinib
Ibrutinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting Bruton) is a standard of treatment in haematology. According to retrospective data, atrial fibrillation and systemic hypertension are common ibrutinib-related advserse events. The investigators aim at prospectively establishing the incidence of thesedrug related advsere events through clinical monitoring and attempt at identifying populations at risk.
