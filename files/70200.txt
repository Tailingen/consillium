A Retrospective Study: Evaluation of the Efficacy of Immunotherapy With Rare Mutations in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
In advanced non-small cell lung cancer, there will be some rare mutations, such as ALK, KRAS, etc. The efficacy of these immunotherapies on these different rare mutations has not been reported. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective clinical study to explore the efficacy of immunotherapy for different rare mutations.
