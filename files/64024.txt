To Prevent Type I-II Myoma After TCRM Recurrence by Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH )Analogues or Mifepristone
Transcervical resection of myoma(TCRM) has a good therapeutic effect while the probability of complete resection of type I and II fibroids is only 55% per procedure on average and a significant number of patients have fibroid remained.At present, there is no standardized treatment option for reducing the remaining submucous fibroids volume and preventing its recurrence after TCRM.The present prospective,multicentre,randomised controlled clinical trial will enrol women after TCRM and treat them with mifepristone(10mg)or GnRHa(3.60mg)for 3 to 6 months,investigating the effective and cost-effective treatment options after fibroids with TCRM，thus to provide evidence and effectual regiments for reducing remaining fibroids volume and preventing its recurrence.

the remaining submucous fibroids volume, The change of residual fibroid volume is compared to residual fibroid volume measured by ultrasound and /or MRI one month after surgery;, one to three years after TCRM
the recurrence rate of remaining submucous fibroids and time, recurrent submucosal fibroids include increased menstrual flow and continued growth of residual submucosal fibroids., one to three years after TCRM|the recurrence time of remaining submucous fibroids, the time interval between recurrent submucosal fibroids and TCRM, one to three years after TCRM
