Study of AR-67 in Adult Patients With Recurrence of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) or Gliosarcoma
The primary objective of this study is to determine the 6-month Progression free survival (PFS) when intravenous (IV) AR-67 is administered in adults with confirmed recurrence of GBM who have not recently (\> 90 days) recurred after treatment bevacizumab (including patients who've received temazolamide, but no bevacizumab). The primary objective in the rapid bevacizumab failure group (\< 90 days) is to determine the 2-month PFS.
