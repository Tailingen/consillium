Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and Letrozole in Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Letrozole may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens. Giving DHEA together with letrozole may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of DHEA when given together with letrozole in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: letrozole|DRUG: DHEA|OTHER: pharmacological study
Dose-limiting toxicity, Subjects will be monitored at day 14 and then every 2 weeks for up to one year., One year from drug start
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the maximum tolerable dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when given together with letrozole in patients with androgen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone and oral letrozole once daily. Physical exams and blood collections are performed every two weeks. Tumor assessments are performed once every three months.
