Combination of Carboplatin, Eribulin Mesylate, and E7449 in BRCA-Related Cancers
Non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I/II, dose-escalation study of the combination of carboplatin, eribulin, and E7449.
Cancer of the Breast
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: E7449
Safety of E7449 will be measured by the number, frequency and severity of adverse events., Patients will be evaluated by MD at clinic visits during Cycle 1, on Day 1 of all 21-day cycles, and will have additional evaluations if clinically indicated., Baseline to 24 months|MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of E7449 will be measured by the number, frequency and severity of adverse events., Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined as highest dose studied in which the incidence of non-hematologic DLT (dose limiting toxicity) is defined as any Grade ≥ 3 toxicity, and a hematologic DLT is defined as any Grade ≥ 4 toxicity, both by CTCAE v 4.03 criteria., Baseline to 21 days
Overall response rate will be measured by the evaluation of target and non-target lesions for changes in tumor measurements., The overall response rate (ORR) will be defined as response after scans (CT or MRI) assessed after two cycles of therapy (1 cycle = 3 weeks)., Baseline to first occurrence of disease progression or death. (up to 6 weeks)
This is a phase I/II clinical trial of the combination of carboplatin, eribulin, and E7449. A cycle will be defined as 21 days. Carboplatin will be given on day 1 of each cycle. Eribulin will be given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. E7449 will be given daily (days 1-21) during each cycle. Patients will continue to receive treatment until progression of disease or discontinuation due to unacceptable side effects.
