Serplulimab Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Treatment Esophageal Cancer in Old Age
This study is a Single Arm, Prospective, Exploratory, Single Center Phase II Clinical Study to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of Serplulimab and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who cannot be treated surgically.Subjects can be enrolled into this study only if they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria.
Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: Serplulimab
mPFS, Median Progression-Free-Survival, up to one year
ORR, overall response rate, through study completion, an average of 18 month|OS, Overall Survival, through study completion, an average of 18 month|DOR, During of response, through study completion, an average of 18 month|Toxic side reactions, The US Toxicity Evaluation Standard (CTC5.0) is divided into O\~4 grades, and the evaluation of acute radiation reactions adopts RTOG/EROTC criteria, through study completion, an average of 18 month
It is expected that 50 patients will be enrolled, and patients who meet the enrollment criteria will undergo esophagoscopy, esophageal barium meal examination, chest contrast-enhanced CT, abdominal ultrasound, electrocardiogram, blood routine, whole body bone scan, liver and kidney function and other examinations before treatment, and esophageal ultrasound if necessary. Patients who received esophageal ultrasound were staged by esophageal ultrasound results, and those without esophageal ultrasound were mainly staged according to the cervical chest and epigastric contrast CT and esophageal barium plates, and clinical staging was performed according to the AJCC staging standard. After the combination of Serplulimab and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, adverse reactions and efficacy evaluation were observed. The expected result is that the local control rate of Serplulimab combined with chemoradiotherapy is improved in patients with locally advanced elderly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and there is no significant increase in adverse reactions, and serological indicators such as PDL-1 CPS can be used as prognostic indicators for esophageal malignancy and have certain guiding significance for treatment. PD-1 monoclonal antibody can be used in locally advanced elderly esophageal cancer patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy, with good short-term efficacy and tolerable toxic side effects, which further provides reference value for clinical guidance.
