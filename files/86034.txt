Quaratusugene Ozeplasmid (Reqorsa) and Atezolizumab Maintenance Therapy in ES-SCLC Patients
This clinical trial will evaluate the combination of quaratusugene ozeplasmid with atezolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC).

The study is comprised of 2 phases, a dose selection phase (Phase 1) and a safety and efficacy evaluation phase (Phase 2).
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
BIOLOGICAL: quaratusugene ozeplasmid|BIOLOGICAL: atezolizumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) - Phase 1, The MTD and/or RP2D of the combination of quaratusugene ozeplasmid and atezolizumab.

Note: if a MTD is not determined, the RP2D will be selected based on all available data (safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy)., First 21-days at each dose level|Progression-Free Survival Rate (PFSR) - Phase 2, PFSR at 18 weeks according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., 18-weeks from Day 1 of maintenance therapy
Safety Profile - Phase 1, Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0, Approximately 6 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Phase 1 & Phase 2, PFS per RECIST 1.1. PFS is defined as time from Day 1 of maintenance therapy to disease progression or death., Approximately 5 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Quaratusugene Ozeplasmid - Phase 1 & Phase 2, Concentration of quaratusugene ozeplasmid in whole blood samples., First 21-day treatment cycle|Overall Survival (OS) - Phase 1 & Phase 2, Number of months from Day 1 of maintenance therapy to the date of death., Approximately 18 months
Acclaim-3 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of quaratusugene ozeplasmid with atezolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with ES-SCLC who did not develop tumor progression after receiving at least 3 cycles, and no more than 4 cycles, of induction therapy with carboplatin plus etoposide and atezolizumab.

Toxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be reviewed by a safety review committee.

Phase 1: Enrollment in Phase 1 is complete and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of quaratusugene ozeplasmid when given in combination with atezolizumab was determined.

Phase 2: Enrollment has been initiated and enrolled patients are treated with quaratusugene ozeplasmid at the RP2D in combination with atezolizumab.
