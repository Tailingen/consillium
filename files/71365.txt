Aflibercept in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This phase II trial is studying how well aflibercept works in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Aflibercept may be able to carry cancer-killing substances directly to myelodysplastic syndrome cells. It may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer

Hematological Response Rate, Complete Response (CR): repeat bone marrow (BM) shows \<5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood values lasting ≥ 2 months of hemoglobin (hgb) (\>110 g/L), neutrophils (≥1.0x10\^9/L), platelets (≥100x10\^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia. Partial Response (PR): same as CR for peripheral blood except BM shows blasts decrease by ≥ 50% but still \> 5% or a less advanced FAB classification from pretreatment. Hematological response=CR+PR., Up to 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the antitumor activity of aflibercept as assessed by the hematological response rate.

II. To determine overall and progression-free survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

III. To assess hematologic improvement and time to leukemic transformation. IV. To assess the toxicity profile of aflibercept in this patient population. V. To perform correlative studies to better understand the ability of aflibercept to reach and modulate its respective targets.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients will receive aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained periodically for pharmacokinetic and biomarker correlative studies. Pharmacokinetic analysis by ELISA; anti-aflibercept antibody measurements; analysis of VEGF and VEGFR expression; and analysis of gene expression by quantitative PCR will be conducted. The effect of aflibercept on apoptosis and proliferation of CD34+ cells will also be analyzed by flow cytometry based assays.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
