Compassionate Use of Brontictuzumab for Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC)
The goal of this study is to start treatment with the NOTCH1 inhibitor brontictuzumab in an attempt to control tumors and prolong survival. The therapy involves participant being given the drug brontictuzumab to treat adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) with NOTCH 1 mutations. This is considered an investigational treatment.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: Brontictuzumab
Number of Participants With Disease Progression, Tumor response for measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) to establish disease progression. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 6 weeks
Treatment:

Participant will receive brontictuzumab by vein over 30 minutes one time every 3 weeks.

Clinic Visits:

On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 weeks from then on:

* Participant will have a physical exam
* Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

Every 6 weeks, participant will have an MRI and CT scan to check the status of the disease.

Length of Treatment:

Participant may continue taking brontictuzumab for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, they develop another illness that prevents receiving more treatment, or if intolerable side effects occur.

Brontictuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.
