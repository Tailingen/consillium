Brigatinib in Relapsed or Refractory ALK-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
FDA approved drugs to treat patients with relapsed or refractory anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has a median progression free survival of 20 months. Majority of patients relapse in 2 years. This study will evaluate overall response rate of next generation ALK inhibitor brigatinib in ALK positive ALCL patients by overcoming mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors on cancer patients.

To evaluate the frequency of NPM/ALK quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) positivity in plasma, Detection of the NPM/ALK fusion gene via quantitative PCR (qPCR) in plasma, 2 years|The evaluate the persistence of NPM/ALK DNA construct in plasma and correlation with rate of relapse, NPM-ALK DNA construct in plasma will be measured prospectively by polymerase chain reaction, 2 years|To evaluate for ALK mutations in tumor and plasma at baseline and at time of relapse, ALK mutations in tumor and plasma will be analyzed by next generation sequencing, 2 years|Changes in ALK-dependent NF-kB activation, NFKB1 and NFKB2 nuclear translocation/accumulation will be tested by immune histochemistry (IHC), 2 years|Changes in ALK phosphorylation, ALK phosphorylation (indicator of brigatinib efficacy) will be tested by immune histochemistry (IHC), 2 years|Changes in TRAF2 expression, TRAF2 expression (E3 ligase required for ALK mediation of NF-kB activation) will be tested by immune histochemistry (IHC), 2 years|To evaluate gene expression profiles before and after treatment with brigatinib, Gene expression profiling of NF-kB will be performed in tumor before and after treatment with brigatinib, 2 years
Although patients with ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), are considered to have a favorable prognosis, relapse is not uncommon if multiple International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk factors, age ≥ 40, and beta-2 microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L are present at diagnosis. For patients older than 40 years at diagnosis and beta-2 microglobulin ≥ 3 mg/L, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) is less than 50% at 2.5 years when treated with standard anthracycline-based induction therapy. Patients with ALK+ ALCL with 3 or more IPI risk factors have a 5-year PFS rate of only 20% to 30%. In total, approximately 40 to 65% of patients with ALCL develop recurrent disease after front-line chemotherapy and at relapse, the disease is historically resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

Current FDA approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory PTCLs have a median PFS of 20 months and majority of patients relapse within 2 years. Despite ALK tyrosine kinase being an attractive target for management of relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL, ALK gene rearrangement makes cancer resistant to first and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors. Brigatinib is a next generation inhibitor with broad activity aganst a broad spetrum of resistant ALK mutants. Brigatinib has been shown to overcome mechanisms associated with resistane to 1st and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors. It is approved as 2nd line of treament in non small cell lung cancer patients. and is being tested in patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive ALCL.
