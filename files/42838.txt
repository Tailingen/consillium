Phase 1/2 Study of REGN5458 in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The main purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of REGN5458 and to find out what is the best dose of REGN5458 to give to patients with multiple myeloma. An additional purpose is to look for any signs that REGN5458 can treat cancer.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* Side effects that may be experienced by people receiving REGN5458
* How REGN5458 works in the body
* How much REGN5458 is present in the blood
* How REGN5458 may work to treat cancer

The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "very much."

Note: Phase 2, Cohort 3 is not applicable for US., Up to 5 years|Effects of REGN5458 on HRQOL and patient-reported symptoms and functioning per Quality of Life Questionnaire-Multiple Myeloma module 20 [QLQ-MY20]), Phase 2

The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a self -administered instrument to assess QoL in persons with MM. This 20-item questionnaire measures the following domains: symptom scales, including disease symptoms (6 items) and symptoms related to side effects of treatment (10 items); function scale and future perspective (3 items); and body image (1 item). A high score represents a high level of symptoms or problems.

Note: Phase 2, Cohort 3 is not applicable for US., Up to 5 years|Effects of REGN5458 on HRQOL and patient-reported symptoms and functioning per EuroQoL-5 Dimension-3 Level Scale [EQ-5D-3L]), Phase 2

The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered generic standardized health status measure, consisting of an EQ-5D descriptive system and an EQ visual analog scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-level scale: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ visual analog scale component is a vertical visual analog scale used by patients to rate their health.
