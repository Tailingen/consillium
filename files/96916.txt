Multiple Respiration-Correlated Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CT) Scans to Reduce Target Positioning Errors in Radiotherapy Treatment of Thoracic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to use cone-beam CT scans to more accurately position the tumor during radiation and to see whether this method is more effective than the standard method of using 2D images (portal images), which is a type of X-ray. Cone-beam CT is a type of CT scanner attached to the treatment accelerator that produces 3D images of the patient.

The ability to eliminate the tumor with radiation depends in part on the accuracy of delivering the radiation to the lung. The position of the tumor changes because of normal breathing. Therefore, we want to improve the accuracy of the way the radiation is delivered to the tumor. With cone-beam CT scans taken before and during your treatment, we will be able to determine the location of the tumor with 3D images, measure how much the tumor moves as you breathe, and then position you so that the tumor will get the best delivery of radiation.
Esophageal Cancer|Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: cone-beam CT
To enhance the accuracy of treatment delivery by using a cone-beam CT guided patient positioning procedure, relative to the standard portal image guided procedure., conclusion of the study
To determine the reduction in the proportion of patients with large target positioning errors using the cone-beam CT guided procedure., conclusion of the study|To gather data on organ motion and setup errors in the thorax and how they vary over the treatment course, in order to develop efficient clinical correction strategies., conclusion of the study
