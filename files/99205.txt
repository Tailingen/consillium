Evaluation of Blood/Imaging Based Biomarkers, Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Musculoskeletal Syndrome
This is a pilot trial to evaluate for blood and imaging biomarkers in patients with breast cancer scheduled to start adjuvant hormonal therapy.
Aromatase Inhibitor Induced Musculoskeletal Syndrome (AIMSS)|Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Initial blood draw|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Initial SWE ultrasound|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood draw at three months|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood draw at six months|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: SWE ultrasound at six months
Oxylipin Levels, Change Oxylipin levels at Baseline, Three and Six Months, Baseline, Three months, and Six months
Tendon Stiffness, Tendon stiffness at baseline, Baseline|Pain Levels, Pain levels at baseline and 6 months. Pain assessment was done using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index; the WOMAC pain assessment consists of 5 items, and each item has a scale that ranges from 0-4 (higher scores indicate higher pain levels). The scores of the 5 items are summed up to obtain the WOMAC-total pain score, which ranges from 0-20., Baseline, Six months
This is a prospective single arm study enrolling patients (n = 25) with breast cancer scheduled to start adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients would have completed all their primary treatments (surgeryÂ± radiation therapy) and are scheduled to start their adjuvant hormonal therapy. They get baseline blood drawn for oxylipins and sheer wave elastrography (SWE) ultrasound of their hands including wrists. They start adjuvant anastrozole and have blood drawn at 3mths and 6mths for measurement of oxylipins. SWE ultrasound is repeated at 6mths. This is a pilot trial to evaluate for blood and imaging biomarkers. Once pilot data is analyzed, goal is to apply for funding for a larger trial to further evaluate and validate these biomarkers
