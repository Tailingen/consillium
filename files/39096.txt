An Observational Study on Epithelioid Sarcoma
Prospective Italian study aimed to provide a description of the population affected by Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES)
Epithelioid Sarcoma
OTHER: Treatment for Epitheloid Sarcoma
Type of treatment given to patients with ES, Number of chemotherapy treatment received patients affected by ES, From diagnosis until the date of death from any cause assessed up to 60 months
Radiotherapy treatments, Number of patients affected by localized ES who received radiotherapy, From the time of diagnosis and then every 6 months up to 60 months|Chemotherapy treatments, Number of patients affected by localized ES who received chemotherapy, From the time of diagnosis and then every 6 months up to 60 months|Predictive biomarkers for response, Tumor biomarkers expression in tumor tissue of patients affected by ES, At time of diagnosis and at the time of any progression where a biopsy is performed up to 60 months
The present prospective national study aims to provide a description of the population affected by ES, an insight into the natural history of the disease and an answer some on the outstanding questions on its management. Also, it will focus on enhancing any differences between the two ES variants (classical-type and proximal-type) in order gain a better understanding of the disease, tailor the treatment and lastly improve outcome.
