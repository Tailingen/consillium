CAVE-2 GOIM Study: a Clinical Study of the Combination of Avelumab Plus Cetuximab as Rechallenge Strategy
This is a non-profit phase II, randomized clinical study of the combination of avelumab plus cetuximab as rechallenge strategy, compared to cetuximab alone, in pre-treated RAS/BRAF wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients (according to liquid biopsy at baseline). Patients have been treated in first line with chemotherapy in combination with cetuximab and have had a clinical benefit (complete or partial response) from treatment.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Avelumab
OS, Overall Survival defined as the interval from enrollment to death for every cause., up to 36 months
ORR, Overall Response Rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy., from screening up to 36 months|PFS, Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from random assignment in the clinical trial to disease progression or death from any cause., from screening up to 36 months (from the start of therapy until disease progression or death due to any cause)|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety profile of the trial drugs as measured by the incidence of AEs, SAEs., up to 36 months
This is a non-profit phase II, open-label, randomized clinical study of the combination of avelumab plus cetuximab as rechallenge strategy in pre-treated RAS, BRAF wild type metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated in first line with chemotherapy in combination with cetuximab and have had a clinical benefit (complete or partial response) from treatment.

173 patients will be randomized (2:1) as follows: cetuximab + avelumab (115 patients) or cetuximab only (58 patients). For each patient, before treatment, a blood sample will be obtained and analyzed for circulating free tumorDNA, to identify RAS/BRAF wild type patient to be enrolled. The same procedure will be performed at progression of the disease. Treatment will continue until:

* disease progression.
* significant clinical deterioration
* any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial drug is fulfilled
* treatment may continue past the initial determination of disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. if the subject's performance status has remained stable, and if in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject will benefit from continued treatment and if other criteria are fulfilled as outlined in the protocol, that is, no new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms and no decrease in performance score.
