Radiographic Prediction of the Nerve Origin of Neck Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors
Postoperative nerve palsy is a major complication following resection of neck peripheral nerve sheath tumors. This study is a retrospective cohort aimed to predict the nerve origin of neck peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Accurate preoperative identification of the nerve origin can improve surgical outcomes and patient counseling

PROCEDURE: Excision
Nerve origin, intraoperative identification of the nerve origin of the tumor, within 1 month
Postoperative nerve palsy is a major complication following resection of neck peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs). Accurate preoperative identification of the nerve origin (NO) can improve surgical outcomes and patient counseling. This study aims to predict the NO of neck PNSTs with radiographic analysis. This study is a retrospective cohort analysis. Radiographic parameters will be reviewed and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of NO prediction will be evaluated.
