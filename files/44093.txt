Patient-led Follow-up from Home After Surgery for Colorectal Carcinoma
The primary goal of the patient-led follow-up from home, is the improvement of quality of life and the reduction of stress in patients, while obtaining a more complete picture of their health status.

A series of assessments are performed in the home setting:

* Blood withdrawal for CEA determination
* Quality of life questionnaires to assess both mental and physical symptoms
* Vital parameters using a Smart Sensor
Colorectal Carcinoma (CRC)
OTHER: Home-based follow-up
Quality of life, The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate non-inferiority of the study follow-up with respect to the EQ-5D-5L score at 36 months of follow-up, which starts within 6 months of resection of the primary tumour., 36 months|Number of in hospital visits, The second primary outcome consists of significantly decreasing the number of in-hospital appointments, by relocating this follow-up care to the home setting. This will be assessed at 36 months postoperatively., 36 months
Primary Objective: To further develop and evaluate a personalised patient-centred surveillance programme including a feedback platform for patients after curative treatment for CRC in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and significantly decrease the number of in-hospital appointments, by relocating the follow-up care to the home-setting. The goal is for this surveillance program to be non-inferior to standard of care follow-up at 36 months, in terms of quality of life. The quality of life in patients will be assessed with the EQ 5D-5L questionnaire and compared to median EQ-5D-5L scores for patients receiving standard of care follow-up. In current literature, the median HRQoL VAS score for patients after surgery for CRC is 62.05 points (1).

The second goal of the program is to relocate part of the in-hospital follow-up care to the home-setting. In standard of care follow-up, at 36 months patients would have had 10 in-hospital appointments. The effect of the PROMISE study on the number of in-hospital appointments, will be assessed at 36 months postoperatively.

The PROMISE study is a multi-centre prospective regional implementation study of a personalised patient-centred surveillance program including a feedback platform for patients after curative treatment for CRC.

All patients who underwent surgery with curative intent for non-metastatic CRC with scheduled postoperative surveillance are potentially eligible.

Follow-up in this study is performed according to the acting Dutch national guidelines. Current guidelines advocate CEA level measurements to be performed every 3-6 months for first 2 years after surgery and every 6-12 months for years 3 to 5. Medical imaging (thoracic and abdominal CT) should be performed 1 year postoperatively. Changes to the Dutch national guidelines during the course of the study will be implemented accordingly into the follow-up.

Within this study surveillance will for the greater part be performed at home:

* Serum CEA level monitoring is performed using the automatic capillary blood withdrawal device (TAP-II) - every 6 months during the first two years and every 12 months thereafter
* Vital parameters will be measured with a LifeSignals Multi-parameter Remote Monitoring System - every 3 months during the first two years and every 6 months thereafter
* QoL is measured with the use of questionnaires - every 3 months during the first two years and every 6 months thereafter
* One scheduled in hospital evaluation with medical imaging (according to national guidelines) performed 1 year after surgical treatment
