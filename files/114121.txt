Irinotecan Plus Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Recurrent Primary Malignant Glioma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan plus temozolomide in treating patients who have recurrent primary malignant glioma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: temozolomide
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan administered in combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent primary malignant glioma.
* Determine the toxicity of this combination therapy in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are stratified according to concurrent anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Tegretol, or phenobarbital vs other anticonvulsants or none).

Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 43 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.
