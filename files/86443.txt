Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Unresectable Renal Cell Carcinoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and gemcitabine, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving doxorubicin together with gemcitabine works in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic unresectable renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer).
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma With Sarcomatoid Features
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor)|DRUG: Neulasta
Response Rate by Solid Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST), Per RECIST criteria, Complete response (CR)= disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions Partial response (PR)= \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from baseline, and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Objective response = CR + PR, Every 8 weeks during treatment; then every 3 months if <2 years from study entry; then every 6 months if 2-3 years from study entry
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry until death from any cause., Every 2 weeks during treatment; then every 3 months if <2 years from study entry; then every 6 months if 2-3 years from study entry|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time from study entry until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s) or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., Every 8 weeks during treatment; then every 3 months if <2 years from study entry; then every 6 months if 2-3 years from study entry
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic unresectable renal cell cancer with sarcomatoid features treated with doxorubicin and gemcitabine.
* Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive doxorubicin intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 2- or 3-10 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After 6 courses, patients undergo a MUGA scan. Patients with a stable\* left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) continue therapy as above. Patients who reach a total doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m\^2 and are found to have unstable cardiac function or who have an abnormal LVEF continue therapy with gemcitabine alone.

NOTE: \*Stable cardiac function is defined as no decrease more than 15% of LVEF in absolute number and LVEF at least 35% in total function by MUGA.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients were accrued for this study.
