A Single Arm Study of Acalabrutinib Conbimed With Obinutuzumab in Chinese Patients With Previously Untreated CLL
This is a single-arm, prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib combined with obinutuzumab in subjects with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Progression-free survival rate at 24 months, 24-month progression-free survival rate is defined as the proportion of subjects without progression or death due to any cause at 24 months since the start of study drug. The evaluation of progression will be investigator-assessed per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria(iwCLL2018) criteria., At 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportionof subjects with complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial remission(nPR), or partial remission(PR) assessed by investigator per iwCLL2018 criteria., 24 months after LPI|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective response to the earlier time of disease progression (assessed by the investigator, per iwCLL 2018 criteria) or death from any cause. The same censoring rules and analysis methods will be applied as described for PFS., At 24 months|24-month overall survival rate (24m OS rate), 24-month overall survival rate is defined as the proportion of subjects without death due to any cause at 24 months since the start of study drug., At 24 months|Adverse Events (AEs), AEs will be graded by the investigator according the NCI CTCAE v5.0 or higher for hematologic and nonhematologic AEs. Each AE verbatim term will be coded to a system organ class and a preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)., Up to acalabrutinib treatment for 24 months|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized. In addition, AE incidence rates will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug.

Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs; TEAEs leading to permanent study drug treatment discontinuation; TEAEs leading to dose reduction; serious TEAEs; and TEAEs resulting in death will be summarized., Up to acalabrutinib treatment for 24 months
Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, a Follow-up Phase.
