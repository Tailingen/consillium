Feasibility of Intraoperative Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy in Brain Tumors
This clinical trial studies optical imaging in assessing activity during surgery in patients with brain tumors. New procedures, such as optical spectroscopy, may help doctors maximally remove brain tumors and minimize damage to normal brain.

OTHER: Interoperative Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy
Determination of the effectiveness of intraoperative optical imaging technology and optical spectroscopy., Optical reflectance images will be analyzed by pixel by-pixel subtraction of a control trial and a stimulation trial. This subtracted image will then be divided by the control image to normalize for differences between subjects and trials. These ratios thus represent proportional changes from baseline., Day 1 post surgery|Intraoperative determination of the location of critical brain functions., We will examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to different stimuli using i2DOS. Stimulus parameters will be varied to investigate stimulus-response relationships. We will study areas of sensori-motor and language cortex using customary stimuli for evoked potentials (i.e. transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), tactile stimuli for exposed cortical dermatome representations, and language tasks for cortical language representations. Results will be correlated with intraoperative electrophysiological measures., Day 1 post surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To develop the instrumentation to achieve real time processing and display of intraoperative 2-dimensional optical imaging and spectroscopy (i2DOS) maps in the operating arena.

II. To examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to different stimuli using i2DOS.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo i2DOS.
