First-line Esophageal Carcinoma Study With Pembrolizumab Plus Chemo vs. Chemo (MK-3475-590/KEYNOTE-590)
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus placebo plus SOC chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU as first-line treatment in participants with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma.

The overall primary efficacy hypotheses are as follows:

1. In participants with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), participants whose tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (defined as combined positive score \[CPS\] ≥10), ESCC participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, overall survival (OS) is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.
2. In participants with ESCC, participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by investigator is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.

Participant responses to the Global Health Status (GHS) question "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" (Item 29) and the Quality of Life (QoL) question "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?" (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome.

For the purposes of this study, the Dysphagia subscale (three items), Pain subscale (three items), and Reflux subscale (two items) were evaluated. All subscale items were scored using a four-point Likert scale with the following response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores for the subscales were standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with higher symptom scores represent a higher ("worse") level of symptoms.
