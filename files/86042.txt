Application of Linked Color Imaging（LCI） in Diagnosis of Early Gastric Cancer(EGC)
the purpose of this study is to evaluate application value of LCI in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.
Early Gastric Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: LCI+white light
Detection rate of gastric neoplastic lesion, Include early gastric caner,high grade dysplasia low grade dysplasia and adenoma, immediately following the procedure
Specificity of detecting gastric neoplastic lesion, Include early gastric caner,high grade dysplasia low grade dysplasia and adenoma, immediately following the procedure|Sensitivity of detecting gastric neoplastic lesion, Include early gastric caner,high grade dysplasia low grade dysplasia and adenoma, immediately following the procedure
The detection rate of early gastric cancer is still very low in China. The investigators need a new and effective screening method to improve the detection rate. LCI (linked-color imaging)is a new model of laser endoscopy which can provide brighter image. LCI can provide clear image which can make red part redder and white part whiter, so suspicious lesion could be found easier. The study of this randomized controlled trial is to discuss effectiveness of LCI in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer and to find a new method to improve the detection rate of early gastric cancer in China.
