131I-rituximab for Relapsed or Refractory Follicular or Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are rare lymphomas which consist of less than 5% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Korea. Although FL with histologic grade 1 or 2 has relatively good prognosis, continual treatment is needed due to frequent relapse. FL with histologic grade 3 has poor prognosis similar to that of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Meanwhile, the response rate to systemic chemotherapy in MCL is low, so the treatment of relapsed MCL is challenging. So we investigate the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy using 131I-rituximab in refractory or relapsed patients with FL or MCL
