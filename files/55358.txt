A Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tafasitamab With Bendamustine (BEN) Versus Rituximab (RTX) With BEN in Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of Tafasitamab with BEN versus RTX with BEN in adult patients with relapsed of refractory DLBCL.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab (RTX)|DRUG: Tafasitamab|DRUG: Bendamustine (BEN)
Progression-free survival (PFS), To determine the efficacy of a combination of MOR00208 with BEN versus a combination of RTX with BEN in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in:

* Adult patients with R-R DLBCL (overall population)
* A subgroup of adult patients with R-R DLBCL with low baseline peripheral blood NK-cell count (NKCC-low), From date of randomization until recurrence/disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever comes first assessed up to 4 yrs
Objective response rate (ORR), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|Duration of response (DoR), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|overall survival (OS), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|disease control rate (DCR), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|time to progression (TTP), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|time to next treatment (TTNT), To determine efficacy, From date of randomization assessed up to 4 yrs|Number of patients with adverse events, Number of participants with treatment- and non-treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE, assessed up to 4 yrs|quality of life (QoL), EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be used, assessed up to 4 yrs|Number of patients developing Tafasitamab antibodies, assessed up to 2 yrs|Maximum Plasma Concentration of Tafasitamab (Cmax), assessed up to 2 yrs|Apparent trough concentration (Cpd) of Tafsitamab, assessed up to 2 yrs
This is a randomised, two-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II/III efficacy and safety study of Tafasitamab in combination with BEN versus RTX in combination with BEN given to adult patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to at least one but no more than three prior systemic therapies and have failed, or are not candidates for HDC and ASCT, and have thus exhausted their therapeutic options of demonstrated clinical benefit. At least one prior therapy line must have included a CD20-targeted therapy.
