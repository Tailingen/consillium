Quality of Life and Voice Perception in Patients Laryngoctomized Phonatory Wearers
Prospective, multicenter observational study involving patients who will undergo total laryngectomy surgery and placement of phonatory prosthesis.
Quality of Life|Larynx Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: to assess the voice perception of the patient undergoing phonatory prosthesis placement surgery by evaluating the optimal score (>30) in terms of VHI.
evaluate the patient's quality of life and voice perception underwent surgery for the placement of a voice prosthesis, Evaluate the perception of the voice of the patient undergoing surgery of voice prosthesis positioning, evaluating the optimal score (\>30) in terms of VHI.

To calculate the sample size we based our estimate on the percentage of patients not undergoing voice prosthesis with a VHI score greater than 30 (Good Score). Such percentage is approximately 35%, a figure reported in the literature. Assuming a difference of 25% in terms of percentage of patients undergoing voice prosthesis who have a VHI score greater than 30 (60%) to ensure a power (1-β) equal to 80% and an α error of 5%, it will be necessary to enlist a total of 31 patients with the required requirements. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables of interest. The associations will come evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Differences between subgroups will be assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical analyzes were conducted using SPSS statistical software (version 21.0), Enlistment period: 2 years Total duration of the study: 36 months
