Determining the Clinical Relevance of the inTeraction Between AprepitaNt aNd EtoposiDe
Rationale: In pharmacokinetic studies, aprepitant was shown to be a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity. Etoposide is metabolised by CYP3A4.

Objective: to investigate the absence of a clinical relevant interaction between aprepitant and etoposide in TC patients treated with (B)EP.

Study design: A single centre, prospective, paired observational pharmacokinetic study in 12 patients with TC who are treated with etoposide during 5 days in combination with cisplatin with or without bleomycin conform the standard BEP or EP-protocol and who will be treated with aprepitant from day 3 until day 7 according to the routine antiemetic protocol. The effect of aprepitant on etoposide will be investigated within the same patient. In this study the patient will serve as its own control.
