Study of Bevacizumab Combined With Capecitabine and Either Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan as First Course of Treatment for Patients With Colorectal Cancer That Has Spread Beyond the Colon
Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor which means it works to stop blood vessel formation in tumors. Without new blood vessels, the growth of a tumor is slowed. Chemotherapy works to kill cancer cells directly. This study is being done to see how colorectal cancer responds to treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Irinotecan
One-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Outcome measure was not assessed due to early study closure. The study was closed early due to low enrollment and new information regarding the benefit of the study regimen., Unevaluable - accrual ended early due to slow accrual rate and before accrual goal was met.
Objective Response Rate, Unevaluable - accrual ended early due to slow accrual rate and before accrual goal was met.|Toxicity - Adverse Events, Assessments before each cycle of chemotherapy, after every third dose of bevacizumab (if given alone), and final adverse event assessment 3 months after the last dose of bevacizumab|Overall Survival, Unevaluable - accrual ended early due to slow accrual rate and before accrual goal was met.|Duration of Response, Unevaluable - accrual ended early due to slow accrual rate and before accrual goal was met.
Due to greater patient convenience and favorable toxicity profiles, clinical practice has seen an increased use of the combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and capecitabine with irinotecan (CAPIRI). Given the data documenting the improved efficacy for 5-FU based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab, it is important to investigate the potential advantages of adding this agent to regimens containing capecitabine.
