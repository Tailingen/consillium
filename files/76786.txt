Consolidation Versus Induction Chemotherapy in Total Neoadjuvant Therapy of Rectal Cancer With High Risk for Recurrence
The purpose of the study is to identify the most promising sequence of modalities in total neoadjuvant treatment of localy advanced rectal cancer with high risk of recurrence
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
OTHER: consolidation chemotherapy|OTHER: induction chemotherapy
complete remission rate, The proportion of complete responses will be defined as the sum of the proportions of pCR in operated patients and cCR in non-operated patients., 2 weeks after completiton of TNT
Overall survival, time from randomization to death, after 3 years of follow-up|Survival without recurrence of the disease, time from the end of treatment (in the case of cCR) or from radical surgery to death or recurrence of the disease - whichever comes first., after 3 years of follow-up|Disease free survival, the time from the end of treatment (in the case of cCR) or surgery to the recurrence of disease, the onset of new cancer, death from cancer or other causes, after 3 years of follow-up|local control, the time from the end of the treatment (in the case of cCR) or surgery to local recurrence, after 3 years of follow-up
International recommendations for the treatment of LARC with a high risk of disease recurrence are inconsistent, regarding TNT. In Germain randomised study more pCR were achieved with consolidation chemotherapy. We will compare our standard approach (induction plus consolidation CT) with consolidation CT.
