Efficacy and Safety of Netupitant and Palonosetron Hydrochloride Capsules in Preventing Nausea and Vomiting Induced by Radiochemotherapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The enrolled head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in this study received high-dose multiday chemotherapy with cisplatin and synchronous radiation therapy, which had a high risk of nausea and vomiting. On the first and third days, they took Netopitam Palonosetron capsules and dexamethasone to reduce the incidence of acute vomiting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antiemetic effect of Netopitam Palonosetron capsules and to explore the effectiveness of using Netopitam Palonosetron capsules again for antiemetic treatment during the study period when breakthrough vomiting occurs.
