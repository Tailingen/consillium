Evaluation of a Scalable Decision Support and Shared Decision Making Tool for Lung Cancer Screening
The purpose of this project is to increase appropriate low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening through the development and wide dissemination of patient-centered clinical decision support (CDS) tools that (1) are integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical workflows, (2) prompt for shared decision making (SDM) when patients meet screening criteria, and (3) enable effective SDM using individually-tailored information on the potential benefits and harms of screening. The study will promote standard of care that is endorsed by the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

OTHER: EHR-integrated Shared Decision Making Tool and Clinical Decision Support for Lung Cancer Screening
Number of Participants With Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) Care-Gap Closed, The LCS care gap was considered closed if one or more of the following events occurred: (1) LDCT completion in the past year, (2) completion of another chest CT in the past year, or (3) SDM documentation in the past 3 years for eligible patients. To assess population care-gap closure levels at the end of each study period, we estimated the care-gap closure status for all patients who had primary care visits in the 12 months preceding the last day of the period. Using structured EHR data, SDM was considered documented if a clinician noted the need for LCS discussion was addressed, the patient declined screening, or LCS was not appropriate., Through study completion, an average of 18 months for the intervention period and 12 months for the baseline period
Number of Participants Who Used the Intervention, The number of participants who used the intervention was measured. The usage was measured through system logs and data from the enterprise data warehouse., Through study completion, an average of 18 months for the intervention period

This project is supported both operationally and by an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) R18 grant.

This project will leverage Decision Precision, a validated Web-based tool for LDCT SDM developed at the Veterans Health Administration, as well as an initial version of Decision Precision+, an EHR-integrated version of the tool which can be accessed directly in the EHR and auto-populate relevant patient data in the tool instead of requiring manual data entry.

This study will be an 18-month interrupted time series study conducted at the University of Utah Health primary care clinics.
