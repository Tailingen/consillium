Monitoring of Immune and Microbial Reconstitution in (HCT) and Novel Immunotherapies
This protocol serves as a mechanism to collect, store, and distribute bodily fluid and tissue samples obtained from Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) or novel immunotherapy patients and their donors at the Masonic Cancer Center in order to conduct correlative studies of the immune system, microbiota, and their interactions. Fluid (including but not limited to, blood, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) sample log-in, processing, relabeling, and storage is performed by the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) Translational Therapy Lab (TTL).
