AZA + Venetoclax as Maintenance Therapy in Younger Adults With AML in First Remission
This phase III trial is conducted to evaluate if azacitidine in combination with venetoclax as maintenance therapy improves relapse-free survival (RFS) for younger adults with favorable-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who remained in first complete remission (CR1) following intensive consolidation.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Remission
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax|OTHER: Supportive care
Relapse-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the number of days from CR/CRi to the date of relapse or the date of death from any cause, whichever comes first., From date of complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), to relapse or death from any cause, up to approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Minimal Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Conversion, The MRD conversion rate is defined as the percentage of participants deemed MRD positive (≥ 10\^-3) at study initiation who converted to MRD of \< 10\^-3 in the bone marrow after randomization or initiation of treatment., Measured From Baseline to approximately 3 years|Complete remission duration (CRd), CRd is defined as time from CR/CRi until date of confirmed relapse, From date of CR/CRi to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of days from the date of study treatment to the date of death., Time from treatment to death from any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Event free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as time from the start of study treatment until date of first confirmed relapse, withdrawal from study due to adverse event, or death due to any cause,, Time from treatment to relapse，withdrawal from study due to adverse event and death from any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Incidence of adverse events, The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE 5.0) is used to grade adverse events., Time from treatment to approximately 3 years
