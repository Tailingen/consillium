Sorafenib Tosylate With or Without Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer
This randomized phase III trial studies sorafenib tosylate and stereotactic body radiation therapy to see how well they work compared to sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients with liver cancer. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send the radiation dose directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving sorafenib tosylate together with stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

Overall Survival, An event for overall survival (OS) is death due to any cause. Survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of death or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis was to occur after 153 deaths were reported., From randomization to last follow-up: weekly during SBRT, post-SBRT/pre-sorafenib, monthly during sorafenib, and overall, from study entry: every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 7.6 years.
Time to Progression, Progression (failure) is defined as any of the following events: new tumor thrombosis, progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within liver excluding tumor thrombosis status, progression of distant metastases that were present at study entry, new HCC within the liver including tumor thrombosis, and vascular thrombosis events=progression-new enhancing tumor thrombosis/progression-Increase in the volume of enhancing portion of thrombosis. Time to progression was measured from the date of randomization to the date of first failure, death (competing risk), or last follow-up (censored). Progression rates are estimated by the cumulative incidence method. The protocol specifies only that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Two-year estimates are provided as a summary of the distributions., From randomization to last follow-up: weekly during SBRT, post-SBRT/pre-sorafenib, monthly during sorafenib, and overall, from study entry: every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 7.6 years.|Progression-free Survival, Failure for progression-free survival (PFS) include death, new tumor thrombosis, progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within liver excluding tumor thrombosis status, progression of distant Mets that were present at study entry, new HCC within liver including tumor thrombosis, and vascular thrombosis events =progression-new enhancing tumor thrombosis/progression-Increase in the volume of enhancing portion of thrombosis. PFS time is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first failure, date of death, or last known follow-up (censored). PFS rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The protocol specifies only that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Two-year estimates are provided as a summary of the distributions., From randomization to last follow-up: weekly during SBRT, post-SBRT/pre-sorafenib, monthly during sorafenib, and overall, from study entry: every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 7.6 years.|Number of Participants by Highest Grade Adverse Event Reported, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grades adverse event severity from 1=mild to 5=death. Summary data is provided in this outcome measure; see Adverse Events Module for specific adverse event data., From randomization to last follow-up: weekly during SBRT, post-SBRT/pre-sorafenib, monthly during sorafenib, and overall, from study entry: every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 7.6 years.|Percentage of Participants With Improvement in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) Total Score 6 Months After the Start of Treatment, The FACT-Hep total score measures quality of life in patients with hepatobiliary cancer. Possible scores range from 0 to 180, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Improvement in FACT-Hep total score is defined as an increase from the baseline to 6-month score of at least 5 points., Baseline and 6 months|Best Vascular Thrombosis Response up to the Time of Progressive Disease (if Applicable), Complete response: Complete resolution of thrombosis, with recanalization of vessel.

Partial response (PR):

* Partial recanalization (if prior complete blockage)
* Unequivocal reduction in the maximal girth
* Unequivocal reduction in the volume, or elimination, of arterial enhancing portion

Progressive disease (PD): any unequivocal, unambiguous

* New enhancing tumor thrombosis
* Increase in the volume of enhancing portion
* Unequivocal progression of thrombosis (non-measurable disease), the increase in overall tumor burden (enhancing thrombosis) must be comparable to the increase required for the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor 1.1 definition of PD of measurable disease (e.g. â‰¥ 73% increase in volume, which is similar to 20% increase in diameter, and at least a 5 mm absolute increase).

Stable disease:

* No/small changes that do not meet the above criteria for PR or PD
* Increase in the volume of non-enhancing thrombosis
* New bland non-enhancing thrombosis, From randomization to last follow-up. Imaging occurs every 3 months for two years then every six months. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 7.6 years.|Quality Adjusted Life Years, Quality adjusted life years is calculated as the weighted sum of the number of years spent in different health states. The weight value is a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state) derived from the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, designed to describe and value health based on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression., The EQ-5D-5L is administered at baseline, six months and one year.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the difference in time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.

II. To measure differences in toxicity in HCC patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib.

III. To measure vascular thrombosis response post sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib.

IV. To measure differences in health related quality of life (QOL) and quality-adjusted survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib compared to SBRT followed by sorafenib.

V. Collection of biospecimens for future correlative studies to investigate differences in potential biomarkers in patients treated with sorafenib versus SBRT followed by sorafenib.
