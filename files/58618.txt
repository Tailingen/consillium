REVEAL 1 (Evaluation of VGX-3100 and Electroporation for the Treatment of Cervical HSIL)
HPV-301 is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of VGX-3100 administered by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation (EP) delivered with CELLECTRA™ 5PSP in adult women with histologically confirmed cervical high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 \[CIN2\] or grade 3 \[CIN3\]) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and/or HPV-18.
Cervical Dysplasia|Cervical High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion|HSIL
BIOLOGICAL: VGX-3100|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo|DEVICE: Electroporation (EP)
Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of Cervical HSIL on Histology and No Evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in Cervical Samples, Participants with no histologic (i.e., biopsies or excisional treatment) evidence of cervical HSIL, no evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at the Week 36 time frame, and participants in which excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between the initial dose up to Week 36 were considered to be responders. No evidence of HSIL was defined by histology as negative, squamous atypia, or low-grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). Cervical samples for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 were collected using the ThinPrep®., Week 36
Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Following Investigational Treatment for the Duration of the Study, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. An SAE is any experience that suggested a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution, and fulfilled any of the following criteria: fatal (resulted in death), life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was medically significant or required intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed here., From baseline up to Week 88|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of Cervical HSIL on Histology, Participants with no histologic (i.e., biopsies or excisional treatment) evidence of cervical HSIL at Week 36 and participants in which an excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between the initial dose up to Week 36 were considered to be responders. No evidence of HSIL was defined by histology as negative, squamous atypia, or LSIL., Week 36|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in Cervical Samples by Type Specific HPV Testing, Participants with no evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at the Week 36 time frame and participants in which an excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between the initial dose up to Week 36 were considered to be responders. Cervical samples for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 were collected using the ThinPrep®., Week 36|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of LSIL or HSIL on Histology, Participants with no histologic evidence of cervical HSIL, squamous atypia, or LSIL at the Week 36 time frame and participants in which an excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between the initial dose up to Week 36 were considered to be responders. No evidence of HSIL was defined as no evidence of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), CIN2, or CIN3 on biopsies or excisional treatment., Week 36|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of LSIL or HSIL and No Evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, Participants with no histologic evidence of cervical HSIL, squamous atypia, and LSIL, no evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 by type specific HPV testing at the Week 36 time, and participants in which an excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between initial dose up to Week 36 were considered to be responders. No evidence of HSIL was defined as no evidence of CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 on biopsies or excisional treatment., Week 36|Percentage of Participants With No Progression of Cervical HSIL to Cervical Carcinoma, Participants with no histologic evidence of cervical Adenocarcinoma in situ or cervical carcinoma at the Week 36 timeframe relative to baseline and participants in which an excision or biopsy sample was not obtained between initial dose up to Week 36 were considered as responders., Week 36|Percentage of Participants Who Have Cleared HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in Non-cervical Anatomic Locations, Participants with no evidence of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 on specimens from noncervical anatomic locations (oropharynx, vagina and intra-anal) at the Week 36 time frame were considered as responder., Week 36|Levels of Serum Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibody Concentrations, A standardized binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the anti-HPV-16/18 antibody response induced by VGX-3100., Week 15 and Week 36|Change From Baseline in Interferon-Gamma Response Magnitude, Assessment of cellular immune activity occurred via the application of the Interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (IFN-γ ELISpot). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood sample were used for analysis., Baseline; Week 15 and Week 36|Change From Baseline in Flow Cytometry Response Magnitude, Assessment of cellular immune activity was measured using the application flow cytometry for the purposes of performing a Lytic Granule Loading Assay. The Lytic Granule Loading assay examines the following external cellular markers: CD3, CD4, CD8 (T cell identification), CD137, CD38 and CD69 (T cell activation markers) as well as PD-1 (exhaustion/activation marker). Here change from baseline in CD8+CD137+Perforin+, CD8+CD38+Perforin+ and CD8+CD69+Perforin+ are reported., Baseline, Week 15
