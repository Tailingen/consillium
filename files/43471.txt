JZP898 Intravenous Infusion as Monotherapy and Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adults With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase 1 first-in-human study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of JZP898 monotherapy as well as JZP898 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Two-part study: Part A Dose Exploration (Parts A1 and A2) and Part B Combination Expansion.

Part A Dose Exploration:

* Part A1 - a monotherapy dose exploration to determine the monotherapy recommended dose and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of JZP898.
* Part A2 - a combination dose exploration of JZP898 plus pembrolizumab to determine the combination recommended dose followed by confirmation of the recommended phase 2 dose (Combination RP2D)

Part B Combination Expansion:

* Part B - combination expansion using a basket design to evaluate clinical antitumor activity and safety profile of JZP898 in combination with pembrolizumab at the Combination RP2D identified in Part A2.
