A Phase I Study of Bendamustine and Melphalan Conditioning and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Treatment of Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma in Elderly Patients
This study is testing a combination of chemo-immuno therapy called RBM. RBM consists of combination of drugs: rituximab, bendamustine, and melphalan followed by reinfusion of the participants own stem cells which is called autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Compared to the standard BEAM regimen, this RBM regimen may or may not be less effective in lymphoma, but will likely have fewer side effects.
