Study of Proteins in Promoting Chemotherapy Resistance in Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and development of drug resistance in patients.

PURPOSE: This research trial is studying proteins that may promote chemotherapy resistance in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: protein expression analysis|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Changes in Stat3 and Stat5 in paired diagnostic and relapsed AML samples|Reduction in chemotherapy sensitivity by relapsed samples compared to diagnostic samples
OBJECTIVES:

* Investigate whether changes in prosurvival signaling occur by comparing activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) and Stat5 pathways in paired diagnostic and relapse samples.
* Investigate changes in leukemia cell responses to extrinsic cues from the environment change, using a bone marrow stromal-cell co-culture model of chemotherapy resistance.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for Stat3 and Stat5 expression by flow cytometry and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity.
