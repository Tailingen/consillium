Etoposide, Filgrastim, and Plerixafor in Improving Stem Cell Mobilization in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This clinical trial studies etoposide, filgrastim and plerixafor in improving stem cell mobilization in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, and plerixafor and etoposide together helps stem cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored.

Collection Using Plerixafor, Etoposide, and Filgrastim, Number of participants able to collect equal to or more than 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg with addition of plerixafor to etoposide and filgrastim. These participants are defined as supermobilizers. Participants with less than 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg are defined as normal mobilizers., Within 2 days of apheresis|Progression-free Survival, The number of participants of patients who receive greater than or equal to 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg following collection with plerixafor, etoposide, and filgrastim and that have progression-free survival at one year, Up to 1 year post-transplant|Overall Survival, Number of participants who receive greater than or equal to 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg by 15% following collection with plerixafor, etoposide, and filgrastimstill alive at 1 yr post transplant, Up to 1 year post-transplant

Remobilization can be described as follows:

The first step for patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation is to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells from the bone marrow using G-CSF, plerixafor and/or chemotherapy. This is followed by collection of the cells by apheresis. If sufficient number of progenitor/stem cells cannot be mobilized and then collected by apheresis to proceed with transplantation, it is considered as "mobilization failure". For these patients, mobilization of their hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells is attempted a second time ("remobilization"). The need to do a second 'mobilization' attempt is not ideal., Up to 28 days post treatment|Correlation of Peripheral CD34+ Cell Count With Graft Content of CD34+ Cells, Correlation of peripheral CD34+ cell count with graft content of CD34+ cells assessed using Spearman correlation., Up to 28 days post treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether the addition of plerixafor improves the proportion of patients with lymphoma who collect \>= 8 x 10\^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+ cells/kg within two days by 25% compared to the historical estimate of 42% with etoposide and G-CSF (filgrastim).

II. To determine whether patients achieving collection of \>= 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg have a 15% one year survival advantage relative to the historical estimate of 68% among patients mobilizing \>= 2 but \< 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg with etoposide and G-CSF.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To demonstrate that patients receiving \>= 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg have more rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery and earlier hospital discharge than those receiving \< 8 x 10\^6 CD 34+ cells/kg.

II. To compare overall survival and progression-free survival between patients receiving \>= 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg and those receiving \< 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg.

III. To compare number of days of apheresis required to achieve goal, transfusion requirements, hospitalization costs, need for remobilization between groups.

IV. To evaluate whether peripheral CD34+ cell count correlates with graft content of CD34+ cells.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on day 0, filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) beginning day 1, and plerixafor SC 15-18 hours prior to apheresis. Patients unable to achieve target collection of \>= 8 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg receive another dose of plerixafor followed by apheresis. Following the second apheresis, patients achieving =\< 2 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg may continue filgrastim with plerixafor and continue collection according to the attending physician.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then for at least 1 year.
