Dostarlimab for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer (non-colorectal/non-endometrial) with Tumor DMMR/MSI
The goal of this open-label randomized, multicenter, comparative phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the immunotherapy, dostarlimab, as first-line treatment for deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) non-resectable metastatic or locally advanced non-colorectal and non-endometrial cancers compared to the standard of care chemotherapy.

Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed dMMR/MSI duodenum and small bowel adenocarcinoma, gastric and oeso-gastric junction (OGJ) adenocarcinoma with combined positive score (CPS)\<5, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ampulla of vater adenocarcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, carcinoma of unknown primary site, neuroendocrine carcinoma (Grade3) all primary, and soft tissue sarcoma (except Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumor) will be included in this study. They will be randomized and treated with either dostarlimab (experimental arm A), or chemotherapy (control arm B).

Patients with documented disease progression following the first line chemotherapy (Arm B) may be eligible for crossover to be treated with dostarlimab, with the same schedule as arm A.

Progression-free survival, The progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, up to 3 years.
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Duration of response, Duration of response (DOR) will be evaluated in patients with either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). DOR is defined as the time from the first assessment of a CR or PR until the date of the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause (if death occurred within predefined period), whichever occurs first., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Overall Survival, The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization until death from any cause, up to 3 years|Progression-Free Survival 2, Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2) is defined as the time from randomization to second/subsequent disease progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (including subsequent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy), or death from any cause, whichever first., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Objective response rate 2, Objective response rate after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (ORR2) is defined as the proportion of patients with best response of CR or PR according to the investigator's judgment., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Progression-Free Survival -crossover, Progression-free survival - crossover is defined as the time from crossover initiation to disease progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever first., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Circulating tumor DNA level, The evolution of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) level in patient's blood during treatment will be correlated with PFS in the overall population., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 3 years|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, every 2 or 3 weeks, and at the end of treatment (up to 2 years)
Following signature of the informed consent form, patients will enter the pre-inclusion period (maximum 28 days prior to start of treatment) during which all examinations required to assess their eligibility will be performed, including dMMR/MSI status, demographic data collection, tumor evaluation, and clinical and laboratory evaluations. A centralized confirmation of MMR/MSI status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or next-generation sequencing (NGS)/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is mandatory to include the patient.

Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either dostarlimab intravenously 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 1000 mg every 6 weeks for all cycles thereafter (experimental arm A) or chemotherapy (control arm B) as per standard of care (SOC) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, investigator's decision, withdrawal of consent or for a maximum of 24 months.

Randomization will be stratified by:

* Primary tumor (Duodenum and Small Bowel/Gastric/OGJ vs Pancreas/ Ampulla of Vater vs Other),
* Age (\<70 years vs ≥70 years)
* Stage: Locally advanced vs Metastatic.

Patients randomized to Arm B may be eligible to participate in the crossover phase after documentation of disease progression by investigator evaluation according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Crossover patients may then be treated with dostarlimab for up to 2 years, according to the schedule defined for experimental arm A. These patients may not initiate treatment with dostarlimab any earlier than 28 days after their last dose of chemotherapy (washout period) regardless of the time of progression. Patients who discontinue dostarlimab treatment after crossover will enter the follow-up phase until the last follow-up visit of the last randomized patient. Crossover is optional and is at the discretion of the investigator (with coordinating investigator's agreement).

In both arms, tumor evaluation will be done by local investigator at inclusion and post-randomization visits as follow:

* Treatment period: every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days) for the first year then every 12 weeks (+/- 7 days) for the second year.
* Follow-up period: every 16 weeks (+/- 7 days) up to one year after the last follow-up of the last randomized patient.
