An Open-label, Single-arm, Multicenter Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Amivantamab in Combination With FOLFIRI as a Second-line Treatment in Patients With RAS/BRAF Wild-type Advanced Colorectal Cancer Progressing on Prior Anti-EGFR Based Treatment.
This trial is a multicenter, single arm study of efficacy of amivantamab in combination with FOLFIRI in RAS/BRAF wild-type advanced colorectal cancer patients progressed prior treatment including oxaliplatin based chemotherapy. This trial will be conducted by Severance Hospital that is responsible for the project management of the trial. Patient recruitment will take at 3 institutions.

Participants will be treated for up to 24 cycles (approximately 2 years) after initiation of treatment with intravenous 1050mg(BW\<80kg) or 1400mg(BW≥80kg) of amivantamab every 4 weeks in combination with FOLFIRI. FOLFIRI includes folic acid, 5-FU and irinotecan. FOLFIRI will be administered intravenously with folic acid 400 mg/m², 5-FU 2400 mg/m², and irinotecan 180 mg/m² every 2 weeks. This study will use ORR based on RECIST 1.1 criteria as the primary endpoint and the tumor assessment will be done every 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints are DCR, PFS, OS, and safeties. Exploratory biomarkers in tumor tissue and ctDNA in blood will be investigated in both pre-treatment and post-treatment periods.
RAS/BRAF Wild-type Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients
DRUG: Amivantamab + FOLFIRI
Overall Response Rate, Efficacy Analysis Set includes all patients who have received at least 1 dose of the study drug, had measurable disease at baseline according to RECIST 1.1, and had at least 1 post-baseline tumor response assessment. Patients with evidence of disease progression or death before the first scheduled assessment of tumor response will be included in this Analysis Set. It will be the primary analysis set for tumor response.

Primary efficacy endpoints will be based upon investigators' tumor assessments per RECIST 1.1 and will be summarized as follows to evaluate the preliminary anticancer activities of amivantamab and FOLFIRI combination. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy by RECIST 1.1., every 8 weeks Up to 2 years 11 months
