Patient Experience Data in Radiation Oncology
The project is part of the overarching goal of improving patient-centric radiation oncology. This pilot project aims to develop an instrument that can be used to collect clinically relevant patient-reported outcome data on adverse effects during and after RT. This real-world evidence (RWE) database will be the basis to monitor and evaluate future technological developments, combination treatments (e.g. radioimmunotherapy, etc.), or changes in treatment protocols. The pseudonymized data will be linked to data in the oncological information system and dosimetric data from the treatment planning system. In this way, they represent a basic building block of patient-oriented development of clinical radiotherapy.
