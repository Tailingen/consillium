A Study of ICP-192 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I/II clinical study to evaluate ICP-192 in patients with advanced solid tumors and FGFR gene alterations. It consists of two parts: Part I (Phase I), dose escalation and Part II (Phase II), dose expansion.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Urothelial Carcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Drug ICP-192
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Phase I: Dose Escalation \& Phase II: Dose Expansion To evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of ICP-192 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Up to 3 years|MTD, Phase I: Dose Escalation To determine Maximum Tolerated Doseï¼ˆMTD) for ICP-192, Up to 3 years|OBD, Phase I: Dose Escalation To determine Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) for ICP-192, Up to 3 years|RP2D, Phase I: Dose Escalation To determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for ICP-192, Up to 3 years|ORR, Phase II: Dose Expansion Objective Response Rate, Up to 3 years
Peak concentration (Cmax), Phase I: Dose Escalation Peak concentration (Cmax), Up to 3 years|AUC, Phase I: Dose Escalation AUC, Up to 3 years|DCR, Phase II: Dose Expansion disease control rate, Up to 3 years|DOR, Phase II: Dose Expansion duration of response, Up to 3 years|PFS, Phase II: Dose Expansion progression-free survival, Up to 3 years|OS, Phase II: Dose Expansion overall survival, Up to 3 years
Drug exposure, Phase II: Dose Expansion Assessment of the correlations between drug exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmax) and patient response to ICP-192., Up to 3 years|PD biomarker, Phase II: Dose Expansion Assessment of the correlations between PD biomarker and patient response to ICP-192., Up to 3 years
Part I (Phase I) of the study enrolls patients with advanced solid tumors (9-15 patients); Part II (Phase II) of the study enrolls patients with urothelial carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR genetic alterations (30 patients).
