Phase 2 Study of KHK2375 in Subjects With Advanced or Recurrent Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of 5 mg KHK2375 on progression free survival (PFS) when administered orally at weekly intervals in combination with exemestane in a placebo-controlled, double-blind comparative study in subjects with advanced or recurrent hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The secondary objectives are to investigate the effect of on overall survival (OS) and the antitumor effect and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety.
Advanced or Recurrent Breast Cancer
DRUG: Entinostat|DRUG: Entinostat(Placebo)|DRUG: Exemestane
Progression Free Survival(PFS) defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1), PFS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or the date of death from any cause, whichever comes first (date of first documented PD or death - date of randomization + 1). The date of first documented PD is the date when PD is first documented at overall response assessment or the date when overall response other than complete response (CR) and not evaluable (NE) is documented after first CR. Subjects who receive post-study treatment before the documentation of PD and subjects with no documented PD or death will be censored at the last date they were confirmed to have no PD. Subjects whose overall response from the date of randomization onward is only NE or who have never undergone assessment of antitumor effect, and whose death has not been documented will be censored at the date of randomization., Approximately 29 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to death from any cause (date of death - date of randomization + 1). Subjects without documented death at the time of data cutoff will be censored at the last date they were confirmed to be alive., Up to 50 months|Antitumor effect, The best overall response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progression or recurrence according to the categories ordered as CR \> partial response(PR) \> stable disease (SD) \> PD \> NE or CR \> Non-CR/non-PD \> PD \> NE. A best overall response of CR or PR will be regarded as objective response. A best overall response of CR, PR, or SD for at least 6 months will be regarded as clinical benefit., Up to 50 months
