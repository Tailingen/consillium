Dendritic Cells(DC)-Based Id Vaccination in Stage-I Myeloma
Patients with stage-I multiple myeloma are treated with a vaccine made from their own immune cells (dendritic cells) and their own myeloma protein. Vaccinations are given on 5 occasions every 4 weeks. The aim is to induce an immune reaction against the malignant myeloma cells in order to slow down or cure the disease.
