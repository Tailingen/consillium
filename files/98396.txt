Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look at how well the combination of two chemotherapy drugs, pemetrexed (Alimta) and gemcitabine (Gemzar) work to treat your cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: gemcitabine
Objective Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year
Time to Progression, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 1 year|Overall Survival, 1 year
This research study is being done because we have not yet been able to find the best treatment for recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer (SCCHN). Pemetrexed and gemcitabine have helped fight against SCCHN when each was given by itself. This study is different from others because it tests these two drugs together, which has not been tried before in patients with SCCHN. We will see how well these drugs can work to help to control or shrink your cancer.

We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) gemcitabine and pemetrexed have on you and your head and neck cancer. We do not know if these drugs will help you. Your cancer might get better or it might get worse. It might not have any effect on your condition. We can use what we learn from this research study to help other people with the same cancer.
