Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib for Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study will evaluate the effect of investigational drugs, pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab with lenvatinib, on the immune systems response to kidney cancer when given before and after surgery to remove kidney cancer.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab infusion|DRUG: Lenvatinib tablet
Change in frequency of progenitor exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX prog) in peripheral blood during neoadjuvant pembrolizumab +/- lenvatinib and in tumor tissue., We will apply two 32-parameter spectral flow cytometry panels for phenotypic characterization of paired blood and tumor specimens over the course of multiple timepoints during three distinct treatment periods (Figure 1: Study Schema): 1) before and after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab + lenvatinib (Arm A), and pembrolizumab alone (Arm B); 2) the initial post-operative adjuvant pembrolizumab period; and 3) upon any tumor recurrence., Approximately 18-24 months

This is a randomized, single-center, unblinded, pilot treatment study to evaluate pembrolizumab with or without lenvatinib as neoadjuvant therapy for RCC planned for surgical nephrectomy. Study objectives include the assessment of immunologic and histologic response measures following neoadjuvant therapy and their association with post-operative clinical outcomes. This trial will generate preliminary data on immune pharmacodynamic outcomes and tumor response for neoadjuvant pembrolizumab +/- lenvatinib and is not powered for comparison between the arms. Up to 33 participants will be enrolled to ensure 30 evaluable patients. Patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy and undergo nephrectomy are considered evaluable. The study will consist of 5 phases: 1) Study Screening; 2) Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy; 3) Surgical Resection; 4) Adjuvant Systemic Pembrolizumab Therapy; and 5) Post-Treatment Follow-up. The total study participant duration, including participant follow-up across all 4 study phases, will be approximately 60 months.
