Treatment Outcomes of Esophageal Cancer
This study will be a carried out through a prospective observational cohort design in conjunction with researchers in the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC). The purpose of this research is to prospectively evaluate outcomes related to existing treatment strategies for esophageal cancer (EC) at participating sites within AfrECC.
Esophageal Cancer
OTHER: Assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
Proportion of esophageal cancer (EC) participants receiving treatment with varying treatment modalities at participating AfrECC sites, Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the proportion of EC patients receiving treatment with each modality at participating AfrECC sites. The investigators will assess the associations between demographic and clinicopathologic characteristic and treatment modalities employed (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemo-radiation, esophageal stenting, esophagectomy, supportive care alone, or a combination of these treatments), Up to 4 years|Change in scores of the Modified Rosenblatt Index over time, The 6-item Modified Rosenblatt Index by Rosenblatt, et al. adapted for use within a resource-limited context evaluates EC related parameters scored on a Likert scale assessing presence and severity of symptoms: Odynophagia (0=no pain on swallowing to 3=severe pain); Dysphagia (0=normal, no dysphagia to 4=unable to swallow saliva); Regurgitation (0=never to 3=constant); Chest and/or Back Pain (0=no pain to 2=pain not relieved by non-narcotics or requiring opiate medication); World Health Organization (WHO) performance status/Overall Well-Being (0="A lot better" to 4="A lot worse"). Scores will be assessed at the following time points: Baseline, 1 month and 3 months after initiation of treatment, and every 3 months thereafter., Up to 4 years|Median Overall Survival, Survival will be defined as the time elapsed from date of diagnosis (either confirmed or date of diagnostic modality leading to presumptive clinical diagnosis) to date of death. For participants who are not deceased, censorship will be performed on the date when the participant was last known to be alive., Up to 4 years
SPECIFIC AIMS:

Aim 1: To describe the types of treatments administered for all patients diagnosed with EC at participating AfrECC sites, including chemotherapeutic regimens, radiation therapy, chemo-radiotherapy, esophageal stenting, esophagectomy, and basic supportive care.

Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of different EC treatment modalities on patient reported outcomes during and after completion of treatment.

Aim 3: To measure the effect of different treatment modalities on overall survival.
