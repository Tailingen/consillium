The escalation part will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and recommended dose of expansion (RDE) of oral ABSK-011 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The expansion part of oral ABSK-011 at RDE will be followed for further evaluating safety and tolerability in patients with FGF19 overexpression advanced HCC. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed.
