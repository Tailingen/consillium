An Open Label Phase II Study Combining Nivolumab and Celecoxib in Patients With Advanced " Cold " Solid Tumors
This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and the anti-tumor activity of the combination of nivolumab and celecoxib.

The total numbers of participants to be enrolled will be up to 68 participants, depending on the investigated dose of celecoxib during the safety run-in phase.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: Celecoxib 400 mg
objective response rate, To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of Celecoxib in combination with anti-PD1 antibodies, at week 12 from onset of treatment
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, All the patients that will receive at least one dose of nivolumab and celecoxib are assess for toxicity endpoint. All adverse events will be recorded and graded based on the CTCAE v4.0 scale.
