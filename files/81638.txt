Exercise-induced Cardiac Adaptions in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients During IL-6 vs. TNF Antibody Therapy
The present study will investigative the physiological effects of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on the adaptive changes to exercise in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The investigators hypothesize that blockage of IL-6 receptors will decrease the cardiac and metabolic adaptations to exercise training compared to the inhibition of TNF. 80 patients will be included in a 12-week investigator blinded randomised exercise training intervention study.

80 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are being treated with either interleukin-6 receptor blockers (IL-6Rb) or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) for a minimum of four months prior to enrollment will be recruited and undergo baseline testing, including examination, biochemistry, ECG, DXA, OGTT, pulmonary function, VO2max, echocardiography, cardiac MRI.

After baseline testing, 40 patients in IL-6 receptor blocker treatment and 40 patients in TNF inhibitor treatment.will be randomly allocated into one group receiving standard of care (control group) or a group performing supervised high-intensity interval training three times a week over a period of 12 weeks. The randomization procedure involves a computer-generated block randomization schedule in a ratio of 1:1 stratified by sex by an independent person. Following the 12-week intervention period, all groups will complete a series of follow-up tests (as baseline testing).
