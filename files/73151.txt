Number of Participants Who Achieved Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), and Partial Response (PR), Number of participants who achieved CR, PR, VGPR were assessed in accordance to International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio if disease measurable only by SFLC. VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or greater than or equal to (\>=) 90% decrease in serum M-protein with urine M-protein \<100 milligram per 24 hours (mg/24 hrs). If disease measurable only by SFLC, \>= 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (dFLC). PR: \>= 50% reduction of serum M-protein and \>= 90% reduction in urine M-protein or to \<200 mg/24 hrs, or a \>= 50% decrease in dFLC. A \>=50% decrease in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas present at baseline, Baseline up to 29 days after last dose of study drug (up to Cycle 87 Day 44) (Each Cycle length=28 days)
The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. This study will evaluate the tolerability, safety, and PK of ixazomib administered alone or in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

This study will enroll approximately 24 participants (3 to 6 participants in each dose-escalation cohort). Participants will be assigned to receive treatment in one of the four treatment cohorts:

* Cohort 1: Ixazomib 4.0 mg
* Cohort 2: Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone
* Cohort 3: Ixazomib 5.5 mg
* Cohort 4: Ixazomib 5.5 mg + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 7 years. Participants will make a final visit 29 days after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
