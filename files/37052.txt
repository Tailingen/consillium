Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever comes first, as assessed by BICR using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. Participants who have not progressed or have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment date., Up to 4 years and 2 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of participant's death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR, ORR is defined as the percentage of randomized participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever comes first, as assessed by the investigator., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of randomized participants achieving complete CR or PR, as assessed by the investigator., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first, for participants who have PR or CR, as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed Investigator, DOR is defined as time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first, for participants who have PR or CR, as assessed by the investigator., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Progression-free Survival After Subsequent Therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until the date of second objective disease progression, after initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, based on investigator assessment (after that used for PFS) or death, whichever comes first., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by BICR, DCR is defined as the percentage of randomized participants achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (with minimum duration of 7 weeks) as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) as Assessed by Investigator, DCR is defined as the percentage of randomized participants achieving CR, PR, or stable disease (with minimum duration of 7 weeks) as assessed by the investigator., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure is defined as time from randomization to discontinuation of therapy for any reason including death, progression, toxicity, or initiation of new anticancer therapy., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Curative Resection (R0) Rate, Curative resection (R0) rate is defined as the percentage of participants (or participants with limited disease at baseline) who underwent curative surgery., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. AE severity will be graded according to the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0. by using the standard grades as follows: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5: Death related to AE., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Number of Participants with Abnormalities in Laboratory Values, Participants with abnormalities in laboratory values (such as serum chemistry, hematology) will be reported., Up to 7 Years 3 Months|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30, is a self-administered, 30-item questionnaire measuring the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of participants with cancer. EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status / quality of life scale, and 6 single items. Responses to items 1-28 are rated on a 4-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all" to 4 "Very much." Two global health status items are rated on a 7-point numeric rating scale from 1 "Very Poor" to 7 "Excellent." Higher scores indicate greater functioning, better global health status, and more severe symptoms., From Baseline up to 7 Years 3 Months|Time to Worsening in Symptoms and Functioning as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30, is a self-administered, 30-item questionnaire measuring the HRQoL of participants with cancer. EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status / quality of life scale, and 6 single items. Responses to items 1-28 are rated on a 4-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all" to 4 "Very much." Two global health status items are rated on a 7-point numeric rating scale from 1 "Very Poor" to 7 "Excellent."

The QLQ CR29 includes items that evaluate symptoms (gastrointestinal, urinary, pain, and others) and functional areas (sexual, body image, weight, and anxiety) that are associated with colorectal cancer and its treatments. Responses are rated on a 4-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 "Not at all" to 4 "Very much". All scores are linearly converted into a scale from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater functioning and more severe symptoms., From Baseline up to 7 Years 3 Months|Time to Worsening in Symptoms and Functioning as Measured by EORTC QLQ-CR29, The EORTC QLQ-CR29, is a self-administered, 29-item questionnaire measuring the HRQoL of participants with colorectal cancer.
