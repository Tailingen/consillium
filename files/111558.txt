MEK Inhibitor and a PDL1 Inhibitor Patients With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The proposed study conducted in adult and pediatric patients aims to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of atezolizumab + cobimetinib in advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (up to 80 patients).
Sarcoma,Soft Tissue
DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Phase II part, The Progression Free rate after 16 weeks of treatment is defined as the rate of patients with a complete response or a partial response or a stable disease as per RECIST V1.1., 16 weeks
Objective response rate, The objective response rate at 8 (16) weeks is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or a partial response after 8 (16) weeks of treatment., at 8 weeks and 16 weeks|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time interval from the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR, whichever status is recorded first) until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Time interval from the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression up to 3 month.|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Time from the first day of study treatment to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death up to 3 month.
The hypothesis of the proposed combination is as follows: cobimetinib via MEK1/2 inhibition could modify the tumor microenvironment and improve the response of T cells against tumor cells. Therefore, the addition of cobimetinib to atezolizumab may improve immune recognition and result in improved anti-tumour activity.

The combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab showed clinical activity in a Phase I trial in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (Atezolizumab 840 mg every 2 weeks and Cobimetinib 60 mg/d) with a disease control rate of 31%. Atezolizumab and cobimetinib are currently being tested in pediatrics in the iMatrix clinical trial with no major safety concerns to date.

A molecular screening step is mandatory for all patients enrolled in this trial in order to document MAPK pathway status and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) using FoundationOne test (FOne Heme).
