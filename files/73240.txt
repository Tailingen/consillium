Genetic Basis of Hemangiomas
The purpose of this study is to determine if there are genes that are common in children with infantile hemangioma. This information will allow physicians to improve care for patients who have been diagnosed with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information regarding the cause of this disease. This research is being done because many unanswered questions remain regarding children with infantile hemangioma. There are very few medications to treat infants with hemangiomas.
Hemangioma, Vascular Anomalies
GENETIC: Cheek cell samples or blood sample (4mL)|GENETIC: Cheek cell sample or blood sample (4mL)
SNP, 3 years
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?

* Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from child being seen in the Dermatology clinic having infantile hemangioma or vascular anomaly
* Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from parents of child

If you and your child agree to be in this study, the following will happen:

1. Informed consent and permission to use or disclose your/your child's health information for research purposes will be obtained by Dr. Drolet, the principal investigator, or her research team. You will receive a copy of this consent form.
2. A buccal swab or blood sample will be obtained from you and your child; buccal sampling involves rubbing the inside of your cheek and removing cells to perform a genetic test called "Genomewide Association (GWA).

We expect you and your child to be involved in this study until you and your child have the genetic testing performed.
