A Study of BMS-833923 With Cisplatin and Capecitabine in Inoperable, Metastatic Gastric, Gastroesophageal, or Esophageal Adenocarcinomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-833923 administered in combination with Cisplatin and Capecitabine as first-line therapy in subjects with inoperable metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal or esophageal adenocarcinomas.
Stomach Neoplasms|Esophageal Neoplasms
DRUG: BMS-833923|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Use National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to establish the MTD, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT(s)) and safety profile of BMS-833923 administered in combination with Cisplatin and Capecitabine, MTD - maximum tolerated dose, At a minimum on days 1, 8, 15 and 35 of cycle 1, days 1 & 14 for cycle 2 and every 21 days thereafter
To evaluate the safety of single-agent BMS-833923, by assessing the evaluation of number, character and duration of adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE)s, At a minimum on days 1, 8, 15 and 35 of cycle 1, days 1 & 14 for cycle 2 and every 21 days thereafter|Pharmacodynamic effects of BMS-833923 will be measured in tumor biopsy samples taken prior to and during single-agent and combination treatment by evaluation of protein or mRNA of biomarkers of Hedgehog (HH) pathway activation, such as GLI-1, Glioma-associated oncogene (GLI)

mRNA - messenger Ribonucleic acid, During cycle 1|Pharmacodynamic effects of BMS-833923 will be measured in tumor biopsy samples taken prior to and during single-agent and combination treatment by evaluation of protein or mRNA of biomarkers of Hedgehog (HH) pathway activation, such as GLI-1, Glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), During cycle 2|Pharmacodynamic effects of BMS-833923 will be measured in tumor biopsy samples taken prior to and during single-agent and combination treatment by evaluation of protein or mRNA of biomarkers of Hedgehog (HH) pathway activation, such as GLI-1, Glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), During cycle 3|The pharmacokinetic parameters that will be assessed include: Cmax (Maximum observed plasma concentration), During cycles 1, 2 & 3|The pharmacokinetic parameters that will be assessed include: Tmax (Time of maximum observed plasma concentration), During cycles 1, 2 & 3|The pharmacokinetic parameters that will be assessed include: AUC(TAU) (Area under the concentration-time curve in one dosing interval), During cycles 1, 2 & 3
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-833923 administered in combination with Cisplatin and Capecitabine as first-line therapy in subjects with inoperable metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal or esophageal adenocarcinomas.
