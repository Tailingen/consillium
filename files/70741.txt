Characterisation of T Lymphocytes, NK Cells and Macrophages in Melanoma Patients
Melanoma tumor tissue ( in particular regressive areas) present a lymphocytic infiltrate with an anti-tumoral specificity. The aim of the study is to analyse at different stages of the disease, tumor samples and to characterise the cellular infiltrate in situ ( in particular T lymphocytes, NK cells and macrophages), the role of inhibitor receptors on in situ immunosuppression, and potential modulation by medical treatments such as dacarbazine.
Melanoma
OTHER: biological collection
Impact of cellular infiltrate - Group 1, Impact of cellular infiltrate on disease free survival at 2 years, 2 years|Impact of NK cell infiltrate - Group 2 and 3, Impact of NK cell infiltrate in metastatic lymph node on disease free survival and overall survival at 2 and 3 years, 2 and 3 years|Modifications of cellular infiltrate - Group 4, Modifications of cellular infiltrate after chemotherapy (after 2 months), 2 months
The study is divided in 4 parts:

Part 1: study of cellular infiltrate (lymphocytes) performed on large primary melanoma and cutaneous metastasis ( fresh samples) Part 2: NK cells study on metastatic regional lymph nodes ( fresh samples) and blood samples Part 3: a retrospective study of macrophages in sentinel lymph nodes and in corresponding primary melanomas Part 4: study of the cellular modulation by the chemotherapy (DTIC or cisplatin or inhibitor of B-raf) which(who) will be made on two cutaneous metastases by patient (one taken before the treatment(processing) and one taken during the evaluation after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment(processing))
