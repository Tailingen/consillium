Combined Stent Insertion and HIFU Ablation for Pancreatic Carcinoma With Biliary Obstruction
The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes between patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction who are treated by stent insertion with or without high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.

DEVICE: biliary stent and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation system|DEVICE: biliary stent
6-month survival rate, From the date of randomization until the date of first documented death from any cause., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months
Stent patency, Stent dysfunction is suspected when the patient experiences recurrence of jaundice., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented stent dysfunction, assessed up to 10 months|Stent dysfunction free survival, From the date of randomization until the date of first documented stent dysfunction or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented stent dysfunction or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 10 months.
Distal malignant biliary obstruction is a common problem in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. In unresectable pancreatic carcinomas, percutaneous stent placement has been pivotal in providing relief from obstructive jaundice, improving the quality of life, and allowing the maintenance of anticancer treatment.

Venous chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, or radiotherapy have been used to prolong stent patency and survival after stent insertion for patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction. High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation is a noninvasive and atoxic treatment of malignant tumor using focused ultrasound energy from an extracorporeal source that is targeted within the body resulting in thermally induced necrosis and apoptosis.

The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes between patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction who are treated by stent insertion with or without high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.
