Proton Radiation Therapy for Spinal Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine if Proton Therapy can provide effective and safe treatment for Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors of the spine and Neurofibromas of the spine.
Nerve Sheath Tumors|Neurofibroma
RADIATION: Proton Radiation for MPNST|RADIATION: Proton Radiation for neurofibromas
Local Control, 7 years after completion of RT
Progression or palliation of pain, numbness, or weakness, At 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after RT|Number of adverse events, At 3, 6, 12, 24, 60 months and 15 years after RT|Quality of Life, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after RT|Rate of malignant transformation within the high-dose volume, 15 years after RT|Rate of second malignant primaries outside of high dose volume, but located in tissues exposed to radiation within the beam path, 15 years after RT
Proton therapy may provide the benefits of local control or palliation, while reducing the risk associated with photon radiation, by delivering therapeutic doses to a well-defined target area with significant reduction in the integral dose. A dosimetry comparison of protons and photons at the University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute confirmed the feasibility of proton irradiation of these tumors with less exposure of normal tissue to radiation than expected with photon techniques. This reduced radiation exposure to uninvolved normal tissues is expected to decrease the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies and neoplasms.
