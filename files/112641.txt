This is an open label, multi center, Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study of mevrometostat (PF-06821497) administered orally BID as a single agent or in combination with SOC to patients with CRPC, SCLC, and FL. The study consists of Part 1, Part 2 and the Japan and China monotherapy cohorts Part 1A will evaluate safety and target modulation of mevrometostat monotherapy in patients with SCLC, FL and CRPC. Mevrometostat will be administered as monotherapy in escalating doses to patients with FL (Part 1B) and mCRPC (Part 1C) to determine the monotherapy MTD. In Part 2A (dose escalation, RP2D finding for dose escalation), mevrometostat will be administered in combination with SOC to patients with mCRPC and SCLC. Japan and China monotherapy cohorts will evaluate the safety, antitumor activity and PK of single agent mevrometostat in Japanese and Chinese patients. In Part 2B (dose expansion), patients with mCRPC will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either SOC or mevrometostat in combination with SOC. Part 2B will assess the efficacy of mevrometostat at the RP2D in combination with SOC in patients with mCRPC in comparison to SOC alone. Part 2C will explore the efficacy of mevrometostat given at a different dose/dosing regimen than 2B in combination with SOC in patients with mCRPC.
