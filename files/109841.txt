Study of a Treatment Driven by Early PET Response to a Treatment Not Monitored by Early PET in Patients With AA Stage 3-4 or 2B HL
All study treatments have proven efficacy in the treatment in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). It is hoped that patients will achieve a good response to both induction therapies consisting either of 4 cycles of BEACOPPesc (Bleomycin, Etoposide, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Procarbazine, and Prednisone) or 2 cycles of BEACOPPesc plus 2 cycles of ABVD (Adriamycine, Bléomycine, Vinblastine, Décarbazine).

The use of F-FDG Position Emission Tomography performed after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (PET2) in the experimental arm will help to stratify patients in order to restrict the BEACOPPesc therapy continuation to those patients who achieved only a partial response after 2 BEACOPPesc regimen and to allow a conventional dose ABVD chemotherapy strategy for PET2 negative patients. For all patients included in the trial the achievement of a good response to induction treatment will be checked after four cycles of induction treatment including a centrally reviewed PET assessment

Patients will be randomized after verification of eligibility and before the start of the protocol treatment.Patients will be randomly assigned to the standard treatment arm not monitored by early PET, or the experimental treatment arm driven by the PET2 result.

Progression free survival, Evaluate by PFS at 5 years the non-inferiority of a chemotherapy of a therapeutic strategy driven by PET with a ABVD conventional dose chemotherapy for patients reaching a negative PET after 2 cycles of BEACOPPesc, compared to a treatment not monitored by early PET delivering 6 cycles of BEACOPPesc., 5 years
