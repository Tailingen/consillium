Changes in Brown Adipose Tissue Activity In Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered standard of care for prostate cancer. However, changes in the patients metabolism are usually seen as a result of hormone therapy. These changes include increased fat mass, decreased lean mass, weight gain, high blood cholesterol, increased incidence of diabetes, and possibly increased incidence of cardiac events such as heart attack. The researchers of this trial would like to learn if these change in body mass are affected by the presence of brown fat in the body. Brown fat is made up of fat cells that are stored in the body and generate heat to control body temperature. Levels of brown fat are at the highest in newborn babies and decrease over time into adulthood. The researchers of this trial would like to learn more about these changes in metabolism during prostate cancer treatment by studying the changes in brown fat during the first 12 months of hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
Change in brown adipose tissue activity, To assess the change in cold-activated borwn adipose tissue (BAT) activity upon initiation of GnRH agoinist or antagoinist therapy among men treated for prostate cancer. The primary endpoint is percent change in cold-activated BAT volumne after 12 months of treatment., 1 year
Interval change, To describe interval change in total body weight and body mass during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year|Interval change, To describe interval change in Total body fat mass as determined by body composition dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year|Interval change, To describe interval change in abdominal cross sectional subcutaneous fat area at the L4 verterbral body level during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year|Interval change, To describe interval change in insulin sensitivity (as refelcted by hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose, and fasting plasma insulin) during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year|Interval change, To describe interval change in serum lipid profile during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year|Interval change, To describe interval change in levels of several markers of BAT regulation \& activity in abdominal subcutaneous fat during GnRH agonist or antagonist therapy., 1 year
* Participants will be asked to come into the clinic for additional visits before they begin hormone therapy. The following procedures will be performed: Cold-activated PET/CT scan; body composition DXA scan; blood tests, questionnaires and abdominal fat biopsy.
* During hormone therapy, the participant will return to the clinical once after 3 months, and again after 6 months, to draw blood for laboratory tests.
* After 12 months of hormone therapy, the participant will return to teh clinic to repeat the following procedures: Cold-activated PET/CT scan; body composition DXA scan; blood tests; questionnaires and abdominal fat biopsy.
