Efficacy and Safety of Surufatinib Combined With Gemcitabine and Albumin-bound Paclitaxel in the Peri-operative Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer
This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of surufatinib combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as peri-operative treatment in locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: surufatinib + gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel
Surgical complete resection rate (R0), This is a complete macroscopic resection of the gross tumor with negative surgical margins, about 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR= Complete response rate + partial response rate, about 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR= Complete response rate + partial response rate + disease stable rate, about 2 years|Downstaging Rate, To determine the rate of downstaging after preoperative therapy, about 2 years|Surgical Resection Rate, To determine the rate of surgical resection after preoperative therapy, about 2 years|Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, pCR is defined as the absence of residual tumor cells in the pathological examination after resection, about 2 years|Major pathological response (MPR), MPR is defined as less than 10% residual tumor after neoadjuvant therapy, about 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS: from the initial date of neoadjuvant therapy to the date of death due to any cause. Patients without documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the last follow-up date. Estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., about 5 years|Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), RFS: from the initial date of neoadjuvant treatment to the first date of radiologic recurrence or death after perioperative treatment., about 3 years|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS: from the initial date of neoadjuvant treatment to the date of disease recurrence or death, whichever is earlier., about 3 years|Adverse events (AEs), treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, about 2 years
This is a phase II, multi-centered, open-label study, aims to explore the efficacy and safety of surufatinib (250mg, qd po) combined with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2, I.V, d1/8/15, Q4W) and nab-paclitaxel (125mg/m2, I.V, d1/8/15, Q4W) as peri-operative treatment in locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Potential therapeutic biomarkers will also be explored.
