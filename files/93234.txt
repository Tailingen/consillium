Sleep Apnoea Syndrome and Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), one of the most frequent respiratory diseases, could represent a major worsening factor in a non alcoholic steatohepatitis and neoplastic context. Our hypothesis is that OSA promotes the prevalence of HCC related to NASH. This national, multicenter study aims to compare the prevalence of OSA in a group of patient curatively resected for NASH-related HCC with a group of HCV-related HCC.

Consisting of 19 items, the PSQI measures several different aspects of sleep. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality., 2 years|This study will compare the Epworth Sleepiness Score between groups., The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire that's routinely used by doctors to assess daytime sleepiness.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common respiratory disease characterized by the occurrence of recurrent episodes of partial or total obstruction of the upper airway called hypopneas and apneas respectively. These episodes are associated with the repetitive occurrence of the desaturation-reoxygenation sequences, the so-called chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) which is the major stimulus underlying main cardiovascular, metabolic consequences and pro-inflammatory state found in patients with OSA. Recent data from cohort studies have established that OSA is an even greater risk factor for cancer-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second cancer related death worldwide and has an increasing impact in developed countries. The epidemic of metabolic syndrome (MS) plays a growing role in the occurrence of metabolic steatohepatitis (NASH) related HCC. Concerning transition from NASH to NASH-related HCC, neither the frequency nor the underlying mechanism are known. Very recently, a link between OSA (IH) and NASH has been highlighted. OSA and intermittent hypoxia should be a major worsening factor in a neoplastic context. Our hypothesis is that OSA promotes the prevalence of HCC in a context of NASH.

The objective is to compare the prevalence of OSA between patients with NASH-related and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC. In this type 3, cross-sectional, multicenter, national, non-randomized study patients suffering from a NASH-related or HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma will be recruited. Investigators expect to show a higher prevalence of OSA in patients with HCC NASH-related but also a shorter overall survival. Complementary ex vivo studies on tumor samples will be conducted in order to explore the mechanisms by which OSA and IH would promote carcinogenesis
