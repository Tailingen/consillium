Study of Induction of Hypothyroxinemia Adjunct to Conventional Therapies in GBM Patients
The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with hypothyroxinemia adjunct to conventional therapies in GBM patients.
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
DRUG: Combined T3 and Methimazole treatment
Response rate at 6 months (6 months PFS), The primary outcome measure of the study is the ratio of patients who complete their 6-month course of chemotherapy given the IP adjunct treatment. Each patient is treated up to 6 weeks until their FT4 target is reached at which time they enter a 26 week (6 month) treatment phase during which they receive chemotherapy as per common protocol with the IP as adjunct treatment. Patients will be monitored for disease progression as per common oncological protocol (e.g. every 2 months) and those who show progression will be deemed failures. Patients with no disease progression (or partial or complete remission) at the end of the 6 month period will be considered success., 32 weeks
Response rate at 2 months (2 months PFS), As a secondary outcome we will measure 2 month progression free survival as measured by RANO., 14 weeks|Response rate at 4 months (4 months PFS), As a secondary outcome we will measure 4 month progression free survival as measured by RANO., 23 weeks|Time to disease progression or cancer-related death, 32 weeks|Safety endpoint evaluation, Patients will be monitored throughout the study period for any Hypothyroxinemia treatment related safety issues including serious adverse events, any adverse events, vital signs, lab assessment, physical examination and lung function., 32 weeks
Since T4 (thyroxine) is a potent growth factor in numerous cancer types, the interventional approach will be to achieve thyroxine deprivation (hypothyroxinemia).This can be achieved by using a dual approach: T3 and methimazole to provide longer term inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis.
