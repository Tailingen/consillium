Clinical Study to Evaluate CryoBalloon™ Full and Swipe Ablation Systems for Ablation of Human Esophageal Epithelium
This study will evaluate the C2 CryoBalloon™ Full and Swipe Ablation Systems for the ablation of human esophageal epithelium in patients scheduled to undergo esophagectomy for reasons unrelated to the objective of the study
Esophageal Cancer
DEVICE: CryoBalloon™ Full Ablation System|DEVICE: CryoBalloon™ Swipe Ablation System
Safety of the CryoBalloon™ Full and Swipe Ablation System, Number of participants with serious, device-related adverse events after treatment with the CryoBalloon™ Swipe Ablation System, 2 weeks|Effect of Ablation to Submucosa at Different Depth of Tissue Ablation Using the CryoBalloon™ Full and Swipe Ablation Systems, Evaluated by depth and uniformity of ablation effect in the esophagus based on histopathologic assessment.

Dose response by effect of ablation to submucosa:

0: Normal

1. Inflammatory cell infiltration
2. Separation with inflammation
3. Edema and Necrosis, 2 weeks
Device Performance: Average Procedure Time, Average Procedure time as measured from start to finish of ablation., Minutes from start to end of procedure|Device Performance: Ease of Deployment of Device, Likert Scale measuring physician satisfaction. 0 (worst) to 10 (best), Minutes, from start to end of procedure
The primary outcomes for the study are the safety and treatment effect of the C2 CryoBalloon™ Ablation System. An esophagectomy will be performed as scheduled following the ablation procedure; histopathological analysis of surgically-resected specimens will be performed.
