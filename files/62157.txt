Peptide Vaccine and Temozolomide for Metastatic Melanoma Patients
The aim of the study is to assess if treatment with IDO/Survivin peptide vaccine can enhance the efficacy of temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Chemotherapy: Temozolomide
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate defined as complete remission rate + partial response + stable disease for a minimum of 6 months plus assessment of time to progression (TTP)., 18 months
Secondarily to studying the efficacy of the treatment; the investigators examine if treatment with IDO/Survivin peptide can induce a measurable cellular T-cell response when the vaccine is given in combination with temozolomide treatment for melanoma patients.
