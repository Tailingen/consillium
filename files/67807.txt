In our pediatric rehabilitation policlinic we have seen that these children has problems in balance and coordination from cause muscle weakness and cerebral-sensory-proprioceptive problems. We have evaluated with all parameters belong the physiotherapy and rehabilitation measurements and then planning this study with study protocol.
