A Phase 1/2 Study of CS7017, an Oral PPARγ Agonist, in Combination With Paclitaxel
The Phase I/II study will be conducted as an open label, multiple center study of CS-7017, an experimental drug and paclitaxel chemotherapy in subjects with advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer. Biopsies will be obtained from patients with accessible tumor at baseline, two-weeks after the first CS-7017 dosage (prior to the start of combination therapy) and at the end of the first study cycle (week 3 of combination therapy), in order to evaluate the effects of the study drug alone and in combination with the chemotherapy agent on the tumor. Treatment will continue until disease progression or the development of intolerable toxicities.
Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: CS-7017|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Overall Progression-free Survival in Participants After a Dosage of CS-7017 Administered Twice Daily in Combination With Paclitaxel Administered Once Every 3 Weeks to Participants With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from enrollment to the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From baseline up to disease progression or death, up to approximately 2 years postdose|Overall Survival in Participants After a Dosage of CS-7017 Administered Twice Daily in Combination With Paclitaxel Administered Once Every 3 Weeks to Participants With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date enrollment to the date of death., From baseline up to date of death, up to approximately 2 years postdose|Best Overall Response in Participants After a Dosage of CS-7017 Administered Twice Daily in Combination With Paclitaxel Administered Once Every 3 Weeks to Participants With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC), The best overall response was the best response (in the order of confirmed complete response \[CR\], confirmed partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], and progressive disease \[PD\]) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until the subject withdraws from the study. If there is no tumor assessment after the date of enrollment, the best overall response is classified as Unknown., From baseline up to disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity, up to approximately 2 years postdose
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Summarized by Worst CTCAE Grade (≥3) and Preferred Term After Administration of CS-7017 Combined With Paclitaxel Administered to Participants With Advanced Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that started or worsened after the first dose of any study drug (after Day 1 or first day of CS-7017 monotherapy) but adverse events occurring more than 30 days after the last dose are not considered TEAEs unless also considered to be related (possibly, probably, or definitely) to study drug., From baseline up to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 2 years
