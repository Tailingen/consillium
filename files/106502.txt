Prospective Ultrafast MRI Radiomics for Breast Cancer
The goal of this prospective study is to investigate the performance of ultrafast MRI radiomics in classifying histological factors and subtypes of breast cancer compared with standard MRI among radiologists with varying experience. The written informed consent was obtained from all participant. We extracted 1618 radiomic features from ultrafast and standard contrast-enhanced MRI before treatment. Classification of hormonal receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki67 status and subtypes was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) with the DeLong test.
