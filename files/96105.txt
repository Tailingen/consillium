CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Refractory and Relapsed CD19+ B Cell Neoplasms
One arm, open label study to assess the clinical use of Investigational Medicinal Product FCTX-CL19-1 (scientific name: Tarcidomgen Kimleucel) containing autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells with a preliminary determination of the safety of intravenous IMP administration in patients diagnosed with refractory and relapsed CD19 + B cell neoplasms.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)|Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)|Large B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: FCTX-CL19-1 (Tarcidomgen Kimleucel)
Percentage of patients with CRS in particular degree of severity according to ASTCT neurological side effects, febrile neutropenia and infection, cytopenia, other unspecified adverse events and death, Safety assessment of IMP administration as the percentage of patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in particular degree of severity according to ASTCT, neurological side effects, febrile neutropenia and infection, cytopenia, other unspecified adverse events and death as a result of the side effects and adverse events described within a 1 month after IMP administration, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Percentage of participants with response to the therapy (sum of complete remissions and partial responses in the particular malignancies), Percentage of participants with response to the Tarcidomgen Kimleucel, FCTX-CL19-1 therapy ( best overall response rate defined as the sum of complete remissions and partial responses in the particular malignancies) during one month (1 months, 30 days), three months (3 months, 90 days), twelve months (12 months, 360 days) after IMP administration, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Percentage of participants with no possibility to receive the product due to the production failure, Percentage of participants with no possibility to receive FCTX-CL19-1 (Tarcidomgen Kimleucel) product that meets the assumed quality criteria due to the production failure, through study completion, an average of 1 year
The aim of the study is to determine the safety of therapy with the study medicinal product FCTX-CL19-1 (Tarcidomgen Kimleucel) with preliminary determination of efficacy, as part of a phase I clinical trial in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell CD19+ tumors.

The hypothesis of the study assumes that the use of the newly developed product FCTX-CL19-1 (Tarcidomgen Kimleucel) containing autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells is safe and will lead to remission of B-cell cancer resistant to current treatment.
