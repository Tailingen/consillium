An Early Stage Study to Evaluate Oba01 for Injection in Patients With DR5 Positive LA/mNSCLC
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Oba01 for injection in patients with DR5 positive LA/mNSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Oba01
maximal tolerance dose (MTD) of Oba01, Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one of six patients experienced DLT during the DLT assessment window., DLT will be evaluated on 21 days of observation period
Overall response rate(ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by investigators according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation., Up to approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of first dose to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of first dose to death., Up to approximately 2 years
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Oba01 for injection in patients with DR5 positive LA/mNSCLC.
