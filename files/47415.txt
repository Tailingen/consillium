Swiss Prospective, Multicenter Study Sentinel Lymph Node Procedure in Colon Cancer
The study is a feasibility and validation study of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure in all stages of colon cancer. If the SLN can be reliably identified, it could be submitted to a more accurate histopathological examination (multiple sections, special staining). The detection of micrometastases in the SLN (occult stage III, upstaging) is possible. Patients with micrometastases should be considered at higher risk.

Additionally, a search for occult metastatic tumor cells in the bone marrow is performed.
Colonic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Sentinel lymph node procedure|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow aspiration
To assess the extent of upstaging due to the SLN procedure for colon cancer., 1 month
To evaluate the accuracy of the SLN procedure for colon cancer. To identify factors influencing the success of the procedure. To correlate SLN results with the presence of colon cancer cell in bone marrow aspirates. To assess OS and DFS., 1 month, 3 and 5 years after surgery
