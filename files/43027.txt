Verification of Saliva MMP-1 as a Diagnostic Marker of Oral Cavity Cancer
The study is designed to measure salivary matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) we developed previously in patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and healthy participants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of the newly developed salivary MMP-1 ELISA as an adjunctive tool to aid in diagnosis of OSCC.
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MMP-1 Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Sensitivity and Specificity (both range from 0 to 1, the higher the better) of salivary MMP-1 levels as a diagnostic marker for OSCC, 30 days from initial sample obtained for this study
ROC analysis of non-cancer group versus OSCC patients to find the optimal cutoff as the maximum of Youden's index (calculated as sensitivity + specificity - 1 and ranges from 0 to 1, the higher the better), 30 days from initial sample obtained for this study
