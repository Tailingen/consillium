SentiMag® Intraoperative Comparison in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this pivotal study is to provide prospective evidence that the SentiMag®/SiennaXP® is safe and non-inferior to the current standard of care for lymph node localization in patients with breast cancer as part of a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure and to summarize measures of product safety and performance.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: SiennaXP|DRUG: Technetium Tc99m Sulfur Colloid|DRUG: Isosulfan blue dye
Number of Participants With Detected Lymph Nodes, The proportion of lymph nodes detected intraoperatively by SentiMag and SiennaXP in relation the proportion of lymph nodes detected by the combination of Technetium Sulfur Colloid and Isosulfan blue dye, During surgical procedure <1 hour|Safety of SiennaXP and SentiMag® as Indicated by Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Their Relatedness to the Detection Method or Procedure., Number of Participants with Adverse Events relating to Sienna XP Injection, 3-6 weeks
Nodal Concordance: Number of Nodes Identified by Both Test and Control Out of Nodes Identified by Control, The number of nodes identified by both SiennaXP and Control out of nodes identified by Control, Intraoperative <1 hour|Number of Participants With Lymph Nodes Detected by Combined Radioisotope,Blue Dye and Magnetic Technique, The per patient detection rate for a combination of all methods (magnetic, combined radioisotope and blue dye; radioisotope alone; blue dye alone), Intraoperative <1 hour
This is a pivotal, prospective, open label, multicenter, paired comparison of the SentiMag® and SiennaXP® magnetic sentinel node localization system with the standard of care (radioisotope with blue dye) for lymph node localization in the detection of lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy. The trial is designed to provide powered evidence that the lymph node detection rate of the SentiMag® and SiennaXP® system is non-inferior to the standard of care in patients with breast cancer.
