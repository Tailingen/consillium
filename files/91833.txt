Minimal Residual Disease in Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
As T-cell receptor sequencing by LymphoTrack is an assay with high sensitivity that can be performed in peripheral blood, the investigators wish to evaluate the ability of this assay to predict which patients are at higher risk of relapse after initial therapy for peripheral T-cell lymphomas which is being given for curative intent. Additionally, as more is known about the ability of dynamic monitoring of cfDNA in B-cell lymphomas to predict relapse, the investigators wish to explore the use of this technology in T-cell lymphomas.
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw|PROCEDURE: Lymphotrack TCR clonality assay
Feasibility of LymphoTrack TCR clonality assay of evaluating minimal residual disease as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) at the completion of 2 years, 2 years
Feasibility of LymphoTrack TCR clonality assay of evaluating minimal residual disease as measured by the ability of Lymphotrack to detect minimal residual disease in at least 60% of baseline samples, Baseline|Evaluate whether LymphoTrack TCR clonality assay can distinguish participants with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) who are at risk of relapse, Through 2 years|Percentage of participants with a dominant tumor sequence identified from the pre-treatment test specimen, Baseline|Determine whether monitoring for the tumor-specific clone at minimal residual disease (MRD) level predicts response to treatment, Through 2 years|Rate of decline of the tumor specific sequence or sequences predict duration of response, Through 2 years|Characterize the lead time from MRD positivity to subsequent clinical relapse, Through 2 years
