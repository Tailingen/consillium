Change from baseline in the score of resilience (measured by Mainzer Resilience Scale for childhood cancer (MRScc)) at yearly intervals up to 5 years, Stress reactivity measured by the Mainz Resilience Score for childhood cancer (MRScc). The MRScc consists of 4 dimensions on mental health problems and 6 dimensions on stressor exposure. For both categories mental health problems and stressor exposure 4 - 400 points can be achieved. To calculate the resilience score, the category mental health problems is divided by the category stressor exposure. A score \>0 means low resilience, a score \< 0 means high resilience., baseline, after 1 year, after 2 years, after 3 years, after 4 years, after 5 years|Change from baseline in the score of resilience (measured by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)) at yearly intervals up to 5 years, Resilience will be evaluated using the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). BRS is a 6 item scale, the items are rated from 1 to 5. A total score is calculated by determining the sum of the individual items which result in a total score ranging from 6 to 30. A higher score means a higher resilience., baseline, after 1 year, after 2 years, after 3 years, after 4 years, after 5 years|Change from baseline in the score of resilience (measured by the Child & Youth Resilience Measure-Revised (CYRM-R)) at yearly intervals up to 5 years, Resilience will be evaluated using the Child \& Youth Resilience Measure-Revised (CYRM-R).

The items within the measures can be directly summed to gain a total score of an individual's resilience.

The questionnaire consists of nine items intended to identify a patient's risk status (high, medium, or low) of poor pain-related outcome using established psychosocial prognostic factors. The PPST is adapted from the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) and validated for the pediatric population from 8 to 18 years. The PPST contains two subscales: physical and psychosocial items. Summing all items, PPST total scores range from 0 to 9. Psychosocial subscale scores range from 0 to 5 and 0 to 4 for the physical subscale. The low risk group was defined as a PPST total score of 0 to 2 (PPST total cutoff for disability minus the PPST psychosocial subscale cutoff for psychosocial distress). For the high-risk group, a score of 3 or greater for the PPST psychosocial subscale was defined as high-risk, and last, a total PPST score greater than or equal to 3 and psychosocial subscale 0 to 2 were defined as medium risk., baseline, after 1 year, after 2 years, after 3 years, after 4 years, after 5 years|Change from baseline in the subjective pain perception (measured with the face pain scale - revised (FPS-R)) at yearly intervals up to 5 years, The subjective pain rating will be measured using the Face Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R), that is a self-report measure of the actual, subjective pain intensity developed for children. The FPS-R was adapted from the Faces Pain Scale to make it possible to score the sensation of pain on the 0-to-10 metric in children and adolescents. The scale shows a close linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the age range of 4-16 years and has already been used and validated with children and adolescents.

The calculation of the socioeconomic status index is based on the dimensions "levels of education", "occupational status" and "income". Scores for each dimension ranged from 1 to a maximum of 7. Since the 3 subscales are included in the calculation with the same weight, the socioeconomic status index can assume values between 3.0 and 21.0. Higher scores mean higher socioeconomic status., baseline
The longitudinal, prospective and monocentric cohort study at the University Medical Centre Mainz is based on the Europe-wide, multicentre FORTEe study \[NCT05289739\]. The Kolibri study aims to complement the FORTEe trial. Kolibri allows the inclusion of patients who are not receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or who are undergoing oncological aftercare.

The longitudinal design of the study will allow the effects of exercise therapy on cancer-related fatigue, health-related quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes, as well as on physical function, to be monitored over the course of oncological treatment, and will provide conclusions about the effectiveness and benefits of exercise therapy. This will enable the establishment and improvement of exercise therapy protocols, as the effects of the exercise dose applied can be observed and compared over time.

The project will also validate and test the reliability of the Mainz Resilience Score in childhood cancer (MRScc) developed in the FORTEe project. The aim is to establish a validated questionnaire to assess resilience in children and adolescents with cancer, as no questionnaires are currently available.
