Safety and Efficacy of Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T Cells Therapy in the Treatment of r/r MM
It is a single-center, open-labeled, single-arm, non-randomized investigator-initiated trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells therapy for relapsed and refractory(r/r) multiple myeloma(MM).
Multiple Myeloma in Relapse|Multiple Myeloma, Refractory
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells infusion
Incidence of adverse events(AE) after infusion, The frequency, severity, and laboratory findings of all adverse events/serious adverse events are included. Description, time, classification, and outcome of AE events resulted from the investigational medical product, delivery method, or emergency measures will be recorded in the case report form., Up to 12 months after infusion|Dose limited toxicity (DLT), Dose limited toxicity(DLT) was defined as the occurrence of any of the following adverse events within 28 days of the infusion of CAR-T cells after optimal supportive treatment, which were discussed with the investigator and determined to be associated or likely to be associated with the infusion., Up to 1 month after infusion
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving strict complete remission(sCR), complete response(CR), very good partial response(VGPRï¼‰ and partial response(PR)., Up to 2 years after infusion|Concentration of CAR-T cells, Concentration of CAR-T cells measured by Flow cytometry after CAR-T infusion, Days 4, 7, 10, 14 and months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 after infusion|Progression-free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival(PFS) refers to the time from cell reinfusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the time the patient received an infusion of CAR-T cells until death (from any cause)., Up to 2 years
This open label, single-arm, Phase I study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T in subjects with relapsed and refractory(r/r) multiple myeloma(MM). A leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture Anti-GPRC5D chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Prior to Anti-GPRC5D CAR-T cells infusion subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. After infusion, the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy was evaluated by investigators.
