Evaluation of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 + Veledimex in Subjects With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma, a Substudy to ATI001-102
This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intratumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex.

Patients who are scheduled for craniotomy and tumor resection will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the follow-up period.
