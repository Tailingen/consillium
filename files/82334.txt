Phase 3 Trial in Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Subjects Comparing Ipilimumab Versus Placebo in Addition to Paclitaxel and Carboplatin
The purpose of the study is to determine whether Ipilimumab plus Paclitaxel and Carboplatin will extend the lives of patients with squamous only non small cell lung cancer more than placebo plus Paclitaxel and Carboplatin.
Lung Cancer - Non Small Cell Squamous
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Who Received at Least One Dose of Blinded Study Therapy at Primary Endpoint, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Participants that had not died were censored at last known date alive. Median OS time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier Estimates. Analysis for the Primary Endpoint occurred when the following 2 conditions were both met: (1) 518 deaths were observed in randomized participants treated with at least one dose of blinded study therapy and (2) 705 deaths were observed in all randomized participants., Randomization until 518 deaths were observed in randomized participants treated with at least one dose of blinded study therapy and 705 deaths were observed in all randomized participants, up to June 2015 (approximately 48 months post study start)
Overall Survival (OS) in All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Participants that had not died were censored at last known date alive. Median OS time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier Estimates. Analysis for the Primary Endpoint occurred when the following 2 conditions were both met: (1) 518 deaths were observed in randomized participants treated with at least one dose of blinded study therapy and (2) 705 deaths were observed in all randomized participants., Randomization until 518 deaths were observed in randomized participants treated with at least one dose of blinded study therapy and 705 deaths were observed in all randomized participants, up to June 2015 (approximately 48 months post study start)|Median Number of Months With Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per mWHO in Participants Who Have Received at Least One Dose of Blinded Study Therapy at Primary Endpoint, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of tumor progression per Modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria or death, whichever occurs first. A participant who died without reported progression per mWHO criteria were considered to have progressed on the date of death. For participants who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS was censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. For participants who remain alive and have no recorded post-baseline tumor assessment, PFS was censored on the day of randomization., Randomization until 518 deaths were observed in randomized participants treated with at least one dose of blinded study therapy and 705 deaths were observed in all randomized participants, up to June 2015 (approximately 48 months post study start)
The primary objective is to compare Overall Survival (OS) of participants with Stage IV/recurrent NSCLC of squamous histology who have been randomized to ipilimumab in addition to paclitaxel and carboplatin versus placebo in addition to paclitaxel and carboplatin, and have received at least one dose of blinded study therapy (ipilimumab or placebo).
