Clinical Application of Image-Guided Liver Surgery
Image-guided surgery is a new technology, which is used to create 3-D pictures that generate a map of the liver. This map will allow surgeons to know the exact anatomical location of their instruments, including instances when direct visualization is not possible. This study is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of using image-guided techniques for treatment of liver tumors. The overall goal of this study is to use image-guided surgery for the improvement of the surgeon's ability to remove liver tumors.

Number of Participants Who Have a Successful Intraoperative Registrations (Phase 1 Portion of Study), * 10 successful intraoperative registrations with no more than 30% failure rate over all the cases will be considered a successful endpoint
* A successful registration is defined as one which yields an RMS surface residual of â‰¤ 10 mm and is determined to be success after qualitative evaluation., Completion of surgery|Accuracy With Which Image-guided Surgery (IGS) Can be Used to Implant a Ceramic Bead Inside a Tumor as Measured by Successful Deliveries of the Bead to Within 8mm of the Pre-operatively Planned Target Point (Phase 2 Portion of Study), * Calculation of bead delivery accuracy using the IGS system involves the acquisition of images of the resected specimen and then the co-registration of the post-resection images to the pre-operative image set. Given that the target location is marked in the pre-operative image set and the registration calculation allows an overlay of the two image sets a Euclidean distance error can be calculated between the true bead location and the pre-operatively determined target. Given that the error involved in computing the registration between the two image sets is included within the bead delivery target error calculation it is imperative that the impact of registration error is minimized.
* Numbers represented are the distance between the planned target site and the true bead location, Completion of surgery|Target Accuracy of an Ablation Probe Using Image-guided Surgery Technology as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Had Ablation Burns Within a 5mm Radius of the Tumor Centroid (Phase 3 Portion of Study), -A measurement of the ablation probe placement via the burn zone will be performed by pathology via specimen sectioning., Completion of surgery|The Number of Participants Who Have Complete Ablation According to Early Post-ablative Imaging Studies as Well as no Recurrence of the Tumor Within 6 Months (Phase 4 Portion of the Study), -A successful endpoint will be a 90% success rate of complete ablation according to early post-ablative imaging studies as well as no recurrence of the tumor within 6 months., 6 months post-ablation
