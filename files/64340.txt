Prospective Study to Observe and Manage Progression of Pulmonary Nodules
Based on the previous review and research, we would like to further observe the nodule changes in patients with pulmonary nodules. These changes include factors such as the reason for the further enlargement or deterioration of the nodule, time, lifestyle, the patient's region, and hereditary medical history. At the same time, we will further look at the corresponding characteristics of a population that does not change the size and nature of the nodule, including age, gender, and all the factors discussed above. On this basis, we can propose more scientific methods for the treatment and management of pulmonary nodules, and provide a more reliable clinical reference for the clinical treatment of pulmonary nodules.
