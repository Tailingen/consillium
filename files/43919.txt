Study of Tipifarnib in Patients With Previously-Treated, Advanced, HRAS Mutant Urothelial Carcinoma
Platinum-based chemotherapy is now regarded a standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, patients who failed to response or experienced progression after platinum-based chemotherapy have a grim prognosis and a standard salvage treatment is not available.

UC is known to harbor multiple mutations. In the investigators' own high-throughput molecular profiling study, the most commonly observed mutations included TP53, FGFR3(fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ) and HRAS. Since RAS signaling can be attenuated using selective farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors, tipifarnib, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of FTase, was proposed to be an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of UC.
