Dose Escalation and Expansion of Ziftomenib in Combination With Quizartinib in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The goal of this all-oral combination is to deliver safe and effective therapy for the largest portion of AML subtypes (NPM1mt, KMT2Ar, NUP98r \~ 40-45%).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Primary Objective:

Cohort 1A: To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ziftomenib in combination with quizartinib and assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Secondary Objectives:

To assess the preliminary efficacy of the combination of quizartinib and ziftomenib by FLT3 mutational status.

To assess overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR).

To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ziftomenib and quizartinib when used in combination.

To assess minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry.
