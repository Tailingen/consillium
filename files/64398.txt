the"Fuzheng" Therapy of TCM to Improve the Survival Quality of Early-stage NSCLC by Intervening the CTCs
Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor cells(CTCs) play a key role in the process of distant metastasis. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented by Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence, individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
DRUG: JinFuKang|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression-Free Survival, It is decided by a doctor via the clinical examinations, The progression disease is assessed based on CT or PET-CT every six months from date of randomization and the endpoints is the date of first documented progression or date of death due to lung cancer,assessed up to Two years.
Circulating Tumor Cell, It is decided by a doctor via the clinical examinations, 24months|Overall survival, It is decided by a doctor via the clinical examinations, Two years
Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with lung cancer, and circulating tumor cells play a key role in the process of distant metastasis.In recent years, research results have shown that CTCs may become a emerging marker and new target in the treatment of lung cancer. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented by TCM in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence, individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of lung cancer.
