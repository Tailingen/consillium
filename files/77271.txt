Combination of Chemoradiation With Immunotherapy in Inoperable œsophageal Cancer
The main objective of the trial is to assess the feasibility and the safety of the addition of immunotherapy with PD-1 antibody nivolumab +/- CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab to concomitant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in inoperable patients with early or locally advanced oesophageal cancer and to select the more promising experimental arm among the two possible combinations in terms of activity (based on progression free survival (PFS) at 12 months according to RECIST 1.1) for further evaluation in a phase III trial.

The secondary objectives will aim to evaluate progression-free survival, failure-free survival and overall survival and pattern of progression (including incidence of distance metastasis).
