Study of iBreast, a Handheld Device to Detect Breast Abnormalities During Screening Visits for Breast Cancer
This study will test the iBreastExam device to find out whether it can detect a mass or lump in the breast as accurately as a routine breast cancer screening examination.

The iBreastExam is a handheld device that performs a painless electronic palpation (examination by touch) of the breast. The device is designed to detect breast abnormalities that may require breast imaging and additional clinical examination by a nurse or doctor. The iBreastExam device creates a color map of the breast, with red spots indicating areas that may be abnormal.
