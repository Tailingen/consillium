A Multi-omic Approach to Evaluate and Characterize the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Phenotype
The purpose of this research study is to explore the relationship between the gut microbiome and hormone levels in women diagnosed with PCOS and determine whether there are differences in the gut microbiome between women with PCOS and women without PCOS.

Consented, enrolled participants will complete a health questionnaire, complete a fasted blood draw at a local laboratory, and provide a stool, saliva, and vaginal swab sample for comprehensive biomarkers, hormones, metagenomics, and metabolomics analysis.
