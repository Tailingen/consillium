Maintain Respiratory Muscle Function and Reduce Pneumonia Risk in Cancer Patients
This research is intended to begin to explore the impact of inspiratory muscle resistance exercise and/or 1,25(OH)2D3 for improving respiratory muscle strength in cancer patients (subjects).

DRUG: 1,25 (OH)2 D3|OTHER: Inspiratory isometric resistance training|DRUG: Oral Placebo|OTHER: Sham Inspiratory Isometric Resistance Training|DEVICE: Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer (IMT)
Sniff Nasal Inspiratory Pressure (SNIP), SNIP is a test of maximal inspiratory muscle force exerting from the diaphram. Patients sniff forcefully through one nostril while the other is obstructed. The best of 10 measurements is recorded., 8 weeks
