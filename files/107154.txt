Frailty in Patients With Gastrointestinal Cancer Who Are Undergoing Major Surgery
This research is for patients who have gastrointestinal cancer and have a planned major surgery. The purpose of this research is to identify cancer patients who may be at risk for frailty. Frailty is common in older adults and may include symptoms of weight loss, weakness, fatigue, low activity, slow walking and other illnesses. Frailty may increase the risk of problems after major surgery. The study will involve a survey, a blood sample, and a review of medical records.
Gastrointestinal Cancer
OTHER: Frailty survey
Percent of patients considered frail assessed by Clinical Risk Analysis Index (RAI-C) Scores of 21 or higher, Assess Clinical Risk Analysis Index (RAI-C) Scores in rural patients referred for major abdominal surgeries. Survey values will be added to yield a final RAI-C score between 0 and 81. Percent of patients considered frail will be defined as Clinical Risk Analysis Index (RAI-C) Scores of 21 or higher, pre-operative
Adverse outcomes after major surgery, Assess adverse outcomes postoperatively and if their is a correlation with the frailty score, 30 days post-operative
The goals of the study are to:

* Describe the rate of frailty in surgical cancer patients
* Assess if frailty correlates with problems (adverse outcomes) after major surgery

Participants taking part will be asked to complete a survey to assess frailty before surgery. The frailty survey is referred to as the Clinical Risk Analysis Index (RAI-C).

Participants will have about 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of blood drawn before surgery. Blood tests will include complete blood count (CBC), vitamin A, creatinine, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), DHEA, albumin, and prealbumin.
