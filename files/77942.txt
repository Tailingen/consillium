Non-interventional Study to Collect Real-world Clinical and Patient-reported Outcomes in Ovarian Cancer
This prospective non-interventional study is intended to generate new data and insights into first-line (1L) treatment of newly diagnosed advanced high-grade epithelial Ovarian cancer (OC) in Germany relevant for patients, physicians and payers. It will capture the influence of 1L Poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) maintenance treatment (MTX) on medical routine in Germany, especially on:

* outcome of the 3-steps 1L treatment phase (including surgery, Chemotherapy (CTX) and MTX) including the potential of patients with primary advanced OC to be cured,
* patient's follow-up (FU) during and after MTX therapy,
* patient-reported outcomes (PROs), experiences and needs,
* physician's experience,
* BRCA/HRD and genomic scar testing behavior at diagnosis/during 1L therapy,
* patient selection for different 1L systemic treatment approaches,
* use and safety of drugs,
* treatment sequence in case of recurrence

Methods and intervals of tumor assessments are at the discretion of the treating physician and will be recorded in the eCRF, time from 1st dose of 1L platinum-based CTX to 3rd, 4th, 5th and later disease progression [investigator-assessed according to clinical routine] or death of any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 84 months|Time to 3rd, 4th, 5th and later subsequent therapy (TST 3rd, 4th, 5th ff.), Time to 3rd, 4th, 5th and later subsequent therapy (TST 3rd, 4th, 5th ff.) is defined as time from 1st dose of 1L platinum-based CTX to the 1st dose of 3rd, 4th, 5th and later subsequent therapy or death of any cause, defined as time from 1st dose of 1L platinum-based CTX to the 1st dose of 3rd, 4th, 5th and later subsequent therapy or death of any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 84 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from 1st dose of 1L platinum-based CTX to death of any cause, time from 1st dose of 1L platinum-based CTX to death of any cause, assessed up to 84 months|Patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) - EQ-5D questionnaire, The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments designed by the EuroQoL Group (EQ).
