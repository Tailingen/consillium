Study of the Outcome of Patients With Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome Receiving Iron Chelation Therapy After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Iron chelation, mostly associated with multiple red blood cell transfusion, is relatively common in patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCT.

This multicenter prospective observational study is designed to establish the impact of iron chelation on relapse after allo-HSCT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The investigators will compare the results obtained in the prospective study to those observed in a historical retrospective cohort of paired patients who did not receive chelation. Given our clinical experience and literature results, the investigators will evaluate the Exjade chelator. Although not demonstrated, the presence of mutations of the HFE gene could play an indirect role on leukemogenesis by promoting overload. It is therefore important to evaluate the status in this patient population.
Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: EXJADE
Impact of iron chelation on relapse-free survival rate, Relapse-free survival will be defined as the number of days between the date of diagnosis and the date of death and / or relapse (or censored at the end of follow-up)., At 2 years
Comparison of relapse-free survival after allograft of chelated patients to allografted patients not receiving chelation., Matching variables will include disease type (AML or MDS), prognostic factors (cytogenetics, molecular biology, age), donor type / matching, and type of conditioning., At 2-year|Cumulative incidence of GVHD, Acute and chronic GVHD date and maximum grade using international classification, 3 months, 1 and 2 years|Rate of infection, during the observation period, Through study completion, an average of 4 years|Hematological toxicity during administration of Exjade, Hemoglobin level; Current average frequency of transfusions, Through study completion, an average of 4 years|Non-hematological toxicity during administration of Exjade, Ferritinemia, Through study completion, an average of 4 years|Non-hematological toxicity during administration of Exjade, Transferrin, Through study completion, an average of 4 years
