Studying Tumor Tissue Samples and Blood Samples to Learn More About DNA Changes in Patients With Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor tissue samples and blood samples to learn more about DNA changes in patients with lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
Mutational status of the EGFR pathway, up to 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

* Examine the mutational status of the EGFR pathway in tumor and blood samples from patients with lung cancer.
* Correlate the EGFR pathway mutations in these samples with clinical outcomes of these patients.

OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed via PCR to detect EGFR pathway mutations in DNA.
