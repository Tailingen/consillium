The goal of this retrospective cohort study is to analyze change of treatment strategies affect the survival outcomes in patients of pancreatic cancer who received curative-intent treatment. The main question it aims to answer is:

Hypothesis: Change of treatment strategies involving increased utility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and aggressive surgical approaches of extended pancreatectomy improved the overall and progression free survival in the patients with pancreatic cancer.

Participants received curative treatment for pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer|Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy|Pancreatectomy
Overall survival and Progression-free survival, Overall survival was calculated from the first treatment day of the disease to the day of mortality. Progression-free survival was calculated from the first treatment day of the disease to the day of proression or recurrece of pancreatic cancer., From enrollment to two years after the end of treatment
This study is to analyze the change of treatment strategies and shift of the paradigm over time in a single center. Researchers plan to see the impact of the evolvement to the survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer.
