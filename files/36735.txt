Evaluation of Patient and Lesion Specific Prognostic Factors for Standard Radioimmunotherapy
MERIT-NHL as an addendum to the International Registry of Radioimmunotherapy (RIT registry) pooling clinical data of patients who suffered from a non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma also includes the documentation of the respective FDG-PET and CT-image files in an online archive.

Based on these documented clinical and imaging data, the MERIT study group centrally performs an intra- as well as interindividual evaluation of follicular CD20+ lymphoma lesions before and after radioimmunotherapy. According to this, the aim of the MERIT-NHL study is to prospectively identify yet unknown patient- and lesion specific prognostic factors predicting patient´s outcome in line with the therapeutic modality radioimmunotherapy.
