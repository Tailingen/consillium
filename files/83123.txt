Study of AVZO-023 as a Single Agent and in Combination With AVZO-021, and/or Endocrine Therapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study, the first clinical trial of AVZO-023, aims to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, maximum tolerated dose, and anti-tumor effects of AVZO-023 in patients with advanced solid tumors. AVZO-023 is an oral medication that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4).

AVZO-023 is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of CDK4. AVZO-021 is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of CDK2 that is currently being investigated in a global Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced hormone receptive positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer and cyclin E1 protein (CCNE1)-amplified malignancies (NCT05867251).

In Phase 1, the safety and tolerability of AVZO-023 in patients with advanced solid tumors that are CDK4/CCND1 amplified and in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) will be assessed. The goal of Phase 1 is to determine the MTD/preliminary RP2D of AVZO-023 for use as monotherapy and in combination with AVZO-021 with or without endocrine therapy (ET).

Phase 2 will assess the antitumor activity and confirm the RP2D of AVZO-023 in combination therapy in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or mBC.
