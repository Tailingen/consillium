Phase I Study of RiMO-401 With Radiation in Advanced Tumors
This is a single arm study of RiMO-401 with radiation in patients with advanced tumors. A single escalation dose of RiMO-401 is intratumorally injected in a 3+3 study design to identify the recommended dose.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Intratumoral Injection
DRUG: RiMO-401
Determination of Recommended Dose, The dose limiting toxicities of RiMO-401 with palliative radiation, as assessed by CTCAEv5, will not be observed in 33% or more patients, 45 Days
Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be determined by imaging according to RECIST 1.1, 45 Days|Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability, Incidence and severity of clinical and laboratory adverse events will be assessed according to CTCAEv5, 45 Days
Evaluation of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Plasma concentrations of RiMO-401 will be measured until 8 days after administration, 8 Days|Evaluation of Area Under the Curve (AUC), Plasma concentrations of RiMO-401 will be measured until 8 days after administration, 8 Days
Primary Objectives:

â€¢ To determine the tolerability of RiMO-401 with palliative radiation as assessed by CTCAEv5

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine clinical response of RiMO-401 with palliative radiotherapy
* To characterize adverse events of RiMO-401 in patients with advanced cancers
* To characterize the pharmacokinetics of RiMO-401 with palliative radiation

The target population comprises patients with clinically accessible lesions that can be trated with palliative radiation.
