Return to Work and Living Healthy After Head and Neck Cancer
Based on a randomized controlled trial, the manualized group intervention Return to work and living healthy after head and neck cancer (RELIANCE) for head and neck cancer survivors will be tested against a non-manualized control intervention (social counseling) in order to evaluate the efficacy of the RELIANCE intervention compared to the control condition. The study design includes two phases, the initial study phase (pilot study) and the intervention study (RCT). The aim of the pilot study is to implement and ensure the necessary standardized procedures for the implementation of patient recruitment and interventions. In the randomized controlled trial, potential participants are assigned to the intervention group or to the control group.
