Homologous Recombination Repair Status as a Biomarker of Response in Locally Recurrent/Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Concurrent Cisplatin and Radiation Therapy
The study is being done to find out if the results of a pre-treatment biopsy can predict response to cisplatin and radiation treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent triple negative breast cancer.

RADIATION: external beam radiation therapy|DRUG: cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Biopsy of Target Tumor
Response (RECIST 1.1 vs. PET Response Criteria (PRC) as Measurement Tools for Treatment Response), RECIST 1.1 as measurement tools for treatment response., 2 years
