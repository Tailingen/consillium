Ultra High Field MRI and MRS Techniques in Diagnosing Breast Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in diagnosing breast cancer. New diagnostic procedures may be a more sensitive way to detect breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: high field strength magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging|PROCEDURE: chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
Sensitivity and specificity, Ninety-percent simultaneous confidence rectangles for sensitivity and specificity will be constructed at the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of the model predicted probability of disease., At time of imaging procedure
Pathological disease status, A generalized linear mixed models analysis of variance with a logit link will be used to predict pathological disease status from MRI and MRS parameters., At time of imaging procedure
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To implement quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, 31 phosphorus (31P) MRS, magnetization transfer (MT)-MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-MRI, and high-resolution structural imaging at 7 Tesla in patients for diagnosing breast tumors.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo measurement of tumor perfusion and permeability using DCE-MRI, tumor cellularity using DW-MRI, phospholipid metabolism using 31P MRS, macromolecular content using MT-MRI, and cellular protein content using CEST-MRI. Diagnostic performance of one, or a combination, of these metrics will be investigated in the context of breast cancer.
