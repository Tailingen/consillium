Frequency and nature of ADRs on the Naranjo Scale Questionnaire, Measure the frequency and nature of adverse drug reactions by obtaining a complete medical history and physical examination and validating the patient's current concomitant medication list during the office visit. Patient medical information would be input into the ActX platform, which functions as a computable EHR medical record analysis, evaluation of polypharmacy status, and monitoring of ADRs using the Naranjo Scale will be conducted for the duration of the study., 5 years
Self-reported Health status and any significant changes, The EQ-5D-5L survey, designed to collect data on health status and significant changes, will be administered to every patient in the registry at each clinic visit and at least every six months for five years after enrollment.

The EQ-5D-5L consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension features five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Patients indicate their health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement for each dimension. This choice generates a one-digit number representing the selected level for that dimension. The numbers from the five dimensions can be combined into a five-digit number that characterizes the patient's health state., 5 years
This research will explore how genetics, diet, exercise, and jobs influence the risk of developing cancers that can be treated early. The goal is to find out if this knowledge can help doctors and health insurers improve their methods for preventing cancers that cannot be treated.
