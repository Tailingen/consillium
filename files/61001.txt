Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Percutaneous Cryoablation for Renal Tumours < 4cm in Patients Who Are Not Candidates for Partial Nephrectomy
The main objective is to evaluate the oncologic efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation of renal tumors smaller than 4 cm in patients with renal cancer that cannot be offered a partial nephrectomy. The oncologic outcome will be assessed by the presence or absence of residue or recurrence during a follow-up by MRI performed the first 12 months (M1, M3, M6, M12).
Renal Tumors Less Than 4 cm
DEVICE: Galil Medical patented 17G Cryoablation Needles
Suspicious contrast enhancement and progression in size of the cryolesion detected by MRI, The success of cryoablation will be declared if the control at 1 year shows no suspicious contrast enhancement (the suspicious character is defined by significant contrast uptake (\>15%) and heterogeneous or nodular or crescent-shape contrast enhancement) and if the cryolesion is not progressing in size compared to early post-ablation control (M1)., 1 year
