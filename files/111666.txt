TCH Versus EC-TH as Neoadjuvant Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
Both TCH (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer have been recommended by NCCN guideline. It is unknown which regimen is better. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCH (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2-Positive breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and hospitalizations.
