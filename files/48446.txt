ADV-TK Improves Outcome of Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, but the prognosis for patients with these tumors remains poor despite advances in diagnosis and standard therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The advantages of ADV-TK gene therapy highlight its efficacy and safety for glioma patients. This clinical trial was conducted to assess the anti-tumor efficacy and safety of intraarterial cerebral infusion of replication-deficient adenovirus mutant ADV-TK, in combination with systemic intravenous GCV administration in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.
