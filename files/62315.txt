Performance of a panel of methylation markers for the detection of bladder cancer in patient presenting with hematuria., Early detection of bladder cancer in patients presenting with hematuria, 1 year
Predictiveness of a panel of methylation markers combined with clinical risk factors for the detection of bladder cancer., Accurately predict clinical risk of bladder cancer through clinical factors and methylation markers, 1 year
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the methylation marker panel for the detection of bladder cancer in patients with gross or microscopic hematuria.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the predictive accuracy of a risk model including clinical factors such as age, gender, smoking history, and presence of gross versus microscopic hematuria compared to a model incorporating the same risk factors along with the methylation marker panel.
