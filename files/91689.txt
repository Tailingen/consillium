Study of Voreloxin (Vosaroxin) in Older Patients With Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study will evaluate the overall remission rate of treatment with vosaroxin (formerly voreloxin) Injection in patients at least 60 years of age with previously untreated AML
Leukemia|Acute Disease|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Nonlymphocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: vosaroxin
Remission Rate Defined as the Percentage of Patients Whose Respnse is CR or CRp Based on International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria and Treatment Outcomes Definitions, Combined remission rate (complete remission \[CR\] + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery \[CRp\]) of vosaroxin of patients â‰¥ 60 years old with previously untreated (de novo or secondary) AML are presented by treatment group for all treated analysis set.

Per IWG criteria, a CR requires bone marrow blasts \< 5%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1000 cells/uL, and platelet (plt) count \> 100,000 plt/uL. The criteria for CRp are the same as those for CR, except for platelet count \<= 100,000 lt/uL. Investigators were to determine a response category for each patient by examination of bone marrow and blood counts at the time of hematologic recovery after induction or reinduction. Investigator assessment categories included CR, CRp, CRi (Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery), PR (partial remission), treatment failure, and relapse., 2 years

Other objectives of this study include:

1. Assess the safety of treatment with vosaroxin, including the 30 and 60 day all-cause mortality
2. Assess leukemia free survival (LFS), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of remission (DR).
3. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of vosaroxin in this patient population.
4. Evaluate potential stratification biomarkers by evaluating DNA-damage and apoptotic pathways in bone marrow samples before and after treatment with vosaroxin
