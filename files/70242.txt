Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Consolidation Immunotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled phase II clinical study for evaluating anlotinib combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy in locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC.

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled phase II clinical study for evaluating anlotinib combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation immunotherapy in locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC. In this study, the enrolled patients were divided into the experimental group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1. The patients in the experimental group received anlotinib combined with curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy first, while the patients in the control group received curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Those who are evaluated as CR, PR or SD after the aforementioned treatment will enter consolidation immunotherapy. Patients will receive tislelizumab 200mg iv. drip, Q3W, for up to 12 months.
