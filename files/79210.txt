Quality of Life in Patients With Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer may help determine the long-term effects of bladder cancer and may help improve the quality of life for patients in the future.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|PROCEDURE: questionnaire administration
Quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24, and QLQ-BLM30 questionnaires
OBJECTIVES:

* To study the effects of recurrence and progression on health-related quality of life (HRQL).
* To study the effects of repeat cystoscopy on HRQL.
* To study the patients' assessments of a hypothetical prognostic model and how this affects their preference for the mode of surveillance.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Quality-of-life questionnaires developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) will be used. The EORTC QLQ-BLS24 with 24 questions specific to non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 with 30 questions specific to muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be combined and used in conjunction with the general cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30.

Assessments using the QLQ-C30 will be made at baseline in the entire cohort of patients. Follow-up assessments using the QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24, and QLQ-BLM30 167 will be made at first routine follow-up and annually until the end of study.
