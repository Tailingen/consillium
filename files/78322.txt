Neoadjuvant Afatinib Therapy for Potentially Resectable Stage III EGFR Mutation-Positive Lung Adenocarcinoma
In general, for patients with stage I or II disease, surgery provides the best chance for cure.EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs)are standard first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC.Afatinib was a 2nd-generation EGFR TKI that covalently bound and irreversibly blocked signaling through activated EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and ErbB4 receptors, and the FDA has approved afatinib for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations.The treatment of stage III NSCLC remains a matter of debate. Current multimodality treatment options for stage III included definitive chemoradiation, surgery followed by adjuvant therapy,or neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection.Previous studies have revealed that adjuvant EGFR-TKI could significantly prolong disease free surivival, and have less toxicity than adjuvant chemotherapy for early resectable EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.EMERGING-CTONG1103 regarding neoadjuvant erlotinib vs chemotherapy (Gemcitabine plus cisplatin) for stage III NSCLC reveal that erlotinib has improved ORR (54%), major pathological response, operation rate, R0 resection and lymph node downstaging, and progression-free survival (PFS).A phase II trial (ASCENT) of neoadjuvant afatinib for stage III EGFR-mutation NSCLC concludes that afatinib yields the highest ORR (75%) up to now and verifies the feasibility of neoadjuvant EGFR TKIs for stage III NSCLC. However, no more studies are available so far to confirm the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant afatinib in the treatment of resectable stage III EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, and there is a lack of studies based on the Chinese population. Given that the neoadjuvant therapy has delayed the operation time and there is a potential risk of cancer progression, more data are needed to perform evaluation.
Lung Adenocarcinoma Stage III|EGFR Gene Mutation
DRUG: Afatinib
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have completed the 8- to 16-week treatment with afatinib before operation and have achieved CR or PR as confirmed by CT evaluation after 3 weeks in all patients., 11 weeks
Event-free survival (EFS), It is was defined as the time from the first administration of afatinib in this study to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cause (including any cause of death in the event of no progression), up to 60 months|Disease free survival (DFS), It refers to the time from radical surgery to relapse or death of a participant due to disease progression., up to 100 months|Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the time from random enrollment to death of participant due to any cause., up to 60 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), It is defined as the time from the first administration of afatinib in this study to the disease progression or death., up to 60 months|R0 resection, It is defined as the proportion of patients with negative surgical margin and no residual found under microscope after resection in all patients who have completed the treatment., 9 weeks|Pathological downstaging rate, It is defined as the proportion of patients who have completed the 8-week treatment with afatinib before operation and have achieved a T stage downing of the tumor as confirmed by CT evaluation after 3 weeks in all patients who have completed the treatment., 11 weeks|Treatment-related adverse events, It refers to the number of adverse events related to afatinib monotherapy or platinum-based chemotherapy as evaluated according to CTCAE v4.0., 12 weeks|Health related quality of life (HRQol), The assessment is made according to the Quality of Life Scale for Lung Cancer Patients (EORTC-QLQ-C30 \& LC13, Version 3). EORTC's QLQ-C30 \& LC13 (V3.0) is a core scale for lung cancer patients, with a total of 43 items. Among them, Item 29 and 30 are divided into seven grades, which are assigned with 1 to 7 scores according to the answer options. The other items are divided into 4 grades: Not at All, A Little, Quite a Bit, and Very Much, assigned with 1 to 4 scores respectively. The higher score, the worse quality., 12 weeks
