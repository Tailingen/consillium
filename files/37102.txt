Fruquintinib Plus Capecitabine Versus Bevacizumab Plus Capecitabine as Maintenance Therapy Following First-line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus capecitabine as maintenance therapy following first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients who have already achieved disease control (including CR/PR and SD), without discontinuation for toxicity, and are progression free after 4-6 months of standard first-line induction treatment will be assigned to 2 maintenance treatment groups by randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive fruquintinib + capecitabine (Arm A) or bevacizumab + capecitabine (Arm B). The study contains a safety lead-in phase in which the safety and tolerability of fruquintinib + capecitabine will be assessed prior to the phase 2 portion of the study. All patients from Arm A and Arm B will be treated until progressive disease, death from any cause, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal (whichever occurs earlier).
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib Plus Capecitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab Plus Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is determined from the date of treatment to PD or death from any cause, From Baseline to primary completion date, about 2 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival is determined from the date of treatment to death from any cause or the last follow-up date, From Baseline to primary completion date, about 2 years|Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0., From Baseline to primary completion date, about 2 years|QoL, Quality of life is assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30. It will be evaluated at Screening, Tumor Assessment Visit and End of Treatment visit., From Baseline to primary completion date, about 24 months
Exploratory Endpoint, Explore any correlation between clinical outcomes and baseline characteristics, and biomarkers associated with the antitumor activity of fruquintinib based on blood samples, From Baseline to primary completion date, about 24 months
