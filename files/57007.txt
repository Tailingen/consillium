Analysis of Initial Adherence and Its Impact on Long-term Adherence to Hormonal Therapy for Breast Cancer
A trial will be conducted on 200 breast cancer patients with adjuvant hormonal therapy. The study included 6 months baseline measurement, and 12 months intervention. Patients will be assigned to high adherence or low adherence group. Then, through randomization, low adherence patients will be assigned to the intervention or control group. Study Coordinator delivers the intervention using the WALKON mobile application. Control participants receive usual care with continuous monitoring using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) device.

BEHAVIORAL: low adherence intervention group
physical activity (daily steps), Comparison of daily steps using WALKON application, 12 months
Medication adherence using MEMS device, Comparison of adjuvant hormonal therapy adherence using MEMS device, 18 months
* Baseline measurement (n=200): screening and enrollment
* 3-month visit: collecting MEMS data
* 6-month visit: collecting MEMS data and assigned to the high adherence (n=70) or low adherence group (n=75). The low adherence intervention group (n=75) will be educated about the WALKON mobile application.
* 12-month visit: Control group: collecting MEMS data intervention group: monthly calls + collecting MEMS data
* 18-month visit: collecting MEMS data and interview
