Artificial Intelligence Prediction Tool in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
This is a multi-center study and the aim is to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -based histologic analysis tool to predict responsiveness to intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) and intravesical chemotherapy in intermediate and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients.

Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 3 months after TURBT in participants with HR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of first procedure confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause during surveillance cystoscopy at 3 months., 3 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 6 months after TURBT in patients with HR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of first procedure confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause during surveillance cystoscopy at 6 months., 6 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 12 months after TURBT in patients with HR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of first procedure confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause during surveillance cystoscopy at 12 months., 12 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 24 months after TURBT in patients with HR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of first procedure confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause during surveillance cystoscopy at 24 months., 24 months
Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 3 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with IR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause at 3 months., 3 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 6 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with IR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause at 6 months., 6 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 12 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with IR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause at 12 months., 12 months|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 24 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with IR NMIBC, Recurrence free survival (RFS) is measured as the time from start of clinical treatment / study enrollment to the date of negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT confirming histopathological recurrence, disease progression or death as a first event from any cause at 24 months., 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with HR or IR NMIBC, Progression-Free Survival is measured as the time from the patient registration to the date of first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with HR or IR NMIBC or death from any cause in the absence of progression, whichever occurs first. An increase in tumor stage and/or the presence of muscle invasive disease diagnosed during surveillance cystoscopy will constitute disease progression., 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) at 24 months following the first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with HR NMIBC or IR NMIBC, Progression-Free Survival is measured as the time from the patient registration to the date of first negative surveillance cystoscopy after TURBT in patients with HR or IR NMIBC or death from any cause in the absence of progression, whichever occurs first. An increase in tumor stage and/or the presence of muscle invasive disease diagnosed during surveillance cystoscopy will constitute disease progression., 24 months
Analysis will be performed on the most recent Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) histologic specimen obtained prior to BCG induction and on histologic specimens at time of recurrence after BCG induction. This stratification is of potential utility to clinicians for patient counseling purposes, for the identification of patients likely to benefit from induction or re-induction with BCG, and for consideration of alternative treatment strategies including clinical trials, chemotherapy, or cystectomy. Additionally, there is currently no reliable tool for identifying which NMIBC patients are most likely to benefit from adjuvant BCG versus intravesical chemotherapy. This is of current relevance in the management of Intermediate-risk (IR) NMIBC since both BCG and chemotherapy are first-line treatment options and will likely become of increasing relevance in High-risk (HR) NMIBC as efficacious first-line alternatives to intravesical BCG are introduced into clinical practice. In the proposed prospective study, the study team also aims to develop and then validate an AI-based histologic analysis tool for clinicians that is intended to predict recurrence following intravesical chemotherapy in IR and HR NMIBC patients.
