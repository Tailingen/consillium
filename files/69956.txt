Neoantigen Reactive T Cells c for Chinese Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see the safety and efficient of neoantigen reactive T cells (NRTs) in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.
Advanced Gastric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Neoantigen Reactive T Cells(NRTs)
Number of participants with Adverse Events, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) in patients, up to 6 months
Response Rate, Response Rate（RR）will be evaluated according Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Visits were conducted at the end (or termination) of each course and at 30, 90, and 120 days after the end of the last course for 4 months|Progression free survival (PFS), the duration of progression free survival is measured from the time of treatment to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or for any reason of death is objectively documented., Visits were conducted at the end (or termination) of each course and at 30, 90, and 120 days after the end of the last course for 4 months
Overall Survival (OS), the duration is measured from the time of treatment to the time of death, Visits were conducted at the end (or termination) of each course and at 30, 90, and 120 days after the end of the last course for 4 months|Interferon-gama change of PBMC cells in the peripheral blood stimulated by tumor antigens, T cells in the peripheral blood stimulated by tumor antigens for 24 hr，and then Interferon-gama secretion is measured, Visits were conducted at the end (or termination) of each course and at 30, 90, and 120 days after the end of the last course for 4 months
The tumor-specific "none-self" immunogenic neoantigens encoded by either viral genes or somatic mutation genes, possess the potential to induce specific anti-cancer immunity, including cellular and humoral immune responses. Today, numerous clinical trials demonstrate that although these "none-self" antigens initiate the antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies and cluster of differentiation 4（CD4）+/cluster of differentiation 8（CD8）+T-cells response, not all of them show a clinical benefit in the response rate, progression-free survival or overall survival.Personalized cell therapy maybe own a breakthrough in the treatment of those gastric cancer patients without standard options.The investigators' center has successfully established a new method for preparing personalized neoantigen reactive T cells(NRTS) for adoptive cell therapy(ACT). Today, the investigators will carry out a single arm clinical prospective study of NRTs for the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer. Participants are assigned to receive 4 circles of cell therapy, and IL-2 continuous intravenous infusion（CIV） will also be given for 5 consecutive days after each time's cell infusion. The safety and clinical response rate（RR） are evaluated. Biomarkers and immunological markers are also monitored.
