Faecal Incontinence in Prostate Cancer Survivors Treated Whith Radiotherapy
The objective of the study is to determine the incidence of faecal incontinence in prostate cancer survivors treated with moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy and correlate the dose received by the anal sphincter with the degree of faecal incontinence.

The investigators know that high doses of irradiation in the anal sphincter are associated with more chronic fecal leaks in survivors irradiated by normofractionated radiotherapy prostate cancer.

The safe dose of irradiation of the anal sphincter with radiotherapy modern techniques (volumetric modulated arc therapy with moderately hypofracctionation) is unknown.

Urgency and faecal incontinence greatly affects the quality of life of these patients.

Therefore, it is interesting to implement strategies to protect the anatomical structures involved in fecal continence.

The objective of the study is to determine the incidence of faecal incontinence in prostate cancer survivors treated with modern moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy and correlate the dose received by the anal sphincter with the degree of faecal incontinence.

The investigators also want to evaluate the quality of life of these patients
