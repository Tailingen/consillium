Remote Ischemia Precondition (RIPC) for Hepatic Protection in Patients Undergoing Hepatectomy
Remote ischemia precondition could protect the liver from ischemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing hepatectomy.
Liver Neoplasms

Remote ischemia precondition (RIPC) had been proofed beneficial to ischemia reperfusion injury of heart, kidney, liver, brain and spinal cord in experimentation on animals. And the clinical studies of RIPC were mainly focused on heart, RIPC's protection effect on hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing hepatectomy still remains unknown, So we designed this study to demonstrate the hypotheses.
