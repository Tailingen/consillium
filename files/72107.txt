Safety Study of HBI-8000 in Japanese Patients With Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HBI-8000 administered orally.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: HBI-8000
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HBI-8000 in adult Japanese patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) for whom no other standard therapy is suitable based on the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) which occur within 28 days., 28 days

Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HBI-8000 administered orally. Patients must be hospitalized as per guidance of the treating investigator throughout Cycle 1. Patients will receive HBI 8000 twice weekly (BIW) (after breakfast), in 28 day treatment cycles.

Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients. The first cohort of 3 patients will receive 30 mg BIW. Decisions regarding cohort escalation will be based upon the clinical experience in Cycle 1 (first 28 days) only. For a given cohort, if 1 patient enrolled in the cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days of the first dose, the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.
