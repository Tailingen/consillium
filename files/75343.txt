Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Preliminary Efficacy of ITI-1001 In Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM)
This Phase I clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of 8 mg ITI-1001 in participants with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).
Glioblastoma
DRUG: ITI-1001
Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)., Number of participants that experience any Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)., Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.|Number of occurrences of Adverse events/Serious Adverse Events that will be assessed for severity according to the NCI CTCAE, version 5.0., Number of occurrences of Adverse events/Serious Adverse Events that will be assessed for severity according to the NCI CTCAE, version 5.0., Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.
Exploratory endpoints include changes in peripheral blood assessment of T cell activation, Parameters include ELISpot, flow cytometry, CMV serology and anti-LAMP1 antibody for evaluation of immune response from the baseline, Through end of treatment, up to 9 months post-baseline|Exploratory endpoints include changes in immune response, Immune assessments for analytical evaluation of MRI data for possible tumor relapse or activated immune cells (inflammation associated with "pseudo-progression"), Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.|Exploratory endpoints include evaluation preliminary efficacy; overall survival, Number of participants that alive at pre-defined timepoints; 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months post-baseline visit, Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.|Exploratory endpoints include evaluation preliminary efficacy; Progression-Free Survival per iRANO, Number of participants that are confirmed PFM at pre-defined timepoints; 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months post-baseline visit, Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.|Exploratory endpoints include changes in immune response, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation from original biopsy/surgical sample and a second biopsy/surgical procedure if recurrence is suspected.

IHC detects cytomegalovirus (CMV) proteins pp65, IE1, and Glycoprotein B (gB) in human glioblastoma multiforme tissues as well as the CMV markers (CD8, CD163, and FOXP3), to observe how various HCMV proteins could contribute to GBM pathogenesis., Screening and End of treatment, up to 2 years post baseline.|Exploratory endpoints include evaluation preliminary efficacy; Neurological Assessment in Neuro-oncology (NANO) analysis, Changes in Neurological Assessment in Neuro-oncology (NANO) scale from baseline.

The NANO scale evaluates 9 major domains of neurologic function that are most relevant to patients with supratentorial, infratentorial, and brainstem tumors, including gait, strength, upper extremity ataxia, sensation, visual fields, facial strength, language, level of consciousness, and behavior.

Levels of function for each domain range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain., Through study completion, up to 2 years post baseline.
This Phase I study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 8 mg ITI-1001 DNA vaccine based on safety, immune activation and preliminary assessment of therapeutic benefit of 2 priming vaccinations given in the 4-6 weeks period between definitive surgical resection and initiation of SOC chemoradiation followed by 2 post-chemoradiation priming vaccinations (#3 and #4) and 5 ITI-1001 vaccine boosters given in parallel with maintenance TMZ as per Schedule of Assessments.

The study duration will be approximately 24 months for individual patients, excluding screening and surgery.

ITI-1001 vaccinations will be given in combination with Td toxoid.

8mg of ITI-1001 DNA vaccine will be administered via IM injection with electroporation up to 9 times using the TDS-IM v2.0 Device according to the device manufacturer's instructions and according to the Schedule of Assessments.
