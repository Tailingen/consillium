A Clinical Trial of TQB3015 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Cancer
This study is divided into two stages: dose escalation and dose extension, including a single dose and a multiple dose clinical study. This is a single-center, open, non randomized, single arm study to the safety and tolerability of TQB3015 tables in patients with advanced malignant cancer.
