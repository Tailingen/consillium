Lean Body Mass and Side Effects in Patients With Lymphoma
The primary purpose is to investigate the relationship between the dose of chemotherapeutic agents per kilogram of lean body mass (LBM) and the development of side effects induced by chemotherapy in patients with lymphoma. Secondarily, the maximum tolerable dose of chemotherapeutics (MTD), patients' quality of life (QOL), nutritional status and physical activity during the course of treatment are estimated.
Malignant Lymphoma
Lean Body Mass (LBM), LBM measured by bioelectrical impedans corelated to the dosis of chemotherapeutics given, 8 weeks (two treatment cycles)
Maximal tolerable dose of chemotherapeutics (microg/ml/kg LBM),, Patients with side effects - correlation between dose of cytostatics/ kg LBM compared to patients without side effects, 8 weeks (two treatment cycles)|Quality of life (QOL) (score EORTC), Correlation of score and difference in LBM (kg), 8 weeks (two treatment cycles)|nutritional status at inclusion (NRS2002 - scale), Predictive value of scale for ocurrence of side-effects (binary), 8 weeks (two treatment cycles)|physical activity (scale - questionaire), Corelation between cytostatic dose/kg LBM and scale, 8 weeks (two treatmenr cycles)
