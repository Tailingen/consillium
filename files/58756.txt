Clinical Efficacy and Mechanism of Yisui Granule in Treatment of Low and Medium Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Through Demethylation
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the mechanism of Yisui Granule(YSG) in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) through demethylation.

Under the same condition of basic western medicine treatment, the treatment group used the same traditional Chinese medicine decoction pieces as YSG, and the control group was given placebo. Through a randomized controlled clinical study, we focused on observing the effects of MDS patients on clinical symptoms (including single symptom), fatigue relief, quality of life, peripheral blood picture, blood transfusion interval and blood transfusion volume, and measured the expression of DNMTs, the expression and methylation level of Wnt3a、β-catenin、SFRP and other indicators, as well as cytokines, were used to explore the mechanism of YSG in the treatment of MDS through demethylation.
