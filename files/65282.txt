Study of CHOP + Campath for T-Cell, Null Cell, or Natural Killer (NK)-Cell Lymphoma
Primary Objective:

* To determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of alemtuzumab (Campath) when administered in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy (C-CHOP) in patients with T-cell, null-cell and NK-cell lymphomas.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate response rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival in patients with T-cell, null-cell, and NK-cell lymphomas treated with Campath + CHOP chemotherapy.
* To assess the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients with these lymphomas treated with the Campath + CHOP combination.
* To determine features which might be predictive of resistance to treatment or predictive of relapse, including the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins.
