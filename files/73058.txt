Learning Curve of Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Among Internship
The investigators conduct this prospective study to investigate the learning curve of digital rectal examination (DRE) for prostate cancer among internship. The investigators want to know how many DRE are usually needed for internship to be performed in urological practice to obtain a stable DRE accuracy.

BEHAVIORAL: Routine review of DRE results by attending doctors
Sensitivity and specificity of DRE performed by internship will be confirmed by prostate biopsy, To examine the sensitivity and specificity of the DRE performed by internship to reference standard of prostate biopsy in a prospective longitudinal cohort of around 700 participants who will undergo prostate biopsy due to suspect of prostate cancer. The investigators will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of DRE by different internship monthly., One year
Sensitivity and specificity of DRE performed by internship with different training plan will be confirmed by prostate biopsy, To examine the sensitivity and specificity of the DRE performed by internship (group 1 with routinely review of pathologic outcome of prostate biopsy twice a month, and group 2 internship who are not told the results of prostate biopsy) to standard reference of prostate biopsy., One year|Sensitivity and specificity of DRE performed by internship will be compared to the results of fPSA/tPSA and MRI., To compare the sensitivity and specificity of DRE to fPSA/tPSA and MRI (not any patients are required to have MRI examination of prostate, this will be determined at the discretion of attending doctor) to reference standard of prostate biopsy., One year
Digital rectal examination (DRE) is a basic physical examination in routine practice in Urology. The DRE is a very important daily practice for screen prostate cancer, and each internship in Urology is required to perform this for patients suspected of prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia. However, how many DRE are usually needed for a internship to perform so as to obtain a stable accuracy in daily practice is currently unknown. The investigators thus conduct this prospective trial to investigate the learning curve of DRE among internship.
