Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.
Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Lymphoma Immunoglobulin-derived scFv-chemokine DNA Vaccine|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Maximum tolerated dose defined as the highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with less than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0, Toxicity type and severity will be summarized by frequency tables., 4 weeks
Immune response defined as at least a three-fold rise in the precursor frequency of tumor-reactive T cells, The rate of immune response will be estimated., At 12 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of using a novel lymphoma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine encoding macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP3a)-fused lymphoma idiotype in single chain format.

II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the vaccine.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine to generate tumor-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive autologous lymphoma immunoglobulin-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFV)-chemokine DNA vaccine intradermally (ID) at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
