KN035 in Combination With Trastuzumab and Docetaxel in HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, single arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of KN035 in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Eligible patient will be enrolled and receive protocol defined therapies until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent. Tumor assessment will be performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Objective response, To estimate the overall response rate (CR + PR) of KN035 in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.

â€¢ Overall Response rate will include confirmed complete response (CR) + confirmed partial response (PR), as determined as per RECIST v1.1 criteria and assessed by the local investigator, 12 months
Adverse events, To characterize the toxicity of KN035 in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 12 months
Disease control rate, To estimate the disease control rate (CR + PR + SD) of KN046 in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Disease control rate will include complete response (CR\], partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD), as per RECIST v1.1 criteria, 12 months
