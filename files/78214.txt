Online Adaptive Radiotherapy Cervical Cancer With Reduced Margin for Cervical Cancer
Online adaptive radiotherapy (oART) has demonstrated to be feasible to reduce planning target volume (PTV) margins for cervical cancer. To explore the value of reduced margins in oART for cervical cancer, we conducted a prospective clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy and toxicity of reduced margins.

Patient-reported acute toxicity, Patient-reported acute toxicity evaluated with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) 3.0 questionnaire, From the start of treatment to 3 months after treatment|Physician-reported acute toxicity, Physician-reported acute toxicity evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0, From the start of treatment to 3 months after treatment
Late toxicity evaluated with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring scheme, Evaluated with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring scheme, 2-year|The irradiated doses of organs at risk, The organs at risk includes bladder, rectum, bone marrow, femur head left, femur head right and bowel that may be irradiated near the target volume, Through study completion, an average of eight month|The dose coverage of target volume as assessed by planing tumor volume V100%, Planing tumor volume V100%, defined as the planing tumor volume receiving at least 100% of the prescribed dose (V100%), is used to evaluate the dose coverage of target volume., Through study completion, an average of eight month|Target volume contouring accuracy, For every target in each fraction, the evaluation of accuracy for target contouring are categorized as follow: no edits, minor edits, moderate edits, major edits and not applicable., Through study completion, an average of eight month|Response evaluation evaluated with RECIST 1.1, Evaluated with RECIST 1.1, One month after treatment|Movement of the uterus during per radiotherapy fractions, The pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans will be obtained during per treatment. The uterus intra-fractional motion were evaluated by comparison of uterus centroid from pre-treatment CBCT and uterus centroid from post-treatment images., Through study completion, an average of eight month|Movement of the cervix during per radiotherapy fractions, The pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans will be obtained during per treatment. The cervix intra-fractional motion were evaluated by comparison of cervix centroid from pre-treatment CBCT and cervix centroid from post-treatment images., Through study completion, an average of eight month|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first., 2-year|Personalized margin for cervical cancer, Pre- and post-treatment images are uploaded to the online adaptive radiotherapy simulator to re-delineate the target volume and determine the personalized margin range., Six month after treatment
This is an investigator-initiated efficacious, single-center, open-label clinical trial study. This study hypothesizes that the use of reduced PTV margins in oART for cervical cancer could decrease toxicity and achieve more accurate dosimetric coverage. A dose of 50.4 Gy is delivered to clinical target volume (CTV) with reduced margin oART. Patients receive cisplatin based concurrent chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is acute toxicity.
