PEDIATRIC SONICS: Pediatric Study of Neuropsychology and Imaging in CNS Demyelinating Syndromes.
Central Nervous System (CNS) demyelinating conditions include multiple sclerosis (MS), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), Optic Neuritis (ON) and Transverse Myelitis (TM). The symptoms of these conditions are quite variable from patient to patient, but can include motor, sensory, visual, gait and cognitive changes. Conventional MRI can be used to look for new anatomic changes, but fails to measure underlying biochemical changes in brain tissue. The purposes of this study are to identify the biologic and anatomic correlations between cognitive profiles and disease activity using MRI imaging techniques.

Pediatric patients (age 12 to 21 inclusive) with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, ADEM, anti-MOG mediated demyelinating disease as well as healthy controls will be recruited to undergo clinical testing. The study visits will include neuropsychological testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and MRI on both the 3T and 7T magnet. Subjects will be asked to undergo two study visits separated by 12 months to 18 months. Each study visit will have the same neuropsychological, OCT, and research MRI examinations.
