Interest of PET/CT at 18F-FDG in the Post-therapeutic Management of Cervical Cancer
A lot of studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT in the management of uterine cervical cancer. Post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT is usually requested by a lot of clinicians.

Whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for prognosis in the follow-up, data are yet insufficient to clearly establish a formal recommendation.

This prospective multicenter observational study will evaluate the interest of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT in clinical management (within 2 months of treatment) in patients with cervical cancer at an advanced stage.

Main outcome :

The therapeutic impact of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT (within 2 months after the end of therapy) will be evaluated on the complete results included MRI.

Investigators will compare :

* decision of clinicians without 18F-FDG PET/CT results
* and decision of clinicians knowing entire results included results of 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Gold Standard for the diagnosis of progression will be based on the conclusions of multi-disciplinary staff ruling on the results of composite data, including clinical examination, biology, histopathology, morphological imaging (MRI), functional imaging (PET/CT) and 6-month follow-up., Validated by six months follow up|collection of the two d√©cisions of RCP, To make statistical analysis possible, the collection of the two decisions will be chosen from three cases of care envisaged below:

1. Complete therapeutic response
2. Equivocal response: doubt about the presence of residual disease.
3. Strong suspicion of residual disease and/or progression Then, we will collect a percentage of patients with rightly changes on management induced by the result of the PET-CT at 18F-FDG., Validated by six months follow up

With approximately 3000 new cases estimated in France on 2017, the uterine cervical cancer is the twelfth cancer cause in women, responsible for 1000 deaths per year.

Management of uterine cervical cancer is well defined before treatment, especially for imaging including systematically pelvic MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT.

A lot of studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT, due to semi quantitative parameters study, like the SUV max and delta SUV between pre and post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT or qualitatively with the persistence of positive 18F-FDG PET/CT at the end of therapy.

Whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for prognosis in the follow-up, data are yet insufficient to clearly establish a formal recommendation.

Nevertheless, post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT is still usually requested by a lot of clinicians.

Furthermore, the group of Parisian public hospital (AP-HP) has established a guide for the management of cervical cancer (2016) and recommends to systematically realize a 18F-FDG PET/CT after treatment for advanced cervical cancer.

Main purpose :

Evaluate the role of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT in clinical management (within 2 months of treatment) in patients with uterine cervical cancer at an advanced stage.

Main outcome :

The therapeutic impact of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT (within 2 months after the end of therapy) will be evaluated on the complete results included MRI.

Investigators will compare

* decision of clinicians without 18F-FDG PET/CT results
* and decision of clinicians knowing entire results included results of 18F-FDG PET/CT.
