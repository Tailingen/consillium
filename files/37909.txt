Preoperative Window Opportunity Study With Giredestrant or Tamoxifen in Premenopausal Women With ER+/HER2[-] & Ki67≥10%
This study is a window of opportunity clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of giredestrant (GDC-9545) or tamoxifen in estrogen receptor-positive (ER\[+\])/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2\[-\]) primary invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast with Ki67 level ≥ 10%.

A total of 92 patients will be enrolled in this trial and randomized 1:1 in the arm A with giredestrant (GDC-9545) and the arm B with tamoxifen, with a total duration of treatment of 15 days.

This study will analyze the efficacy of giredestrant (GDC-9545) as determined by Ki67 expression between baseline tumor biopsy samples and post-treatment biopsy samples.
Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer, Early-Onset
DRUG: Giredestrant|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Change in proliferative index (Ki67 expression), To assess changes in tumor cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 expression between baseline and D15 (+1 day) post-treatment tumor biopsy samples by central assessment in patients with centrally confirmed Ki67 ≥10% (Arm A: giredestrant vs Arm B: tamoxifen), Baseline up to 15 days
Complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA), To measure complete cell cycle arrest in all arms, defined as the percentage of participants with centrally assessed Ki67 scores ≤2.7% stained nuclei upon treatment, Baseline up to 15 days|Changes in molecular profiles of tumor tissue samples, To analyze gene expression profiles in tumor tissue samples obtained at baseline and after treatment using the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel, Baseline up to 15 days|Changes in expression levels of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in tumor tissue samples, To analyze the expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in tumor tissue samples obtained at baseline and post-therapy, Baseline up to 15 days
Changes in molecular profiles of plasma biomarkers related to endocrine function, To compare the expression of blood biomarkers in samples obtained at baseline and post-therapy using a plasma endocrine panel, Baseline up to 15 days|Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined in accordance to NCI-CTCAE v.5.0, Baseline up to 15 days
This is a multicenter, international, open-label, two-arms, one stage, phase II, preoperative window of opportunity clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of giredestrant (GDC-9545) as single agent in ER\[+\]/HER2\[-\] early breast cancer patients with Ki67 ≥ 10%.

Upon meeting all selection criteria, 92 patients enrolled in the study will receive either giredestrant (GDC-9545) 30 mg or tamoxifen .

A total of 92 patients will be enrolled as follows:

* 46 patients in the investigational Arm A will receive giredestrant \[GDC-9545\] 30 mg. It will be administered orally once a day during 15 days.
* 46 patients in the control Arm B will receive tamoxifen 20 mg. It will be administered orally once a day during 15 days.

Patients can take both treatments at home.

The main objective is to analyze the efficacy of giredestrant (GDC-9545) according to changes in tumor cell proliferation. This analysis will compare absolute changes for Ki67 expression between baseline score and the evaluation after 15 days of treatment.

Total study duration is 15 days of treatment and until 28 days after the last dose of the study treatment (or discontinuation) of follow up.
