Ribociclib (Ribociclib (LEE-011)) With Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Recurrent Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
Investigators hypothesize that concurrent ribociclib treatment and chemotherapy will enhance the response to platinum-based therapy and maintenance therapy will slow ovarian cancer tumor growth leading to prolongation in progression free survival.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: ribociclib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of ribociclib (LEE-011) when given with carboplatin + paclitaxel in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, Participants will be observed for the first two treatment cycles (2, 28 day cycles) and maximum tolerated dose will be determined., 56 days
Number of participants that respond to treatment, Overall response rate (ORR) will be analyzed. The number of patients that respond to treatment (exhibit Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)) will be recorded. PR is defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA 125 levels (response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days) and/or at least 30% decrease in the sum diameters of target lesions. CR is defined as normalization of CA125 levels ((response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days) and disappearance of all target lesions., 18 months post treatment|Time from treatment until disease progression or death, Progression is defined as one of the following:

* Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart or
* Patients with elevated CA-125 before treatment, which never normalizes, must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart or
* Patients with CA-125 in the reference range before treatment must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart
* Increase in at least 20% in sum of diameters of target lesions or any new lesions or unequivocal increase in non-target lesions.
* Response determined via measurable disease (measurement of target and non-target lesions) takes precedence over CA125 criteria Stable Disease (SD): CA, 18 months post treatment|Number of participants encountering toxicity at each dose level, Patients will potentially be treated with 3 different dose levels of ribociclib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy., 30 days post treatment|Overall Survival (OS), The (median) length of time from start of treatment patients are still alive., Up to 5 years
Investigators hypothesize that concurrent ribociclib treatment and chemotherapy will enhance the response to platinum-based therapy and maintenance therapy will slow ovarian cancer tumor growth leading to prolongation in progression free survival.
