Procure Tumor and Initiate Melanoma Tumor-Reactive Tumor Infiltration
Procure Tumor and Initiate Melanoma Tumor-Reactive Tumor Infiltration Lymphocytes (TIL)
Melanoma
Evaluate Feasibility of conducting TIL procurement in a single-site setting, Cell viability, viable number and TIL potency using standardized methods, 5 years|Evaluate Safety of conducting TIL procurement in a single-site setting, lab personnel training during procurement, isolation, testing tumor reactivity and cryopreservation, 5 separate TIL procedures
To determine whether TIL Procurement, isolation, testing tumor reactivity and cryopreservation can be performed at John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI) and Providence Saint John's Health Center (PSJHC) and infused into patients, 5 years
The purpose of this study is to allow the collection of tissue from subjects to be used in future research studies by scientists and to isolate tumor fighting cells for the future treatment of Melanoma.
