A Study of Ficlatuzumab in Combination With Cetuximab in Participants With Recurrent or Metastatic (R/M) HPV Negative Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab compared to placebo plus cetuximab in participants with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HPV-negative Head and Neck Cancer.

The primary hypothesis is that ficlatuzumab combined with cetuximab is superior to cetuximab alone in terms of progression-free survival and/or overall survival.

BIOLOGICAL: Ficlatuzumab|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|OTHER: Placebo
To compare the efficacy by overall survival of ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death for any cause, From Randomization until death from any cause (Approximately 44 months)
To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) for ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From Randomization until disease progression or death (Approximately 44 months)|To evaluate additional objective response rate for ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 until last response assessment (response assessments are every 8 weeks for the first year, every 12 weeks for years 2 and 3 and then every 6 months)|To evaluate disease control rate (DCR) for ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Disease control rate (DCR), defined for participants who have achieved a CR, PR or stable disease for at least 8 weeks per RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 until last response assessment (response assessments are every 8 weeks for the first year, every 12 weeks for years 2 and 3 and then every 6 months)|To evaluate duration of response (DOR) for ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from first documented evidence of a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 until last response assessment (response assessments are every 8 weeks for the first year, every 12 weeks for years 2 and 3 and then every 6 months)|To compare the safety and tolerability of ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Number of times participants experience Adverse Events (AE) or abnormal laboratory values., From Screening until 30 days after last dose|To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ficlatuzumab, Serum samples will be assessed for concentrations of ficlatuzumab, From Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) until End of Treatment (Approximately 44 months)|To assess the immunogenicity of ficlatuzumab via antidrug antibodies (ADAs), Serum samples will be assessed for the presence of ADA to ficlatuzumab., From Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) until End of Treatment (Approximately 44 months)|To assess the immunogenicity of ficlatuzumab via neutralizing antibodies (nAB), Serum samples that test positive for the presence of ADA to ficlatuzumab will be further tested for the presence of nAB., From Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) until End of Treatment (Approximately 44 months)|To evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of ficlatuzumab plus cetuximab vs placebo plus cetuximab in participants with R/M HNSCC, Change from baseline in overall health status and time to clinically meaningful deterioration based on scoring of standardized participant questionnaires, From Baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) until End of Treatment (Approximately 44 months)
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of ficlatuzumab combined with cetuximab (Arm 1 or Arm 2) to a control arm of placebo plus cetuximab (Arm 3) in participants with R/M human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC. Eligible participants must have failed prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 \[programmed cell death protein 1\] or PD-L1 \[programmed death ligand 1\] immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and with platinum-based chemotherapy, administered in combination or sequentially. Failure of prior treatment may be due to progression of disease or intolerance to treatment. It is anticipated that the study will enroll approximately 410 participants across 3 arms.
