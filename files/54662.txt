Despite the advent of novel targeted and immunotherapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors, many patients remain without cure.

Allocetra-OTS is an immunomodulatory cell-based therapy consisting of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells that have been modified to be engulfed by macrophages and reprogram them into their homeostatic state.

This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, Phase 1/2a study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Allocetra-OTS in the treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancy as monotherapy (Stage 1), and in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy (Stage 2).

Allocetra-OTS will be administered systemically or locally (intravenous \[IV\] or intraperitoneal \[IP\]) according to the tumor location.
