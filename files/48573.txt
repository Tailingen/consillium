OSDI consist of three subscales (ocular symptoms: item 1-3; visual related function: item 4-9; environmental triggers: item 10-12). Each item will be graded on a scale of 0 (none of the time or lower disability) to 4 (all of the time or greater disability) with total scores ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (complete disability). The total OSDI score was calculated as (sum of scores for all questions answered\*100) divided by (total number of questions answered\*4). Higher scores indicated greater disability. Baseline (Day 1) was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with non-missing value, including unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value., Baseline (Day 1) and up to approximately 4.5 years|Change From Baseline in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) Overall Composite Scores, The NEI-VFQ-25 consisted of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question to assess the patient's perception of vision-related functioning and vision-related quality of life.
