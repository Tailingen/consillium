Pharmacokinetics of Doxorubicin in cTACE of Liver Cancer
Patients with primary and secondary liver cancer may participate in this study. The purpose is to perform an analysis of the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol on the body (doxorubicin pharmacokinetics ) after conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE). cTACE is a procedure in which chemotherapy drugs are injected, followed by an injection of small beads to block the tumor-feeding arteries. Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the cTACE procedure. This study will examine doxorubicin pharmacokinetics in patients who: 1) receive whole liver cTACE; and 2) receive super-selective CTACE (i.e., delivered in close proximity to the tumor).
Liver Cancer
DRUG: whole liver lobe cTACE doxorubicin|DRUG: superselective cTACE doxorubicin
Pharmacokinetics Profile-- Peak of Plasma Concentration (Dose-normalized), Peak of plasma concentration (Cmax) of both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol reported for 10 lobar subjects, 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to 1 segment, and 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to multiple segments after dose normalization., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 24 hours, and 3-4 weeks post dose|Pharmacokinetics Profile-- Peak of Plasma Concentration, Peak of plasma concentration (Cmax) of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol reported for 10 lobar subjects, 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to 1 segment, and 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to multiple segments., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 24 hours, and 3-4 weeks post dose|Pharmacokinetics Profile-- Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (Dose Normalized), Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) reported for doxorubicin and doxorubicinol reported for 10 lobar subjects, 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to 1 segment, and 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to multiple segments after dose normalization., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 24 hours, and 3-4 weeks post dose|Pharmacokinetics Profile-- Area Under the Concentration Time Curve, Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) reported for doxorubicin and doxorubicinol reported for 10 lobar subjects, 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to 1 segment, and 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to multiple segments., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 24 hours, and 3-4 weeks post dose|Pharmacokinetics Profile-- Time of Maximum Concentration, Median time of maximum concentration (Tmax) reported for doxorubicin and doxorubicinol reported for 10 lobar subjects, 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to 1 segment, and 10 superselective subjects with Lipiodol distribution to multiple segments., 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 24 hours, and 3-4 weeks post dose
Number of Participants With Technical Success of cTACE Procedure., Feasibility/technical success (yes/no) is measured by ability to administer a therapeutic dose, which is determined clinically., assessed at baseline (at the time of the cTACE procedure)|Assessment and Frequency of Toxicities (Laboratory and Clinical Adverse Events) According to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for AE (CTCAE) 5.0., Adverse events assessed by CTCAE 5.0 and stratified by Lipiodol distribution. 30 patients were reviewed for toxicities., up to 4 weeks post cTACE
Patients with primary and secondary liver cancer may participate in this study. The purpose is to perform an analysis of the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol on the body (doxorubicin pharmacokinetics ) after conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE). A pharmacokinetics profile (PK profile) will be constructed and will include peak of plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum concentration (TMax), and area under the concentration curve (AUC). This composite measure will be used to compare patients in cTACE lobar administration and cTACE superselective administration. In addition, the PK profile will be correlated with toxicity, tumor burden, body surface area, and gender. Feasibility and safety will also be assessed.
