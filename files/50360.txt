The Metformin Active Surveillance Trial (MAST) Study
This study aims to see if metformin can delay the time to progression in men with low risk prostate cancer when compared to a placebo.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: Placebo
Time to progression, Time to progression - progression is defined as the earliest of the following events:

1. Primary therapy for prostate cancer (e.g. prostatectomy, radiation, hormonal therapy)
2. Pathological progression as defined as one of the following:

i. \>1/3 of total amount of cores involved ii. At least 50% of any one core involved iii. Gleason pattern 4 or higher, 3 years
Time to primary therapy for prostate cancer, Length of time before the participants move on to more radical treatment options (prostatectomy, radiation and/or hormonal therapy), 3 years|Time to pathological progression, 3 years|Change from baseline in disease-related patient anxiety, Measured by the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), 3 years|Change from baseline in decisional satisfaction and decisional conflict, Measured by the Decisional Regret scale, 3 years|Change from baseline in prostate cancer diagnosis at repeat biopsy, 3 years|Change in Gleason Score at repeat biopsy, 3 years|Change in clinical stage of prostate cancer based on digital rectal examination, 3 years|Assess the prognostic and predictive value of prostate cancer biomarkers, Using biomarkers in tissue, blood and urine samples, 3 years|To determine the safety and incidence of (serious) adverse events from the administration of 36 months of metformin to men with early stage prostate cancer, 3 years
This study aims to see if metformin can delay the time to progression in men with low risk prostate cancer when compared to a placebo.
