Bispecific Antibody-Based Salvage Therapy Followed by CAR-T ± ASCT in R/R Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma
This study consists of two sequential treatment phases. In the first phase, patients with r/r aggressive B-NHL receive two cycles of glofitamab ± investigator-selected agents. In the second phase, patients eligible for CAR-T monotherapy undergo FC lymphodepletion followed by CAR-T infusion (2-4×10⁶/kg), while those eligible for CAR-T+ASCT receive conditioning chemotherapy with PBSC reinfusion on day 0 and CAR-T administration (2-4×10⁶/kg) on day +3 (±1). Patients demonstrating Deauville 4-5 or ctDNA positivity at day 28 post-CAR-T infusion subsequently receive four cycles of glofitamab consolidation therapy.

The study comprises two sequential treatment phases. In the first phase, eligible patients with r/r aggressive B-NHL receive 2 cycles of glofitamab ± X regimen (where X includes but is not limited to chemotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates, or small-molecule targeted agents, selected at the investigator's discretion). Peripheral blood lymphocyte apheresis is performed prior to initial glofitamab administration unless clinically contraindicated, with hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and collection timed per investigator assessment to achieve minimum required yields of ≥3×10⁸/kg mononuclear cells and ≥2×10⁶/kg CD34+ cells.

Patients successfully completing phase 1 proceed to phase 2 treatment. In the CAR-T alone cohort, patients receive FC lymphodepleting therapy (days -5 to -3) followed by CAR-T cell infusion (2-4×10⁶/kg) on day 0. The CAR-T+ASCT cohort undergoes conditioning chemotherapy (regimen determined by investigator) with autologous PBSC reinfusion on day 0 and CAR-T cells (2-4×10⁶/kg) administered on day +3 (±1 day).

At day 28 post-CAR-T infusion, patients demonstrating PET-CT Deauville scores of 4-5 or ctDNA positivity initiate 4 cycles of glofitamab consolidation therapy.
