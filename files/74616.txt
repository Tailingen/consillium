Radiogenomics in Glioblastoma: Correlation Between Multiparametric Imaging Biomarkers and Genetic Biomarkers
The purpose of this study is to evaluate relationships between multiparametric imaging biomarkers and genetic analysis in glioblastoma patients.
Glioblastoma
OTHER: Observational only
Functional and genomic profiling of glioblastoma, Prognostic stratification will be evaluated using following parameters:

Quantitative and qualitative parameters from CT, PET, MRI Genomic data of glioblastoma tumor samples and tumor in situ fluid samples, 3 years after diagnosis
Relationship between genomic and multiparametric imaging profiling, We will evaluate if certain relationship exists between changes in multiparametric imaging markers from CT, PET, MRI and genomic informations of glioblastoma., 3 years after diagnosis
To evaluate relationships between multiparametric imaging biomarkers(CT, PET/CT, MRI) and genetic analysis (tumor tissues and ctDNA in tumor in situ fluid) in glioblastoma patients
