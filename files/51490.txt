A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Anti-tumor Activity of SNK01 (NK Cells) Administered in Combination With Chemotherapy or Chemotherapy / Cetuximab in Local Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Who Failed Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment
This clinical trial is a Single-Center, Open, Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial conducted to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of SNK01 and GC +/- Cetuximab administered in combination to Locally advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients who have failed prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy at least once.

After the start of the clinical trial, the first 3 subjects complete the enrollment in Cohort 1 in serial order and then 3 subjects are enrolled in Cohort 2 in serial order. After this, Cohorts 1, 3 and Cohorts 2, 4 are independently processed and subjects are enrolled in serial order when new cohorts start and/or replacement subjects are required. For the subjects who are additionally enrolled after the DLT evaluation and the MTD is determined in each dose cohort, no DLT evaluation is conducted.

The subjects allotted to each cohort are administered with the SNK01 manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells total 8 times over a period of about 10 weeks. Combined administration of SNK01 starts from the Cycle 2 (Week 4) of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy and SNK01 is administered at an interval of 1 week starting from the day after the administration of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy and/or Cetuximab (Visit 5-1, D23).

When no disease progression is confirmed at EOT (End of Treatment), disease progression is checked until the clinical trial is over. The adverse events which have occurred during the study period are monitored until the date when the investigator judges that no monitoring is required as the symptom has disappeared or there is no further change in the symptom or the 30th day (±3 d) from the latest date of the administration among Gemcitabine, Carboplatin and Cetuximab after the EOT, whichever comes first.

For all the subjects enrolled in the present clinical trial, safety is checked in accordance with CTCAE V5.0 and effectiveness is checked in accordance with RECIST V1.1 through the vital signs, laboratory test, adverse events, etc. during the study period.
