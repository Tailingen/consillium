Exploring Biomarkers of the Carcinogenesis of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) of the Pancreas
This is a prospective, open large cohort study to explore biomarkers for detecting early carcinogenesis of IPMN.
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm
OTHER: Observation
The accuracy of IPMN malignant transformation, Up to 10 years
the probability of IPMN malignant transformation, Up to 10 years|rates of surgical resection, Up to 10 years|survival after surgery, Up to 10-15 years
This prospective study was designed to explore biomarkers for detecting early carcinogenesis of IPMN. This study intends to prospectively and continuously enroll IPMN patients, and regularly collect biological samples including blood, urine, feces and saliva. We aimed to detect biomarkers which can predict the carcinogenesis of IPMN by multi-omics. The primary endpoint is the predictive accuracy of biomarkers for IPMN malignant transformation. The probability of IPMN malignant transformation , rates of surgical resection and survival after surgery are secondary endpoints.
