The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and gemcitabine), as measured by objective response rate (ORR) assessed by a Blinded Independent Central Review Committee (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in first-line recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer participants (both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and non-EBV-associated).
