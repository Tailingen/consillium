Gadoxetate Enhanced Imaging Study to Detect Prostate Cancer
Background:

- Prostate cancer is the most common cancer type among men. Some prostate cancers respond to hormonal therapy. However, some cell characteristics of other prostate cancers cause it not to respond as well to these therapies. Researchers want to see if gadoxetate, a contrast agent used to help identify damaged liver tissue, can help tell these types of prostate cancer apart. It may be able to identify if a man has a type of prostate cancer for which hormone therapy may not work as well.

Objectives:

- To see if gadoxetate can help identify different types of prostate cancers during imaging studies.

Eligibility:

- Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer. Participants will be having surgery to either remove the prostate or take tumor tissue samples.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected.
* Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the lower torso. They will receive gadoxetate during the MRI scan.
* Participants who have surgery will have a sample of their tumor cells collected. Those who have a biopsy will provide cells from this biopsy for study.
* Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Eovist
Uptake and Retention of Eovist in Prostate Cancers, Uptake and retention of Eovist in prostate cancers is measured by the change of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter values between pre and post injection., Baseline and 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 60 minutes after Eovist injection
Number of Participants Who Were Evaluated for Magnetic Resonance (MR) Contrast Enhancement Parameters Following Eovist Injection With Respect to Gleason Score, Scans with or without endorectal coil were obtained through the prostate gland, bone metastasis or soft tissue metastasis (usually a lymph node) selected as the target lesion as described in primary outcome measure. Then 0.1 ml/kg Eovist was administered intravenously. Scans were correlated with baseline Gleason score obtained from the prostate biopsy. Gleason score \<7 = low grade cancer; Gleason score â‰¥7 = high grade cancer., At baseline|Baseline Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels of Patients Who Were Evaluated for Magnetic Resonance (MR) Contrast Enhancement Parameters Following Eovist Injection, Scans with or without endorectal coil were obtained through the prostate gland, bone metastasis or soft tissue metastasis (usually a lymph node) selected as the target lesion as described in primary outcome measure. Then 0.1 ml/kg Eovist was administered intravenously. Scans were correlated to baseline PSA levels., Baseline|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Here is the number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., From date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 3 years and 33 days
BACKGROUND:

* Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among men in the western world. Prognostic biomarkers would be useful in stratifying patients to different treatments.
* The expression of a testosterone membrane transporter, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3), is associated with shorter time to progression after hormonal ablation therapy and shorter overall survival in prostate cancer patients. 52% of localized prostate cancer lesions express OATP1B3, while 92% of prostate cancer metastases requiring hormonal ablation treatment, express OATP1B3 in soft tissue lesions. Expression of OATP1B3 also correlates with Gleason grade.
* Current imaging methods cannot predict treatment failure or resistance.
* Gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) (Eovist , Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pittsburgh, PA) is an MR imaging agent which is FDA-approved gadolinium chelate for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as normal hepatocytes express OATP1B3 while most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) do not. However, those HCCs that do take up Eovist have been shown to express OATP1B3.
* Eovist may be useful to evaluate OATP1B3 status in patients with prostate cancer and may therefore serve as a prognostic and treatment biomarker.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

-Evaluate the uptake and retention of Eovist in prostate cancers.

ELIGIBILTY:

* Male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years old
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2
* Subjects with clinically localized prostate cancer must have image guided biopsy confirmed prostate cancer and sufficient tissue available for OATP1B3 immunohistochemistry (IHC).
* Subjects with advanced disease who have failed hormone therapy and who have sufficient tissue from a soft tissue or metastatic bone lesion (measuring greater than or equal to1.5cm in diameter at computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan) available for OATP1B3 IHC.

or

-Subjects, for whom tissue is not available, must have a soft tissue or metastatic bone lesion that can be biopsied and be willing to undergo percutaneous biopsy to obtain tissue for OATP1B3 expression.

DESIGN:

* This pilot study will accrue 25 subjects divided into two arms: 10 evaluable subjects with localized prostate cancer and 15 evaluable subjects with advanced disease
* Each subject will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of Eovist by bolus injection
* All subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to and immediately after, 10, 20 and 60 minutes post-Eovist injection
