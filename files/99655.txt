Lymphoma in the Orbit
Imaging techniques have considerably improved over the last decades and ocular adnexal lymphomas (OALs) nowadays can be detected. As major advances in immunophenotyping and molecular diagnostics in histology have been achieved offering an accurate diagnosis, the investigators would like to introduce that surgical biopsy of an orbital lymphoma becomes crucial for the possibility of a correct diagnosis and proper treatment. As radiotherapy accomplished great preciseness as well and OALs respond excellently to radiation, this therapy should be the treatment of choice in local defined lymphomas instead of blind treatment with steroids. Radiation results in great local control rates of 85% to 100%
