Safety Study to Assess AFM11 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Adult B-precursor ALL
The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to determine the safety and tolerability of increasing doses and different infusion times of AFM11 infusion in patients with adult B-precursor ALL
Leukemia, B-Cell
DRUG: AFM11
Number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of increasing doses and different infusion times of AFM11, Measure of occurence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory testing (chemistry and hematology), physical examination, vital signs, cardiac monitoring, and neurological assessments, From first administration of continuous infusion over 2 weeks in step 1 (or 4 weeks in step 2) followed by 2 weeks of treatment break
Maximum Plasma Concentration of AFM11 (Cmax), The maximum observed concentration of AFM11 in plasma will be determined., Multiple time points during the 2 weeks of treatment in step 1 and 4 weeks of treatment in step 2|Area Under the Curve (AUC), The area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to the sampling time will be determined., Prior to initial dose on Day 1 and at multiple time points during the 2 weeks of treatment in step 1 and 4 weeks of treatment in step 2|Clinical efficacy of AFM11 in ALL, Measured by bone marrow assessment (complete response \[CR\], complete response with incomplete hematological recovery \[CRh\], and minimal residual disease \[MRD\]), Baseline and after treatment (week 3 in step 1 or week 4 in step 2)|Measurement of immunological markers, Immunological markers like lymphocytes and cytokine levels in serum will be measured at different time points during the 4 weeks of treatment and 30 days thereafter to assess the level of activity resulting from administration of AFM11., Prior to initial dose on Day 1 and at multiple time points during the 2 weeks of treatment in Step 1 and 4 weeks of treatment in Step 2
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive type of leukemia characterized by an overproduction of lymphoblasts or lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood; it is frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis. It can spread to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, the central nervous system (CNS), and other organs (sanctuary sites). Without treatment, ALL usually progresses quickly.

B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells express surface antigens that parallel their respective developmental lineages. Precursor B-cell ALL cells typically express CD10, CD19, and CD34 on their surface, along with nuclear terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. About 20% of adult ALL patients have a cytogenetic abnormality that is indistinguishable from the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1, t(9;22)), according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

The rationale for the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both malignant cells via its anti-CD19 domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This results in the formation of the "immunological synapse" and the subsequent T-cell activation on leading to killing of malignant cells. AFM11 has 2 binding sites for CD19 and 2 for CD3, its molecular weight is \~ 105kDa compared to diabodies like blinatumomab with one binding site for each target and a much lower molecular weight \~ 55kDa. In addition, preclinical experiments have shown that AFM11 has about a 100 fold higher affinity to CD3 compared to diabodies and is inducing higher cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of low effector:target cell ratios. These differences might allow for a shortening of the infusion times and potentially higher clinical efficacy compared to blinatumomab.
