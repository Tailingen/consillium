"Impact of a Nursing Intervention in the Management of Oncological Patients With Lung Cancer Under Treatment With Immunotherapy"
Introduction. Lung cancer is very common worldwide with 2.09 million cases in 2018. Immunotherapy has become a mainstay in cancer treatment. There is insuficient knowledge about the impact of altered needs, as well as the interventions developed by the nurse that are aimed at cancer patients in immunotherapy treatment.

Objectives. Describe the needs of non-microcytic lung cancer patients in immunotherapy. And, evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse intervention program aimed at these patients in decreasing comorbidities, increasing satisfaction, early detection of symptoms and management of toxicities, quality of life and monitoring of anthropometric indicators.

Methodology. Phase 1: descriptive, cross-cutting and prospective study. Phase 2: quasi-experimental pre-post study. The sample is patients of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, with non-microcytic lung cancer in treatment with Checkpoints inhibitor antibodies. The dependent variables: sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, satisfaction, quality of life, nutritional status, psychological impact, toxicities, number of unscheduled visits and health costs. Independent variable: nurse intervention program.

Implications for practice: Knowing the needs of patients in immunotherapy treatment will allow the development of a nurse care program to meet these needs and evaluate the program.

Number of altered needs of patients with lung cancer undergoing treatment with immunotherapy, Detect the altered needs of patients with lung cancer in immunotherapy treatment. In order to outline the best intervention program that suits their needs. Through assessment through scales and questionnaires., one day|Changes on anxiety in lung cancer patients with immunotherapy treatment measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Assess the patient's level of anxiety from diagnosis and prior to initiating treatment up to 6 months after initiating treatment. Using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 6 months|Changes on quality of life in lung cancer patients with immunotherapy treatment measured by EORTC quality of life scale, Assess the quality of life of lung cancer patients from before starting immunotherapy up to 6 months after starting it. Through the EORTC QLQ-LC 30., 6 months|Number of immunomediated toxicities requiring hospital admission, Record the number and type of toxicities that require hospital admission for its management., 6 months
