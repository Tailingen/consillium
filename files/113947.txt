18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography in Oncology and Neurology
This clinical trial is being conducted to study the use of a radioactive glucose tracer as an imaging test \[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)scan\] in adults who have or are suspected of having cancer and in another group of adults to assess for neurologic conditions.

RADIATION: [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose
To confirm the diagnostic effectiveness of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) as compared to the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis., The primary outcomes of sensitivity and accuracy of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies will be obtained by comparing results of the PET scan with the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis when those results are available. Comparison to correlative imaging follow-up, and assessment of efficacy based on feedback from referring physicians will be used in the absence of pathologic data., Three years
