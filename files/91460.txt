The Diagnostic Efficacy of Glutamine Synthetaseand BCLAF1in Early Diagosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Cirrhotic Patients
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prominent kind of liver cancer, accounting for 85% of primary liver malignancies. It is a very aggressive tumor, having a terrible prognosis and poor survival rate HCC is ranked as the sixth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortalities world wide.

HCC incidences arise in complications associated with chronic liver disease like cirrhosis, endemic hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcohol-related liver disease (Torre, 2015).
