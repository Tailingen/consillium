Early Cancer Detection Test - Lung Cancer China
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China from both incidence and mortality rate point of view, with significantly lower 5-year survival rate than average. Early detection is the recognized solution. LDCT is more and more popular accepted as an effective screening methodology but leads to numerous indeterminate pulmonary nodules for physicians to distinguish too. The value of autoantibody test in risk assessing of IPNs as well as early detection of lung cancer in high risk population has been demonstrated in clinical practice and trial but mainly in Caucasian. Purpose of this study is to understand the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of candidate autoantibodies, and consequently explore the autoantibody combination with best clinical performance in Chinese population.
