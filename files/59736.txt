BRE-08 Phase II Study of CMC Regimen for Early Stage Breast Cancer
This is a non-randomized, single arm phase 2 trial of oral CMC based on conversion of doses that would be delivered with conventional metronomic CMF chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Capecitabine
Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) in patients treated with the CMC regimen. RDI is defined as the sum total of delivered drug in mg/m2/week for each drug in the CMC regimen per the number of participants that have equal to or greater than 85%, Number of participants that have RDI of the CMC regimen is equal to or greater than 85%, 1 year
Safety of oral CMC regime per the number of participants experiencing adverse events, Number of participants having adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5, 1 year|Invasive Disease Free Survival (iDFS), Number of participants that have iDFS, defined as the time from enrollment to

documentation of the first of the following: invasive cancer in the ipsilateral breast/chest wall or regional nodes, contralateral invasive breast or regional nodes, distant metastases, or death from any cause, 10 years|Distant Disease Free Survival (DDFS), Number of participants that have DDFS defined as the time from enrollment to documentation of distant metastases or death from any cause., 10 years|Overall Survival (OS), Number of participants that have OS defined as the time from study enrollment to the date of the subject's death, 10 years|Participant outcomes using the Quality of Life (QOL) and EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaires, Number of participants having good outcome versus low outcomes. High score means worse health outcomes and low score means better health outcomes, 10 years|Protocol therapy interruption, Number of participants that have protocol therapy interruption, 10 years|Discontinuation of protocol therapy, Number of participants that have discontinuation of protocol therapy, 10 years|Rates of dose reduction of cyclophosphamide, Number of participants that have dose reduction of cyclophosphamide, 10 years|Rates of dose reduction of methotrexate, Number of participants that have dose reduction of methotrexate, 10 years|Rates of dose reduction of capecitabine, Number of participants that have dose reduction of capecitabine, 10 years
Participants who require adjuvant radiotherapy for locoregional management may opt to initiate radiotherapy following the fourth cycle of CMC with the final 4 cycles held during radiotherapy. Following completion of radiation therapy, participants may then resume with cycle 5 of CMC. The washout period before and after radiation therapy is a minimum of 2 weeks. Alternatively, patients may receive adjuvant radiotherapy after the completion of the final (8) cycle of CMC.

The study team will collect data on cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and capecitabine compliance at routine clinical visits every 3 weeks. In addition, standard electrolyte, chemistry and liver function laboratory monitoring will be conducted at each clinic visit
