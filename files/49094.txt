Effect of Trastuzumab on Disease Free Survival in Early Stage HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Patients With ERBB2 Expressing Disseminated Tumor Cells
This phase II trial studies the efficacy of trastuzumab treatment in breast cancer patients with stage II-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors and HER2-expressing bone marrow disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). Administering targeted trastuzumab therapy to these patients may result in the elimination of HER2 expressing disseminated tumor cells and improved disease free survival.

DRUG: Doxorubicin|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil
Number of Participants With Disease Recurrence, -Disease recurrence is defined as the documented appearance of local (breast, chest wall, axillary, supraclavicular nodes) or distant disease., Up to 3 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)|Death Rate, Up to 3 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 4 years)
Elimination of ERBB2 Overexpressing Bone Marrow DTCs, Bone marrow disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) are evaluated by RT-PCR performed on specimens collected 6-18 months apart (one before and one after therapy). The proportion of samples turned negative after therapy will be calculated. Samples will be considered negative for ERBB2-expression if expression from bone marrow collected from each iliac crest is less than 2 standard deviations above the ERBB2-level in pooled normal bone marrow specimens., Before treatment and after treatment (estimated to be 6-18 months)
