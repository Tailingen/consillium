Transcutaneous Breast Cancer Diagnosis by Canine Odorology
Patient with an indication of interventional percutaneous procedure for characterization of a breast lesion, palpable or not, classified as category 4 or 5, according to the Breast Imaging (BI) Report and Data System of the American College of Radiology (RADS) classification detected at mammography and/or breast ultrasound examination.
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Odour sampling
Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of canine odorology in women with breast lesion, The sensitivity and specificity of canine odorology in women with undeterminate breast lesion classified American College of Radiology (ACR) 4 or 5 (typically malignant) will be compared to the anatomopathological results of breast percutaneous sampling (biopsy), 26 months
Sensitivity (markings on patients affected) and specificity (no-markings on patients not affected), Number of markings among compresses of patients affected and number of no-markings among compresses of patients not affected. The gold standard is the pathological examination of the operative specimen or the status of the patient at 1 year., 38 months|Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of canine odorology, Number of compresses of patient affected on number of markings (PPV) and number of compresses of patient non affected on number of no-markings (NPV) will be evaluated, 38 months|Patient compliance during the study, The rate of return of compresses after delivery of a kit will be evaluated, 26 months|Comparison between canine odorology and mammography, Comparison test of sensitivity and specificity values between canine odorology and mammography, 38 months|Performance of each dog, Sensitivity and specificity of canine odorology for each dog will be calculated, 26 months|Variability between dogs, A Cohen's kappa test will be used to explore the variability between trained dogs and dog breeds, 26 months|Performance of canine odorology if the test is based on 2 dogs, The results of the 2 dogs will be used to compare the performances, 24 months|Patient's satisfaction, A questionnaire will be completed by the patients to measure their satisfaction and indicate their level of agreement. A score from 0 (no anxiety) to 5 (very anxious) on a scale will be completed to assess anxiety, a score from 0 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy) will be used to ensure that the compress is easy to use., 26 months
