A Study of Cobimetinib Plus Paclitaxel, Cobimetinib Plus Atezolizumab Plus Paclitaxel, or Cobimetinib Plus Atezolizumab Plus Nab-Paclitaxel as Initial Treatment for Participants With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer That Has Spread
This three-cohort, multi-stage, randomized, Phase II, multicenter trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability and estimate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in Cohort I, of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab plus paclitaxel in Cohort II, and of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in Cohort III in participants with metastatic or locally advanced, triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Participants may continue on study treatment until the development of progressive disease (PD) or the loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. The Cohort I target sample size is 12 participants for the safety run-in stage and approximately 90 participants in the expansion stage. Each of Cohorts II and III will consist of a safety run-in stage of approximately 15 participants followed by an expansion stage of approximately 15 participants.

Cohort I: Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, as determined by the investigator, using RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., Randomization up to disease progression or relapse, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Cohort II, III: Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Overall Response (OR) (Partial Response [PR] or Complete Response [CR]), as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, OR was defined as the rate of a PR or CR occurring after randomization and confirmed \>=28 days later as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target and new measurable lesions., Randomization up to disease progression or relapse, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 5.25 years)

PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target and new measurable lesions., Randomization up to disease progression or relapse, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Cohort I, II, III: Duration of Response (DOR), as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, DOR was defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of relapse, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurred first., Time from the first occurrence of documented objective response to time of relapse or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6.5 years)|Cohort I, II, III: Percentage of Participants With Unconfirmed Overall Response (OR_uc) (Unconfirmed PR or CR), as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, ORR_uc (ORR confirmation not required) was defined as the rate of a PR or CR occurring after randomization as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, confirmation not required. As per RECIST v1.1, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target and new measurable lesions., Randomization up to disease progression or relapse, whichever occurs fist (up to approximately 6.5 years)|Cohort II, III: Progression-Free Survival, as Determined by Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or relapse, as determined by the investigator, using RECIST v1.1.
