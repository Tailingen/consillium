Flotetuzumab for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Advanced CD123-Positive Hematological Malignancies
This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of flotetuzumab for the treatment of patients with blood cancers (hematological malignancies) that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and have come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Flotetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

Incidence of adverse events, Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 except infusion-related reaction (IRR)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which will be by the modified criteria proposed by Lee et al. Safety and toxicity will be assessed for each cohort independently. Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity, attribution, time of onset, duration, probable association with the study treatment and reversibility or outcome., Up to 30 days post-treatment
Best response of complete remission attained, Rates and 95% Clopper Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for complete remission/response rate (confirmed complete remission \[CR\]/ complete remission with incomplete count recovery \[CRi\]/ complete remission with partial hematological recovery \[CRh\] \[Cohort A\] or CR/molecular response \[MR\] \[Cohort B\]). Remission rates will also be explored based on number/type of prior therapy(ies), the presence of extramedullary disease at the time of starting therapy, disease burden, and CD123 expression intensity., by the end of induction/re-induction cycles (each cycle is 28 days, up to 6 cycles)|Minimal residual disease, Assessed by multi-color flow cytometry in ALL the cohorts., Up to 1 year|Duration of remission, Will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 1 year|Number/percent who bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), Number/percent of patients who proceed to hematopoietic cell transplantation after achieving complete response/ complete remission, Up to 1 year|Overall survival, Will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (recommended phase 2 dose, RP2D) of flotetuzumab, when given as a single agent.

II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of flotetuzumab in CD123-positive advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Cohort A) and other hematological malignancies (Cohort B), by evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, and duration of the toxicity.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Obtain preliminary estimates of remission; (complete remission \[CR\], complete remission with incomplete count recovery \[CRi\], complete remission with partial hematological recovery \[CRh\] or morphologic leukemia free state \[MLFS\] in Cohort A or CR/molecular response \[MR\] in Cohort B) rate and duration.

II. Estimate 1-year overall survival. III. Evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) status in responders in the ALL cohort.

IV. Evaluate the percentage of patients who receive subsequent allogeneic transplantation.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Examine immune profile pre- and post-treatment with flotetuzumab. II. Assess the association between CD123 expression and tumor response. III. Assess the association between alterations in tumor genetic or microenvironment with response.

IV. Assess cytokine levels during therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive flotetuzumab via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1-28. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD)/partial remission (PR) (Cohort A) or PR/clinical improvement (CI) (Cohort B), receive an additional induction cycle. Patients who achieve PR (Cohort A) or PR/CI/major molecular response (MMR) (Cohort B) after cycle 2 re-induction, may continue induction therapy for up to 4 more cycles.

CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who achieve CR/CRi/CRh/MLFS (Cohort A) or CR/MR (Cohort B) after cycle 1 or cycle 2 of induction therapy, receive flotetuzumab via continuous IV infusion on days 1-28 for up to 5 and 6 cycles, respectively, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR (Cohort A) or PR/CI/MMR (Cohort B) who have received up to 6 cycles of induction therapy may receive up to 2 cycles of consolidation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

SUPPORTIVE CARE: Patients also receive acetaminophen orally (PO) or ibuprofen PO every 8 hours for 48 hours, diphenhydramine or equivalent IV or PO every 8 hours for 48 hours, ranitidine or equivalent IV every 8 hours for 48 hours, and dexamethasone IV up to 30 minutes prior to dosing and then at 12 hours after dosing on week 1 days 1 and 7.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months for 1 year.
