A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of YL201 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label stydy to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of YL201 in Combination with Serplulimab with or without Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Selected Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors conducted in China. The study will include 2 parts: a dose escalation part (Part 1) followed by a cohort expansion part (Part 2).

Part 1 will estimate the safety, tolerability and MTD/RED(s) of YL201 in combination with serplulimab with or without platinum-based chemotherapy in selected subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Part 2 will estimate the efficacy of YL201 in combination with serplulimab with or without platinum-based chemotherapy in selected subjects with advanced solid tumors.
