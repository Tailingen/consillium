A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of CV-MG01 (Myasterix) in Myasthenia Gravis
Study CV-0003 will be the second clinical trial administering CV-MG01 in humans. This will be a phase 2/3 proof-of-efficacy therapeutic confirmatory study following the proof-of-concept exploratory phase 1 study (CV-0002).
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
BIOLOGICAL: CV-MG01|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Clinical efficacy, To assess the efficacy of 3 subcutaneous injections of CV-MG01 compared to placebo, as measured by a decrease from baseline of the QMG total score at 24 weeks after the first injection (equivalent to 12 weeks after last injection)., 24 weeks
Safety (ohysical examens and laboratory tests) and local tolerance (FDA grading scale), Evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including local injection site reactions (severity assessed with an overall grading scale following the FDA recommendation (FDA, CBER, September 2007)).

General safety monitoring via physical examinations, vital signs (VS), ECG and standard laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis)., 24 weeks|Efficacy - Responder rate, Proportion of patients with improvement or worsening by â‰¥ 3 points in the QMG score at week 24 after the first injection in the active group compared to the placebo group, 24 weeks
The review of the clinical data accumulated so far in Study CV-0002 indicated that the safety and tolerability profile of CV-MG01 is considered very good, with positive immunogenicity results after the high dose regimen of CV-MG01. The preliminary results also show an indication of efficacy of CV-MG01, as based on the different scales and questionnaires results, all specific to MG disease. Therefore, it is proposed to investigate, in an appropriately designed, randomised, double-blind and powered study, the clinical efficacy of CV-MG01 in a larger cohort of MG patients.
