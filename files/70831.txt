Study to Evaluate Efficacy of CO-1.01 as Second Line Therapy for Gemcitabine-Refractory Stage IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether CO-1.01 is safe and effective for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer that did not respond to gemcitabine.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), Every 8 weeks|CA 19-9 response rate, Every 4 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), Every 8 weeks|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Every week|Overall survival (OS), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Median progression-free survival, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Median overall survival, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months|Duration of response, Every 8 weeks
Pancreatic tumors with low hENT1 expression may show less benefit from gemcitabine compared with those with higher expression of this nucleoside transporter. Nonclinical studies indicate that CO-1.01, a gemcitabine derivative, is effective independent of such transporters. Thus patients with low or no meaningful expression of hENT1 who failed to respond to gemcitabine might derive benefit from CO1.01 before needing alternative (combination) chemotherapy. Furthermore, the PK profiles of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are dissimilar and this may confer additional clinical benefit on CO1.01.
