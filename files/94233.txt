Measure of Plasma Tissue Factor to Predict a Venous Thromboembolism in Primitive Cancer of Lung
The aim of the study is to evaluate if the plasma activity of the tissue factor at the time of the diagnosis of a lung cancer, before any treatment, or after the treatment of induction (surgery or two first cures of chemotherapy), can be a predictive factor of venous thromboembolism disease in the year which follows the diagnosis, independently of the other parameters.
