A Study of Intratumoral Administration of Oncolytic Virus Injection (RT-01) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose escalation, clinical pharmacology study to evaluate safety and efficacy of oncolytic virus injection(RT-01) When Administered Via Intratumoral Injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, the secondary purpose is to evaluate the antitumor activity, immunoreactivity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Oncolytic Virus Injection(RT-01)
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as an adverse event that is considered to be drug-related and meets one of the Protocol definitions, Up to 28 days
Incidence of adverse events, Graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 6 months|To evaluate the antitumor activity., Assessed per RECIST and iRECIST, Up to 2 years|The changes of the immunoreactivity during treatment, Peripheral blood T lymphocyte subtype, Up to 28 days|To evaluate the immunogenicity of RT-01, Antiviral antibody, Up to 28 days|To evaluate the viral shedding of RT-01, Viral RNA, Up to 24 Weeks|The Pharmacokinetics characteristics of RT-01, The Cmax of Viral RNA, Up to 24 Weeks|The Pharmacokinetics characteristics of RT-01, The Tmax of Viral RNA, Up to 24 Weeks
This is an investigator initiated , single-arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical pharmacology study of RT-01 as a single agent given via Intratumoral injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The study is a single agent dose escalation which will use an accelerated and "3+3" design to evaluate escalating doses of RT-01. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 6-12 evaluable participants enrolled. A Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) observation period of 4 weeks was established before the entry of the first patient at the next dose level.
