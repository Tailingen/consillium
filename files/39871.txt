LITT Followed by Hypofractionated RT for Recurrent Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment regimen of using Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) and Hypo-fractionated Radiation Therapy to treat patients with recurrent gliomas.

Radiation therapy is preferably used as an adjunct to surgery for patients with a newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. LITT offers an alternative to surgical resection, and due to its minimally invasive nature, does not delay initiating radiation therapy. Another advantage of LITT prior to radiation therapy is the ability to obtain a tissue diagnosis of recurrent tumor prior to initiating radiation therapy.
