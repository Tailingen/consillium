Camrelizumab Plus Apatinib as Maintenance Therapy in Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
This single-arm, Phase II study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab (anti-programmed death-receptor 1 \[PD-1\] antibody) combination with Apatinib in participants with ES-SCLC who was response or stable disease after firstline standard chemotherapy. Participants will be receive camrelizumab +apatinib on 21-day cycles until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.
