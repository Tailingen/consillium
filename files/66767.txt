Copeptin as a Biomarker for Central Diabetes Insipidus Development Following Pituitary Surgery
1. Access the optimal cut point value of copeptin which predicts development of central diabetes insipidus postoperatively with highest accuracy.
2. Access the optimal cut point value of copeptin which predicts the lack of central diabetes insipidus postoperatively with highest accuracy
3. Access the relative change in copeptin values between baseline and post-surgery as a predictor for diabetes insipidus development.

Predict central diabetes insipidus development, Using the measured lab value, we will access the optimal cut point value of copeptin which predicts development of central diabetes insipidus postoperatively with highest accuracy., 2 years|Predict lack of central diabetes insipidus development, Using the measured lab value, we will access the optimal cut point value of copeptin which predicts the lack of central diabetes insipidus postoperatively with highest accuracy, 2 years|Assess relative change, Using the measured lab value, we will access the relative change in copeptin values between baseline and post-surgery as a predictor for diabetes insipidus development., 2 years
Patient serum levels of copeptin would be measured after phlebotomy of 3 ml of blood in EDTA tube twice a) within 1-4 hours of extubation and b) within 4-24 hours of extubation (the morning following surgery).
