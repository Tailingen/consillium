The Miami "EMPIRE" Trial - Eradication of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer With Immuno-Radiation
The purpose of this study is to assess if radiation therapy (which uses high-energy radiation to damage or destroy cancer cells) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (medications that helps the body recognize and attack cancer cells) will be beneficial for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) among participants will be reported. CBR is the number of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease after start of study therapy. Response will be assessed using Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) 1.1 criteria., Up to 15 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate will be reported, based on best response according to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) 1.1 criteria. Objective response (OR) is defined as the number of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) to study therapy., Up to 15 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) among participants will be reported. PFS is defined as the elapsed time in months since the start of radiation therapy until the first documentation of disease progression or death., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) among participants will be reported. OS is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of radiation therapy until death by any cause., Up to 5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Grade 3 or Higher Toxicities, The number of participants experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicities will be reported using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 15 months
