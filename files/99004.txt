Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With Carboplatin and Docetaxel in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer-Prospective, Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial
The purpose of this study is to evaluate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy by imaging and observation of anatomical and biological indicators (i.e. ascites or continuous measurement of tumor marker CA 125). Furthermore the optimal number of preoperative administered cycles of combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and docetaxel should be determined.
