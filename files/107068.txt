A Novel Conditioning Regimen for Myelodysplastic Syndrome With Moderate High IPSS-M Score
Figure out the Efficacy and Safety of Azacitidine Combined with BUCY2 Conditioning Regimen Before Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndrome with Moderate High IPSS-M Score
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Azacitidine Injection
Progression-free survival (PFS) at 18 months post-transplant, month, PFS is measured from the date of allo-HSCT to the date of relapse or death from any cause or the last follow-up for surviving patients., 18 months post-transplantation
Overall survival (OS) at 18 months post-transplant, month, OS is defined as the time from allo-HSCT to the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up for surviving patients., 18 months post-transplantation
This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study, which plans to enroll 40 patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to be given azacitidine (AZA) combined with busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BUCY2) conditioning regimen to evaluate 18-month progression-free survival (PFS), aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine plus BUCY2 pretreatment regimen.
