Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Defined as the time from study enrollment to the date of the first procedure confirming histopathological recurrence or disease progression or death from any cause. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for participants who were still alive and who had no recurrence/progression., Surgery to recurrence or death (Follow-up assessments were performed at 3 and 6 months after the first TUR-BT, and every 6 months thereafter, until recurrence/progression of disease, or until the end of study, up to 24 months)
Time to Recurrence, Time from enrollment to first confirmation of histopathological recurrence or disease progression.
