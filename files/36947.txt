A Phase I Study of BMS-690514 in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin
The purpose of this clinical research is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-690514 when given in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Paclitaxel and carboplatin will be administered on a standard regimen every 3 weeks at standard doses. BMS-690514 will be given in the interval at escalating doses until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. An additional cohort of subjects will be treated with BMS-690514 at the MTD in combination with Paclitaxel and carboplatin
