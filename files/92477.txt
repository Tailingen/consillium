Study of 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) + Bevacizumab Versus 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin/Irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) + Bevacizumab as First Line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Not Previously Treated and With Three or More Circulating Tumoral Cells
The purpose of the study is to evaluate FOLFOX + bevacizumab versus FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab as first line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer not previously treated and with three or more circulating tumoral cells.
