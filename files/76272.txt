Virtual Ileostomy Versus Diverting Ileostomy in Patients Undergoing Total Mesorectal Excision
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn to compare the safety and efficacy of virtual ileostomy versus diverting ileostomy in patients undergoing sphincter-saving surgery for rectal cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is the virtual ileostomy a safe and effective alternative to the ileostomy?
* Is it scientifically reasonable to perform diverting ileostomy intraoperatively? Researchers will compare virtual ileostomy to diverting ileostomy to see if the virtual ileostomy works to reduce rates of stoma.

Participants will:

* Performing diverting ileostomy or virtual ileostomy undergoing sphincter-saving surgery for rectal cancer
* Continuous follow-up of their complications after the first surgery

If the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the number of hospitalization due to complications and/or reoperation since the data of low anterior resection for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Duration of bearing the stoma (months), If the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the duration of bearing the stoma since the data of surgery of diverting ileostomy., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Total hospitalization costs(Initial and all subsequent hospitalizations), Patients in the virtual stoma group who did not have a second surgery due to complications recorded the costs after the first surgery for rectal cancer, if the virtual stoma group required bedside or secondary surgery for converted to diverting ileostomy due to complications and all patients in the diverting ileostomy group required reoperation for stoma reversal, record the costs due to complications and reoperation since the data of the first surgery for rectal cancer., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Number of participants with terminal ostomy, Hartmann's procedure or for example, abdominoperineal extirpation，and transverse colostomy, Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Number of Participants with unscheduled secondary surgery, Patients performed unscheduled secondary surgery due to complications., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|The rate at which virtual ileostomy was converted to diverting ileostomy, The virtual ileostomy group required bedside or secondary surgery to convert to diverting ileostomy due to complications, Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Virtual ileostomy remove time(days), Duration of days from the date of radical resection of rectal cancer to virtual stoma removed., During hospitalization,approximately 14 days|Bile acid concentration of drainage fluid, The investigators are monitoring the concentration of bile acids in the first postoperative drainage fluid., During hospitalization,approximately 7 days|Number of participants with stoma (terminal/loop) at 6 months after initial surgery, Patients carrying stoma 6 months after the first surgery for rectal cancer, 6 months from the date of first surgery for rectal cancer|Interventional drainage rate, Patient requires interventional drainage due to complications., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Fecal Incontinence Scale(Wexner Score), The defecation function of all postoperative patients. Wexner score range is 0-20 points, with 0 points indicating normal and 20 points indicating complete incontinence., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Quality of life(EORTC QLQ-C30), The quality of life of all patients was assessed using relevant scales\[EORTC (The European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30(Quality of Life Questionnare-Core 30)\]. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (V3. O) consists of 30 entries, which can be divided into 15 domains, including 5 functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functions), 3 symptom domains (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting), 1 overall health/quality of life domain, and 6 individual entries (each as a domain). EORTC QLQ-C30 has a total of 30 entries. Among them, entries 29 and 30 are divided into seven levels, ranging from 1 to 7 points based on their answer options; the other entries are divided into 4 levels: none(1 point), a little（2 points）, more（3 points）, many（4 points）. The QLQ-C30 scale is reversed except for items 29 and 30 (the higher the value, the worse the quality of life)., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Disease free survival (DFS), Disease free survival, Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival, Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Rate of permanent ileostomy, Patients who underwent diverting Ileostomy were converted to permanent ileostomy., From the date of first surgery,an average of 3 year|Completion of intended perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy, Completion of intended perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy, Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Low anterior resection syndrome for rectal cancer, The investigators use LARS scale to evaluate the patient's defecation function.The LARS rating scale consists of 5 questions: voiding incontinence, fluid voiding incontinence, frequency of voiding, voiding aggregation, and voiding urgency. 0-20 is classified as no LARS, 21-29 is classified as mild LARS, 30-42 is classified as severe LARS., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Quality of life for fecal incontinence, The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (FIQL) is mainly used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with fecal incontinence. It includes four main aspects: lifestyle changes, psychological coping/behavioral limitations, depression/self-perception, and social embarrassment. The FIQL is analyzed as a total score; the higher the patient's score, the higher the patient's quality of life., Through study completion, an average of 5 year|Permanent ileostomy rate, Patients with diverting ileostomy who underwent sphincter-saving surgery for rectal cancer were converted to permanent ileostomy., 3 years from the date of first surgery for rectal cancer|Mortality, 30-day mortality, 30 days from the date of first surgery for rectal cancer
