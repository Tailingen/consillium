De novo tumor biopsies obtained during therapy and upon disease progression could be used to help confirm pharmacodynamic effects of treatment and investigate potential acquired mechanisms of resistance (ie, presence of but not limited to regulatory T-cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells and other immune suppressive cells or proteins)., Baseline (Baseline was defined as the time closest to, but prior to, the start of study drug administration in the first cycle), Cycle 3 Day 1|Number of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response, Tumor assessments included all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging included contrast enhanced chest, abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI scans; brain CT or MRI scan for participants with known or suspected brain metastases; bone scan and/or bone x rays for participants with known or suspected bone metastases. For participants with known CT contrast allergy, a non-contrast CT of the chest with contrast enhanced abdominal and pelvic MRI could be used. The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline was employed in the tumor assessments. Assessment of response used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Objective Response was defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)., Baseline up to maximum of 4 years
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-07062119 administered as a single agent in sequential dose levels and then in combination with anti-programmed cell death -1 protein (anti-PD-1) and in combination with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). In Part 1A, successive cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of PF-007062119 and then in dose finding (Part 1B) with PF-07062119 in combination with anti-PD-1 and in combination with anti-VEGF. This study contains 2 parts, dose escalation with single agent (Part 1A) and then dose finding with PF-007062119 in combination with ant-PD-1 and in combination with anti-VEGF (Part 1B) followed by dose expansion arms as a single agent and PF-07062119 in combination with anti-PD 1 and in combination with anti-VEGF (Part 2).
