Radiation Free Chemotherapy for Early Hodgkin Lymphoma
The results of the present study will provide information on short-term safety and efficacy of a iPET and MTV-adapted therapeutic strategy, aimed to assess the feasibility and safety on immediate disease control of a standard ABVD chemotherapy without any further treatment in patients with a very low risk or treatment failure. A second very important endpoint will be the efficacy of INRT "on demand" followed by Nivolumab maintenance for one year to rescue patients failing first-line treatment and relapsing with the pattern of "limited relapse" in terms of 3-Y failure from 2 relapse (FF2R). Patients entering into the study will be also asked to participate to a long-term follow up study (beyond ten years) to assess the prevalence of late-onset cardiovascular effects and secondary tumors in the cohort of patients enrolled in the experimental and control arm of the study. An exploratory endpoint has been also added such as the role of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection by cell-free DNA assay on peripheral blood samples obtained during treatment in predicting long-term disease control.
