Efficacy of Immediate Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Versus Bridging Therapy Followed by Transplantation in Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients
This study aims to evaluate whether immediate allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is non-inferior to HSCT following bridging therapy in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).

OTHER: Immediate HSCT Group|OTHER: Bridging Therapy Group
2-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) post-HSCT, Defined as the time from transplantation to two years post-HSCT, with primary events including death or failure to achieve CR or CR equivalent at the time of assessment, 2-year
Cumulative Incidence of Allogeneic HSCT, The proportion of patients who undergo HSCT at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks post-randomization., The proportion of patients who undergo HSCT at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks post-randomization.|Complete Remission (CR) or CR Equivalent Rate from Randomization, The percentage of patients achieving CR or CR equivalent, defined as the first documented occurrence., 2-year|2-year Overall Survival (OS) post-HSCT, Defined as the time from HSCT to death from any cause within two years., 2-year|2-year Leukemia-Free Survival (LFS) from Randomization, The time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause within two years., 2-year|2-year Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment: 2-year Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment from Randomization, Defined as the assessment of patient-reported QoL starting from randomization over a 2-year period, evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire., 2-year|Molecular Clearance Rate, Molecular clearance was defined by two consecutive blood samples obtained at least 4 weeks apart that were negative for driver mutations in a patient who had been positive before transplantation., 2-year
This study aims to evaluate whether immediate allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is non-inferior to HSCT following bridging therapy in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).A total of 236 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the immediate transplantation group (n=118) and the disease control group (n=118). The study will continue until at least 124 events occur.
