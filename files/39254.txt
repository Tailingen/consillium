Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Ixabepilone (Ixempra)|DRUG: Paclitaxel (Taxol)
Disease-free Survival, The percentage of participants with disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years. Disease-free survival (DFS) is measured from the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease recurrence, or death from any cause., up to 5.25 years (63 months)
Overall Survival, The percentage of participants with overall survival at 3 and 5 years are presented. Overall survival (OS) defined as the time between randomization to date of death from any cause., up to 5.25 years (63 months)
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of two different treatment arms. Patients in treatment arm 1 will receive AC followed by ixabepilone. Patients in treatment arm 2 will receive AC followed by weekly paclitaxel.
