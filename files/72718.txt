Study of BG-T187 Alone and in Combination With Other Therapeutic Agents in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1a/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-T187 alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Drug: BG-T187
Phase 1a: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with AEs including serious adverse events (SAEs), defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drugs, whether considered related to study drugs or not as graded by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE) V5.0/American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) for cytokine release syndrome \[CRS\] and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome \[ICANS\]); and adverse events meeting protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) of BG-T187, MAD is defined as the highest dose that can be administered safely and tolerably, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BG-T187, MTD is defined as the highest dose evaluated for which the estimated toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate of 30%, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a: Recommended Dose(s) for Expansion (RDFE[s]) of BG-T187, RDFE(s) is determined based on the MAD or MTD, taking into consideration the long-term tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), preliminary antitumor activity, and any other relevant data, as available, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigators per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BG-T187 alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents, R2PD is determined based on safety, tolerability, PK, preliminary antitumor activity, and other relevant data, as available, Approximately 2 years
Phase 1a: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed BOR, CR or PR as determined by investigators per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a and 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first objective response until the first documentation of disease progression after treatment initiation or death, whichever comes first, as determined by investigators per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a and 1b: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with the BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease, as determined by investigators per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1b: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first administration of study drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by investigators per RECIST v1.1, Approximately 2 years|Phase 1a and 1b: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BG-T187, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle19 Day1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a and 1b: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of BG-T187, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle19 Day1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a and 1b: Terminal Half-Life (t1/2) of BG-T187, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle19 Day1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a and 1b: Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of BG-T187, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle19 Day1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1a and 1b: Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to BG-T187, From Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle19 Day1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1b: Number of Participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants with AEs including serious adverse events (SAEs), defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drugs, whether considered related to study drugs or not as graded by the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE) V5.0/American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT), Approximately 2 years
