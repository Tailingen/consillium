Tislelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery Versus Up-front Surgery in Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (REDUCTION-I)
A prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy followed by surgery versus up-front surgery in resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
