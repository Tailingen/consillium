Artificial Intelligence Model for Growth Prediction of Ovarian Cancer Organoids
The present study aims to collect early bright field image of patient-derived organoids with ovarian cancer. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this study will seek to construct and refine algorithms that able to predict growth of ovarian cancer organoids.
