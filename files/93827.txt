PROCEDURE: Blood Draw
Overall prevalence of possible or likely acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency, defined by PK enzyme activity or PK:HK ratio \>1 SD below the control mean (healthy subject mean) as measured by enzyme assay, or potentially pathogenic mutations in the PKLR gene as found on PKLR sequencing, Day 1
Overall prevalence of definite acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency, Defined by PK enzyme activity below normal (or a PK:HK ratio \<8.7) as measured by enzyme assay, or known pathogenic mutations in the PKLR gene as found on PKLR sequencing, Day 1|Red cell pyruvate kinase enzyme activity, Red cell pyruvate kinase enzyme activity in patients not receiving red cell transfusion in the 60 days prior to blood draw, 60 days|Red cell pyruvate kinase, hexokinase enzyme activity ratio in patients not receiving red cell transfusion in the 60 days prior to blood draw, 60 Day|Somatic mutations in PKLR (and other genes associated with acquired PKD) detected in the hematopoietic clone, Day 1|Somatic mutations in other genes associated with hemolytic anemia detected in the hematopoietic clone, Day 1|Characterization of pyruvate kinase-related red cell metabolites (ATP, 2,3-DPG) and pyruvate kinase-R protein in patients with clonal myeloid disorders, Day 1|Impact of pyruvate kinase activators on PK activity in vitro, Day 1

This cross-sectional prevalence assessment study involves a single blood draw in specific patient populations to assess for enzymatic and genomic evidence for acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency.

* Red cell pyruvate kinase enzyme activity and next-generation sequencing (NGS) hereditary hemolytic anemia panels will be performed on samples from all recruited participants.
* The study will recruit patients to two separate cohorts.

  * Cohort 1 will recruit approximately 75 anemic (Hgb \<11.0 g/dL) MDS participants without overt clinical evidence of hemolysis.
  * Cohort 2 will recruit approximately 25 participants with clonal myeloid disorders of any type with evidence of non-immune, otherwise unexplained hemolytic anemia
* Participation in the study involves a single blood draw. Basic information about the participant's blood disorder will also be collected.

It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study
