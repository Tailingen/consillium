A Pilot Study To Assess Guidance in and Subsequent Use of Mind-Body Techniques on the Quality of Life of Cancer Patients
Aim: To answer the questions of whether a Mind-Body Medicine (MBM) skills group facilitated face-to-face and online can improve measures of Quality of Life (QOL) in a population of cancer patients.

Value of Study: Technological advances have contributed to new venues for healthcare delivery. It is imperative that these new delivery methods, for individual and/or group psychosocial services are sufficiently tested and validated. Research shows that there is very little knowledge about differences in communication styles between online and face-to-face groups, nor is there much knowledge on the overall efficacy of online groups.

Phenomenon Studied: Can MBM skills groups improve the quality of life of cancer patients? Is there a difference in outcome between a MBM skills group delivered face-to-face and a MBM skills group delivered online.

Reasons Leading to Proposing the Project: Despite encouraging research showing that psychosocial interventions have positive effects in the lives of cancer patients, more research is needed due to several problems of current research, such as poor study design, lack of use of technological advances and relatively few existing studies on the effectiveness of MBM therapies in the oncological setting.

Stated Hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1:

There is no difference between baseline QOL measures and QOL measures at the end of face-to-face facilitated MBM skills groups.

Hypothesis 2:

There is no difference between baseline QOL measures and QOL measures at the end of Online facilitated MBM skills groups.

Hypothesis 3:

Participation in either, online facilitated MBM skills groups or face-to-face facilitated MBM skills groups will improve QOL measures when compared to control group.

Hypothesis 4:

Patients in the control group (waitlist control, care as usual group) will have no improvement on QOL measures.

Anticipated Value to the Larger Community: According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) "...there is a need for reliable, objective, evidence-based information regarding the usefulness and safety-or lack thereof-of CAM" (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 2011, p.3). This study will add to general scientific knowledge of CAM and MBM.

Change in Quality Of Life, as assessed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument, The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assessment. The instrument has been tested and developed for almost 20 years and "...results indicate that overall, the WHOQOL-BREF is a sound, cross-culturally valid assessment of QOL, as reflected by its four domains: physical, psychological, social and environment" (Skevington, Lofty, \& O'Connell, 2004)., Baseline, week 4
Change in distress, anxiety, depression and need for help as assessed by the Emotion Thermometers ToolÂ© (ET5), The ET5 is a five dimensional tool comprised of five visual-analogue scales in the form of four predictor domains (distress, anxiety, depression, anger) and one outcome domain (need for help). It is modeled after the original Distress Thermometer (DT) recommended by the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network. In order to detect broadly defined distress or anxiety, a combination of thermometers was most accurate (Mitchell, Baker-Glenn, Park, Granger, \& Symonds, 2010). The ET5 tool expands on the DT by combining domains in order to detect emotional complications after a diagnosis with cancer., Baseline, Week 4
