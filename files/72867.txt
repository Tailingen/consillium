Prehab for Lung and Esophageal Cancer
Research indicates that individuals diagnosed with lung or esophageal cancer who enter treatment with higher functional capacities, improved body composition, and better nutrition status tend to experience better outcomes and a higher quality of life. The primary objective of a prehabilitation health coaching program is to enhance the overall health and well-being of patients before they undergo major surgery.This personalized 8-week program encompasses elements such as nutrition, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, and movement, equipping participants with the knowledge and tools needed to adopt healthier lifestyles.

The purpose of this study is to explore the implementation, feasibility and effectiveness of a community-based prehabilitation health coaching program, including nutrition, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene and movement for individuals scheduled to undergo surgery for lung or esophageal cancer.. Participants will have the option to engage in a one-on-one prehabilitation health coaching program tailored to their needs, led by a Qualified Exercise Professional (QEP). The personalized prehabilitation plan will encompass 4-6 in-person or virtual meetings before surgery, including a structured movement plan, education on smoking cessation, sleep quality, stress reduction, mindfulness, and nutrition. Post-surgery, the QEP will provide support through counselling and scheduled sessions for a month after surgery and include one session while the patient is in hospital.

This research adopts a repeated measure, mixed-methods approach. Participants will undergo three clinical assessments at different stages: baseline, pre-surgery, and 4-6 weeks post-surgery. The findings from this study will guide future grant applications aimed at funding larger studies and the implementation of prehabilitation as part of standard of care in lung and esophageal cancer patients in Nova Scotia.

Central to the research endeavor is the driving question: "How can a community-based prehabilitation program be successfully implemented in the community, and can it lead to improved functional outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for lung or esophageal cancer?" This overarching question provides the study with its core focus and serves as a guiding force throughout the research process.
