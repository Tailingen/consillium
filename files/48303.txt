Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: indinavir sulfate|DRUG: nelfinavir mesylate|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: ritonavir|DRUG: saquinavir mesylate
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether the body distribution and plasma clearance of paclitaxel is affected by protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir mesylate, or nelfinavir mesylate).

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to protease inhibitor treatment (yes vs no), prior paclitaxel (yes vs no), and prior doxorubicin or daunorubicin (yes vs no).

Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for at least 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who previously received paclitaxel receive no more than 1 course during this study.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
