Gemcitabine With or Without Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if gemcitabine is more effective with or without capecitabine in treating pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without capecitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride
Survival at 1 year
Quality of life|Median survival rate|Survival rate at 2 years|Toxicity|Objective response rate
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the 1-year survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine with or without capecitabine.
* Compare the median and 2-year survival rates and the objective response rates of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic) and performance status (0 and 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 during the first course. After a 1-week rest period, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Subsequent courses repeat every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

Patients are followed every 3 months.
