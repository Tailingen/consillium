Comparative Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Safety of BCD-057 and Humira® in Patients With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis
CALYPSO clinical study is a phase 3 study which is carried out to establish the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic equivalence of BCD-055 (adalimumab, manufactured by JSC BIOCAD, Russia) and Humira® when used in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

CALYPSO study is the next step of clinical evaluation of adalimumab biosimilar manufactured by joint-stock company (JSC) BIOCAD, Russia.The aim of this study is to establish that BCD-057 is equivalent to Humira® in terms of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics when used by the standard regimen in patients with plaque psoriasis.

The study will enroll 344 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who will be randomized into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): patients from the first group will receive BCD-057 subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. Then participants of this group will be invited for randomization at week 25 (in order to keep the double-blind design of the study), but it will have a formal character (assignment of a new randomization number and lot). Patients will continue to receive 40 mg of BCD-057 on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and 51.

Patients from the second group will receive Humira® subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. At week 25 participants will re-randomized (1:1) to treatment with Humira® or will transitioned to BCD-057.They will receive Humira® or BCD-057 at a dose 40 mg on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and 51.
