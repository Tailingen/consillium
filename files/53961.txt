This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate Tunlamatinib plus Vemurafenib versus Investigator's choice of Chemotherapy based treatment as controls in patients with BRAFV600E mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) whose disease has progressed after 1 or more prior regimens in the metastatic setting.
