Comparison Study of EAP and Disease-Specific Chemotherapy Regimens in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization for Lymphoma
This study utilizes a prospective, multicenter, randomized two-arm design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the etoposide, cytarabine, and pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) combination therapy (EAP regimen) in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A total of 99 NHL patients will be enrolled as research subjects and will be randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to compare the EAP regimen versus disease-specific chemotherapy mobilization regimen. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving the ideal collection value after a single collection (CD34+ cells ≥5×10\^6/kg).

Based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 99 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients from 16 hospitals will be selected. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group will receive the EAP regimen, which combines etoposide, cytarabine, and pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF), while the control group will receive disease-specific chemotherapy mobilization regimens, such as the CHOP and Hyper-CVAD. Subsequently, the number of CD34+ cells will be monitored. The study will evaluate the proportion of patients achieving the ideal collection value after a single collection (CD34+ cells ≥5×106/kg); the proportion of patients achieving the target collection value cumulatively; the total amount of CD34+ cells collected and the average number of collections; hematological and non-hematological adverse reactions; and the proportion of patients receiving plerixafor.
