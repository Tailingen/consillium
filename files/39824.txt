All patients who meet entry criteria will be randomized, and will undergo a leukapheresis procedure. During the Induction period, all patients will receive DCVAC/OvCa or placebo (study treatment) with concurrent standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without use of bevacizumab. In the Maintenance period, patients will continue treatment with study treatment in combination with bevacizumab, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) or best supportive care only. Study treatment will continue irrespective of disease progression
