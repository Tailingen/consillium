Assessment of the Uro-C Cystoscope for Use in Diagnostic Cystoscopy Procedures
This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical usability study in subjects who are candidates for office diagnostic cystoscopy. The primary objective of this initial device assessment is to evaluate the performance of a new cystoscope for direct visualization of the urethra and bladder.
Bladder Tumor
DEVICE: Uro-C (Use of new cystoscope)
Assessment of the utility and performance of the cystoscope by the physician, Ranking with Likert Scale on ease of advancement, visibility of tissue and structures, and removal of the device, during the procedure
Patient tolerance of the procedure, Assess level of discomfort or adverse event associated with the procedure by the subject using the Likert Scale, during and within 5 days after the procedure
A new cystoscope has been designed for female diagnostic cystoscopy, with a focus on promoting patient comfort, tolerability and safety while improving office efficiency. The cystoscope, named the Uro-C, is light-weight, ergonomic, handheld, battery-operated portable system that integrates a disposable cannula with a reusable handle that contains video electronics, is wireless capable, and has a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Cystoscopy with the new system is performed in a standard manner to cystoscopy with currently available endoscopes, so risks are no different than when currently available endoscopes are used.
