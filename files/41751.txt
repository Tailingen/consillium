B7-H3-Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor Autologous T-Cell Therapy for Pediatric Patients With Solid Tumors (3CAR)
3CAR is being done to investigate an immunotherapy for patients with solid tumors. It is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the use of autologous T cells genetically engineered to express B7-H3-CARs for patients ≤ 21 years old, with relapsed/refractory B7-H3+ solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells.The purpose of this study is to find the maximum (highest) dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells that are safe to give to patients with B7-H3-positive solid tumors.

Primary objective

To determine the safety of one intravenous infusion of autologous, B7-H3-CAR T cells in patients (≤ 21 years) with recurrent/refractory B7-H3+ solid tumors after lymphodepleting chemotherapy

Secondary objective

To evaluate the antitumor activity of B7-H3-CAR T cells

Exploratory objectives

* To evaluate the tumor environment after treatment with B7-H3-CAR T cells
* To assess the immunophenotype, clonal structure and endogenous repertoire of B7-H3-CAR T cells and unmodified T cells
* To characterize the cytokine profile in the peripheral blood after treatment with B7-H3-CAR T cells

Safety of B7-H3-CAR T cells, A phase I design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of autologous, B7-H3-CAR T cells. Four dose levels (3x10\^5/kg, 1x10\^6/kg, 3x10\^6/kg, and 1x10\^7/kg) will be evaluated., 6 weeks after B7-H3-CAR T cell infusion
Clinical Response, The number of patients with objective responses (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., 6 weeks after B7-H3-CAR T cell infusion
Treatment will include a single infusion of B7-H3-CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, with dosing based on the number of CAR+ T cells and patient weight. The study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of B7-H3-CAR T cells, using a standard 3+3 study design and a 6-week evaluation period. The total study duration will be 1 year, at which point patients will enroll on our existing institutional long-term follow-up protocol.
