A Study to See How Well and How Safely Different Treatments Work in a Group of Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and/or safety of multiple therapies in patients with early-stage resectable NSCLC. Cohort B1 is a phase II cohort that will evaluate the safety, and efficacy of alectinib in combination with up to four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting post complete surgical resection. Cohort B2 is a phase II cohort that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative alectinib in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Alectinib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Cohort B1: Incidence, type, and severity of adverse events (AEs) with onset up to 28 days after the last dose of chemotherapy, Up to 28 days after the last dose of chemotherapy treatment (up to 4 cycles, cycle length = 3 weeks)|Cohort B2: Investigator-assessed pathologic complete response (inv-pCR), At the time of surgical resection (approximately weeks 14-17)
Cohort B1: Investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS), From initiation of study treatment to the first documented recurrence of disease or new primary NSCLC or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 5 years)|Cohort B1: Overall survival (OS), From initiation of study treatment to death from any cause (up to approximately 8 years)|Cohort B1: Incidence, type, and severity of AEs with onset up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, From first dose to up to approximately 5 years|Cohort B1: Time to first onset of selected AEs, From first dose to up to approximately 5 years|Cohort B1: Change from baseline in target safety parameters, From first dose to up to approximately 5 years|Cohort B2: Investigator-assessed major pathological response (inv-MPR), At the time of surgical resection (approximately weeks 14-17)|Cohort B2: Pathologic complete response (pCR) by independent review, At the time of surgical resection (approximately weeks 14-17)|Cohort B2: Major pathologic response (MPR) by independent review, At the time of surgical resection (approximately weeks 14-17)|Cohort B2: Investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR), Up to approximately Week 17|Cohort B2: Investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS), From first treatment to the first documented disease progression that prevents surgery, local or distant disease recurrence, or death from any cause (up to approximately 5 years)|Cohort B2: Overall Survival (OS), From initiation of study treatment to death from any cause (up to approximately 8 years)|Cohort B2: Incidence, severity, and type of AEs, From first dose up to approximately 5 years|Cohort B2: Change from baseline in target safety parameters, From first dose to up to approximately 5 years|Cohort B2: Frequency of surgery completion, defined as participants who have successfully completed surgery without treatment-related delays (> 60 days) from the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, At the time of surgical resection (approximately weeks 14-17)|Cohort B2: Length of treatment-related surgical delays, incidence of operative and post-operative complications, and/or reasons for surgical cancellations, Approximately weeks 14-24
