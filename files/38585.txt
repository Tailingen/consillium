Study of Liposomal Annamycin in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
This is a Phase I/II multi-center, open label, dose escalation study to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of liposomal annamycin and to evaluate the safety of liposomal annamycin in patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Liposomal Annamycin
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of L-Annamycin, 8 months|MTD, 8 months
To study multi drug-resistant (MDR)-1 encoded P-170 glycoprotein expression and MDR-1 multidrug-resistant-associated protein (MRP), lung-resistance associated protein LRP), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mRNA levels, 8 months|To measure the pharmacokinetics of annamycin and its metabolite, annamycinol., 8 months
This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation, MTD study of liposomal annamycin in refractory or relapsed ALL patients. Enrollment will occur in cohorts of approximately 3 patients with 10 additional patients enrolled at the MTD. The liposomal annamycin doses will be escalated in sequential cohorts. Four dose levels of liposomal annamycin are planned: 190, 230, 280, and 310 mg/m2/day.
