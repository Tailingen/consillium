Phase 2 Trial of Seribantumab Plus Fulvestrant in Postmenopausal Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study in postmenopausal women with heregulin positive, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic, unresectable breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Seribantumab|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented radiographical progression of disease using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first as assessed by the investigator.

The tumor assessment (i.e., scan dates) was used for progression/censor date not the date corresponding to the determination of overall response. Progression-free survival time distribution and median survival for each treatment group were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization until progression of disease or death due to any cause up to 13 months (The study terminated prematurely) . The primary analysis was planned to be initiated when 58 PFS events have occurred
Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. The study was terminated on 30 Nov 2018 . Data represents outcomes up to 150 days of treatment., Randomization until death due to any cause up to 13 months (The study terminated prematurely)|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a RECIST v1.1 response recorded from randomization until disease progression characterized as either a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) relative to the total number of evaluable patients., Randomization through end of study up to 13 months (The study terminated prematurely)|Time to Progression, Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of objective tumor progression., Randomization to date of objective tumor progression up to 13 months (The study terminated prematurely)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Reported With the Combinations of Seribantumab Plus Fulvestrant Versus Fulvestrant Alone, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that occurred after the first dose of study drug and was not present prior to study drug administration or worsened in severity after study drug administration., TEAEs were collected through the study completion (30 Nov 2018), up to 13 months. Frequency and percent summaries were presented for TEAE defined as adverse events that occur or worsen in severity following the first dose of seribantumab, or fulvestrant|Percentage of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Reported With the Combinations of Seribantumab Plus Fulvestrant Versus Fulvestrant Alone, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that occurred after the first dose of study drug and was not present prior to study drug administration or worsened in severity after study drug administration., TEAEs were collected through the study completion (30 Nov 2018), up to 13 months. Frequency and percent summaries were presented for TEAE defined as adverse events that occur or worsen in severity following the first dose of seribantumab, or fulvestrant|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of Seribantumab When Given in Combination With Fulvestrant and of Fulvestrant When Given in Combination With Serbantumab., Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation are performed on samples obtained pre-dose on day 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121. The maximum observed concentration (Cmax) is presented and calculated usig Non-compartmental analysis (NCA). Serum levels of MM-121 are measured at a central lab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., The study terminated prematurely after 13 months. Were to be analyzed post-dose on Cycle 1,Week 1 & pre-dose for all subsequent seribantumab infusions until the completion of Cycle 2. Fulvestrant PK samples were to be collected prior to seribantumab dose
This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international phase 2 trial in patients with HRG+, HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer that has progressed following treatment with no more than 2 prior therapies, one of which must have been a CDK inhibitor. All patients will be screened for heregulin using central testing, and eligible patients will be randomized to receive either seribantumab + fulvestrant or placebo + fulvestrant. Disease status will be assessed according to RECIST v 1.1 to support the primary endpoint.
