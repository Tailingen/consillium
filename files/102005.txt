Dose-Dense MVAC With Pegfilgrastim Support in Subjects With Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma
The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of neoadjuvant dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (ddMVAC) in combination with pegfilgrastim followed by radical surgery in patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.

Number of Patients Achieving Pathologic Response, Pathological response is defined as down-staging to \</=pT1, N0 after chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support., After completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support (cycle length 2 weeks)
Number of Patients Experiencing Febrile Neutropenia, Febrile neutropenia defined per CTCAEv3 as Grade 3 or higher and treatment attribution possibly, probably or definitely-related., After completion of 4 cycles of chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support (cycle length 2 weeks)|Number of Patients Experiencing Surgery-related Toxicity, Surgery-related toxicity defined per CTCAEv3 as Grade 2 or higher and treatment attribution possibly, probably or definitely-related., Surgery + 30 days
* Participants will be given a study infusion schedule for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts three weeks. The infusion of methotrexate will take place on the first day of each cycle. Infusions of vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin will take place on the second day and an injection of pegfilgrastim will be given on the third day.
* During all treatment cycles participants will have a physical exam and will be asked questions about their general health and any problems they might be having and any medications they may be taking.
* Following completion of study treatment, but before surgery, participants will have an assessment of their tumor by CT scan of the chest and and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.
* Following the participants surgery, we would like to keep track of their medical condition indefinitely, or until this study is officially completed. We would like to do this by calling the participants on the telephone once a year to see how they are doing.
