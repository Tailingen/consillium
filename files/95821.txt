Rosuvastatin in the Treatment of Rectal Cancer
This study will evaluate whether the addition of Rosuvastatin to standard chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer may improve the pathological response rate and survival compared to standard chemoradiation therapy alone.

The standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer involves neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by surgery and further adjuvant chemotherapy. The pathologic complete responses associated with neoadjuvant CRT are 10-20%. The prognosis of patients undergoing neoadjuvant CRT is associated to the extent of post-treatment tumour regression, the final primary tumour stage and presence of involved lymph nodes in the surgical specimen. This data suggests that treatments that enhance the pathological response may result in improvements in survival.

Overwhelming preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that statins demonstrate anticancer properties and sensitize cancer tissues and protects normal tissues to the effects of radiation. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of rosuvastatin to standard CRT for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer may improve the pathological response rate. This protocol describes an open-label single-arm phase 2 study designed to test this hypothesis. Moreover, this study will also identify genetic, serological, and pathological biomarkers that may be both prognostic and predictive of response and toxicity to treatment.
