Advanced Development of Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry for Intraoperative Molecular Diagnosis of Brain Cancer Using Pathology Biopsies
This study explores whether DESI-MS can be used to identify cancerous vs. noncancerous tissue during brain tumor surgery.

OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Pathological state of the tissue, Will use desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) to identify cancerous versus noncancerous tissue monitoring depletion of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and aberrations of the phospholipid signature (components of the cell membrane) of neurological tissue., Up to 5 years|Percentage of tumor infiltration, Will estimate the percentage of tumor infiltration in tissue biopsies by monitoring depletion of NAA and aberrations of the phospholipid signature of neurological tissue., Up to 5 years|Presence of IDH mutations, Will use DESI-MS to identify the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations by monitoring the 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and therefore differentiate between IDH-mutant and wild-type gliomas., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore the translational abilities of desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) as intraoperative diagnostic tool to:

Ia. Identify cancerous versus noncancerous tissue and estimate the percentage of tumor infiltration in tissue biopsies, by monitoring depletion of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and aberrations of the phospholipid signature of neurological tissue; Ib. Identify the presence of IDH mutations by monitoring the 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and therefore differentiate between IDH-mutant and wild-type gliomas.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo tissue sample collection and DESI-MS during standard of care surgery and have their medical records reviewed on study. Patients also undergo MRI per standard of care on study.
