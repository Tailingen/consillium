FLuorescence Identification of Melanoma by a Multicenter Based Algorithm (FLIMMA)
All patients will undergo dermoscopic diagnosis and be documented with a video image storing. The diagnosis based on dermoscopy will be immediately documented. Then, as a second diagnostic procedure, fluorescence diagnostics based on the two photon excitation from a dye-laser will be performed. The classification as non-melanoma or malignant melanoma by the medical device LIMES will also be documented immediately. Afterwards, the lesion will be excised and undergo histopathologic examination by the respective histopathologist of the participating centers. The histopathologic diagnosis will serve as gold standard for subsequent evaluations of the diagnostic accuracy.

DEVICE: LIMES
To determine sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for the fluorescence diagnostics of melanoma., The comparator and gold standard for the diagnosis will be the histopathological diagnosis of the pigmented lesions., 7 days
To collect data for training and optimization of the diagnostic algorithm., 1 day
To assess the safety of the device and to assess the incidence of adverse events, 7 days
