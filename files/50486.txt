Study of CC-122 to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Effectiveness for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, or Multiple Myeloma
The main purpose of this first in human study with CC-122 is to assess the safety and action of a new class of experimental drug (Pleiotropic Pathway Modulator) in patients with advanced tumors unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dosing level and regimen for later-stage clinical trials.

Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE):

* A clinically relevant AE that is suspected to be related to CC-122 and starts ≤ 30 days of first dose (Cycle 1) and ≥ grade (Gr) 3 except for Alopecia, Gr3 rash of the acneiform or maculopapular type \< 4 daysduration , Gr 3 diarrhea or vomiting lasting\< 72 hours
* Clinically relevant laboratory abnormality suspected to be related to CC-122 and that commences within 30 days of first dose and ≥ Gr3.
* Hematological toxicities as follows: Any febrile neutropenia (NP), Gr4 NP \> 7 days, Gr 4 thrombocytopenia \> 24 hours, Any Gr 3/4 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding.
* Gr 4 liver function tests (LFTs) or Gr 3 ALT with ≥ Gr2 bilirubin
* Any AE suspected to be CC-122 related and necessitating dose reduction during Cycle 1., Up to approximately Day 28|Pharmacokinetics- Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in plasma (Cmax), Up to day 22|Pharmacokinetics- AUC, Area under the concentration-time curve, Up to day 22|Pharmacokinetics- tmax, Time to maximum concentration, Up to day 22|Pharmacokinetics- t1/2, Terminal half-life, Up to day 22|Pharmacokinetics- CL/F, Apparent total body clearance, Up to day 22|Pharmacokinetics- Vz/F, Apparent volume of distribution, Up to day 22|Non-tolerated dose (NTD), Is defined as the dose level at which ≥2 out of 6 evaluable subjects in any dose cohort with DLT., Up to day 28|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Is defined as the last dose level below the NTD with ≤1 out of 6 evaluable subjects with DLT) during Cycle (C) 1., Up to day 28
Response Rate, The response rate of each tumor types based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), International Workshop Criteria (IWC) for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (IURC), or Responses Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group for Glioblastama multiforme (GBM), up to approximately 6 months|Tissue concentration of CC-122, Tissue concentration of CC-122 in salvage resection specimens from subjects with GBM (CNS primary tumor) or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from subjects undergoing lumbar puncture., up to approximately 6 months|6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate for GBM chort, The primary efficacy variable for GBM chohort is 6-month progression free survival (PFS)., Up to approximately 6 months
This trial is enrolling additional Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects in a separate cohort defined as MM-2 to evaluate tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 formulated capsule alone or in combination with DEX on intermittent dosing schedule (5 of 7 days of the week) in Pomalidomide-naïve subjects. Preliminary efficacy data in Multiple Myeloma subjects, warrants further exploration of CC-122 in MM on intermittent schedules to assess if dose intensity and tolerability can be improved. Initially, patients will be treated with oral CC-122 for one month. During this time, various tests (involving blood and urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose tumors stabilize or regress may continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from CC-122. Different dose levels of CC-122 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.
