Premedication Simethione Improves Visibility During Bowel Cleansing for Colonoscopy
To evaluate the efficacy, visibility of low volume polyethyleneglycol-simeticone (2-LPEG-S) for colonoscopy.
Bowel Preparation Scale|the Amount of Air Bubble|Adenoma Detection Rate
DRUG: 2L PEG|DRUG: 2L PEG+simethicone
adenoma detection rate, 2 days|bowel preparation scale, 2 days|the amount of air bubbles, Five areas of the colon (rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, ascending, and cecum) were graded for the amount of air bubbles.The amount of intraluminal air bubbles was classified into four grades as shown below: Grade 0 = No or minimal scattered bubbles; Grade 1 = Bubbles covering at least half the luminal diameter; Grade 2 = Bubbles covering the circumference of the lumen; Grade 3 = Bubbles filling the entire lumen., 2 days
In this randomized controlled study, consecutive outpatients scheduled for elective colonoscopy were randomized into two groups. Group A patients (n = 300) used only 2 L PEG before colonoscopy. Patients in group B (n = 300) were additionally advised to simeticone plus 2 L PEG, The overall quality of colonoscopy cleaning was evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale by a single endoscopist who was blinded to the intervention. Visibility was blindly assessed for the amount of air bubbles and adenoma detection rate (ADR). Difficulty of procedure, and adverse events were also evaluated.
