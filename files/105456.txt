Dacomitinib for EGFR Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Brain Metastases
DRUG: Dacomitinib
Progression Free Survival （PFS）, Progression Free Survival （PFS）is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 per investigator review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., 20 months
Intracranial Objective Response Rate, Intracranial Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of either CR or PR of intracranial disease, where BOR is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or start of other anticancer therapy. As per RECIST v1.1 guidelines, PR and CR do not need to be confirmed following initial response documentation., 20 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of either CR or PR, where BOR is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or start of other anticancer therapy. As per RECIST v1.1 guidelines, PR and CR do not need to be confirmed following initial response documentation., 20 months|Disease control rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or subjects with stable disease (SD) as per investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., 20 months|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time from first documented response of CR or PR to date of first documented progression or death due to any cause, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 20 months|Intracranial Progression Free Survival, Intracranial Progression Free Survival is defined as confirmed by investigator with morphologically proven intracranial PD \[presence of at least one key symptom in combination with radiologic evidence including CT or MRI of PD in the brain on follow-up or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., 20 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of death for any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored at the last date the subject is known to be alive., 48 months
The brain is a common site of metastases among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The incidence of CNS metastases in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC is 24% at first diagnosis almost doubles over the course of the disease. Several data has shown treatment with first generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can reduce the risk of progression in the CNS, compared with chemotherapy or WBRT.Pre-clinical data showing that brain homogenate dacomitinib concentrations is similar to plasma in mice. While, there are evidence show that dacomitinib have efficacy in NSCLC patients with BM. This phase II study was designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dacomitinib in NSCLC patients with BM.
