Phase II Trial to Compare the Safety of Two Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab Regimens as Adjuvant Therapy for HER2-positive Breast Cancer (Study P05048)
The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of cardiac dysfunction in subjects with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer treated with either doxorubicin or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), both in combination with trastuzumab.
Breast Neoplasm
DRUG: doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, trastuzumab|DRUG: PLD, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab, paclitaxel
Number of Participants Who Experienced Cardiac Events (Level 1 or 2), or Inability to Administer Trastuzumab Either During the 8 Cycles of Chemotherapy or According to Package Insert for a Total Duration of 1 Year, Cardiac events defined as:

Level 1: Cardiac death due to heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction or arrhythmia, or probable cardiac death defined as sudden, unexpected death within 24 hours of a definite or probable cardiac event, or severe symptomatic HF, concomitant with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) drop of \>10 percentage points from baseline and to ≤50% LVEF

Level 2: Asymptomatic systolic dysfunction or mildly symptomatic HF concomitant with an LVEF drop of \>10 percentage points from baseline and to \<50% LVEF; the LVEF drop was to have been confirmed within 3-4 weeks., 8 cycles of chemotherapy and subsequently one year of planned trastuzumab treatment

Level 2: Asymptomatic systolic dysfunction or mildly symptomatic HF concomitant with an LVEF drop of \>10 percentage points from baseline and to \<50% LVEF; the LVEF drop was to have been confirmed within 3-4 weeks., During 1 year of trastuzumab therapy|Number of Participants Who Survived Without Relapse, Relapse-free survival would have been determined by Kaplan-Meier method.

This was not calculated, since the 2 year follow-up was curtailed., Approximately 2 years
