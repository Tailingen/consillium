Clinical Feasibility of Microwave Ablation Using Two Channel Microwave Generator and Two Antennas for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To compare safety and efficacy of microwave ablation with simultaneous ablation using two antennas versus overlapping ablation with single antenna for small hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Microwave ablation
Technical success, Evaluate technical success defined as complete ablation of the index tumor with safety margin, equal or larger than 5 mm on immediate CT., Immediately after ablation|Technique efficacy, Evaluate technical success defined as complete ablation of the index tumor on 1 month follow-up CT., 1 month after ablation
To compare safety and efficacy of microwave ablation with simultaneous ablation using two antennas versus overlapping ablation with single antenna for small hepatocellular carcinoma
