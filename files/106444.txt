Effects of Tirzepatide on Blood, Imaging and Breast Tissue Biomarkers
Evaluation of biomarkers for risk of developing breast cancer in women with obesity who are using tirzepatide to achieve weight loss.
Obesity|Breast Cancer Risk
DRUG: tirzepatide
Feasibility of design as assessed by accrual rate of 1 or more per month over 12 months, Accrual defined as signed consent and ompleting baseline proceedures, 12 months|Completion rate of 70% or more, Completion of procedures for biomarker assessment after 3-6 months of tirzeptide, 6 months
Change in mammographic fibroglandular volume, as measured by Volpara software baseline and 6 months, 6 months|Change in benign breast tissue proliferation, Difference in baseline and off study Ki-67 in women with baseline Ki-67 of 1 % or higher, 3-6 months|Change in benign breast tissue estrogen response and ELF5 gene expression, Difference in baseline and off study mRNA, 3-6 months|Assessment of GIP-R expression in breast tissue, GIP- R mRNA and protein, 3-6 months|Change in selected adipokines, cytokines, hormones, IGF-1, alpha klotho, change in blood levels with assays primarily by ELISA, 3-6 months
Women who are scheduled to take tirzepatide for weight loss will be assessed before and after taking drug for change in risk biomarkers. These include mammography, DXA scan, blood draw, and random periareolar fine needle aspiration (RPFNA) for acquisition of benign breast tissue.
