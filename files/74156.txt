Photodynamic Therapy With LUZ11 in Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
This study will investigate the tolerability, recommended dose and pharmacokinetics of LUZ11 following photodynamic therapy (PDT) of patients with advanced head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer

Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Up to 21 days following each dose-finding PDT session, and up to 13 weeks following final PDT session
Depth of Tumor Necrosis Assessed by Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Gadolinium as a Measure of Anti-Tumor Efficacy, Up to 21 days after each dose-finding PDT session, and up to 13 weeks after final PDT session
LUZ11 Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC), Elimination Half-Life (TÂ½), Volume of Distribution (Vd) and Clearance (CL), Prior to dose, immediately after dose, and at 0.08, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose
LUZ11 is a new photosensitizer for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of solid tumors, such as head and neck cancer. PDT with LUZ11 involves the intravenous administration of LUZ11 followed by irradiation of the target tumor with laser light of an appropriate wavelength. The light causes the drug to react with oxygen, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) locally and induces tumor cells death and damages the blood vessels of the tumor thus preventing it from receiving nutrients.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability of LUZ11 following single ascending doses of LUZ11. The secondary objectives of this study are to explore the LUZ11 dose that has anti-tumor effect following photoactivation and to determine LUZ11 pharmacokinetics.
