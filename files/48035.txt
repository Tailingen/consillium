Magnetic Resonance Study of Liver in Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to see whether magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can detect changes caused by chemotherapy in the livers of patients who have been treated for colorectal cancer. Some patients who undergo chemotherapy for colorectal cancer may experience side-effects in their livers. These side effects may influence further treatment options. If this study finds that MR techniques detect changes in the liver due to chemotherapy, then MR methods may eventually be used to help patients and physicians plan further treatment.

To determine whether magnetic resonance techniques can detect changes in normal liver morphology and metabolism caused by chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer., 2 years
Each patient will have 4 MR exams: prior to or within one week of the start of the chemotherapy regimen, one after 6 weeks of chemotherapy, a third after completion of chemotherapy (between 12 and 24 weeks post-initiation of chemotherapy) and a long term followup study at least 4 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Normal volunteers will be recruited and studied by MR for comparison to patient data.
