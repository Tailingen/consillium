A Study Comparing Nivolumab, Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab and Placebo in Participants With Localized Kidney Cancer Who Underwent Surgery to Remove Part of a Kidney
The purpose of this study is to determine whether nivolmab alone or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus placebo, is safe and effective for delaying or preventing recurrence of cancer in participants who have experienced partial or entire removal of a kidney.

Disease-Free Survival (DFS) by BICR - Treatment Part A and B, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization to development of local disease recurrence (ie, recurrence of primary tumor in situ or occurrence of a secondary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) primary cancer), distance metastasis, or death, whichever came first per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomization to development of local disease recurrence, distance metastasis, or death, whichever came first (up to approximately 72 months)
Overall Survival (OS) - Treatment Part A and B, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the participants was known to be alive.
