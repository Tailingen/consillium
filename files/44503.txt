Effect of a Tracking Program on Colon Adenoma Surveillance and Adherence to Guideline Recommendations
This will be a retrospective chart review of 880-1000 patients who had a colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular adenoma between the years of 2004-2008. We will compare the rate and timing of completion of repeat colonoscopies pre and post establishment of a polyp registry (tracking system) in 2006. Each group will be composed of up to 500 subjects consecutively identified from all the patients who underwent colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular adenoma (Group 1-2004 to 2006, Group 2 2007-2008).

This will be a retrospective chart review of 880-1000 patients who had a colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular adenoma between the years of 2004-2008. We will compare the rate and timing of completion of repeat colonoscopies pre and post establishment of a polyp registry (tracking system) in 2006. Each group will be composed of 380-500 subjects consecutively identified from all the patients who underwent colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular adenoma (Group 1-2004 to 2006, Group 2 2007-2008).
