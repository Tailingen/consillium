This phase II trial is studying the antitumor activity of single agent pemetrexed 900mg/m2 IV over 10 minutes in patients with recurrent cervical cancer.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Uterine Neoplasms|Genital Neoplasms, Female
DRUG: Pemetrexed
Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that defines when participants improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable"), or worsen ("progression") during treatment., baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 5 years)
Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., time of initial response until documented tumor progression (up to 5 years)|Progression-Free Survival, The period from study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact., baseline until documented tumor progression (up to 5 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death. For patients who are alive, overall survival is censored at the last contact., baseline until death from any cause (up to 5 years)
