Biomarker Expression in Samples From Young Patients With Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. it may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarker expression in tissue samples from young patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Expression of immunoregulatory proteins including CD4, FOXP3 and CD276 in ALCL|Correlation of CD4, FOXP3, and CD276 with ALK autoantibody response in patients enrolled in ANHL0131
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the expression of immunoregulatory proteins including CD4, FOXP3 and CD276 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).
* To correlate the expression of these proteins with the levels of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) autoantibodies in patient of ANHL0131.

OUTLINE: Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed by mass spectrometry and validated by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and IHC.
