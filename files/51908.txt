AdvanTIG-202: Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) Combined With or Without Anti-TIGIT Monoclonal Antibody Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) in Participants With Previously Treated Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This study tested how well and how safely the drug tislelizumab, given either alone or with another drug called ociperlimab (BGB-A1217), worked in people with cervical cancer that had come back or spread after previous treatments. The study included two groups and took place at multiple medical centers.

The scales include Symptom Experience (11 items), Body Image (3 items) and Sexual/vaginal Functioning (4 items). The single symptom items include Lymphedema, Peripheral Neuropathy, Menopausal Symptoms, Sexual Worry, Sexual Activity and Sexual Enjoyment. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. The Index score is calculated as the average of the 3 symptom scales and 6 single item scores. Lower scores indicate better HRQoL., Baseline to Cycles 3 and 5 ( Each cycle was 21 days)|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study drugs, whether considered related to study drugs or not.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:

* Resulted in death
* Was life-threatening
* Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
* Resulted in disability/incapacity
* Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect
* Was considered a significant medical AE by the investigator based on medical judgement (eg, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)., From the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose; maximum treatment exposure was 23.5 months.|Serum Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) Concentrations at Specified Timepoints, The timepoints are defined as predose (within 60 minutes before starting infusion) and postdose (within 30 minutes after the end of infusion)., Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9, and 17 (each cycle was 21 days)|Serum Tislelizumab Concentrations at Specified Timepoints, The timepoints are defined as predose (within 60 minutes before starting infusion) and postdose (within 30 minutes after the end of infusion)., Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9, and 17 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants Who Developed Positive Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Ociperlimab, Number and percentage of participants who developed detectable ADAs to ociperlimab during the treatment period., Samples for ADA analysis were collected predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9 and 17, and at the Safety Follow-up Visit (30 days after last dose) up to the immunogenicity data cut-off date of June 1, 2023 (approximately 21 months).|Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Tislelizumab, Number and percentage of participants who developed detectable ADAs during the treatment period., Samples for ADA analysis were collected predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9 and 17, and at the Safety Follow-up Visit (30 days after last dose), up to the immunogenicity data cut-off date of June 1, 2023 (approximately 21 months).
