The prospective registration of completely resected high-risk stage III melanoma patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the adjuvant setting will be based on collaboration with centers of excellence on melanoma patients treatment. Pre-identified centers (up to 12) considered as the most advanced according to their knowledge and experience, will take part in the patients recruitment.
