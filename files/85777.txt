A Study to Determine Whether Perioperative Energy Dynamics Correlates With Postoperative Outcomes
To validate a new method for assessing perioperative risk in the cancer patient undergoing major cancer surgery.

In this proposed study researchers will:

1. Measure preoperative energy reserve capacity (fitness)
2. Determine if postoperative morbidity is a function of perioperative cardiopulmonary gas exchange metabolism
Abdominal Cancer|Pelvic Cancer
OTHER: Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)
Patient Perioperative Risk, Measure preoperative energy reserve capacity (fitness) using perioperative energy dynamics where fitness is defined by gas exchange data during cardiopulmonary exercise testing as method of assessing perioperative risk, Baseline + 30 days postoperatively monitoring for morbid events
Primary Objective:

• To characterize the effects of neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or immunotherapy) on functional capacity in esophageal and lung cancer participants as measured by gas exchange parameters (%predicted AT, %predicted P-VO2, VO2 at AT \& peak exercise, oxygen pulse, ΔVO2/ΔWR, ΔVE/ΔVCO2) obtained from CPET before and after neoadjuvant therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

• To characterize changes in CPET measures in participants treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or immunotherapy followed by surgery and correlate these changes with postoperative outcome.
