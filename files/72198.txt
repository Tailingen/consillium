Early Screening of Colorectal Cancer Based on Plasma Multi-omics Combining With Artificial Intelligence
To evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of a novel screening method based on plasma multi-omics combining with artificial intelligence in a large prospective cohort for the detection of colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas.

Lesions will be confirmed as malignancy or precancerous by pathological biopsy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Specificity, Specificity (for colorectal cancer and\\or advanced precancerous neoplasm) of this plasm-based multi-omics test.

Minimally invasive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood of patients with colorectal malignancies via liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising biomarker. This is urgently needed, as conventional imaging and plasma protein-derived biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity.The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of a novel screening method based on plasma multi-omics combining with artificial intelligence in five hospitals around China for the detection of colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas.
