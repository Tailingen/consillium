A Study of REGN2810 and Ipilimumab in Patients With Lung Cancer
The primary objective of the study is to compare the objective response rate (ORR) of high dose cemiplimab (HDREGN2810) and standard dose cemiplimab plus ipilimumab combination therapy (SDREGN2810/ipi) to the ORR of standard dose cemiplimab (SDREGN2810) in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in patients whose tumors express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in \<50% of tumor cells.
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: SDREGN2810|DRUG: SDREGN2810/ipi|DRUG: HDREGN2810
Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants Whose Tumors Express Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in <50% of Tumor Cells, ORR was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of participants in the efficacy analysis set. BOR was defined as the best response recorded, as determined by a blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) between the date of randomization and the date of the first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (Any pathological lymph nodes \[whether target or non-target\] must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm \[\<1 cm\]). PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of randomization up to 41 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of participants in the efficacy analysis set. BOR was defined as the best response recorded, as determined by a blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) between the date of randomization and the date of the first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (Any pathological lymph nodes \[whether target or non-target\] must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm \[\<1 cm\]). PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From date of randomization up to 41 months|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Tumor PD-L1 Expression Levels <50% of Tumor Cells, OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. A participant who lost to follow-up was censored at the last date that the participant was known to be alive. OS was measured using Kaplan-Meier method., Time from randomization to the date of death (up to 41 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Participants With Tumor PD-L1 Expression Levels <50% of Tumor Cells, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by the IRC (based on RECIST 1.1 assessments) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier method., Time from randomization up to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death (up to 41 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, and TEAEs Resulting in Death, Adverse event (AE): any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Serious AE: an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAE: AE with onset after start of treatment or with onset date before the treatment start date but worsening after the treatment start date. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs. Number of participants with TEAEs, Serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to death were reported., Up to 41 months|Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities of Grade 2 or Higher Severity Based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Grading System, The laboratory measurements included hematology, chemistry, electrolytes and liver function. NCI-CTCAE was graded according to the following scale: Grade 1 (Mild): Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; Grade 2 (Moderate): Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Grade 3 (Severe): Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 (Death): Death related to AE., Up to 41 months
