Exercise Prehabilitation in Patients With Head and Neck Squamous-cell Carcinoma: The FIT4TREAT Trial
The main purpose of this randomized-controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of prehabilitation based on exercise training (ET) on functional capacity in HNC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Forty-six participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into prehabilitation and usual care groups. The length of intervention will be at least 2 weeks. Data will be collected at diagnosis, immediately before anti-cancer treatment start and 4 weeks following CRT. Primary outcome is functional capacity as assessed by the six-minute walk test. Additional measures include muscle strength, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, inflammatory biomarkers, body composition, quality of life, treatment tolerance, compliance to treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

This is a patient-reported questionnaire composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and 6 single items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., Change from Baseline (at diagnosis) to 1-3 days before the beginning of radiotherapy|Health-related Quality of Life, Assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).
