Study of Intratumoral CV8102 in cMEL, cSCC, hnSCC, and ACC
This study evaluates intratumoral administration of CV8102 in patients with advanced melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Patients will receive CV8102 as single agent or in combination with SoC anti-PD-1 therapy.
