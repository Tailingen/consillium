Phase 1/2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Rociletinib in Combination With Trametinib in Patients With mEGFR-positive Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor effect of rociletinib when administered in combination with trametinib.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Rociletinib|DRUG: Trametinib

Duration of Response (DR) According to RECIST Version 1.1, DR according to RECIST Version 1.1 as determined by Investigator assessment, Every 6 weeks until disease progression, up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) According to RECIST Version 1.1, DCR according to RECIST Version 1.1 as determined by Investigator assessment, Every 6 weeks until disease progression, up to approximately 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST Version 1.1, PFS according to RECIST Version 1.1 as determined by Investigator assessment, Every 6 weeks until disease progression, up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Every 12 weeks until date of death, up to approximately 60 months|Longitudinal changes in blood based biomarkers (i.e. mutations in EGFR) in ctDNA, Biomarker samples will be collected from each subject approximately every 3 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Cmax of rociletinib metabolites at steady state, Cycle 2 Day 1 to Day 2|Tmax of rociletinib metabolites at steady state, Cycle 2 Day 1 to Day 2|AUC of rociletinib metabolites at steady state, Cycle 2 Day 1 to Day 2|Cmin of rociletinib metabolites at steady state, Cycle 2 Day 1 to Day 2
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, non randomized, multicenter study evaluating the safety and efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with trametinib.

This study will be conducted in 2 phases:

Phase 1: This will be the dose escalation phase of the study. Phase 1 will determine the MAD or MTD and RP2D of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib, and evaluate its safety and tolerability and PK profile in EGFRm NSCLC patients who have failed at least one prior EGFR TKI.

Phase 2: This will be the dose expansion phase. Phase 2 will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and pharmacodynamics of the combination of rociletinib and trametinib at the RP2D in two subsets of EGFRm NSCLC patients.
