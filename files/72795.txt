LY3214996 in Patients With AML Who Are Not Candidates for Standard Therapy
This research study is evaluating a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that has returned or not responded to standard treatment.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: LY3214996
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Toxicities occurring following administration of protocol therapy, measured using CTCAE 5.0 criteria., 21 days
Overall Response Rate, Rate of complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and partial remission (PR) using IWG and ELN criteria., 6 months
This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any disease.

LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are testing to see if LY3214996 is a safe treatment for AML that has returned or not responded to standard treatment. Several doses of the study drug will be explored in this study.
