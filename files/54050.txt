Comparison of Chemoradiotherapy and Chemoradiotherapy Combined With Consolidation Chemotherapy for ESCC
This study is a phase III, multicenter, prospective randomized controlled clinical study comparing the efficacy of non-surgical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with radical chemoradiotherapy and radical chemoradiotherapy combined with consolidation chemotherapy. The survival time and side effects of patients were observed and compared.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Chemotherapy Effect|Side Effect of Drug
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Consolidation chemotherapy (4 courses)|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Concurrent chemotherapy (2 courses)
3-years overall survival (OS), Overall survival was measured from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of the last follow-up or death., up to 3 years|5-years overall survival (OS), Overall survival was measured from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of the last follow-up or death., up to 5 years
3-year progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS was calculated from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of disease progression or death., up to 3 years|Objective response rate (ORR) Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of a predefined amount, including complete remission and partial remission, through study completion, an average of 36 month|5-year progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS was calculated from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of disease progression or death., up to 5 years
Test grouping:

Group A: radical chemoradiotherapy group; Group B: radical chemoradiotherapy combined with consolidation chemotherapy group;

Specific chemotherapy regimens:

Concurrent chemotherapy (2 courses): Lipusu (T) + Cisplatin (DDP) scheme: T 135mg/m2 ivgtt, d1, 3week\*2cycles; DDP 75mg/m2 ivgtt, d2, 3week\*2cycles; Consolidation chemotherapy (4 courses): After the concurrent chemoradiotherapy is over, after 2-3 weeks of rest, the patients in the consolidation chemotherapy group will be given 4 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, and the chemotherapy regimen is the same as the concurrent chemotherapy regimen; Radiotherapy scheme: intensity modulated radiotherapy PTV50-54Gy, PGTV 56-60Gy, conventional fractionation.

Primary efficacy endpoints: 3-year overall survival (OS), 5-year overall survival (OS) Secondary efficacy endpoints: 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), toxic and side effects, and patient quality of life
