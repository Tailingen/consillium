RADIATION: Partial breast re-irradiation
Treatment related toxicity, determine the toxicity of partial breast re-irradiation (PBrI) as rate of grade â‰¥ 3 treatment-related skin, fibrosis, and breast pain Adverse Events, accordin to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE) up to 1 year from completion of radiation treatment, 12 months
in-breast recurrence in the ipsilateral breast, In-breast recurrence is defined histologic evidence of recurrent carcinoma, invasive or noninvasive (excluding lobular carcinoma in situ), in the ipsilateral breast, 5 years|Number of patients free from mastectomy over total number of patients, Freedom from mastectomy is calculated from mastectomy failure rates. Failure is a mastectomy of the treated breast performed for any reason, 5 years|To evaluate distant-metastasis free survival, Distant metastasis-free survival is defined as time from registration to the appearance of a distant metastasis confirmed radiographically and/or pathologically or death from any cause, 5 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as time from registration to date of death or last follow-up, 5 years|Patient satisfaction, Patients satisfaction is assessed with the Breast-Q questionnaire (from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores reflect a better outcome), 5 years
Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women worldwide. Although advances in treatment have led to an overall reduction in breast cancer mortality, survivors continue to have an ongoing risk of disease recurrence. For women who experience breast recurrence, mastectomy has historically been the only treatment approach offered. However, it has been associated with negative health outcomes, including reduced quality of life, depression and anxiety, and impaired sexual functioning. As a result, there is increasing interest to identify treatment options that include breast preservation. Breast-conserving surgery followed by re-irradiation with partial breast irradiation has recently been found to be a safe alternative to mastectomy for women who have undergone prior whole breast radiation.
