Evaluation of Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Specific Mode Electroacupuncture Stimulation for Paclitaxel Across BBB Delivery in Patients With Postoperative Recurrence of Malignant Glioma: A Single-arm Trial
Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors, with the main treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, gliomas are highly prone to recurrence, posing significant treatment challenges, especially for high-grade gliomas, which have a 5-year survival rate of only 5.5%. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a common chemotherapeutic agent, and its in vitro antitumor efficacy is 1400 times stronger than that of temozolomide (the first-line chemotherapy drug for gliomas). However, due to its large molecular weight (approximately 893 Da), it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), preventing its use as a first-line treatment for gliomas. Preliminary research by our team has demonstrated that Specific Mode Electroacupuncture Stimulation (SMES) can open the BBB, increasing the concentration of PTX in tumor tissues, peritumoral tissues, and surrounding invasive tissues, thereby exerting antitumor effects. Therefore, this study aims to preliminarily observe the safety and efficacy of SMES combined with PTX in treating patients with postoperative recurrent high-grade gliomas.

4-month progression-free survival rate, Comprehensive neurological examinations and MRI scans were performed at baseline to establish the initial disease status. These assessments were repeated at specified post-treatment time points (weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18) to evaluate changes compared to baseline. Responses, including complete response , partial response, stable disease , and progressive disease, were assessed according to the specific criteria outlined in the RANO 2.0 guidelines.Finally, the proportion of subjects in the intent-to-treat population with progression-free survival exceeding 4 months was calculated., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30, The questionnaire consists of 30 items and covers multiple dimensions, such as physical function, role function, emotional function, social function, quality of life, fatigue, pain, and other cancer-related symptoms., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.|The Neurological Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (NANO), NANO Scale quantitatively assesses nine neurological functions in patients, including gait, muscle strength, sensation, visual fields, facial strength, speech, cognition, and limb coordination, with each category scored between 0 to 3 or 0 to 2., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.|Overall survival(OS), The time from enrollment to death for any reason (for lost-to-follow-up patients, the time of the last follow-up; for patients still alive at the end of the study, the time of the last follow-up)., On the last day of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 during the treatment period; and then monthly during the follow-up phase for a total of 12 times.|Disease control rate, Disease control rate refers to the proportion of patients in the intent-to-treat population who achieved complete response , partial response , or stable disease , as assessed by the RANO 2.0 criteria., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.|Objective response rate, Objective response rate refers to the proportion of patients in the intent-to-treat population who achieved complete response or partial response , as assessed per the RANO 2.0 criteria., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time interval from the initiation of SMES combined with ABX treatment until the first occurrence of any of the following events: radiographic disease progression as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) version 2.0 criteria, the development of intolerable treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, or death due to any cause., On the last day of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 during the treatment period; and then monthly during the follow-up phase for a total of 12 times.|Duration of response, Duration of response was defined as the time interval between the first administration of SMES plus ABX therapy and the occurrence of disease progression., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18|Duration of Disease Control, Duration of Disease Control was defined as the time interval from when a patient first achieved disease control (complete response , partial response , or stable disease until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., baseline and 1-2 days before the end of weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18|Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, Adverse reactions were recorded from the time of informed consent signing through the final visit, including any emerging symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities. Common adverse reactions may include skin discomfort, pruritus, pain, etc., with severity graded into 5 levels., On the 7th, 14th and 21st days of the 1st to 6th treatment cycles, each treatment cycle lasts for 21 days.
