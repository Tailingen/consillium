ImmunoTEP for Patients With Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.
The aim of this study is to optimize pretargeting parameters using pharmacokinetic and imaging data for immuno-PET using anti-CEA x anti-HSG TF2 BsMAb and 150 MBq of 68Ga-IMP-288 peptide in MTC patients with abnormal Ct serum level after initial complete surgery and at least one abnormal lesion
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: • TF2 and 68 Ga-IMP-288
Evaluation of the tumor targeting (No Unit) and signal/noise (No Unit)ratio by immunoTEP with TF2 and 68-Ga-IMP-288, Decrease of TF2 and IMP- 288 molar doses and variation of pretargeting interval will be performed in 4 to 5 cohorts of 3 patients, receiving 120 to 30 nmol of TF2 and 6 à 1.5 nmol of peptides 1 to 3 days apart.

A last cohort (number 5 or 6) with optimal conditions will be proposed Blood samples will be obtained after TF2 and 68Ga-IMP-288 injections. Whole-body PET images will be recorded 60 to 120 minutes after 68Ga-IMP-288 injection to assess semiquantitatively tumor targeting and tumor/background ratio., one week
Sensibilité, 6 monts after immunoTEP
tolerance, 6 monts after immunoTEP|a second _iTEP if necessary for the follow up of a lesion, with in the follow up of the pateint, 6 monts after immunoTEP
Variation of TF2 molar dose, IMP-288 molar dose and pretargeting interval will be performed in 4 to 5 cohorts of 3 patients, receiving 30 to 120 nmol of TF2 and 1.5 to 6 nmol of peptides 1 to 3 days apart. Blood samples will be obtained after TF2 and 68Ga-IMP-288 injections.

A last cohort (cohorte number 5 or 6) with optimal conditions will be proposed. Whole-body PET images will be recorded 60 and 120 minutes after 68Ga-IMP-288 injection to assess semi-quantitatively tumor targeting and tumor/background ratio. Moreover, the targeting sensitivity of the TF2-pretargeted 68Ga-IMP-288 will be compared to standard methods of tumor.

some patient will have a second immuno-TEP for their follow up in the first examen was the most sensible.
