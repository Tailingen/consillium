Hair Isotope Analysis for Early Cancer Detection
Cancer is a major health challenge, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Research has shown that cancer can alter the way the body processes nutrients. This study aims to explore whether these metabolic changes can be detected through a simple, non-invasive method: analysing hair. Hair grows slowly over time, potentially capturing subtle metabolic changes that occur during cancer development. By studying the nitrogen stable isotope composition in hair samples donated by individuals diagnosed with cancer, we aim to identify potential early markers of the disease. Participants will be asked to donate a small strand of hair, which will be analysed using a laboratory technique called Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). The findings from this study could contribute to new, non-invasive screening tools for early cancer detection.
