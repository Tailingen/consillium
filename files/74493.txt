Ketogenic Diet Adjunctive to HD-MTX Chemotherapy for Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
Ketogenic diet has shown auxiliary effect on treatment of malignant tumors require high glucose consumption. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketogenic diet adjunctive to high dose methotrexate(HD-MTX) chemotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).

In a pilot study of primary central nervous system(CNS) lymphoma patients, ketogenic diet was given in adjunction with standard HD-MTX chemotherapy as interventional group; standard HD-MTX is given with routine diet as control group. The primary endpoint is the safety of ketogenic diet in PCNSL patients receiving chemotherapy, secondary endpoints include rate of complete remission, remission time, rate of tumor relapse and overall survival.
