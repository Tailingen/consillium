A Study of Immunotherapy Combined With Neoadjuvant Therapy Versus Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer
This is a randomized, open label Phase II neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of traditional herbal medicine for cancer immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy versus neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.
Stage II-III Breast Cancer
DRUG: cytotoxic chemotherapy (docetaxel or epirubicin or cyclophosphamide or carboplatin)|DRUG: anti-Her2 monoclonal antibody (Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab)|DRUG: traditional herbal medicine
Total pathological complete response rate (tpCR), The disappearance of all invasive tumours in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, One month after surgery
Global health status and functioning subscales, Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30; version 3)., One month after surgery|Cancer-related fatigue scores, Piper Fatigue Scale will be used to measure cancer-related fatigue. The scale scores were measuredï¼šat baseline, at the end of cycles 2 and 4, and before surgery. Each score represents the degree of fatigue: a score of 0 means none, 1-3 means mild, 4-6 means moderate, 7-10 means severe., One month after surgery|Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), For adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), refer to NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard., Period of neoadjuvant therapy (treatment 1-6 months)|Disease free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival (DFS) is the time from the day of enrollment to the first occurrence of recurrent disease, including second primary malignancies in the non-breast area and breast ductal carcinoma in situ., 5 years|Five-year overall survival (OS), Five-year overall survival (OS) is the time from the random date to death due to any cause., 5 years|Expression of immune cells, Expression of immune cells (T cell, B cell, NK cell ), One month after surgery|Expression of cytokines (IL, INF-r, TNF-a), Expression of cytokines (IL, INF-r, TNF-a), One month after surgery
This is a randomized, open label Phase II neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of traditional herbal medicine for cancer immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy versus neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms: arm 1, combination of traditional herbal medicine for cancer immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy for 6 or 8 cycles; arm 2, neoadjuvant therapy 6 or 8 cycles. Patients will undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles.
