Systematic Oral Education for Prevention of Oral-related Complications Caused by Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
A study on the efficacy of systematic oral health education for the prevention of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors
Malignant Tumor of Head And/or Neck|Radiotherapy; Complications
OTHER: Systematic oral health education|OTHER: Routine oral health education
Oral mucositis, Oral mucositis is assessed by trained physicians according to World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity Scale(grade 1-5); Higher grade indicates more severe symptoms, 1 week before radiotherapy; weekly during radiotherapy(until 7 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy
Xerostomia, Patients self-evaluated xerostomia according to Xerostomia questionnaire(score 0-100);Higher score indicates more severe symptoms, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Dysphagia, Dysphagia is assessed by M.D.Anderson Dysphagia Inventory(score 20-100);Lower score indicates more severe symptoms, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Quality of Life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of Life is assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30(European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire);transformed into 0-100 scales for different domains and symptoms;Higher domain scores represent better quality of life, while higher symptom scores represent worse quality of life, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Quality of Life assessed by QLQ-H&N35, Quality of Life is assessed by QLQ-H\&N35(Head and neck cancer-related quality of life scale);transformed into 0-100 scales for different domains and symptoms;Higher scores represent worse quality of life, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Number of teeth, Number of teeth is assessed by trained physicians, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Periodontal pocket depth, Periodontal pocket depth is assessed by trained physicians using standardized periodontal probes, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Bleeding on probing, Bleeding on probing is assessed by trained physicians using standardized periodontal probes, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Plaque, Plaque is assessed by trained physicians according to Turesky-Modified Quigley-Hein Plaque Index; higher scores represent more plaque, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Adverse effects, Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 version(grade 1-5);Higher grade indicates more severe symptoms, up to 12 months|Changes of oral flora, The changes of oral flora in patients' salivary or oral swab measured by 16s rDNA technique, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the middle of radiotherapy(3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy); at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the end of radiotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy of systematic oral health education for oral-related complications in patients with head and neck malignant tumors who receive radiotherapy. The main question it aims to answer is:

the efficacy of systematic oral health education for the prevention oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors

Participants will:

be given systematic oral health education or routine oral health education be evaluated to learn the efficacy of systematic oral health education for the prevention of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors Researchers will compare systematic oral health education group with routine oral health education group to see if systematic oral health education has good efficacy for the prevention of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors.
