FOLFOX Via HAI Plus Intravenous Irinotecan With or Without Bevacizumab Versus Systemic FOLFOXIRI With or Without Bevacizumab in Initially Unresectable RAS-mutated CRLM Patients
This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study aims to evaluate the objective remission rate of FOLFOX hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAI) in combination with systemic irinotecan with or without bevacizumab versus systemic intravenous FOLFOXIRI with or without bevacizumab in initially unresectable RAS-mutated colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

The goal of this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the objective remission rate (ORR) of FOLFOX hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAI) in combination with irinotecan with or without bevacizumab systemic intravenous chemotherapy versus systemic intravenous FOLFOXIRI with or without bevacizumab in initially unresectable RAS-mutated colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

To assess and compare the depth of response (DpR), R0 surgical resection rate, No evidence of disease (NED) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) in resectable patients and safety (chemotherapy-related adverse events, catheterization-related adverse events, surgical complications, etc.) between the two intervention groups.

OUTLINE:

Patients in the HAI group receive FOLFOX via hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy plus intravenous irinotecan with or without bevacizumab every 14 days, while patients in the systemic group receive intravenous FOLFOXIRI regimen with or without bevacizumab every 14 days. Patients will receive a maximum of 12 cycles in total (before and after surgery) unless there is disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if the patient withdraws from the study.
