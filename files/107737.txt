RE-sensitizing With Supraphysiologic Testosterone to Overcome REsistance (The RESTORE Study)
Single-arm, single site, open label study of the effects of parenteral testosterone followed by enzalutamide, abiraterone or castration-only therapy in men with metastatic CRPC who previously progressed on one of these forms of therapy. The study will enroll four cohorts of patients: men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on enzalutamide (Cohort A; n=30); men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on abiraterone acetate (Cohort B; n=30); men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on first line castration-only therapy (Cohort C; n=30); men with metastatic CRPC with inactivating somatic or germline mutations in ≥2 of the genes TP53, PTEN, or RB1 (Cohort D; n=20).

PSA Progression on Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate or Castrate Levels Post-BAT, Time to PSA progression on enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate or return to castrate levels of testosterone post-BAT, defined as the time from the date of re-initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate or castration-only therapy to the date of the PSA measurement when it shows an increase by ≥25% above the nadir value that occurred following re-initiation of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate or castration-only therapy and confirmed by a repeat PSA 4 weeks later (PCWG2)., up to 18 months|PSA Progression on BAT (Bipolar Androgen Therapy ), Time to PSA progression on BAT. Time to PSA progression on BAT is defined as the time from the date of initial dose of Testosterone to the date of the PSA measurement when it shows an ≥25% increase above the nadir value and confirmed by a repeat PSA 4 weeks later (PCWG2 criteria) during the treatment with BAT., up to 18 months|Disease Response as Defined by RECIST 1.1 (Soft Tissue Lesions) and PCWG2 Criteria (Bone Lesions), Number of participants with complete or partial response post-BAT as defined by RECIST 1.1 (for soft tissue lesions) and PCWG2 criteria (for bone disease), or return to castration-only post-BAT., up to 18 months|Initiation of Docetaxel Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of docetaxel chemotherapy, up to 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by FACIT-F Score, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy, Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F) assesses Fatigue with a total score range of 0-52, with a higher score reflecting better QoL., up to 18 months|Safety and Tolerability as Assessed by Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants who experience adverse events, as defined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by RANDSF-36, RAND 36-Item Short Form (RANDSF-36) assesses physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, general health perceptions, and perceived change in health with a total score range of 0-100. The total score from all of the questions answered is divided by the total number of the questions answered yielding a global score from 0-100, with a higher score reflecting a better QoL., up to 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by BPI, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning with scales ranging from 0-10, with a higher score indicating a higher level of pain., up to 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by IIEF, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) is a diagnostic tool for erectile dysfunction, with a total score range of 5-25, with the lowest score indicating a higher degree of dysfunction., up to 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by PANAS, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report measure that is made up of two mood scales, one measuring positive affect and the other measuring negative affect, with a total score range from 10-50 with a higher score on the positive scale indicating greater levels of positive affect and a lower score on the negative scale indicating less of a negative affect., up to 18 months
The trial will enroll up to 110 patients, 30 for each Cohorts A-C and 20 for Cohort D. Eligible patients will continue on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) if not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Patients will also receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was designed to produce rapidly fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic to the near-castrate range (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy \[BAT\]). Assessments for response to testosterone will be made approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of progression, patients will then go on to receive either abiraterone (Cohort B) or enzalutamide (Cohort A), whichever agent they had previously progressed on prior to study enrollment. Patients in Cohort C will remain on LHRH agonist therapy and receive no additional androgen ablative hormonal therapy while those in the mutation-positive Cohort D will receive enzalutamide regardless of prior therapy.
