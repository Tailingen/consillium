A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of YL202 in Patients With BC
This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of YL202 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with TNBC, HR-positive, HER2-zero-expression or HER2-low-expression
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: YL202 should be intravenously infused
ORR assessed according to RECIST v1.1, ORR: defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., By the end of trial date, approximately within 36 months|Determination of the recommended dose of YL202 in the pivotal clinical study, By the end of trial date, approximately within 36 months
