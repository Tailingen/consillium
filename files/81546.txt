Fasting on Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
This study is to see how safe the use of short-term fasting is in breast cancer patients who will receive chemotherapy before undergoing surgery and to examine if the use of short-term fasting will decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and how much a tumor shrinks while receiving chemotherapy.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab
Pathological Response Rate at the Time of Surgery or at the Time of Biopsy, Evaluate pathological complete remission rate at the time of surgery, or partial pathological response rate (defined as residual invasive disease of 1cm) at the time of surgery or at the time of biopsy upon completion of planned chemotherapy., 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)
Fasting on the Toxicity of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapyaccording to the NCI, The effect of short-term fasting on the toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients according to the NCI common toxicity criteria (Version 4.03), 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Pathological Response Rate at the Time of Surgery or Time of Biopsy Upon Completion of Planned Chemotherapy, To evaluate pathological complete remission rate (defined as disappearance of all invasive tumor in the breast; ypT0-is) at the time of surgery, or partial pathological response rate (defined as residual invasive disease of 1cm, ypT1a-b) at the time of surgery or at the time of biopsy upon completion of planned chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer., 4-6 cycles|Insulin Abnormalities, Changes in plasma insulin abnormalities after short-term fasting and chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Biomarker Changes Before and After Chemotherapy, Biomarker changes in breast cancer (biopsy or residual tumor) before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Nutritional Assessment Before and After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, Nutritional status assessment with Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (aPG-SGA) before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Glucose After Fasting and Chemotherapy, To investigate changes in glucose after short-term fasting and chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Changes in Insulin-like Growth Factor-1, To investigate changes in Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) after short-term fasting and chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)|Plasma Blood-based Tumor-related Abnormalities in DNA, To investigate changes in plasma blood-based tumor-related abnormalities in DNA after short-term fasting and chemotherapy, 4-6 cycles (up to 12 weeks)
Patients will fast 24 hours before and 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy which will consist of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks for four cycles followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks for four cycles (dose-dense AC + T) or docetaxel (T) every 3 weeks for four cycles. Trastuzumab (H) and Pertuzumab (P) will be given concurrently with docetaxel for a total of 4 cycles before surgery. For patients who do not achieve pathological complete remission (pCR), adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin (A) plus cyclophosphamide (C) every 3 weeks for four cycles will be given, followed by trastuzumab every 3 weeks to complete 1 year of treatment. For patients with pCR, only trastuzumab every 3 weeks will be given adjuvantly to complete 1 year of treatment (TPH + AC).
