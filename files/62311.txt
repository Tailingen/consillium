Randomized phase 3 trial evaluating niraparib plus dostarlimab vs chemotherapy at physician's choice in the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer patients for which platinum is not an option.

The patients must have received no more than 2 previous chemotherapy lines. Stratification factors will include HRD status, previous treatment with parp and anti PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors, Bevacizumab treatment and PDL1 expression.

Patients will continue to receive niraparib until disease progression (determined using RECIST v.1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first. Patients will continue to receive dostarlimab for a maximum of 2 years, or until disease progression (determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, whichever may come first. Dose interruption and/or reduction may be implemented at any time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient.
