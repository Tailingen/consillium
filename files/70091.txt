Effects of the Use of Probiotics on the Intestinal Microbiota of Patients With Gastric Cancer
The objective of this randomized controlled, prospective clinical study, composed of 5 groups, G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5 is \[Evaluate the intestinal microbiota profile, nutritional, immunological status and inflammatory profile, before and after total or partial removal surgery (gastrectomies) for gastric cancer, in a patient using probiotic supplements.\] The main questions it aims to answer are:

* probiotics are capable of modulating the immune response and microbiota in cancer patients who will undergo surgery
* surgery itself alters the immunological pattern and microbiota of cancer patients Participants will be divided into groups for evaluation and the G1 intervention group will take probiotic capsules.

The researchers will compare groups G1, G2 with G3 (negative control group) to see if there are differences between using probiotics or not, in controlling the immune response and if there are significant changes in their intestinal microbiota. Groups G4 and G5 will also be compared, where in these we will only measure the power of the use of probiotics in reducing surgical complications in the postoperative period.

Modulation of the Immune Response, We will measure (measure the concentration) of inflammatory cytokines through flow cytometry, and then observe whether the intervention interferes negatively or positively in the inflammatory pattern., twelve months|Modulation of the Intestinal Microbiota, The use of probiotics positively interfered in maintaining a change in the pre-surgical microbial profile, in relation to the post-surgical one., twelve months|The use of probiotics can modify the incidence of postoperative complications, During surgery, many inflammatory factors can interfere with the appearance of postoperative complications. We assume that the use of probiotics can beneficially modulate surgical complications., twelve months
Modulation of nutritional parameters with the use of probiotics-weight and height, Nutritional measurements such as weight and height will be combined to obtain BMI and evaluate body mass, as biological markers that can be modulated with the use of probiotics., twelve months|Modulation of nutritional parameters using probiotics-phase angle, Nutritional measurements such as phase angle (a measurement obtained by applying electrical bioimpendance, as a biological marker that can be modulated with the use of probiotics, twelve months
