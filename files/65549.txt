PLAN-A Data- Bio- and Plan- Bank Collection for SCCA in Denmark
The study is a prospective registration of treatment related-, toxicity-, Quality of life- and outcome data from patients treated in Denmark with radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA), as a cooperation within the Danish Anal Cancer Group (DACG).

Substudy one: A prospective biobank is collected with the purpose to identify predictive and prognostic markers for outcome.

Substudy two: MRI scans are performed to investigate the rate of pelvic insufficience fractures at one year post chemoradiotherapy.
Anal Cancer
Complete clinical response, Rate of complete response to primary treatment as defined by clinical and radiological evaluation, 3 years
Early toxicity evaluation by CTCAE, The rate of treatment related adverse events (assessed by CTCAE v.4.0) related to bowel, skin, bladder and bone., 2 weeks after the last day of therapy|Late toxicity evaluation by CTCAE, The rate of treatment related adverse events (assessed by CTCAE v.4.0) related to bowel, skin, bladder and bone., 1 and 3 years post treatment|Quality of life assessed by the EORTC QoL questionaires, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QoL) questionnaire (QLQ) C30 (core).

The EORTC QLQ-CR29 is a tumor-specific health related QoL questionnaire module for CRC (colorectal cancer) patients, which is designed to complement the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.

Patients are asked to indicate their symptoms during the past week(s). Scores can be linearly transformed to provide a score from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning on the functional scales and a higher level of symptoms on the symptom scales., 2 weeks, 1 and 3 years post therapy|Prognostic value of ctDNA, Measurement of circulating tumor DNA (in copies per ML), At time of treatment completion, an average of 30 days, 1 and 3 years post therapy|Incidence of pelvis fractures, Frequency of pelvic insufficience fractures at MRI scans, 1 and 3 years post therapy
