Watch-and-Wait Approach With Dostarlimab in Localized dMMR/MSI-H Gastric Cancer: GERCOR Phase II Study
This phase II study will evaluate dostarlimab with a watch-and-wait approach for patients with localized mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) gastric or oeso-gastric junction adenocarcinoma.

The goal of the study is to determine whether the surgery could be avoided in patients with localized dMMR/MSI-H gastric/OGJ adenocarcinoma with complete response at endoscopy and biopsies free of tumoral cells after treatment with dostarlimab, with a watch-and-wait approaches.
Adenocarcinoma - GEJ|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Dostarlimab
Clinical complete response (cCR), The primary endpoint is the rate of patients who at 1 year from the start of therapy with dostarlimab are alive, were not operated for tumor resection, are free of disease progression (locoregional or metastases), have all biopsies negative, and show endoscopy downstaging stage 3 and 4., From the start of therapy with dostarlimab to 1 year; assessed at 1 year.
Pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological complete response is defined as 100% fibrosis or fibro-inflammation or necrosis or granulomatous reaction within an entire gross lesion without microscopic evidence of carcinoma, and no positive lymph nodes, after examination of the complete macroscopic surgical specimen equivalent to a Becker TRG Grade 1a (complete regression)., up to 5 years; from the date of dostarlimab initiation to the date of surgery|Loco/loco-regional and distant recurrence, Loco/loco-regional recurrence is defined as cancer recurrence within the regional resection area or local anastomotic site.

Distant recurrence is defined as peritoneal recurrence, liver metastasis or metastasis at other extra-abdominal sites as well as nodal metastasis beyond the regional nodes, up to 5 years; from the date of dostarlimab initiation to the date of recurrence|Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival is defined as time from first dose of treatment to surgery for tumoral resection, first progression of disease local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause. Alive patients without event will be censored at the last follow-up., up to 5 years; from the date of dostarlimab initiation to the date of surgery|Time to treatment failure (TTF), Time to treatment failure is defined as the interval between initiating therapy (first dose of dostarlimab) and the earliest of clinical progression, depending on whether the patient had surgery for tumoral resection or no, or death., up to 5 years; from the date of dostarlimab initiation to the date of progression or death|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival is defined only for patient with surgery (partial or complete gastrectomy or oesogastrectomy) as the time between the date of surgery and the date either of recurrence or death from any cause., up to 5 years; from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence or death from any cause|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time between the date of the first dose of study treatment and the death date., up to 5 years; from the date of dostarlimab initiation to the date of death
In patients with localized, resectable gastric or oeso-gastric junction (OGJ) adenocarcinoma radical surgery is the only curative option. Despite the evolution in treatment with multimodality strategies, gastric or OGJ adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal malignancies. When the disease is localized, perioperative chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents is the preferred strategy.

The morbidity rate associated with oesophagogastrectomy/gastrectomy and their negative impact on patients' quality of life and considering the high efficacy of ICIs in patients with localized tumor, one might wonder whether the surgery could be avoided in patients with localized dMMR/MSI-H gastric/OGJ adenocarcinoma

The purpose of this national, multicenter, open-label phase II study is to look at the effects of the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab with a watch-and-wait approach in patients with localized dMMR/MSI gastric or oeso-gastric junction adenocarcinoma and to determine whether patients with complete response at endoscopy and biopsies free of tumoral cells after treatment with dostarlimab, with a watch-and-wait approach can circumvent surgical resection.

The primary objective of the study is the rate of complete clinical response at 1 year.

A total of 59 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study. Patients will be included in participating centers, which will perform treatments.
