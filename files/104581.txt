A Study of KC1036 in Patients with Advanced Thymic Tumors
This is a single armï¼Œopen-label, multicentric, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KC1036 in patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
Thymic Tumors
DRUG: KC1036
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of the first radiologically documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause., approximately 2 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from first documented response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) to the date of first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, among patients with a confirmed PR or CR per RECIST 1.1., approximately 2 year.|Adverse events (AEs), Incidence of treatment-related AEs, approximately of 2 year
Thymus tumor is a relatively rare type of thoracic tumor. Patients with thymus tumor who have failed to receive first-line chemotherapy lack of effective therapeutic drugs and clinical need is urgent. Previous phase I study showed that KC1036 has a good therapeutic effect in patients with advanced thymic tumors, and KC1036 is safe and well tolerated in patients with advanced tumors. This study further explored the efficacy and safety of KC1036 in patients with advanced thymic tumors.

Patients will receive continuous treatment with oral KC1036 60 mg once daily. Each cycle will be considered as 21 days of treatment; safety was assessed every 21 days. Tumor assessement will be done every two cycles. Treatment should be administered until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.
