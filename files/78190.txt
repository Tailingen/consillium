Selection of Surgical Technique in Rectal Cancer
Currently, there is no prediction scale available to identify patients with rectal neoplasms as technically complex in the middle and lower thirds; that is, those who are at high risk of affected circumferential margins and low quality of the mesorectum. The application of a predictive model that allows preoperative identification of the group of patients in whom optimal results in mesorectal quality and circumferential margin are less likely to be obtained through laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery would enable the selection of patients who will require and justify all efforts and healthcare resources to improve surgical outcomes.

Therefore, the investigators aim to create a predictive model to identify these patients, allowing the discrimination of which patients will benefit from different techniques, or even which ones would be opportune to initially consider an open approach.
Rectal Neoplasms
OTHER: Data collection
Suboptimal oncological outcomes, Surgical resection with affected margins (proximal-distal and/or circumferential \< 1mm) and/or incomplete or nearly complete mesorectal resection, 15 postoperative days
Surgical and Postoperative complications, Conversion to open surgery and anastomotic dehiscence rates, 30 postoperative days|Overall and disease free survival, Recurrence of the tumoral disease at the pelvic level and distant recurrence is defined as s the recurrence of the disease in other distant organs., 3-years surgery
