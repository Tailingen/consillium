Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Nilotinib 300mg Twice Daily in Patients With Philadelphia Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) in Chronic Phase Who Are Intolerant to Prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.
The purpose of this Australian study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib 300mg twice daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase who were intolerant but responsive to 1st line treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Eligible patients have been previously treated with imatinib or dasatinib for at least 3 months and are experiencing non-hematologic toxicity whilst having documented responses that meet PBS authority for 1st line treatment of CML without current MR4.5.

Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) Rate: Percentage of Patients Who Have Achieved a 4.5-log Reduction in BCR-ABL Level Within 24 Month, Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a 4.5 -log reduction in Breakpoint cluster region - Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) levels.

Kinetics of Molecular Response: Percentage of Patients With no Response Based on BCR-ABL Over Time After the Switch to Nilotinib, No response corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio \< 0.1% international scale (IS) using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)., Baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96|Kinetics of Molecular Response: Percentage of Patients With MMR Based on BCR-ABL Over Time After the Switch to Nilotinib, MMR corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.1% international scale (IS) using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)., Baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 96|Kinetics of Molecular Response: Percentage of Patients With MR4.0 Based on BCR-ABL Over Time After the Switch to Nilotinib, MR4.0 corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.01% international scale (IS) using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)., Baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96|Kinetics of Molecular Response: Percentage of Patients With MR4.5 Based on BCR-ABL Over Time After the Switch to Nilotinib, MR4.5 corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.0032% international scale (IS) using Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)., Baseline, week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96|Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Time to Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5), Breakpoint cluster region - Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) levels is measured in patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood by the 24 months following the commencement of nilotinib therapy. MR4.5 corresponds to a

BCR-ABL ratio 0.0032% IS using RQ-PCR. The derivation of time to molecular response for patients in the study was measured from the date of first nilotinib use, defined as follows:

Days to MR4.5 = date of assessment where BCR-ABL ratio is 0.0032% IS - date of baseline + 1., 96 weeks (24 months)|Time to Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of baseline visit to the date of earliest progression-defining event: namely progression (or withdrawal due to progression to blast crisis (BC) or accelerated phase (AP) disease), or death from any cause.

Patients who did not progress were censored at earliest of the following:

* the date of the 24-month visit;
* the date of loss to follow-up;
* the date of discontinuation of study treatment for any reason other than progression to BC, or AP disease, or death, 96 weeks (24 months)|Time to Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time from date of baseline visit to the first occurrence of any of the following: Disease progression, treatment failure or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. Patients who did not have an event of interest were censored at earliest of the following:

* the date of the 24-month visit;
* the date of loss to follow-up;
* the date of withdrawal from the study for any reason other than lack of efficacy/progressive disease, tolerance to reduced dose or death, 96 weeks (24 months)|Number of Patients With Events Reported at Baseline That Have Shown an Improvement in Non-hematological AE Severity Compared to Week 12 Visit, The total number of patients that have showed improvement with respect to CTCAE grades at the time of the 12-week visit are reported. Improved is defined as prior to, or at the time of the 12-week visit, the AE has completely resolved., Baseline, week 12 (month 3)|Mean M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML), Quality of life was assessed using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) self-administered questionnaire for adult CML patients. The questionnaire consisted of 13 core questions in part I measuring the severity of symptoms, 6 questions in part 2 assessing the interference of symptoms on daily living. The CML component of the MDASI provided an additional 7 CML-specific symptom items: diarrhea, swelling, rash/skin change, muscle soreness/cramping, bruising/bleeding easily, malaise, and headache. In part I (13 questions) and the CML component (7 questions) each question was scored from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates a symptom is not present and 10 indicate the symptom is "as bad as you can imagine". For part 1 the total score can therefore range from 0 to 130 and for CML 0 to 70. Part 2 is also recorded on a 0 to 10 scale, but 0 now indicates that the symptom "did not interfere" and 10 "interfered completely". The total score can range from 0 to 60., Baseline, week 12, 24, 48, 96
The study was planned to enroll 130 patients to achieve the sample size requirement for a meaning full conclusion. Study got terminated with 20 patients because of slow recruitment. Therefore, due to small sample size, the results cannot be considered clinical significant.
