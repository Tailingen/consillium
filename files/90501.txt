Sintilimab Combined With IBI310 and Surufatinib for the Treatment of G3-NET and NEC (NESSIE)
This is a phase II, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab combined with IBI310 and Surufatinib for the treatment of high-grade advanced-neuroendocrine neoplasm
Neuroendocrine Neoplasm
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: IBI310|DRUG: Surufatinib
Objective response rate (ORR, RECIST 1.1), The incidence of confirmed complete response or partial response, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anticancer therapy(up to approximately 2 years)
Objective response rate (ORR, iRECIST 1.1), The incidence of confirmed complete response or partial response, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anticancer therapy(up to approximately 2 years)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment to disease progression or death of any cause, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anticancer therapy (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of response (DoR), Duration from the first time reported partial response or complete response to the first time of disease progression or death, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, new anti-cancer therapy (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall survival (OS), From the time of enrollment to death caused by any reason, From date of first dose of study drug until death caused by any reason (up to approximately 2 years)|Safety of regimen as measured by incidence of adverse events, From first dose to within 30 days after the last dose, The safety and tolerability of Surufatinib will be evaluated based on adverse events data. Other safety parameters include physical examination, vital signs, laboratory test results|PD-L1, To evaluate the relationship between the efficacy and tumor biomarkers of PD-L1, Up to approximately 2 years
The study population is about 40 patients with high-grade advanced-neuroendocrine neoplasm, who fails or cannot tolerate standard therapies. Surufatinib 250 mg once a day (QD) will be orally administrated, Sintilimab 200mg will be intravenously administered every 3 weeks and IBI310 1mg/kg will be intravenously administered every 6 weeks up to documented disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, participant request, or withdrawal of consent. For Sintilimab, the upper time limit for treatment is 2 years. The primary objective is objective response rate (ORR) of Sintilimab combined with IBI310 and Surufatinib in patients with advanced high-grade advanced-neuroendocrine neoplasm.
