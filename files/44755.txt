Prediction of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Efficacy in Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
This study intends to explore the value of 68Ga-FAPI-04 and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer(LAGC).
Gastric Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT
Prediction for NAC efficacy, Predictive value of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT for LAGC in NAC response assessment., Two weeks after surgery|Standardized uptake value(SUV), SUV of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images for primary gastric cancer., Two weeks after surgery|Target-to-background ratio(TBR), 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG uptake ratio of primary gastric cancer to mediastinum blood pool on PET/CT images., Two weeks after surgery
Diagnostic efficacy for metastatic lymph nodes, The sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV and accuracy of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for metastatic lymph nodes in comparison with those of 18F-FDG PET/CT., Two weeks after surgery|Disease free survival, Disease free survival, 5 years|Overall survival, Overall survival, 5 years
Before the start of NAC, baseline 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans will be scheduled in all enrolled patients. Next, the patients with resectable LAGC will receive NAC treatment, surgery will follow 3\~6 weeks after finishing NAC. Abdomen 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT will be scheduled after one cycle of NAC treatment or before surgery. Imaging response measurements will be compared with the histopathological tumor regression grade (TRG) of the resection specimen as gold standard.
