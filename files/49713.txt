Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia Related to PARP Inhibitors (MyeloRIB)
Although PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have proved effective in treating many cancers, few patients receiving PARPi may experience rare but life-threatening adverse events such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Today, data about MDS/AML are scarce.

The objective was to investigate reports of MDS/AML adverse events related to PARPi, including olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, talazoparib and veliparib using the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French pharmacovigilance databases.
