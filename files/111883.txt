A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of CFT8634 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic SMARCB1-Perturbed Cancers, Including Synovial Sarcoma and SMARCB1-Null Tumors
This is an open-label, non-randomized, first-in-human Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CFT8634 in subjects with synovial sarcoma and SMARCB1-null tumors who: have received prior systemic therapy; have relapsed/refractory tumors; have unresectable or metastatic disease; and are not candidates for available therapies known to confer clinical benefit. The study will characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of CFT8634.

The study was intended to be Phase 1/2 trial but did not advance to Phase 2.
