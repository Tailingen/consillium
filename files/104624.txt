Rate of MRD negativity after ASCT consolidation treatment by NGS, The rate of MRD negativity is determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity (≥10-5 sensitivity level) after ASCT consolidation treatment using ITT principle. For patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before four post ASCT consolidation cycles, the best MRD assessment will be considered. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment., The end of consolidation, average of 12 months

For patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before ASCT, the best MRD assessment will be considered. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment., After ASCT, approximately 8 months.|MRD negativity rate by NGF post induction, The rate of MRD negativity (by NGF) after induction is determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity (≥10-5 sensitivity level) after the specific phase using ITT principle. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment. Patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before MRD evaluation phase, the best MRD assessment will be considered., Approximately 4 months|MRD negativity rate by NGF post induction, The rate of MRD negativity (by NGF) after ASCT is determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity (≥10-5 sensitivity level) after the specific phase using ITT principle. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment. Patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before MRD evaluation phase, the best MRD assessment will be considered., Approximately 8 months|MRD negativity rate by NGF post consolidation, The rate of MRD negativity (by NGF) after consolidation is determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity (≥10-5 sensitivity level) after the specific phase using ITT principle. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment. Patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before MRD evaluation phase, the best MRD assessment will be considered., Approximately 8 months|MRD negativity rate by NGF post light consolidation, The rate of MRD negativity (by NGF) after light consolidation are determined as the proportion of patients with MRD negativity (≥10-5 sensitivity level) after the specific phase using ITT principle. Patients will be classified as MRD positive if they have only MRD positive test results or do not undergo MRD assessment. Patients who withdraw from the study or are lost to follow up before MRD evaluation phase, the best MRD assessment will be considered., Approximately 24 months|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the time between first documentation of response (achievement of at least a PR) and PD with deaths owning to causes other than progression not counted, but censored. Responders without disease progression at the cut-off date of final analysis will be censored either at the time of lost to FU, at the time of death due to other cause than PD, or at the at the time of last contact, approximately up to 9 years|Duration of MRD negativity (by NGS and NGF), The duration of MRD Negativity (by NGS and NGF) is defined as time between first MRD Negativity and first MRD positivity. Patients without MRD positivity will be censored at last complete assessment, approximately up to 9 years|Determine the rate of sustained for 1-year MRD negativity (by NGF and NGS) from post ASCT consolidation to post light consolidation, Rate of 1 year sustained MRD negativity by NGS (from post ASCT consolidation to post light consolidation) will be also evaluated., approximately up to 9 years|Determine the time to progression (TTP), From the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression or death per PD, whichever occurs first, approximately up to 9 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), measured from the date of from randomization to the date the subject's death, approximately up to 9 years|Time to next therapy (TNT), TNT will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of next anti-myeloma therapy. Death due to any cause before starting therapy will be considered an event. Subjects who have not progressed or who withdraw from the study will be censored at the time of the last complete disease assessment. Subjects lost to FU will also be censored at the time of last contact., approximately up to 9 years|Progression-free survival on the next line of therapy (PFS2), Progression-free survival on the next line of therapy (PFS2) is defined as the time from randomization to progression on the next line of treatment or death, whichever comes first., approximately up to 9 years
This is a open-label randomized phase III study that enrolls newly diagnosed MM patient eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. Patients will be randomized at enrolment (1:1, stratification according to ISS Stage \[3 levels: I vs II vs III\] and cytogenetic risk FISH \[2 levels: high-risk vs standard risk/missing\] based on presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del 17p)) into 2 treatment arms: -ARM A: induction with 4 cycles of Isatuximab-Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Isa-KRd) followed by cyclophophamide and stem cell collections, chemotherapy with Melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by ASCT (Mel200-ASCT), 4 cycles of Isa-KRd post ASCT consolidation and 12 cycles of Isatuximab-Lenalidomide-Carfilzomib-dexamethasone (IsaKRd) light consolidation; ARM B: induction with 4 cycles of Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) followed by cyclophophamide and stem cell collections, chemotherapy with Melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by ASCT (Mel200-ASCT), 4 cycles of KRd post ASCT consolidation and 12 cycles of Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) light consolidation. Details of all treatments (dose and schedule) are given in paragraph 8. After light consolidation patients are allowed to receive Lenalidomide maintenance as per standard of care.
