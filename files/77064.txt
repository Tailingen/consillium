Study of Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Patients With Large Brain Metastases Treated With Neurosurgical Resection
The primary purpose of this study is to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through a dose-escalation trial using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) following neurosurgical resection for large brain metastases, and to determine the progression-free survival rate as in the recurrence rate of treated brain metastasis.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)
Established Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by classical 3+3 dose-escalation design. Toxicity will be measured using the National Cancer Institute Common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 5.0).

The first dose of 18Gy will be administered to the first 3 subjects, after 90 days from treatment a safety assessment for dose limiting toxicities will be done to determine if the next 3 subject will escalation to dose of 21Gy or receive 18Gy.

If escalation to 21Gy is permitted, then after 90 days from treatment a safety assessment for dose limiting toxicities will be done to determine if next cohort of 3 subjects will escalate to a dose of 24Gy or receive 21Gy. The highest dose level to be administered will be 24 Gy if permitted by safety assessments., Phase I cohorts; 90 days from treatments|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of adverse events reported per participant., 12 months
The potential for delivering ablative doses of radiation to the tumor bed while simultaneously sparing normal brain parenchyma from significant doses of radiation and reducing the potential for tumor repopulation has led to interest in the use of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for brain metastasis.
