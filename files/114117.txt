A Study of TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist With or Without Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in dose escalation and dose expansion. Participants will receive intratumoral (IT) injection of TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist every cycle. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in innate immune cell recognition of foreign pathogens, stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is designed as a long-acting localized delivery prodrug of resiquimod, a potent toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist, with the potential to prolong high local concentrations of resiquimod and promote potent anti-tumoral responses while reducing systemic drug exposure and related adverse events. TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is expected to stimulate innate and adaptive immune response in the tumor microenvironment and enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab.
