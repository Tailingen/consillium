Phase II Biomarker Study of SAR444881 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Solid Tumors
To study possible biomarkers that may be related to how SAR444881 works (either alone or when combined with cemiplimab) in participants with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: SAR444881|DRUG: Cemiplimab
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective

* To identify biomarkers:

  * Related to the mechanism of action of SAR444881 alone and in combination with cemiplimab in participants with solid tumors
  * Predictive of response/survival and resistance to the combination of SAR444881 and cemiplimab in participants with solid tumors
* To evaluate the association of biomarkers with response/survival and resistance\*:

  * Objective response rate (ORR)
  * Clinical benefit rate (CBR)
  * Progression-free survival (PFS)
  * Overall survival (OS)

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the efficacy of the SAR444881 and cemiplimab combination
* To determine the safety and tolerability of the SAR444881 and cemiplimab combination
