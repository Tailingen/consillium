CR was defined as a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From the time of the first dose of study drug until the date of documented disease progression (confirmed by investigator), death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal by the subject, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 57 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the earlier of the dates of the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause. PFS will be determined by the Investigator., From the time of the first dose of study drug until the date of documented disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal by the subject, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 57 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST v1.1, respectively. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From the time of the first dose of study drug until the date of documented disease progression (by investigator), death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal by the subject, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 57 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., From the date of the first dose of drug up to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 57 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Concentration (CMax) for I DXd, total anti-B7-H3 antibody, and DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental methods., Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1: predose, end of infusion, 3 hours (hr), 6 hr; 24 hr, 168 hr; 336 hr; 504 hr; Cycles 2, 4, and 5 Day 1: predose and end of infusion; Cycle 7 and every 2 cycles thereafter up to EOS (57 months) predose (every cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (TMax) for I DXd, total anti-B7-H3 antibody, and DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental methods., Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1: predose, end of infusion, 3 hours (hr), 6 hr; 24 hr, 168 hr; 336 hr; 504 hr; Cycles 2, 4, and 5 Day 1: predose and end of infusion; Cycle 7 and every 2 cycles thereafter up to EOS (57 months) predose (every cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Half-life (t1/2) for I DXd, total anti-B7-H3 antibody, and DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental methods., Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1: predose, end of infusion, 3 hours (hr), 6 hr; 24 hr, 168 hr; 336 hr; 504 hr; Cycles 2, 4, and 5 Day 1: predose and end of infusion; Cycle 7 and every 2 cycles thereafter up to EOS (57 months) predose (every cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Minimum Concentration (Ctrough) for I DXd, total anti-B7-H3 antibody, and DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental methods., Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1: predose, end of infusion, 3 hours (hr), 6 hr; 24 hr, 168 hr; 336 hr; 504 hr; Cycles 2, 4, and 5 Day 1: predose and end of infusion; Cycle 7 and every 2 cycles thereafter up to EOS (57 months) predose (every cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Curve (AUC) for I DXd, total anti-B7-H3 antibody, and DXd, Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental methods., Cycles 1 and 3 Day 1: predose, end of infusion, 3 hours (hr), 6 hr; 24 hr, 168 hr; 336 hr; 504 hr; Cycles 2, 4, and 5 Day 1: predose and end of infusion; Cycle 7 and every 2 cycles thereafter up to EOS (57 months) predose (every cycle is 21 days)|Percentage of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive (Baseline and Post-Baseline), Anti-drug antibodies will be measured in the plasma using a validated assay., Baseline up to 57 months|Percentage of Participants Who Have Treatment-emergent ADA, Anti-drug antibodies will be measured in the plasma using a validated assay., Baseline up to 57 months
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of I-DXd in participants with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors previously treated with 1 or more systemic therapies for the selected tumor indication. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Each cohort starts with Stage 1 and may continue to Stage 2 if sufficient safety and efficacy data are observed.

The HCC Safety Run-In (Phase 1) will assess the safety and tolerability of I-DXd in participants with HCC.
