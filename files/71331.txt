APG-115 Alone or in Combination With APG-2575 in Children With Recurrent or Refractory Neuroblastoma or Solid Tumors
An open, non-randomized Phase I trial of dose-escalation and cohorts expansion to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and initial efficacy of APG-115 alone or in combination with APG-2575 in the treatment of recurrent or refractory pediatric neuroblastoma or solid tumors.
Neuroblastoma|Solid Tumor
DRUG: APG-115|DRUG: APG-2575
Dose Limiting Toxicity (Phase I), DLT will be defined based on the rate of drug-related grade 3-5 adverse events experienced within the first 3 weeks of study treatment. These will be assessed via CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 21 days|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events per NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, Number of patients with adverse event; Number of patients with abnormal vital signs, abnorma physical examination, laboratory abnormalities, and abnormal 12-lead ECG in monotherapy of APG-115 and combined with APG-2575., Up to 12 months
Part 1: Dose escalation and expansion of APG-115 monotherapy in pediatric neuroblastoma or solid tumors to determine MTD and recommended phase 2 dose, RP2D.

Part 2: Dose escalation of APG-2575 to determine the MTD and RP2D combined with APG-115 at the dose level determined in part 1 in pediatric neuroblastoma or solid tumor, and extend the RP2D level of the combination therapy.
