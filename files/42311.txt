A Study of Retreatment With Brentuximab Vedotin in Subjects With Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma or CD30-expressing Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
This study will look at whether brentuximab vedotin works and is safe in the re-treatment setting. To be in this study, patients must have already received brentuximab vedotin as treatment and have cancer that progressed (got worse) after stopping treatment.
Hodgkin Lymphoma|Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: brentuximab vedotin
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per BICR According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014) based on BICR, Up to 18.3 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as events that are new or worsened on or after receiving the first dose of study treatment and up through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment., Up to 36 months|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Laboratory data was summarized by the worst post-baseline grade, by NCI CTCAE v5.0 or higher for each parameter., Up to 36 months
Duration of Response (DOR) Per BICR According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, Duration of response is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), according to the Modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2007), to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 17.1 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per BICR According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression according to the Modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2007) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first., up to 18.3 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause., Up to 35.8 months|Rate of Complete Response (CR) Per BICR According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants with CR according to the modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014), Up to 18.3 months|ORR Per Investigator Assessment According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with CR or PR according to the modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014) based on investigator assessment, Up to 18.3 months|DOR Per Investigator Assessment According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, Duration of response is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), according to the Modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2007), to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 17.1 months|Progression-free Survival Per Investigator Assessment According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression according to the Modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2007) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 18.3 months|Rate of Complete Response Per Investigator Assessment According to Modified Lugano Response Criteria, CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants with CR according to the Modified Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014)., Up to 18.3 months|ORR Per BICR According to Lugano Response Criteria, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with CR or PR, assessed according to Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014), Up to 18.3 months
This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in subjects with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) who experienced complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) with a brentuximab vedotin-containing regimen and subsequently experienced disease progression or relapse.
