BXQ-350 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study in Cancer Patients
This study will assess pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships and whether BXQ-350 may decrease the intensity and/or duration of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) thereby improving quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients who have been exposed to oxaliplatin and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. This study includes two randomized, placebo controlled, blinded treatment cycles of BXQ-350/placebo, an optional open-label BXQ-350 treatment period, and an unblinded Post-Treatment Follow-up period.

BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a cell membrane phospholipid (clinical formulation BXQ-350).Due to the presumed mechanism of action of BXQ-350, Bexion anticipates that it may have an impact on ceramides, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, pre-clinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 induced neurite generation and protection in vitro in the PC-12 and NS20Y cell lines and significantly decreased oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in a model of CIPN. Thus BXQ-350 may represent a new approach to deliver a neuropathy benefit.

The unique combination of SapC-DOPS along with its proven safety profile and possible neuropathy benefit makes BXQ-350 a worthwhile candidate to test on cancer patients affected by CIPN. The aim of this pilot proof-of-concept study is to assess PK/PD relationships in cancer patients with CIPN symptoms in order to determine the impact BXQ-350 has on ceramide, S1P, and inflammatory cytokine levels; thereby potentially reducing the intensity and/or duration of CIPN, improving QoL, and establishing these signaling molecules as biomarkers in future studies.
