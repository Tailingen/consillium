A Study to Test Different Doses of BI 891065 Alone and in Combination With BI 754091 in Asian Patients With Different Types of Advanced Cancer (Solid Tumours)
The primary objective of this trial is:

Part A

- To determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose (RD) of BI 891065 monotherapy for further development in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

Part B

- To determine the MTD and/or the RD of BI 891065 in combination with a fixed dose of BI 754091 at 240 mg for further development in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

The secondary objectives are:

Part A

- To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 891065 as monotherapy in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

Part B

- To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise PK of the combination therapy of BI 891065 and BI 754091 in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours
