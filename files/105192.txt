A Single Arm, Open-label,Phase Ib Study of CT053PTSA in Preciously Treated Patients With Advanced and Metastatic RCC
This is a phase Ib,single arm,open label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA in patients with advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer who have progressed from previous treatment
Renal Cell Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: CT053PTSA
Part 1(dose-escalation part):Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the CT053PTSA will be determined according to incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed by NCI CTCAEv4.03, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28|Part 2 (expansion part):Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR),defined as a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) occurring at any point post-treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors as assessed by RECIST1.1, up to approximately 24 months
Number of patients with adverse events (AEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability will be assessed through AEs, via monitoring changes in physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECGs, up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR, proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or SD, up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as time from date of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as time from the first documented CR or PR to first documented progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as time from date of treatment to death due to any cause, up to approximately 24 months|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28|Time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), to assess the pharmacokinetic profile, Cycle 1 Day1 and Day 28
This study is being carried out in two parts,part 1 and part 2. Part 1: This is the dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend the appropriate doses of CT053PTSA for further study Part 2: This is the expansion part.The part 2 portion of this study will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA at the appropriate dose recommended in Part 1,in patients with advanced and metastatic RCC
