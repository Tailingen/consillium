Collect and Assess Tissue Samples From Subjects With Hematologic Malignancy
This is a prospective, multicenter observational study to collect clinically annotated biospecimens in order to assess the correlation between ex vivo data generated by the Notable assay platform and clinical outcome.

OTHER: This is a non-interventional study
Clinical response to treatment, Collect clinical responses to treatment and outcomes in patients who have provided samples to the biobank, 3 years
Type of clinical treatment responses, Correlate ex vivo drug sensitivity data on patient samples with clinical treatment responses., 3 years|Types of somatic tumor mutations, Determine genotype and/or phenotype relationships between ex vivo and clinical responses with somatic tumor mutations., 3 years
This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study with collection of de-identified biospecimens with matched clinical data from up to 1000 participants from clinical networks in the United States and Canada. Clinical information, demographics, and medical data relevant to cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical record at baseline (at study entry and time of baseline biospecimen collection), and subsequent visits per patient consent, for up to 1 year.

The primary assessment is the establishment of a tumor registry with annotated clinical outcomes. Exploratory assessments include correlation of ex vivo functional testing results with clinical outcomes, as well as identification of potential biomarkers that correlate responses with genotype and/or phenotype.
