Single-center Randomized Trial for Comparison of Performance Between Domestic and Imported Chemoport
To compare the performance of domestic chemoport and imported chemoport
Cancer
DEVICE: Celsite chemoport implantation|PROCEDURE: local anesthesia|DEVICE: Humanport chemoport implantation
function of chemoport, Whether or not chemoport function is intact will be assessed. Chemoport function will be rendered as intact when chemotherapeutic agent is well infused through the chemoport. Chemoport function will be rendered as not intact when chemotherapeutic agent could be infused through the chemoport., 6 months
infection, If infection related with chemoport develop during 6 month follow-up, infection will be recorded., 6 months|Skin dehiscence, If skin dehiscence related with chemoport develop during 6 month follow-up, it will be recorded., 6 months|deep vein thrombosis, If deep vein thrombosis related with chemoport develop during 6 month follow-up, it will be recorded. Deep vein thrombosis can be develop in the jugular vein which is access route., 6 months|Fibrin sheath, If fibrin sheath around chemoport catheter develop during 6 month follow-up, it will be recorded., 6 months
chemoport implantation was done by two investigator Chemoport type was randomly rendered. Domestic chemoport(Human port) and imported chemoport (Celsite) were used. chemoport function will be followed up.
