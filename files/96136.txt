To compare the outcome of thulium beam coagulation versus suture renorrhaphy for hemostasis of the tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.
Renal Tumor|Renal Malignant Tumor
PROCEDURE: Suture renorrhaphy only for hemostasis of the tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy|PROCEDURE: Thulium beam coagulation and suture renorrhaphy for hemostasis of the tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy
Intraoperative Warm Ischemia time (WIT) in minutes (time of renal artery clamping)., Started once renal artery clamped before tumor enucleation till release of the clamp after 1st layer renorraphy in group 1 or Thulium beam coagulation in group 2, during the surgery|Suture time and operative time in minutes, Suture time starts from the first suture to the last one, including time of manipulating needles., during the surgery|Intraoperative number of sutures for renorraphy, which is the count of each time the needle comes out from the renal parenchyma., during the surgery|Intraoperative Blood loss, Blood loss will be calculated from the suction jar minus the amount of fluid irrigation, during the surgery|Blood transfusion rate, Amount of blood in ml transfused intraoperative or postoperative, perioperatively|Renal function: serum creatinine, will be estimated by serum creatinine. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): will be staged according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to reflect the change of renal function, 3 months|Renal function: estimated GFR (eGFR), ill be estimated by estimated GFR (eGFR) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (Levey et al., 2006).

Chronic kidney disease (CKD): will be staged according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to reflect the change of renal function, 3 months|Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) urine level, will be measured in urine to indicate the fibrogenic process that occurs in renal parenchyma after PN, pre-surgery, at 24 hours and at 1 month|Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) urine level, will be measured in urine to indicate the fibrogenic process that occurs in renal parenchyma after PN, pre-surgery, at 24 hours and at 1 month
Hospital stay, from time of surgery till time of patient discharge., perioperatively|Post operative pain, by Visual Analogue Scale The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 100 mm line that represents a continuum between "0 or no pain" and "100 or worst pain"., perioperatively
To date, no studies have compared the outcomes of thulium beam coagulation versus suture renorrhaphy for hemostasis of tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in patients with small renal messes (SRMs).

This study aims to compare the outcome of thulium beam coagulation versus suture renorrhaphy for hemostasis of the tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.

The investigators hypothesize that:

Conducted well designed, randomized prospective comparative study can help to identify which technique is better.

Using thulium beam coagulation for hemostasis of the tumor bed in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy can improve the outcome, shorten intraoperative ischemia time and decrease blood loss.
