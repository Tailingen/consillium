Assessment of Safety and Feasibility of ExAblate Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2 used as a tool to disrupt the BBB (blood brain barrier) in patients with high grade glioma undergoing standard of care therapy.
Glioma|Glioblastoma
DEVICE: Focused ultrasound (FUS)
Device and procedure related adverse events, The number and severity of device and BBB disruption procedure related adverse events will be evaluated and classified according to the CTCAE, Throughout the study, approximately 12 months.
Feasibility of repeated BBB disruption will be evaluated through assessment of post-procedure contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, The repeatability of BBB disruption will be evaluated at each of the 6 procedures and will be evaluated through assessment of post-procedure contrast-enhanced MR imaging., At the time of each ExAblate MRgFUS procedure
This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and feasibility of BBB (blood brain barrier) disruption along the periphery of tumor resection cavity using the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 (220 kHz) system. For this study, patients will be eligible to enroll in the study prior to beginning the planned adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy phase of treatment. Of note, only patients who are deemed eligible for adjuvant TMZ will be eligible for enrollment.
