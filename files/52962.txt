Dose Escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AVE8062 in Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity and the maximum administered dose of AVE8062 administered every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary objectives:

* To assess the overall safety profile of the drug.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AVE8062 and its active metabolite RPR 258063.
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the drug.
