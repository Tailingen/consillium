PReservation Study of Ovarian Function And Hemostasis, and Its Safety of Surgiguard@ During Laparoscopic Ovarian Cystectomy
The purpose of this study is to compare hemostasis, ovarian function preservation effect, and safety about intraoperative bleeding with SurgiGuard@ in women who underwent laparoscopic unilateral ovarian cystectomy
Ovarian Cyst Benign
DRUG: Surgiguard
Hemostasis, Change of serum hemoglobin from baseline, post operative 48 hours later,1 week later, and 12 weeks later
Ovarian function preservation, Change of serum AMH from baseline, post operative 48 hours later,1 week later, and 12 weeks later|Volume of ovary, ovarian volume measured by ultrasonography, post operative 48 hours later,1 week later, and 12 weeks later
In women who underwent laparoscopic unilateral ovarian cystectomy, the effect of SurgiGuard@ was assessed by randomization, using SurgiGuard@ and Bipolar electro cauterization, followed by comparative evaluation of hemostasis, ovarian function preservation, safety using postoperative Hb, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), pelvis ultrasonography (USG), and physical examination
