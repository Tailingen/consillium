IMWG criteria for VGPR: Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or greater than or equal to (\>=) 90 percent (%) reduction in serum Mprotein plus urine M-protein less than (\<) 100 milligram (mg)/24 hours, CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow. sCR: CR plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio, and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence for 2 to 4 color flow cytometry., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Percentage of Participants with Complete Response (CR), Complete response is based on serum M-Protein and bone marrow assessments as per IMWG criteria., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Percentage of Participants with Negative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Minimal residual disease negative rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve MRD negative status by the respective time point. MRD will be assessed by bone marrow 8-colored flow cytometry., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Percentage of Participants who Achieve Clinical Benefit, Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve ORR (sCR + CR + VGPR + PR) and minimal response (MR) as per IMWG criteria., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time between date of the initial infusion of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for PR or better., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of initial infusion of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells to date of first documented disease progression, defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is measured from the date of infusion of the LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells to the date of the participant's death., Mnimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Levels of CAR-T cell Activation Markers, Levels of CAR-T cell Activation Markers like CD4+, CD8+, and CD25+ will be assessed. An evaluation of cell populations may be performed by flow cytometry., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Levels of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cell Expansion (proliferation), Levels of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cell expansion (proliferation) will be reported., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Levels of LCAR-B38M CAR-T Persistence, Levels of LCAR-B38M CAR-T persistence will be evaluated via monitoring CAR-T positive cell counts and CART transgene levels., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Percentage of Participants with Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Stringent Complete Response (sCR) is based on serum M-Protein and bone marrow assessments as per IMWG criteria for complete response(CR) plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio, and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry(IHC), or 2 to 4 color flow cytometry., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Circulating Soluble B-Cell Maturation Antigen (sBCMA) Levels, Blood samples will be collected for measurement of sBCMA level., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)|Percent Reduction in BCMA Expression Cells, Percent reduction in BCMA Expression Cells will be measured., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-B38M CART infusion (Day 1)
