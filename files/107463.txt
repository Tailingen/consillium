Study of Re-treatment With [177Lu]Lu-PSMA in Men With Metastatic Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States and Europe. The treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has evolved with the arrival of the radioligand \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617, which specifically targets PSMA-expressing cancer cells.

The randomized phase III VISION study showed that \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival with an acceptable toxicity profile.

The ReaLuP study will evaluate the efficacy of a re-treatment of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients progressing after taxane based therapy and who have been previously treated with \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA without evidence of progression during this first course of treatment.

Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, or alternatively up to 9 months after the last dose of treatment.

At the end of this follow up period, patients will enter the " long term follow up ", at least for 2 years after the end of the last active follow-up.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (Pluvicto, Novartis)
Progression-Free Survival rate, Proportion (in %) of patients alive without disease progression at 24 weeks. Progression is defined by imaging (bone scan and CT-scan) according to RECIST 1.1 and/or PCWG3 criteria., At 24 weeks after the start of study treatment
Imaging-based radiographic progression (rPFS), Imaging-based radiographic progression defined as the time from the first cycle of re-treatment to the date of radiographic disease progression or death from any cause., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Overall survival, Overall Survival (Os) defined as the time from the first cycle of re-treatment to the date of death from any cause, Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) measured by RECIST v1.1 response., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Duration of response, Duration of response (DOR) will be measured in patients who achieved a CR or PR between the date of first response and the date of RECIST progression or death., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate as measured by RECIST v1.1 response. Rates will be measured in soft tissue, lymph nodes and visceral lesions., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Progression free survival, Progression free survival will be defined as the date of first cycle of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 re-treatment to the date of first evidence of radiographic progression, clinical progression, PSA progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Biological response, Proportion of participants with a PSA response defined as a patient who has achieved a ≥ 50% PSA decrease from baseline that is confirmed with a second PSA measurement at ≥ 4 weeks., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Time to PSA progression, Time to PSA progression will be defined as the date from first cycle of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 re-treatment to a ≥ 25% increase in PSA and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir and confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained 3 or more weeks later. Where no decline from baseline is documented, PSA progression is defined as a 25% increase from the baseline value along with an increase in absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more after 12 weeks of treatment., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Safety : Adverse Events, Safety of re-treatment will be assessed by percentage of patients with all grade and Serious AEs; percentage of patients with SAEs during the active follow up period; percentage of patients with an interruption of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 re-treatment; Percentage of patients who discontinue \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 re-treatment secondary to an AEs or death; Number and grade of AE related to the investigational medicinal product or to the procedures added by the research, Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months|Pain assessment, Pain will be assessed with the BPI-SF (Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form) questionnaire.

BPI-SF is a multidimensional scale evaluating the intensity and the interference of pain in life activities: four pain severity items and seven pain interference items rated on 0-10 scales, and the question about percentage of pain relief by analgesics.

Pain severity: The BPI assesses pain at its "worst," "least," "average," and "now" (current pain); each of the forth items are used singly to represent pain severity.

Pain interference: The BPI measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. This mean can be used if more than 50%, or four of seven, of the total items have been completed on a given administration.

The highest is the score, the worst are the pain and pain interference, Up to 6 weeks from the last [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 administration|Quality of life assessment, Aspects of HRQoL will be reported using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire.

FACT-P score range 0-156; the higher the score, the better the QoL Subscales: Physical well-being (0-28) Social/Family well-being (0-28) Emotional well-being (0-24) Functional well-being (0-28) Prostate cancer subscale (0-48), Up to 6 weeks from the last [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 administration|Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE) assessment, Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) and SSE-free survival defined as date of first injection of \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 re-treatment to the date of first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, or requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain, whichever occurs first., Through study completion, a maximum of 57 months
