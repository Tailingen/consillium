A Trial of Robotic-assisted Versus Laparoscopic Abdominoperineal Resection for Treating Low Rectal Cancer
In this study, the investigators assessed the difference in efficacy and safety among robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for patients with low rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robotic-assisted resection.|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic resection
postoperative complications, postoperative complications related to operation, 30 days post operatively
operative mortality, death occurred 30 days after operation, 30 days post operatively|disease-free survival, disease-free survival rate at 3 years after operation, 3 years|overall survival, overall survival rate at 3 and 5 years after operation, 3 and 5 years|locoregional recurrence rate, local recurrence rate at 3 and 5 years after operation, 3 and 5 years
operative time, Time from cutting the skin to suturing the incision during the surgery, recorded in minute, Day 1|rate of conversion to open surgery, The rate of patients actually receiving open surgery in robotic or laparoscopic surgery groups., Day 1|estimated blood loss, Blood loss will be measured according to the suction and the weight of wet gauze, and then minus the irrigation., Day 1|circumferential resection margin, The circumferential margin will be reported as "positive" or "negative" to define whether tumor is radically resected. It will be reported according to the post-operative pathology. Details are based on NCCN and Chinese guidelines for colorectal cancer., 10 days post operatively|proximal/distal resection margin, The proximal/distal resection margin will be reported as "positive" or "negative" to define whether tumor is radically resected. It will be reported according to the post-operative pathology. Details are based on NCCN and Chinese guidelines for colorectal cancer., 10 days post operatively|number of retrieved lymph nodes, It will be reported according to the post-operative pathology., 10 days post operatively|postoperative hospital stay, The postoperative hospital stay is defined as the number of date from the first day after operation to discharge., 30 days post operatively|self reported bladder function, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "International prostate symptom score" (IPSS), at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 months|self reported sexual function for male patients, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "International Index of Erectile Function" (IIEF-5)., at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 months|self reported sexual function for female patients, This section is assessed using a self-rating scale "Female Sexual Function Index" (FSFI)., at postoperative 3, 6 and 1 2 months
Patients will be eligible for inclusion if their primary tumors is low rectal cancer.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to robotic-assisted (arm A) versus laparoscopic (arm B) abdominoperineal resection.
