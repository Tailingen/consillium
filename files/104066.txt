This is a single-center、open-label and non-controlled Phase 1 study which will be conducted in two parts: part A is the dose-escalation phase; part B is dose-expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase is guided by pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety, according to the standard 3+3 dose-escalation schema. CM082 tablets are taken orally with a starting dose of 200 mg and a subsequent dose of 400, 600 and 800 mg. The way of administration is as follows: QD or BID. The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD)、characteristics of dose-limited toxicity (DLT) and pharmacokinetics (PK). Secondary objectives include safety、tolerability and preliminary efficacy
