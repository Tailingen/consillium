Ripretinib Combined With Surgery in Advanced GIST That Have Failed Imatinib Therapy: A Multicenter,Observational Study
The objective of this observational study is to explore the efficacy and safety of ripretinib treatment combined with surgery in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors(GIST) after failure of imatinib therapy.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor(GIST)
PROCEDURE: Resection surgery of gastrointestinal stromal tumor
1-year Progression free survival rate, PFS Based on radiographic assessment using Choi criteria, 12 monthes
objective response rate（ORR）, Objective response rate as determined by confirmed CR + confirmed PR by radiologic review, 12 monthes|R0 resection rate, R0 is the proportion of subjects with no microscopic residual after resection, 1 days after surgery|2-year overall survival rate, Proportion of subjects with an overall survival time of at least 2 years, 24 monthes|time to progression (TTP), The time from the start of treatment to the progression, 12 monthes|Duration of continuous medication before surgery, Only for subjects undergoing surgery, 12 monthes
This study is a single-arm, multicenter, observational study. A total of approximately 30 subjects were be enrolled. The patient was orally administered with ripretinib150 mg QD. 4 weeks for one cycle. Efficacy was assessed every two cycles. For subjects with PR or SD after ripretinib treatment, resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumor was performed after discussion by MDT and ensure R0 resection as much as possible.Ripretinib 150mg QD was continued 2 weeks after surgery. Thereafter, subjectss entered the follow-up period for at least 1 year. Safety and survival information will be collected
