Hippocampal-sparing Whole Brain Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases From Breast Cancer
Based on evidence that radiation-induced damage to the hippocampus plays a considerable role in neurocognitive decline after cranial irradiation, hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiation therapy (HS-WBRT) has been proposed. This study will investigate the neurocognitive function and prognosis between HS-WBRT and conventional WBRT for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer.
