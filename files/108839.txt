Phase II Clinical Trial of Gemcitabine and DoxilÂ® for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of gemcitabine and doxil will have clinical activity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Doxil
Response Rate, Number of participants that experienced response/total number of participants per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan. Response was defined as Complete Response (CR), the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Up to 18 weeks for individual; Up to 40 months for cohort
Time to Progression, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 40 months
Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have received prior therapy with sorafenib, sunitinib or temsirolimus and have progressive disease may participate in this study if all eligibility criteria are met. Doxil will be administered on day 1 and gemcitabine on day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Tumor responses will be evaluated by RECIST. Up to six cycles of study treatment may be administered. Cardiac ejection fraction will be monitored.
