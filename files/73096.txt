Carotid Ultrasound to Identify Head and Neck Cancer Survivors With High Cardiovascular Risk After Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this research study is to understand how radiation therapy may affect blood vessels in the neck called the carotid arteries. Investigators want to look at narrowing of the artery or thickening of the walls of the arteries.
Head and Neck Cancer|Carotid Artery Stenosis|Cardiovascular Complication
PROCEDURE: Carotid ultrasound|OTHER: Blood draw|OTHER: Survey
Number of Participants with 50% Stenosis Identified, This will be defined as having a peak systolic flow velocity of 150 cm/s or higher on Doppler ultrasonography will be estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence interval., At study completion, up to 1 approximately year
Change in Intima-Media Thickness (IMT), Mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range will be used to describe IMT as a continuous variable at three separate angles (anterior, lateral and posterior). IMT will be measured in millimeters at 3 separate angles (anterior, lateral, and posterior) at the level of the distal common carotid artery, carotid bulb at the flow divider, and the proximal internal carotid artery., At time of ultrasound, up to approximately 1 year|Number of Participants with Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) Increase, Participants with at least one carotid IMT measurements of 0.9 mm or greater based on IMT measurements will be each be estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence interval., At time of ultrasound, up to approximately 1 year|Number of Participants with Carotid Plaque Thickness Increase, Participants with carotid plaque of maximum thickness 2 mm or greater and with high risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk 1.50 or greater) based on IMT measurements will be each be estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence interval., At time of ultrasound, up to approximately 1 year|Number of Participants Identified at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events, Participants identified as clinically significant (relative risk 1.50 or greater) may be estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence interval within subgroups defined by clinical characteristics., At time of ultrasound, up to approximately 1 year|Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Carotid Artery Stenosis (Greater than or Equal to 50%) Based on Potential Risk Factors, Associations between continuous clinical characteristics and clinically significant carotid artery stenosis will be evaluated using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Potential risk factors used to evaluate will be gender; age; systolic blood pressure at time of ultrasound; history of cigarette smoking; history of prior cardiovascular disease; history of atrial fibrillation; left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram; use of anti-hypertensive medication; radiation dose to the exposed carotid artery, At time of ultrasound, up to approximately 1 year|Number of Participants Enrolled that Receive Study Intervention - Feasibility, The study will be considered feasible if 60% of responding participants enroll and receive carotid ultrasound. If less than 40% of responding participants enroll and receive the study carotid ultrasound, investigators will re-evaluate methods for subsequent study. This will be be reported with an exact 95% confidence interval., At time of enrollment, up to approximately 1 year|Acceptability of Intervention Measure Instrument (Likert scale)., Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize acceptability of carotid ultrasound. Scoring scale is a Likert scale (completely disagree to completely agree) with completely agree being scored as a more positive response to the intervention and treatment options., At study completion, up to approximately 1 year|Barriers Survey instrument (Likert scale), Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize barriers to getting a carotid ultrasound. Scoring scale is a Likert scale (completely disagree to completely agree) with completely agree being scored as a more positive response to the intervention and/or treatment options., At study completion, up to approximately 1 year|Assessment of Risk Perception Instrument (Likert scale), Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize stroke risk perception. Scoring scale is a Likert scale (completely disagree to completely agree) with completely agree being scored as a more positive response to the intervention and/or treatment options., At study completion, up to approximately 1 year
Primary Objective: To determine the proportion of patients with clinically significant carotid artery stenosis (â‰¥50% stenosis) in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To measure the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To determine the proportion of patients with carotid intima-media thickness of at least 0.9 mm in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To determine the proportion of patients with carotid plaque of maximum thickness 2 mm or greater in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To determine the proportion of patients identified as having a high risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk 1.50 or greater) based on intima-media thickness measurements in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To describe the risk of significant carotid artery stenosis based on various clinical factors in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To determine the feasibility of carotid ultrasound in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To obtain preliminary data on the acceptability of carotid ultrasound among head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To obtain preliminary data on barriers to potential carotid ultrasound screening in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
* To obtain preliminary data on stroke risk perception among head and neck cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy in head and neck cancer survivors treated with head and neck radiotherapy.
