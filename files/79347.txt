Sequential and Maintenance Icotinib Plus Chemotherapy Versus Icotinib Maintenance After Chemotherapy in Advanced NSCLC
This randomised, controlled, open-label, prospective trial is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of icotinib maintenance therapy after sequential Icotinib plus chemotherapy versus Icotinib maintenance therapy after chemotherapy in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation.
EGFR Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Sequential and maintenance icotinib|DRUG: Maintenance icotinib
Progression Free Survival, A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed., 15 months
Overall survival, Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive., 24 months|Objective response rate, Number of subjects with confirmed objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., 24 months|Adverse events, The number of patients who suffered adverse events, which is graded by NCI CTCAE version 4.0., 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate including complete response (CR) oï¼Œpartial response (PR) , stable disease (SD), 24 months
