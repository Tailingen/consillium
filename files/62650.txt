Targeting Chronic Stress for Reducing Risk Factors for Colorectal Cancer
Many neighborhoods in Chicago experience daily exposure to stressors including economic inopportunity and violent crime in public spaces. There is mounting evidence that chronic psychosocial stress can facilitate carcinogenesis by modulating the gut microbiome and immune system. The proposed research aims to study the practice of mindfulness to mitigate CPS and reduce colorectal cancer risk factors among Black American women at elevated risk.

Chronic stress can directly and indirectly promote carcinogenesis through immune, metabolic, and microbial pathways. Our overarching hypothesis is that reducing chronic stress will have important implications for colon cancer risk reduction among vulnerable and high-risk populations. A promising approach for reducing chronic stress is mindfulness practices. Mindfulness is a meditation-based technique to achieve a state of mind used to experience higher awareness or consciousness. We propose to pilot test an 8-week Mindfulness intervention delivered in a hybrid format (synchronous and asynchronous sessions) among 40 Black females at elevated risk of colon cancer, who reside in vulnerable communities and who report moderate to high perceived stress. At baseline and post-intervention, participants will provide blood and stool undergo body composition analysis, and complete mood and lifestyle-related surveys. The specific aims are to: test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and evaluate the preliminary effect on stress and weight, fasting glucose, inflammation markers, and the gut microbiome - risk markers and risk pathways associated with colon tumorigenesis. While relieving social stressors is the paramount goal, addressing chronic stress at the individual level is achievable now, with implications for CRC risk reduction. If successful, data generated here will serve in developing a fully powered trial to test if MBSR is efficacious for CRC risk reduction among high-risk vulnerable populations in Chicago.
