Quality of Life Study Using Gabapentin Versus Venlafaxine in Treating Hot Flashes in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the change in quality of life over a 6 month period between gabapentin and venlafaxine in men with prostate cancer treated for hot flashes related to androgen deprivation therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Gabapentin|DRUG: Venlafaxine
Changes in Quality of Life, We will measure the absolute change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) total score, between gabapentin and venlafaxine in men with prostate cancer treated for hot flashes related to androgen deprivation therapy, observed over a 6 month treatment period
Compare Toxicity Rates Between the Gabapentin and Venlafaxine Treatment Groups, Toxicity rates will be compared between the two groups, over a 6 month treatment period|Assess Changes in the Hot Flash Scores for the Two Arms, Assess percentage changes in the hot flash score from baseline to cycle 6 between gabapentin and venlafaxine in men with prostate cancer treated with for hot flashes related to androgen deprivation therapy, 6 month treatment period|Assess Changes in Quality of Life Using the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), Assess percent change in quality of life from baseline to cycle 6, as measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) total score, between gabapentin and venlafaxine in men with prostate cancer treated for hot flashes related to androgen deprivation therapy., over the 6 month treatment period
60 evaluable patients with prostate cancer currently receiving androgen ablation therapy or who have had an orchiectomy will be enrolled in this study. All patients will be randomized 1:1 (30 patients per treatment arm) to either receive gabapentin or venlafaxine. Treatment duration will be a total of 6 months. During those 6 months, study staff will evaluate frequency and intensity of hot flashes using hot flash score from hot flash diary every 28 days. Patients will also record side effects associated with either gabapentin or venlafaxine on their medication diaries. Study staff will record the severity of all adverse events reported. Patients will also complete the quality of life Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) form at baseline, cycle 3, and cycle 6/off study.
