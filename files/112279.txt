Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Gastroesophageal Cancer
The aim of this study is to investigate urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) microexpression in gastroesophageal cancer (adenocarcinomas) both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively and to evaluate if it offers a possibility for future imagining purposes.
Esophagus Cancer, Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: uPAR immunohistochemistry
uPAR microexpression, Our primary objective is to investigate uPAR microexpression in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. This will be done by a pathology analysis of gastroesophageal cancer resections., Up to 6 months|Tumor-to-background ratio, A pathology staining will determine the uPAR in the tumor compared with the healthy cells., Up to 6 months
uPAR in patient groups, Baseline statistical analysis of patient groups and their expression of uPAR in their resected tumor tissues will be made., Up to 6 months
* Sections of the tumor tissue will be HE stained.
* Sections of the tumor tissue will be stained with an uPAR antibody for immunohistochemistry.
* Immunohistochemical staining against cytokeratin which colors cancer cells will be made to assist the observer in the evaluation of uPAR microexpression pattern.
* A semiqualitative scale corresponding to the level of uPAR expression will be made.
* Quantitative polymerase chain reaction will be used to validate the immunohistochemistry uPAR expression pattern.
* An electronic scoring system (digital pathology) will be trained to access the expression of uPAR in both tumor- and normal tissue.
