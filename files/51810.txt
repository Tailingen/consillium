Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Treatment With Bendamustine in Combination With Ofatumumab in Previously Untreated Patients With Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response (complete response + partial response) of bendamustine in combination with ofatumumab in previously untreated patients with indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
DRUG: Bendamustine hydrochloride|DRUG: Ofatumumab
Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as Determined by the International Working Group (IWG) Criteria As Assessed by Investigators, The IWG criteria (Cheson et al 2007) for a CR is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A PR is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed., up to Week 32
