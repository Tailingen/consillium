Responses can range from 0 ("never," "none," "not at all," or "absent") to 4 ("almost constantly," "very severe," or "very much"), with a higher score indicating a higher frequency, severity, or interference of adverse events., Up to approximately 407 weeks|Change from Baseline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire 30-item core module (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These include five functional scales (physical functioning \[PF\], role functioning \[RF\], cognitive functioning \[CF\], emotional functioning \[EF\] and social functioning \[SF\]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting \[N/V\]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhoea, insomnia, dyspnoea, appetite loss \[AL\] and financial difficulties \[FD\]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores will be averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represent better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represent significant symptomatology., Baseline and up to approximately 407 weeks|Change from Baseline in HRQoL as measured by EORTC QLQ-20-item Multiple Myeloma Module (MY20), The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 20-item Multiple Myeloma module (QLQMY20) is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A high score for Future Perspective and Body Image represents a high/healthy level of functioning., Baseline and up to approximately 407 weeks|Change from Baseline in HRQoL as measured by EORTC item library 52 (IL52), The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 20-item Multiple Myeloma module (QLQMY20) is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. For the EORTC IL52, disease symptoms domain of the QLQ-MY20 will be used for bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest pain, and pain increasing with activity. The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain will be averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Baseline and up to approximately 407 weeks
