TACE Combined With Penpulimab and Anlotinib for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this multicenter, dual-cohort, prospective real-world study is to explore the efficacy and safety of penpulimab and anlotinib combined with or without TACE, as well as the optimum interval of the combination of penpulimab and anlotinib with TACE in advanced HCC patients.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: TACE+penpulimab+anlotinib vs. penpulimab+anlotinib
Progression free survival (PFS), Time from initiation of either combination therapy to tumor progression according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria or death from any cause., 2 years
Objective response rate(ORR), The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to the mRECIST criteria., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The time from initiation of either regimen of combination therapy to all-cause death., up to 5 years|Adverse effects, Adverse event (AE)，treatment emergent adverse event(TEAE)，serious adverse event (SAE), 2 years
The efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with penpulimab and anlotinib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. This is a multicenter, dual-cohort, prospective real-world study with patients receiving normal clinical care. Patients in cohort I will receive TACE combined with penpulimab and anlotinib (TACE-A-A Cohort), and patients in cohort II will just receive penpulimab and anlotinib (A-A Cohort). The primary endpoints of this study are the efficacy of penpulimab and anlotinib combined with or without TACE in advanced HCC patients. While the secondary endpoints include the safety of penpulimab and anlotinib combined with or without TACE, as well as the optimum interval of the combination of penpulimab and anlotinib with TACE in advanced HCC patients. The results will provide further evidence for the clinical practice and the design of future trials.
