Efficacy and Safety of Sintilimab Combined with Platinum-containing Double-agent Chemotherapy in First-line Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Elderly Patients
To investigate the efficacy and safety of sindilizumab combined with platinum-containing dual chemotherapy in first-line treatment of elderly patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

This study was an observational, prospective, single-arm, single-center study. Specific dosing regimens are as follows:

1. Sintilimab, 200mg, intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle, every 3 weeks as a cycle (Q3W), until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of new anti-tumor therapy, or termination of treatment for other reasons specified in the protocol; The longest treatment time of sintilimab was 24 months.
2. Chemotherapy regimen:

1) Pemetrexed combined with platinum regimen (non-squamous cell carcinoma) : pemetrexed 500mg/m2, intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle, cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5, intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle, every 3 weeks (Q3W) for a total of 4-6 cycles. Participants who did not progress after 4 to 6 cycles received maintenance pemetrexed monotherapy at the same dose and cycle as before until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or discontinuation for other protocol-specified reasons.

2) Gemcitabine plus platinum regimen (squamous cell carcinoma) : gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle, cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin: AUC 5, intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle, every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4-6 cycles. Participants who did not progress after 4 to 6 cycles received maintenance gemcitabine monotherapy at the same dose and cycle as before until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, or discontinuation for other protocol-specified reasons.

Patients are assessed for measurable disease at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks after starting treatment, and every 9 weeks thereafter according to RECIST 1.1 criteria during the treatment period until disease progression or intolerable toxicity withdrawal. Following discontinuation of treatment, subjects are followed for survival status every 3 months until death. Subject safety was assessed during treatment according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 criteria. Subjects who experience an AE should be followed until the AE returns to baseline.
