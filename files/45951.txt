Phase II Trial of Dose-dense Paclitaxel and Cisplatin as Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy for Operable Stage II and IIA NSCLC
A single arm, open-label phase II is appropriate to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose - dense combination of paclitaxel with cisplatin supported by pegfilgrastim for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in this patient population.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Pegfilgrastim
the evaluation of the clinical response rate of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with dose-dense therapy of paclitaxel and cisplatin(PC) with peg-filgrastim in patients with operable NSCLC
>To evaluate the safety of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with PC|- to characterize the toxicity of PC, include febrile neutropenia.|- to evaluate peri- and post-operative mortality|> to determine the pathological complete response rate|> to determine the complete tumor resection rate|> to evaluate proportion of cycle 2 and all cycles chemotherapy given with planned dose-on-time and proportion of patients receiving planned dose-on-time in cycle 2 and over all cycles.|> To evaluate the following time-to-event efficacy variables:|- disease free survival|- overall survival|> to evaluate Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13)
This is an open-label, single-arm Phase II study of dose-dense regimen with paclitaxel and cisplatin supported by pegfilgrastim as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable stage II, IIA NSCLC.

Paclitaxel will be administered via intravenous infusion over approximately 3 hours at dose of 175mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Cisplatin 75mg/m2 will be given via intravenous infusion on day 1 (after paclitaxel) according to institutional guidelines.

Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) fixed dose of 6mg (0.6mL of a 10mg/mL solution) as a single subcutaneous injection on Day 2 of each study cycle.

All drugs will be given in 2-weekly cycle. Three cycles of pre-operative chemotherapy are planned.
