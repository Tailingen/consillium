GP Chemotherapy in Combination With Anti-PD-1 and Anti-TIGIT in Unresectable Advanced BTC
This is an open label, multi-center, phaseⅡstudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GP (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) in combination with Tislelizumab and Ociperlimab as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC).
Biliary Tract Carcinoma
DRUG: GP+PD-1+Tight
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to study drugs, 24 months
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR or SD to study drugs, 24 months|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time interval from first meeting response criteria (CR or PR) to confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 24 months|6-months/12-months PFS rate, 6-months/12-months PFS rate is defined as the proportion of patients alive and free of disease progression at 6 months/12 months., 6 months/12 months|Overall Survival (OS）, OS is defined as the time from the treatment until death due to any cause., 24 months|6-months/12-months OS rate, OS rate is defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced death from any cause at 6 months/12 months., 6 months/12 months|Adverse Events (AEs), The grade of AEs and the number of patients with AEs are assessed based on CTCAE v5.0, 24 months
Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) has an insidious onset, invasiveness, high malignancy, and no specific symptoms in the early stage, and most of them are in the middle and advanced stages at the time of diagnosis and have lost the chance of surgery. For patients with advanced BTC, systemic therapy is currently the main choice, and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) is currently the "gold standard" for first-line treatment of advanced BTC, but the efficacy is still unsatisfactory, and more and more clinical practice has found that GP-based combination therapy may have better efficacy.

Previous studies have shown that chemotherapy can improve the immunotherapy microenvironment and may have a synergistic anti-tumor effect in combination with immunotherapy. This study is to explore the efficacy and safety of GP in combination with anti-PD1 antibody (Tislelizumab) and anti-TIGIT antibody (Ociperlimab) as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable advanced BTC.
