Precision Care Initiative: Integrating Precision Oncology Into Clinical Programs
The purpose of this study is to drive integration of precision medicine into routine oncology healthcare. It is hoped that this research will not only optimise the newly established Precision Care Clinic within the Prince of Wales Hospital, but also prime it for use within other health care sites. The multidisciplinary team will work to achieve the following three objectives:

1. Co-design a Precision Care Clinic, its implementation platform and suite of outcome measures (Phase 1)
2. Test the implementation-, service-, clinical, and cost-effectiveness of a Precision Care Clinic (Phase 2)
3. Develop and pilot test a Precision Care scale-up model and toolkit (Phase 3)

A mixed-methods approach will be used to develop and evaluate an implementation platform to support the integration of precision medicine into the routine oncology setting at a single hospital site. In the first study phase, interviews and focus-groups will be used to develop the implementation platform, which involves a co-designed model of care supported by a Learning Health System. A Type II Hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial design will then be used to test the implementation, clinical, and cost-effectiveness of this novel model of care (phase 2). A combination of patient surveys and interviews will be used to measure patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs); stakeholder and patient interviews, surveys and focus-groups will be used to measure implementation outcomes; and cost data will be collected to inform an economic evaluation. These data will be collected at various stages of implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of the model of care over time. In the final study phase (phase 3), a scale-up model will be developed to support implementation of the new model of care across a wider range of clinical contexts. (Phase 3 will be detailed in a separate ethics amendment)

It is hoped that this research will not only optimise the newly established model of care within The Prince of Wales Hospital, but also prime it for use within other health care sites.
