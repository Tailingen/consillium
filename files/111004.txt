FCN-159 in Adult Patients With Symptomatic, Inoperable Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas
A study to evaluate the efficacy of FCN-159 in adult patients with symptomatic, inoperable neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas.
Neurofibromatosis 1|Plexiform Neurofibroma|NF1
DRUG: Test group (Group A): FCN-159 8 mg, orally, once daily;|DRUG: Control group (Group B): Placebo, orally, once daily;
Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by BIRC (Response evaluation in Nerufibromatosis and Schwannomatosis, REiNS criteria), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response as determined by ICR per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by the investigator (REiNS criteria), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response as determined by ICR per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Duration of response (DOR) evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (which is subsequently confirmed) until progression by BIRC and the investigator per REiNS criteria or death due to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR) evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response or stable disease as determined by BIRC and the investigator per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR)evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response or stable disease\>48 weeks as determined by BIRC and the investigator per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS) evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until date of disease progression by BIRC and investigator per REiNS criteria or death due to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Time to progression (TTP) evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, TTP is defined as the time from randomization until date of disease progression by BIRC and investigator per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Time to response (TTR) evaluated by BIRC and the investigator;, TTR is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of objective response by BIRC and investigator per REiNS criteria., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Change from baseline in pain intensity score, Difference in mean change from baseline in overall tumor and target PN pain intensity score between Arm A and Arm B as assessed by the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11),which uses the range 0-10,higher scores mean worse outcome., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Change from baseline in appearance, Change in appearance from baseline for Arm A versus Arm B as assessed using a sponsor-customized 'appearance evaluation'PRO questionnaire, which is descriptive., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FCN-159 in adult patients with symptomatic, inoperable neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas.
