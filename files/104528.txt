Magnetomotoric Ultrasound (MMUS) in Rectal Cancer
Magnetomotoric ultrasound, combines conventional ultrasound with a time-varying magnetic field. The aim is to improve diagnosis of mesolectal lymph nodes.
Rectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Magnetomotoric ultrasound
Accuracy of mesorectal lymph node diagnosis with MMUS, compared with final histopathology, Evaluation of the accuracy of MMUS in detecting lymph node metastases in rectal cancer. The results of the MMUS (malignant or benign lymph nodes) will be compared with final histopathology. The accuracy will be expressed in sensitivity (%), specificity (%) and overall accuracy (% correctly staged lymph nodes with MMUS), Approximately 1 hour after MMUS|Accuracy of mesorectal lymph node diagnosis with MMUS, compared with preoperative MRI, Evaluation of the accuracy of MMUS in detecting lymph node metastases in rectal cancer in comparison to standard staging (MRI). The results of the MMUS (malignant nodes or benign nodes) will be compared with the results of preoperative MRI (malignant or benign lymph nodes) and the final histopathology. The accuracy will be expressed in sensitivity (%), specificity (%) and overall accuracy (% correctly staged lymph nodes) with MMUS and MRI., Approximately 1 hour after MMUS
Magnetomotoric ultrasound, combines conventional ultrasound with a time-varying magnetic field. Nanoparticles are injected close to the rectal cancer and migrate to adjacent lymph nodes.The time-varying magnetic field will influence the nano particles in the lymph node enhancing diagnosis of affected lymph nodes. The aim is to improve diagnosis of mesolectal lymph nodes and compare the results of magnetomotoric ultrasound with MRI and final histopathology.
