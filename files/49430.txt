Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy|Breast Neoplasm|Breast Cancer|Breast Diseases
DEVICE: TiLOOP® Bra Pocket
Quality of Life - Patient reported outcome, The primary endpoint is defined as the change of the four BreastQ domain scores before study treatment compared to twelve months after study treatment. The BreastQ questionnaire yields a domain score in the range from zero to 100. Wheras a score of 100 is the best score. The study hypothesis is that the patient's QoL after the study intervention treatment is not worse than the QoL prior to the intervention study treatment . The following four domains are relavant: Satisfaction with breasts, Psychosocial well-being, Physical well-being:chest and Sexual well-being., 12 months after study treatment
Quality of Life - Patient reported outcome, The change of the four BreastQ domain scores before study treatment compared to six months and 24 months after study treamtment., 6 and 24 months after study treatment|Complication rate, The number and rate of occurrence of adverse events is reported as a secondary endpoint along with a tabulation of the types of adverse events (6, 12 and 24 months after study treatment)., 6, 12 and 24 months after study treatment|Cosmetic outcome, The cosmetic outcome is assessed based on photographs 6, 12 and 24 months after study treatment by descriptive statistics (an independent expert, the physician in charge and the patient assess the cosmetic outcome)., 6, 12 and 24 months after study treatment
This international, multicentre, non-randomised, observational clinical device investigation will be performed to obtain post market information on TiLOOP® Bra Pocket surgical meshes for a period of up to two years. In particular, on patient reported satisfaction (BreastQTM), cosmetic outcome and the rate of complications.

The objective of the clinical Investigation is to establish the efficacy and safety of the TiLOOP® Bra Pocket.

The Investigation will be performed in ten clinical centres in Germany and Austria.
