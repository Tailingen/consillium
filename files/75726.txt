A Study of Rivoceranib and Trifluridine/Tipiracil for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rivoceranib when used in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil in participants with mCRC and to assess progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with mCRC.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Rivoceranib|DRUG: Trifluridine/Tipiracil
(Phase 1b) Percentage of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Cycle 1, Baseline up to 28 days|(Phase 1b) Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)investigator assessment, Baseline up to 3 years|(Phase 1b) Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Baseline up to 3 years|(Phase 2) Progression Free Survival (PFS) per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by Investigator Assessment, Up to approximately 3 years
(Phase 1b and Phase 2) Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from participant enrollment until death from any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|(Phase 2) Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR per RECIST v1.1 by Investigator Assessment is defined as percentage of participants who will achieve confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 3 years|(Phase 2) Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment., Up to approximately 3 years|(Phase 1b and 2) Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) that Worsen in Severity as Defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, Up to approximately 3 years
This a multicenter open-label study comparing safety, tolerability and efficacy of rivoceranib and trifluridine/tipiracil monotherapies, and the combination of rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil in participants with mCRC. Participants with histologically or cytologically definitive adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have progressed following standard of care therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) will be randomly assigned (1:1:2) to rivoceranib, trifluridine/tipiracil or rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil treatment groups.

The study will consist of an initial phase 1b portion to assess the safety of and determine the RP2D of rivoceranib in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil. A subsequent phase 2 portion will assess the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment. When a participant discontinues rivoceranib and/or trifluridine/tipiracil for any reason, the participant will enter the 12-month survival follow-up period until withdrawal of consent from the study, lost to follow-up, end of the study or death, whichever occurs earlier.

The maximum duration of the study is estimated to be 36 months, which includes screening, treatment, and follow-up phases.
