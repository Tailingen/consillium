Optimizing Patient Selection for Surgery Using Pathologic Analysis Following Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
This interventional, non-randomized, prospective trial aims to evaluate the role of endoscopic resection following neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

Phase I focuses on assessing the feasibility, safety and efficacy of endoscopic resection of residual scar or superficial residual neoplastic tissue following neoadjuvant treatment.

Phase II explores the potential of this approach to guide patient selection for total mesorectal excision and to serve as a definitive treatment option for those with limited residual disease.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC)
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic resection|BEHAVIORAL: Short interval restaging|PROCEDURE: Total mesorectal excision
Feasibility of Endoscopic Resection, Feasibility of the endoscopic resection technique in the context of locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy including radio-chemotherapy. This will be assessed by the curative, en-bloc, and R0 resection rates., From the endoscopic procedure date to the date of reported pathology results, estimated to a maximum of 15 days|Disease Recurrence, This will be assessed by the rate of local or distant recurrences and the need of salvage surgery within 1, 3 and 5 years following the neoadjuvant treatment and endoscopic resection., From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the completion of the neoadjuvant therapy
Complete endoscopic resection rate, This is defined as the absence of residual visible tissue after endoscopic resection, The day of the endoscopic procedure|En-bloc endoscopic resection rate, This is defined as a single piece endoscopic resection, with clear margins, The day of the endoscopic procedure|Incidence of procedure-related technical complications (Safety of the technique), This will be defined as any complication occuring during the performance of the endoscopic procedure, such as muscle galling, rectal muscle perforation, minor or major bleeding, anesthesia-related adverse events, endoscopic material defect, The day of the endoscopic procedure|Incidence of early procedure-related adverse events, This will be assessed by evaluating the incidence of procedure-related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) within 30 days post-procedure. This includes bleeding rates, perforation rates, infection rates among other complications., Starting the next day following the endoscopic procedure until 30 days after the procedure|Incidence of late procedure-related adverse events (Long-term safety of the procedure), This will be assessed by evaluating the incidence of late procedure-related complications within 1, 3 and 5 years after the procedure. This includes delayed haemorrhage, delayed perforation, stenosis, stricture, infection and local pain among other complications, From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the procedure date|Endoscopic tumor characteristics, This will be assessed by the correlation between endoscopic tumor characteristics and the rates of recurrence and salvage surgery. Endoscopic tumor characteristics include the presence of a non-lifting sign, muscle retraction sign, fibrosis, and the description of vessels density (low/moderate/high), From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the procedure date|Pathologic tumor characteristics, This will be assessed by the correlation between residual tumor characteristics (e.g. resected specimen surface, the presence of residual tumor, tumor differentiation, margin status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), fibrosis degree, tumor budding) and the rates of recurrence and salvage surgery, From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the completion of the neoadjuvant therapy|Pathological response, This will be assessed by the correlation between the degree of pathological response (e.g., complete, partial, or poor response) and the rates of recurrence and salvage surgery, From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the completion of the neoadjuvant therapy|Molecular biomarkers, This will be assessed by evaluating molecular biomarkers such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on the resected specimen, and correlating these findings with the rates of recurrence and salvage surgery, From the pathologic report date until 5 years after the endoscopic procedure date|Survival Outcomes, Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1, 3 and 5 years., From the endoscopic procedure date until 5 years after the completion of the neoadjuvant therapy
Procedure Duration, The average time taken to perform the endoscopic resection, measured in minutes and reported by the endoscopist, The day of the endoscopic procedure|Length of Hospital Stay, Number of days patients are hospitalized post-procedure, From the endoscopic procedure date to the date of the patient's discharge from the hospital, up to 30 days
