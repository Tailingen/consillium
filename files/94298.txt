Assessment of the Clinic-pathological Correlation of Basal Cell Carcinoma
Assessment of the concordance of the initial clinical and histological diagnosis and to explore its prognostic impact in terms of risk of recurrence.

The skin cancer is a major public health problem whose incidence is increasing due to the aging population. Among them, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a daily concern the dermatologist. The recommendation of good practice for the BCC of support has been established according to French agency methodology in 2004 : "Agence Nationale d'Accréditation et d'Evaluation en Santé" (ANAES). This classification is based on clinical and pathological use of sometimes mismatched terminology pretending to clinical reality with discrepancies between the clinical appearance and histology. On the other hand the simplified classification of recommendations has never been tested and validated on a large series of BCC. Probabilistic margins applied based on clinical assessment of clinical and pathological subtype, it seems interesting to evaluate the consistency of the initial clinical diagnosis and histological diagnosis and to explore its prognostic impact in terms of risk of recurrence.

This study could lead to improved clinical and pathological classification and allow amending the current recommendations of the surgical management of the BCC.
