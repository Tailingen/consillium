Cardiac Output Optimization on Postoperative Complications in Major Hepatic Surgery
Major hepatectomies are high-risk surgeries offered more and more frequently for the curative treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer, and for complex cases, representing a real challenge for medical teams. The 1st peroperative phase of "hepatic resection" requires a minimum supply of filling fluids to limit perioperative bleeding (Low Central Venous Pressure). However this strategy exposes the risk of organ hypoperfusion due to low cardiac flow, secondary to hypovolaemia, which may lead to ischemic situations favoring the onset of postoperative complications. On the other hand, the hemodynamic management of the 2nd peroperative phase "post hepatic resection" is marked by the need to correct this hypoperfusion by optimizing cardiac output by suitable vascular filling.

The major challenge is thus to restore cardiac output by refilling without excess, by correcting the hypovolemia that arose during the "post resection of the hepatic parenchyma" phase.

Our hypothesis is that an individualized protocol for optimizing intraoperative cardiac flow by guided vascular filling during the "post hepatic resection" phase is accompanied by a reduction in postoperative complications in patients operated on for major hepatic surgery.
Primary or Metastatic Hepatic Adenocarcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Optimization of cardiac flow by base water-electrolyte supply|BEHAVIORAL: Control arm
Evaluation of the cardiac output optimization strategy on the occurrence of postoperative complications, Assessment of the impact of an individualized protocol for optimizing perioperative cardiac flow guided by monitoring of dynamic indices of preload dependence during the post-hepatic resection phase on the occurrence of postoperative complications in major hepatic surgery, for primary hepatic cancer or metastatic origin. We retain as the primary endpoint, the percentage of patients with at least one postoperative complication regardless of the grade in the Dindo-Clavien classification., From Day 1 to Day 30 post-surgery
Evaluation of grade III-IV postoperative complication in the Dindo-Clavien classification, To determine whether the strategy for optimizing cardiac output guided by dynamic dependence preload indices is associated with a difference in the incidence of occurrence of at least one grade III-IV postoperative complication in the Dindo-Clavien classification, From Day 1 to Day 30 post-surgery|Evaluation of length of stay in the hospital, To determine whether the cardiac output optimization strategy guided by the dynamic dependence preload indices is associated with a difference in the length of stay in the Continuing Care Unit, intensive care unit or length of hospital stay or on re-hospitalization rates, From Day 1 to Day 30 post-surgery|Evaluation of mortality, To determine whether the cardiac output optimization strategy guided by the dynamic dependence preload indices is associated with a difference in mortality at D30 and D90, On Day 1, Day 30 and Day 90 post-surgery|Evaluation occurrence of organ failures, To determine whether the cardiac output optimization strategy guided by dynamic dependence preload indices has an impact on the occurrence of organ failures, which will be evaluated by the SOFA score per device from Day 1 to Day 7 postoperatively, From Day 1 to Day 7 post-surgery|Evaluation of hemodynamic parameters, To determine whether the cardiac output optimization strategy guided by dynamic dependence preload indices is associated with a difference on hemodynamic parameters, From Day 0 to Day 1 post-surgery
