This study consists of phase Ia and Ib portions for patients with solid tumors.

Phase Ia portion is the standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with 0.1mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg of Mogamulizumab.

Phase Ib portion is the randomized study comparing 0.1mg/kg and tolerated dose of Mogamulizumab based on the phase Ia portion to pursue safer and immunologically more efficient dose.
