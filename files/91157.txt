The Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of Injectable SPN01 in Phase I.
The primary objective of this study is: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of injectable SPN01 in subjects. The secondary objective of this study is: to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of injectable SPN01 in subjects.The exploratory objectives of this study are: (1)to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of injectable SPN01 in subjects with colorectal cancer. (2) to evaluate the effect of the blood concentration of injectable SPN01 on the QTc interval. (3) to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of injectable SPN01 in humans.
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: SPN01 for Injection|OTHER: Placebo|DRUG: SPN01 for Injection
Safety and Tolerability, Safety and tolerability will be assessed through the monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests (including complete blood count, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, and urinalysis), local safety assessments, vital sign checks (including temperature, respiration rate, pulse rate, and blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical examinations.

Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0.

All adverse events occurring during the clinical trial will be recorded, including their clinical manifestations, severity, onset and resolution times, management measures, and outcomes. The correlation between AEs and the investigational drug will also be determined., Predose and up to 24 hours postdose
