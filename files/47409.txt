MESO-CAR T Cells Therapy for Relapsed and Refractory Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of anti-MESO antigen receptors (CARs) T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: anti-MESO CAR-T cells
Safety measured by occurrence of study related adverse effects defined by NCI CTCAE 4.0, 12 months post infusion
Overall complete remission rate defined by the standard response criteria for malignant lymphoma for each arm, 12 months post infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS) after administration, 12 months post infusion|Duration of CAR-positive T cells in circulation, 12 months post infusion|Detection of PD1 antibody in serum, 12 months post infusion
Primary Objectives

To determine the feasibility ad safety of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in treating patients with MESO-positive ovarian cancer.

Secondary Objectives

To access the efficacy of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in patients with ovarian cancer.

To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of anti- MESO CAR-T cells.
