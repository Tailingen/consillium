Orelabrutinib Maintenance Therapy After ASCT in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
A multicenter, randomized, prospective clinical study of the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib maintenance therapy after Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib
Progression free survival at 2 years, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Complete response rate at 1 years, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 1 years)|Overall survival at 2 years, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
This trial was designed as a multicenter, randomized controlled, prospective clinical study. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib maintenance therapy with ASCT in patients with primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in a prospective clinical study.

174 patients were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into Orelabrutinib maintenance group experimental group or observation group (control group) by 1:1. The trial included a screening period (day -28 to day -1), a treatment period (oral administration of Orelabrutinib 150mg daily for 1 year, beginning 8 weeks after autologous transplantation), and a follow-up period (1 year after the end of the last treatment).
