Safety and Effectiveness of BioTraceIO Lite for Tissue Damage Assessment Following Liver Tissue Ablation Procedures
Clinical study planned to demonstrate that the BioTraceIO Lite, available post-procedure, is effective at estimating the area of tissue damage as measured on 24-hour post-procedure (T=24hrs) CECT scan and that it is safe, based on an assessment of device-related Adverse Events.

Multi-center (up to 6 investigational sites) prospective single-arm clinical investigation 50 evaluable subjects total stratified by cancer type (primary hepatocellular carcinoma vs. secondary liver metastases).
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Metastatic Liver Cancer
DEVICE: BioTraceIO Lite
Safety - Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of device-related adverse events (including serious adverse events (SAE)) occurring between the beginning of the liver tissue ablation procedure and the completion of the T=24hrs contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan. There is no comparator for this endpoint., 1 year|Effectiveness - DICE, Paired comparison of the DICE similarity coefficient, assessed between BioTraceIO Lite, as measured at end of ablation procedure (T=0) and the tissue damage area based on 24-hours post-procedure CECT (T=24), and the DICE similarity coefficient, assessed between the tissue damage area based on immediately post-procedure CECT (T=0) and the tissue damage area based on 24-hours post-procedure CECT (T=24)., 1 year
Sensitivity, Sensitivity of the BioTraceIO Lite at T=0 compared to CECT at T=24hrs., 1 year|Precision, Precision of the BioTraceIO Lite at T=0 compared to CECT at T=24hrs., 1 year|Questionnaire - Effect of BioTraceIO, The proportion of subjects in whom the treating physician indicates that, if the BioTraceIO Lite results had been available for use in patient management, it would have impacted their follow-up plan for patient management, compared to the CECT alone., 1 year|Difference between T=0 and T=24hrs CECT tissue damage, Difference in percentage between tissue damage volume as visualized at T=0 contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) versus tissue damage volume as visualized at T=24hrs CECT., 1 year
Clinical study planned to demonstrate that the BioTraceIO Lite, available post-procedure, is effective at estimating the area of tissue damage as measured on 24-hour post-procedure (T=24hrs) contrast-enhanced CT scan and that it is safe, based on an assessment of device-related Adverse Events.

BioTraceIO Lite is intended to provide physicians with adjunctive information in their clinical assessment of tissue damage created by liver tissue ablation, as part of their overall post-procedure clinical assessment.
