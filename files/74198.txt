Fosaprepitant for the Prevention of Nausea and Emesis During Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is an opene-label, single center, randomized prospective pilot study to compare the efficacy of weekly versus triweekly fosaprepitant regimens for the prevention of nausea and emesis during concurrent chemoradiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Scheme:

Eligible fosaprepitant sensitive (complete response \[defined as no emesis and no use of rescue antiemetics\] during the overall phase \[0 to 120 hours\] of all cycles of cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy) NPC patients will be randomized to 2 arms at 1:1 ratio.

* Weekly Arm: fosaprepitant 150mg/m2 weekly in concurrent with radiotherapy during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
* Triweekly Arm: fosaprepitant 150mg/m2 triweekly in concurrent with chemotherapy during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
