Plinabulin vs. Pegfilgrastim in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Docetaxel Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy Phase 2
To assess the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in treatment Cycle 1 in patients treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (5, 10, or 20 mg/m2) or with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg). Neutrophils count was to be assessed at baseline (prior to Cycle 1 docetaxel dose) and during Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 15 (pre-dose on dosing days; times equivalent to pre dose on other days).
Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia
DRUG: Plinabulin|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim
DSN, Duration of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \< 0.5 Ã— 109/L), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), a parameter to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin by evaluating the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of the drug in the blood after administration of a single dose of the drug, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Area Under Curve (AUC), A parameter to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin to describe the variation of the drug concentration in blood plasma as a function of time, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Terminal Half-time (T1/2), A parameter to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin by measuring the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the plasma to be reduced by 50%, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Volume of Distribution in the Terminal Elimination Phase (Vz), A parameter to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin by evaluating Vz., 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Clearance (Cl), a parameter to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Systolic Blood Pressure, a parameter to establish the pharmacodynamic profile of plinabulin, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Diastolic Blood Pressure, a parameter to establish the pharmacodynamic profile of plinabulin, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose|Area Over the Neutropenia Curve, a parameter to establish the pharmacodynamic profile of plinabulin, 0, 0.5, 1, 4.5, 24 hours post-dose
55 patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC have been randomized with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows: Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m\^2) Arm 3: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m\^2) Arm 4: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m\^2)
