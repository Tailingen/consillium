Effect of Modified Stylet Angulation on the Intubation With GlideScope®
The GlideScope® videolaryngoscope usually visualize glottis better than the conventional laryngoscope. Under the visualization of glottis by GlideScope®, the insertion of endotracheal tube, however, is challenging.

The goal of this study was to determine which of two stylet (70° vs 90°) was better, as determined by time to intubation.
Cholecystitis|Stomach Cancer
PROCEDURE: Glidescope guided intubation|DEVICE: GlideScope®
Time to Intubation, Time from the insertion of the Glidescope blade to the measurement of end tidal CO2 (\>30 mmHg), Intraoperative intubation
Success Rate of Intubation, The number of patients in which the intubation was successful at the first time., Intraoperative intubation|Difficulty of Intubation Measured Using Visual Analogue Scale, Difficulty of intubation will be measured using visual analogue scale (0:easiest, 100:most difficult)., Intraoperative intubation|Number of Participants for Whom External Laryngeal Manipulation Was Necessary, External laryngeal manipulation is defined as the compression of neck for the facilitation of laryngeal view. Number of participants for whom external laryngeal manipulation was necessary will be measured., Intraoperative intubation|Cormack-Lehan Grade, The grade of Cormack-Lehan was assessed as I/II/III/IV (I: Full view of glottis, II: Partial view of glottis, III: Only epiglottis seen, none of glottis seen, IV: Neither glottis nor epiglottis seen). Grade I was considered better outcomes., Intraoperative intubation|Mallampati Grade, The Mallapati grade was assessed as I/II/III/IV (I: Soft palate, uvula, fauces, pillars visible, II: Soft palate, uvula, fauces visible, III: Soft palate, base of uvula visible, IV: Only hard palate visible). Grade I was considered better outcomes., Intraoperative anesthetic induction|Thyromental Distance, The thyromental distance was measured., Intraoperative anesthetic induction|Postoperative Sore Throat Measured Using Visual Analogue Scale, Postoperative sore throat will be measured using visual analogue scale (0:no pain, 100: worst pain imaginable), at 1, 24 hr postoperatively|Mean Blood Pressure, Mean blood pressure is measured before and 2 min after intubation., Intraoperative intubation|Heart Rate, Heart rates are measured before and 2 min after intubation., Intraoperative intubation|Airway Injury, Larynx injury is assessed., Intraoperative intubation
