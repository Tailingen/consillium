A Study of the Use of Irreversible Electroporation in Pancreatic Ductal Cancer
This I/II study will evaluate to see how safe and useful irreversible electroporation (also called NanoKnife) is in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Irreversible Electroporation|DEVICE: NanoKnife System
Adverse event rate, 30 days post IRE or index hospitalization|Overall survival rate, Date of IRE treatment to the date of death, up to 2 years
Progression-free survival rate, IRE treatment to the date of documented disease progression or death, up to 2 years|Overall survival rate of disease, Date of disease diagnosis to date of death, up to 2 years|Progression-free survival rate of disease, Date of disease diagnosis to date of death, up to 2 years
In this phase I/II trial, patients with locally advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma will be assigned to receive interventional treatment of irreversible electroporation (IRE).

IRE will be performed by laparotomy under general anesthesia in the operating room.

All patients enrolled in the study will have a biopsy at the time of laparotomy. Blood will be collected for regular blood tests and correlative studies at baseline and during the study. Computed tomography (CT) scans will be done at baseline, 4 weeks post treatment, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 36 weeks follow up. Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires will be completed at baseline and during the study. Patients will be given optional consent for storage of any leftover tissue and blood samples for future analysis. Patients will be followed up 4 weeks post treatment, then every 12 weeks until death.
