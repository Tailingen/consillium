activity of regorafenib screening, in terms of 2-months progression free survival rate, to evaluate activity of regorafenib, in terms of 2-months progression free survival rate, 2 months
prognosis in terms of progression-free survival, to explore the prognosis in terms of progression-free survival calculated from the first day of regorafenib treatment to the date of tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first., 36 months|overall survival (OS), to explore overall survival (OS) measured from the first day of regorafenib treatment until the date of death from any cause or the date of the last contact, at which the patients will be censored, 36 months|safety profile of regorafenib according to NCI-CTC v.3, to assess the safety profile of regorafenib according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3, 3 months
Each tumour will be assessed by itself. Regorafenib 40 mg tablets will be used in the study. Subjects will receive 160 mg regorafenib po every day (qd) for 3 weeks of every 4 week cycle (i.e., 3 weeks on, 1 week off).

Subjects will continue on treatment until at least one of the following occurs (main criteria):

* Progressive Disease (PD) by radiological assessments or clinical progression
* Death
* Unacceptable toxicity
* Subject withdraws consent
* Treating physician determines discontinuation of treatment is in the subject's best interest
* Substantial non-compliance with the protocol
