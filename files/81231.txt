Surgical Site Infection Rates Associated with Antibiotic Bowel Prep, Rate of surgical site infection rate as associated with or without use of antibiotic bowel preparation, 2019-2021
This is a retrospective chart review study. Patients who underwent scheduled intra-abdominal surgery with a WellSpan gynecologic oncologist will be identified and their chart reviewed for demographic data of age, race, BMI, comorbidities, and type of surgery. Those patients who had a deep organ/space surgical site infection within 30 days postoperatively will be identified. The numbers of these infections before and after August 2020, at which time all patients moving forwards were prescribed antibiotic bowel preparation, will then be statistically analyzed and compared to see if the institution of the antibiotic bowel preparation was associated with a reduction in surgical site infection.
