BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab
Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process C Relative to the Cmax of Ipilimumab Manufactured by Process B - Evaluable Pharmacokinetic Population, Single-dose Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ipilimumab were derived from serum concentration versus time data. Cmax was measured from first dose to end of the induction period (4 doses) as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL). Samples were obtained at 0 hour (predose) on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10; Day 1, samples were also obtained 1 h 30 minutes (min), 2 h, 2 h 30 min, 3 h 30 min, 4 h 30 min, and 6 h post dose.
