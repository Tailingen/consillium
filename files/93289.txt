Endometrial Scratching During Laproscopic Ovarian Drilling in Subfertile PCOS Women
Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling is a valid procedure for infertile anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome who failed to get pregnant or to ovulate with ovulation induction medications as clomiphene citrate or exogenous gonadotropins. The reasearchers supposed that endometrial curettage at time of laparoscopic ovarian drilling may boost fertility in these women.
Infertility|Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Endometrial Currettage
live birth rate per woman randomized, 15 months
pregnancy rate per woman randomised, 6 months
miscarriage rate time to pregnancy interval, 6 months
Current literature suggests that endometrial biopsy may improve pregnancy rates in infertile women hence the investigators will examine whether this hypothesis will apply to infertile PCOS women undergoing laparoscopic ovarian drilling to overcome ovulatory disfunction or not.
