Study of CD19 Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor Positive T Cells (CAR-T) in ALL and NHL
It is a treatment that activates and strengthens the immune system against cancer. Recently, T cell receptors have been genetically rearranged by adaptive T cell therapies, which are promising in the fight against cancer, and are now able to recognize antigens on tumor cells. These modified T cell receptors are called chimeric antigen receptors. Many previous clinical studies have shown that different CAR-T cells are effective in relapse / refractory B cell cancers and NHL.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Car-T Cell Therapy
Incidence of Adverse Events, Type, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities., 6 Months
Complete Remission Rate, It is determined by the evaluation of complete remission (CR) obtained in the first 3 months., 3 Months|Total Response Rate, CR obtained in the first 3 months is determined by evaluation of partial remission, incomplete partial remission and stable disease responses., 3 Months|Duration of Remission (DOR), Duration of remission (DOR) is defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of CR or CRi is first met to the date of relapse or death due to underlying cancer, whichever occurs first., 6 Months|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS) is measured by the time from achievement of CR or CRi whatever occurs first to relapse or death due to any cause during CR or CRi., 6 Months|Progression Free Survival, Only in the NHL is the duration from CAR T cell infusion to progression, 6 Months|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Event free survival (EFS) is the time from date of first Car-T cell infusion to the earliest of the following:

* Death from any cause
* Relapse, 6 Months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is the time from date of first Car-T Cell infusion to the date of death due to any reason., 6 Months|Duration to maximum response, The duration from date of the first Car-T cell infusion to complete remission in ALL.

The duration from date of the first Car-T cell infusion to complete remission and partial remission in NHL, 6 Months|The impact of baseline tumor burden on response, Best overall response will be summarized by baseline tumor burden (MRD, extramedullary disease, etc.), 6 Months|The relationship between CRS/CRES efficiency, The relationship between CRS / CRES grades and total response rates are determined by correlation between DOR, RFS, EFS, PFS, OS., 6 Months|The relationship between the total response and Car-T Cell persistence, The relationship between total response and the number of Car-T copies is determined by the correlation between DOR, RFS, EFS, PFS, OS, 6 Months|The relationship between Car-T Cell product content and responses, The relationship between Car-T Cell subgroups and total response are determined by the correlation between DOR, RFS, EFS, PFS, OS., 6 Months|Car-T cell proliferation capability, The relationship between the Car-T Cell proliferation capability and the total response, are determined by the correlation between DOR, RFS, EFS, PFS, OS., 6 months|The relationship between MRD grade and clinical response, The relationship between MRD grade and total response are determined by correlation between DOR, RFS, EFS, PFS, OS., 6 Months|The relationship between the incidence of immune response to Car-T cells and the persistence of Car-T cell, It is assessed as the relationship between antiserum effectivity against Car-T cells and Car-T cell copy number in blood., 6 Months
Clinical trials of CAR-T cell therapy started at the end of 1990s. Phase I and II trials have still evaluated the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells in hematological and solid cancers. The therapy involves drawing blood from patients and isolation of the T cells. Next, the T cells are genetically engineered in a laboratory by using virus or sleeping beauty to produce receptors on their surface named as chimeric antigen receptors. As the last step, the CAR-T cells are infused back into the patient. After infusion, it is expected that the CAR-T cells further increase in number in the patient's body and with the help of their engineered receptor to recognize and target the antigen on the surface of the cancerous cells for antitumor effect.
