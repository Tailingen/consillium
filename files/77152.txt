Biomarkers in Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is studying bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Define somatic mutations occurring in de novo AML, 1 month
OBJECTIVES:

* To rigorously examine fractionated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
* To define somatic mutations occurring in de novo AML, including the FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, NPM1, TET2, ASXL1, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations.
* To examine what cellular compartments (LT-HSC, ST-HSC, CMP, GMP, and MEP) contain the selected mutations and in what order those mutations occur.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow specimens are analyzed for sequencing and detection of mutations by Sanger-based resequencing of PCR amplicons. Results are then compared with the results of age-matched healthy controls.
