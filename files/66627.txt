Preoperative Localization of Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer Patients By Novel Computed Tomography-Lymphography Guided Technique
A question is raised about the possibility of accurate localization of the SLN (sentinel lymph node) detected by CTLG (Computed Tomography Lymphography) which offers a detection rate of 100% in many studies In Oncology center, Mansoura University (OCMU), the surgical oncology unit had a previous experience in using charcoal for localization of non-palpable suspicious breast lesions and it showed promising results in comparison to traditional localization methods In addition, we had another study using silver wire for localization of breast masses before neoadjuvant therapy.

In the study, the investigators will study the usage of both methods as preoperative localization methods for the SLN detected by CT lymphography in breast cancer patients The investigators suppose that this method can offer two main advantages over the traditional SLN intraoperative methods which are; saving operative time needed for the intraoperative procedure as well as solving the problem of the need for complex logistic preparations especially for the usage of radioisotope method.
