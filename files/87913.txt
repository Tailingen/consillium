Perioperative Treatment of Resectable Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction by Immunotherapy (Adebrelimab) Combined With Chemotherapy (XELOX): a Prospective, Single-center, Feasibility Study
The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (Adebrelimab, a PD-L1 inhibitor) combined with standard chemotherapy (XELOX) in the perioperative treatment of resectable esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.
Esophagogastric Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Adebrelimab (anti-PD-L1) + XELOX
Pathological complete response rate (ITT), The proportion of subjects with no cancer cells in the primary tumor and lymph node specimens (ypT0N0), From date of enrolment until surgical resection, an average of 3 months
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the immunotherapy (Adebrelimab) combined with standard chemotherapy (XELOX) in the perioperative treatment of resectable esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. Potential study participants will be assessed for eligibility during a 28-day screening period that includes central verification of clinical stage and eligibility. Eligible patients will be receive perioperative treatment with adebrelimab with XELOX. Location of the primary (GEJ type I vs. GEJ type II/III vs. stomach), and PD-L1-status (CPSâ‰¥5 vs. CPS\<5). Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H vs MSI-L) will be will be given special attention.
