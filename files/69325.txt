Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy + Surgery Versus Surgery in FIGO IB2 and IIA2 Cervical Cancer
To clarify the potential benefits of NACT before radical surgery(RS), we perform a phase III, randomised controlled trial to compare NACT plus RS with RS alone in patients with stages IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancer.
PFS|OS|Quality of Life
DRUG: NACT (Paclitaxel + Cisplatin or carboplatin)|PROCEDURE: radical surgery
Disease free survival, 2 years
overall survival, 5 years|quality of life, 3 years
Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancer are eligible for our study. They will receive paclitaxel + cisplatin(TP)/carboplatin(TC) regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) 3 cycles followed by radical surgery (RS) (type III to V radical hysterectomy plus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy) (arm A) or directly radical surgery (arm B). Postoperative pelvic radiotherapy will be started within 6 weeks after surgery if the patients have pelvic lymph node metastasis, parametrial involvement, deep stromal invasion or positive margin. Extended-field external beam therapy, delivering a dose of 4500cGy by a four-field technique, will be administered to patients with positive para-aortic nodes. High-dose rate brachytherapy will be delivered to the vaginal stump if patients have positive surgical margins. The primary end point is 2-years progression-free survival, The secondary end points is overall survival , rate of response to TP or TC regimen chemotherapy and the quality of life.
