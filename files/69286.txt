Isatuximab in Combination With REGN2810 (Cemiplimab) in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
Primary Objectives:

* To characterize the safety and tolerability of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810 in participants with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were naÃ¯ve to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-containing therapy, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1-containing therapy, and to confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
* To assess the response rate of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810 in participants with either mCRPC who were anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy naive, or NSCLC who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, or of isatuximab as single agent in participants with mCRPC.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety of the combination of isatuximab with REGN2810 or isatuximab monotherapy.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab and REGN2810.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab single agent or in combination with REGN2810, and to characterize the PK of REGN2810 in combination with isatuximab.
* To assess overall efficacy of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810 or as a single agent.
