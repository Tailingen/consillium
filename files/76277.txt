Pacritinib Versus Best Available Therapy to Treat Myelofibrosis
Phase 3, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral pacritinib compared to Best Available Therapy (BAT) in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis.
Primary Myelofibrosis|Post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis|Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Pacritinib|DRUG: Best Available Therapy
Spleen Volume Reduction, Number of patients achieving a â‰¥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), Baseline to Week 24
Total Symptom Score (TSS) Reduction, Number of patients with \>= 50% reduction in total score from baseline to week 24 on the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0 (MPN-SAF TSS 2.0). Responses (on a scale from 0 \[absent\] to 10 \[worst imaginable\]) to questions about symptoms (tiredness, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, pruritus, bone pain, and pain under the ribs on the left side) were used to calculate the TSS., Baseline to Week 24
Multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of pacritinib with that of BAT in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis. Approximately 322 eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to pacritinib (400mg QD) or BAT (includes any physician-selected treatment for myelofibrosis with the exclusion of JAK inhibitors (inhibitors of Janus kinases)). Spleen volume will be measured by MRI or CT at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter. An independent radiology facility (IRF), blind to treatment assignments, will measure spleen volumes. Patients will also be followed for safety, Leukemia Free Survival (LFS), Overall Survival (OS), frequency of red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions, and other exploratory endpoints. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate the safety of pacritinib.
