Catumaxomab for Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in Patients With Gastric Adenocarcinomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of catumaxomab by determination of the rate of macroscopic complete remissions of peritoneal carcinomatosis after treatment with one cycle (four doses) of catumaxomab followed by six cycles of routine neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis|Siewert Type II Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis|Siewert Type III Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: catumaxomab, Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel|DRUG: Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel
Rate of macroscopic complete remissions of peritoneal carcinomatosis, Macroscopic complete response (mCR) rate of the peritoneal lesions, as resulting from the second diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy performed after chemotherapy., Assessment after 14 - 18 weeks after start of treatment
Surgical resection rate (R0, R1, R2), All tumor evaluation is performed according to RECIST, Assessment after 14 - 18 weeks after start of treatment|Overall survival (OS), The duration of overall survival (OS) will be determined by measuring the time interval from randomization to the date of death or last observation (censored)., Assessment over minimum 16 months up to 3 years|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival (DFS) will be defined as the time from surgery, resulting in a R0 finding and macroscopic complete remission of PC, to the time of disease progression or relapse (according to RECIST) or death, or to the date of last assessment without any such event (censored observation). Patients with evidence of disease at surgery are counted as having the event at time = 0., Assessment over minimum 16 months up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from randomization to the time of disease progression or relapse (according to RECIST) or death, or to the date of last assessment without any such event (censored observation)., Assessment over minimum 16 months up to 3 years|Frequency, relationship, and severity of AEs, Assessment over minimum 16 months up to 3 years|Immunoreaction against tumor in tissue samples, blood and tumor tissue from every patient assed at 2time points. the first Laparoscopy (before randomization)and the second Laparoscopy (after chemotherapy), 14 - 18 weeks|Detection of disseminated tumor cells via PCR, blood and tumor tissue from every patient assessed at 2time points. the first Laparoscopy (before randomization) and the second Laparoscopy (after chemotherapy), 14 - 18 weeks
