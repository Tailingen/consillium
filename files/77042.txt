Total Neoadjuvant Treatment Combined With Adaptive Radiotherapy for Rectal Cancer
Diarrhea was the most frequently reported severe adverse event in the treatment regime of pre-operative sequential short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy (so called total neo-adjuvant treatment).

This study therefore investigates the benefit of on-couch adaptation for locally advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing this treatment regime.
Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: On-couch adaptive radiotherapy
Incidence of acute gastro-intestinal toxicity equal or higher than grade 2, Incidence of acute gastro-intestinal toxicity from therapy graded according to CTCAE ver. 5., Up to administration of the last course of chemotherapy or week 22, whichever comes first
Number of participants that require alteration of chemotherapy due to toxicity, Alterations of chemotherapy, defined as dose-reduction or pre-maturely stopping chemotherapy administration, From treatment week 3 up to week 20|Number of patients with disease related treatment failure, Disease-related treatment failure include the first of any of the following events:

(i) During treatment: Non-radical resection of primary tumor (R2 resection) or un-fit of for surgery due to progression, death from treatment (ii) During, or after treatment: Loco-regional recurrence (including regrowth after potential watch-and-wait), distant metastasis (including M re-staging at surgery), death from rectal cancer, second primary rectal cancer., 5 years after surgery|Number of patients with pathological complete response (pCR), pCR after completion of the intended or tolerated TNT, At surgery i.e. in treatment week 23-28|Tumour regression grade, Radiological based clinical response evaluation on MR (mrTRG), Baseline to response evaluation on MR in up to week 25 of the study|Overall survival, Overall survival from time of inclusion until death, Follow-up until 5 years or death|Incidence of late gastro-intestinal toxicity equal or higher than grade 2, Incidence of late gastro-intestinal events (e.g.diarrhea, rectal hemorrhage, rectal and/or abdominal pain) from therapy graded according to CTCAE ver. 5., 5 years
Bowel exposure, Radiation dose to bowel, Treatment week 1-2|Immunogenic alterations from TNT, Presence of selected immune cells, Baseline and at surgery i.e. in treatment week 23-28|Perfusion changes on MR, Changes in perfusion from contrast-enhanced MR, Baseline and at MR response evaluation up to week 25 of the study|Diffusion changes on MR, Changes in diffusion from diffusion-weighted MR, Baseline and at MR response evaluation up to week 25 of the study|Patient reported general outcome measures, Quality of life using EORTC qlq-c30 questionnaire, Baseline and up to 5 years of the study|Patient reported colo-rectal outcome measures, Quality of life using EORTC qlq-cr29 questionnaire, Baseline and up to 5 years of the study|Patient reported bowel-related outcome measures, Quality of life using low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score, Baseline and up to 5 years of the study
This is a prospective single-arm study investigating the benefit of on-couch adaptation for locally advanced rectal cancer patients prescribed with pre-operative sequential short-course radiotherapy (RT) followed by Oxaliplatin-combined chemotherapy (mFOLFOX(6) or CAPOX). On-couch adaptation, where the radiation dose is tailored to the anatomy of the patient at each radiotherapy session. Firstly, the study will investigate if on-couch adaptation result in less gastro-intestinal adverse events, secondly it will reveal if this possible reduction lead to more patients being able to fulfill all cycles of prescribed chemotherapy.
