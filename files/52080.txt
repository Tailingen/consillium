Phase 1 Trial of Intravenously Administered Nerofeâ„¢ in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This study will be the first to test the anti-cancer peptide Nerofe in humans. It will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic behavior, and pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of Nerofe given intravenously every other day to patients with advanced malignant disease.

Pharmacodynamic effects of Nerofe, through the measurement of serum concentrations of biomarkers (including cytokines and circulating soluble T1/ST2 receptor) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of T1/ST2 receptor, Up to 6 months|Clinical effects of Nerofe on cancer, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Up to 6 months|Pharmacokinetic behavior of Nerofe: plasma concentrations in ng/mL, Pre-dose (Cycle 1 Days 1 and 29 only); and 0.25, 1, 2, 4h, 6, 8, and 24h following the end of infusion (Cycle 1 Days 1 and 29)|Pharmacokinetic behavior of Nerofe: plasma half-life in minutes, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 29|Relationship between pretreatment fresh/archival tumor tissue T1/ST2 receptor expression and biological activity of Nerofe, Up to 6 months
This is a Phase 1 single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in 2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Nerofe and evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical effects. The subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of Nerofe. Subjects will be treated with IV doses of Nerofe thrice weekly (on alternating days) in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal criteria may continue to receive Nerofe for up to 6 cycles, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the Clinical Safety Committee.
