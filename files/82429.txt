The Long Non Coding MALAT1 as a Potential Salivary Diagnostic Biomarker in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Through Targeting mi RNA 124
Objective: is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of lncRNA MALAT1 as a potential salivary biomarker of OSCC as well as assessment of the salivary expression level of miRNA 124 which is targeted by MALAT1. Materials and Methods: Saliva Samples were collected for the quantitative determination of salivary "MALAT1 and mi RNA -124" using quantitative Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction technique for the two study groups, Group A: 20 patients with a diagnosis suggestive of OSCC and Group B: 20 age-and-sex-matched healthy individuals, as normal controls.
