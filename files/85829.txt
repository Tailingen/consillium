Body Warming in Improving Blood Flow and Oxygen Delivery to Tumors in Patients With Cancer
This randomized pilot clinical trial studies body warming in improving blood flow and oxygen delivery to tumors in patients with cancer. Heating tumor cells to several degrees above normal body temperature may kill tumor cells.
Adult Liver Carcinoma|Breast Carcinoma|Colon Carcinoma|Kidney Neoplasm|Lung Carcinoma|Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm|Malignant Neoplasm|Melanoma|Ovarian Neoplasm|Soft Tissue Sarcoma
PROCEDURE: Hyperthermia Treatment|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Changes in tumor vascular (blood flow, blood volume), The primary analysis will be implemented using an analysis-of-covariance model for both blood flow and blood volume., Baseline to 24-88 hours
Changes in tumor vascular measures, Baseline to 88-264 hours|Incidence of adverse events graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, The frequency of toxicities will be tabulated by grade across all dose levels and cycles. The frequency of toxicities will also be tabulated for the dose estimated to be the maximum tolerated dose., Up to 30 days post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 2 different Body Warming to Alter (Thermo) Regulation and the Microenvironment (B-WARM) regimens on altering tumor blood flow in patients with a variety of malignancies.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if duration and thermal dose of B-WARM changes duration and extent of tumor blood flow changes in patients with a variety of malignancies.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees Celsius (C) for 30 minutes.

ARM II: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees C for 2 hours.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days.
