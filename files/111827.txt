Safety and Preliminary Anti-Tumor Activity of TYRA-430 in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Other Solid Tumors With Activating FGF/FGFR Pathway Aberrations
A Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-430 in cancers with FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations, including locally advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and other advanced solid tumors.

This is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human, Phase 1 global study of TYRA-430, a first-in-class, selective, reversible fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 4 and 3 inhibitor, in locally advanced/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and other advanced solid tumors that contain FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations.
