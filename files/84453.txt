MelPRO-0322 (CRISTINA Trial) [miCrobiome pRedIctS aPD1 effecTivnes In melaNoma pAtietns]
The goal of this observational study is to learn about if new biomarkers such as gut microbiota and molecular genetics melanoma features could predict clinical radiological and pathological response to neoadjuvant monotherapy with anti-PD1 agents in patients with resectable stage IIIB-D melanoma. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* radiological and pathological response rate to three doses of antiPD1 agents;
* do radiological and pathological responses correlate with gut microbiota and melanoma molecular genetics features Participants will receive three doses of aPD1 monotherapy as per center routine practice and will undergo regional lymphadenectomy. Before treatment initiation patients will be asked to bring faeces probes and fill out dietary questionnaire as well as just before the surgery.

After sugery adjuvant therapy will be prescribed for 12 month and patients will be followed up according to institutional routine practice for 5 years.
Melanoma, Skin|Melanoma Stage Iii
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Gut microbiota analysis
2-year disease-free survival, 2-year disease-free survival: time from surgery to disease recurrence (either locoregional or distant) or death from any cause, time from surgery and up to 2 years follow up
pathological response rate, Rate of pathological complete response, near-to-pCR, non-pCR/disease progression, from enrollment to surgery (in average up to 20 weeks)
biomarker reproducibility, Gut microbiota isolation and 16S-RNA clusterization, from enrollment to end of the study follow up (in average during 6 months since randomization)
The clinical efficacy of PD1 inhibitors on the 2-year recurrence-free survival of patients with resectable stage III B-D melanoma will be assessed. This indicator will be compared with a historical control group using adjuvant PD1 immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Various factors will be analyzed for their potential impact on immunotherapy effectiveness, including demographics, disease stage and sub-stage, molecular-genetic status of the tumor, composition of the tumor\&#39;s lymphoid infiltrate, LDH levels, gut microbiome composition, radiological and pathological response to treatment, and the development of immune-mediated adverse events. These findings may help optimize treatment by implementing neoadjuvant therapy for stage III B-D cutaneous melanoma.
