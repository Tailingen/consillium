Chemoradiotherapy With or Without Enteral Nutrition for Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Carcinoma
This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter study.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Enteral Nutrition Therapy|Chemoradiotherapy
DRUG: Enteral nutrition|RADIATION: radiotherapy
Body Weight Change from baseline to the end of treatment, Body weight change from baseline to the end of treatment = body weight at the end of treatment - baseline body weight., up to 1 month after the treatment
Maximum Body Weight Change during treatment, Maximum body weight change during treatment= the lowest body weight during treatment - baseline body weight., up to 1 month after the treatment|Blood biochemical examination, albumin, haemoglobin,et al, up to 1 month after the treatment|Grade 3-5 toxicity, Grade 3-5 adverse events as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0 andthe criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ，such as esophagitis、pneumonitis 、hematologic toxicity and infection rate, up to 1 month after the treatment|Completion rate of chemoradiotherapy, The proportion of people who complete all treatment as required, up to 1 month after the treatment|short-term effect, objective remission rate, up to 1 month after the treatment|Overall Survival, overall survival, at least 2 years
This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter study. The aim of this study was to compare the changes of body weight,survival,toxicity,quality of life and opportunistic infection frequency in Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma between and after chemoradiotherapy with or without enteral nutrition therapy.
