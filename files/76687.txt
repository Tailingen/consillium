Daratumumab, Ixazomib, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone as Salvage Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate of patients with Multiple Myeloma to the combination of Daratumumab, Ixazomib, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Ixazomib|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Daratumumab-Hyaluronidase-Fihj@1,800 Mg-30,000 Unit/15 mL@SUBCUT@VIAL (ML)
Overall Response Rate, Anti-cancer response as defined by the International Uniform Response Criteria Consensus Recommendations, 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Treatment-emergent Grade 2-5 adverse events (AEs) will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v4.03 toxicity criteria, 2 years
Clinical benefit rate, CBR: minimal response +ORR, 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment until objective tumor progression or death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Time to progression, Time to progression is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment until objective tumor progression., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Assessment on the presence of minimal residual disease for those in stringent complete response, 1 year|Quality of life (QOL) scores, Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire and EORTC QLQ-MY20, 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate of patients with Multiple Myeloma to the combination of Daratumumab, Ixazomib, Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone.

The drugs being used in this study are daratumumab ixazomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer by interfering with proteasomes (the protein breakdown mechanism in the cells). Pomalidomide, and dexamethasone are standard drugs that can change and regulate the immune system and may stop cancer cells from growing. Both Ixazomib and Daratumumab are approved for use in Multiple Myeloma, but not in this combination.
