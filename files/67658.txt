Ruxolitinib in Combination With Nilotinib in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Patients
This study is designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose of Ruxolitinib in combination with nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with nilotinib. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 study design. If 2 or more participants within a cohort experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then the MTD will have been exceeded and the preceding dose level will be evaluated as the MTD. A minimum of 6 participants must be evaluated at the dose level in order for it to be declared as the MTD.

Dose limiting toxicity is defined as:

* Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade three, excluding any untreated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fatigue that occurs during the first 56 days of therapy.
* Grade three thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or grade four thrombocytopenia or febrile neutropenia (ANC \<500 cells/µL and fever \> 101.0 F (38.5C)).
* Any treatment related grade five toxicity (i.e., death)., Average of 6 months
Complete Molecular Response Rate, Complete molecular response rate (CMR \>4.5 log reduction) after the treatment combination., Up to 36 months
This study is designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose of Ruxolitinib in combination with nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
