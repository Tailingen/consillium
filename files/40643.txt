Bacterial Decolonization to Prevent Radiation-induced Oral Mucositis
The purpose of this study is to determine whether bacterial decolonization of the nares prior to treatment with radiotherapy (RT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, can prevent high-grade radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) and improve quality of life.

This study is being conducted because a randomized clinical trials form Yana Kost et al. have found bacterial decolonization in the nose prior to initiation of RT was effective for prevention of acute radiation dermatitis.

Patients in the treatment arm will receive pretreatment with mupirocin ointment to the nares while patients in the control arm will receive standard of care treatment. Bacterial cultures will be taken from the nares and mouth, and participants will also complete a quality of life questionnaire before and after RT.

DRUG: Mupirocin Ointment
High-grade radiation-induced oral mucositis, Grade 3 or higher radiation-induced oral mucositis according to RTOG, radiation-induced oral mucositis(graded by the RTOG) will be assessed at the last treatment session (study week depends on patient's length of treatment, but ranges from 6 weeks to 8 weeks)
High-grade radiation dermatitis, Grade 3 or higher radiation-induced dermatitis according to RTOG, Radiation dermatitis (graded by the CTCAE) will be assessed at the last treatment session (study week depends on patient's length of treatment, but ranges from 6 weeks to 8 weeks)|Quality of Life according QLQ-H&N43, EORTC QLQ-H\&N43, Quality of Life (according QLQ-H&N43) will be assessed at the last treatment session (study week depends on patient's length of treatment, but ranges from 6 weeks to 8 weeks)
