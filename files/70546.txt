A Study to Evaluate Avastin in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy to Treat Colorectal Cancer
This is a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhuMAb VEGF (Avastin) added to the standard first-line chemotherapy used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. This trial will enroll approximately 900 subjects with histologically confirmed, previously untreated, bi-dimensionally measurable metastatic colorectal cancer.
