Antimicrobial Catheter Securement Dressings for the Prevention of Cvc-related Bloodstream Infections in Cancer Patients
In neutropenic cancer patients, catheter-related bloodstream infections may cause severe infections and even death. To assess the prophylactic effect of a chlorhexidine coated catheter securement dressing on the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections, this open, randomized trial is being carried out. CHG iv Tegaderm securement dressing will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion against Tegaderm Advanced iv securement dressing.
