A Clinical Study of HLX10 Combined With Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Combined With Chemotherapy for Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Treatment of Gastric Cancer
This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of HLX10 combined with chemotherapy versus placebo combined with chemotherapy for neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment of gastric cancer.

Subjects will be randomized to the following two arms at 1: 1 ratio:

* Arm A (HLX10 arm): HLX10 combined with chemotherapy will be adopted in the neoadjuvant treatment phase, and HLX10 monotherapy will be administered in the adjuvant treatment phase;
* Arm B (control arm): Placebo combined with chemotherapy will be given in the neoadjuvant treatment phase, and chemotherapy alone will be administered during the adjuvant treatment phase.

Chemotherapy regimen SOX (oxaliplatin + tegafor gimeracil oteracil potassium (S-1)) will be used in the neoadjuvant treatment phase in Arm A and B, and in the adjuvant treatment phase in Arm B.

After randomization, subjects will receive a total of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with the mentioned treatment regimen.Surgery will be performed within 3-6 weeks after the last cycle of neoadjuvant treatment.All subjects who have completed the surgery will be unblinded after surgery, and adjuvant treatment will be started 3 to 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects randomized to Arm A (HLX10 arm) will continue to receive HLX10 monotherapy for up to 17 cycles (12 months).Subjects in Arm B after surgery (control arm) will continue to use chemotherapy alone (oxaliplatin + S-1) for 5 cycles.
