Early Enteral Feeding After Pylorus Preserving Pancreatoduodenectomy
Pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications. These postoperative complications could delay postoperative resumption of adequate oral intake. Clinical study on postoperative feeding after pancreaticoduodenectomy is very limited. Method of Nutritional support (Enteral feeding or total parenteral support)after pancreaticoduodenectomy is controversial.

1. To evaluate whether early enteral nutrition may be a suitable alternative to total parenteral nutrition
2. To evaluate whether enteral feeding improve nutritional status after pancreaticoduodenectomy
Pancreas Cancer|Bile Duct Cancer|Ampulla of Vater Cancer
PROCEDURE: Enteral Feeding and Total Parental Support
To evaluate the impact of early postoperative enteral feeding, Postoperative 21 days
To evaluate the nutritional status, Postoperative 6 months
Pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications. These postoperative complications could delay postoperative resumption of adequate oral intake. The use of TPN significantly increases postoperative complications, especially those associate with infections. However, method of Nutritional support (Enteral feeding or total parenteral support)after pancreaticoduodenectomy is controversial.

1. To evaluate whether early enteral nutrition may be decreased the postoperative complications
2. To evaluate whether enteral feeding improve nutritional status after pancreaticoduodenectomy
3. To determine the optimal method for postoperative nutritional support
