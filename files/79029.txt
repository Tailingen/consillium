Enterotomy Closure and Minimally Invasive Gastrectomy
All consecutive patients from January 2009 to december 2019 who underwent minimally invasive partial gastrectomy for gastric cancer at thirteen high volume institutions will be retrospective analysed to assess the better way to fashion a handsewn intracorporeal enterotomy closure after a stapled anastomosis.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Totally intracorporeal distal gastrectomy
Postoperative complications, The better way to fashion enterotomy closure, 1 month
Different ways to fashion intracorporeal anstomoses will be investigated: robotic vs laparoscopic approach; laparoscopic HD vs 3D vs 4K technologies; single layer vs double layer enterotomy closure. Additionally double layer enterotomies will be analysed layer by layer, comparing running vs interrupted suture, presence vs absence of deep corner suture and type of suture thread (barbed, braided, non braided suture)
