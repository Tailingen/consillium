Utility and Usability of ActivSight™ Laser Speckle Imaging in Visualization of Tissue Perfusion and Blood Flow During Esophageal Surgery in Humans
ActivSight™ combines an innovative form factor and proprietary software to deliver precise, objective, real-time visualization of blood flow and tissue perfusion intraoperatively for laparoscope-based surgery. A small adaptor that fits between any existing laparoscope and camera systems and a separate light source placed along any current commercial system will deliver objective real-time tissue perfusion and blood flow information intraoperatively.

Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility of ActivSight™ in detecting and displaying tissue perfusion and blood flow in the conduit and foregut anastomoses in esophageal resection/reconstructive surgery. The investigators will compare the precision and accuracy among the naked eye inspection, ICG and LSCI in assessing the vascularity of the conduit.

Incidence of Adverse Events in 28 days following use of ActivSight™, To determine safety of ActivSight™ in patients undergoing esophageal surgery, as defined through clinical assessments and evaluation of use related adverse events intraoperatively and a routine follow up at 28 days following surgery. ActivSight™ will be deemed safe if no hardware (adaptor or light source)-related major (serious) adverse event is encountered in the treated patients and if less than 2 hardware-related minor adverse events are encountered.

Adverse events will be summarized descriptively and tabulations on the type, severity, and relationship to application will be performed and any changes of outcomes from baseline on follow up will be examined using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank test., 28 days|Preparation time of ActivSight™., Rate on a scale of 1-5 (1 = Difficult to use or Unsatisfied - 5 = no training required or very satisfied): How easy was ActivSight to set up?, 1 day|Latency of display of ActivSight™., Rate on a scale of 1-5 (1 = Difficult to use or Unsatisfied - 5 = no training required or very satisfied): How specifically did ActivSight display the intended field and the target tissue of interest?, 1 day|Resolution and objectivity of display of ActivSight™., Rate on a scale of 1-5 (1 = Difficult to use or Unsatisfied - 5 = no training required or very satisfied): How was the display quality of ActivSight on the intended field and target tissue of interest?, 1 day|Specificity of display of ActivSight™., Specificity of display will serve as an outcome for feasibility.

Design:

* This is a prospective interventional cross-over study where ActivSight™ will be used in sequence to the standard practice of visualizing perfusion status of the conduit using the naked eye visual inspection and ICG during esophageal resection.
* Feasibility will be determined by technically successful completion of intended visualization.
* Safety will be determined through clinical assessments and evaluation of any adverse event.
* Assessment of preliminary efficacy will be performed through analysis of any intraoperative decisions made based on visual display as compared to standard endoscopic approach, or non-inferiority to ICG-based visualization and usability.
* Patient outcome and follow up to Postoperative day 28 will be monitored for clinical outcome.
* Target enrollment for the assessment of esophageal anastomoses is a total of seventy patients powered to detect \~ 2-3 cm discordance between ICG and LSCI lines of demarcation between well vascularized and less vascularized sites in the gastric conduit. Since ActivSight™ can detect the difference of \> 2 cm between perfused versus less perfused in comparison to ICG with 80 % confidence at p\<0.05 in a sample size of n = 21, the investigators estimate that the study will require an accrual of 63 patients. With potential unforeseen dropout and mortality, the investigators will recruit a total of 70 patients for the proposed study.
