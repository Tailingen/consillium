BCMA and CD19 Targeted Fast Dual CAR-T for BCMA+ Refractory/Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of GC012F CAR-T cells in patients diagnosed with BCMA+ refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (r/r MM).

The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of GC012F in r/r MM. GC012F is an autologous dual chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD19. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (less than or equal to \[\<=\] 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by Apheresis (will occur upon enrollment); Treatment Phase including a conditioning regimen followed by infusion of GC012F and post-infusion assessments from Day 1 to Day 84; and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 85 and up to end of the study). Efficacy will be explored to assessed and safety will be closely monitored during the study.
