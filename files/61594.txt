Rectal Washout in Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision and Presence of Intraluminal Malignant Cells
The study aims to assess the existence of intraluminal malignant cells and the appropriate fluid volume needed to perform rectal washout during transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) for rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Rectal washout
Existence of intraluminal malignant cells in fluid samples from rectal washout, Positive/negative cytology, Intraoperatively
Fluid volume needed to perform rectal washout during transanal total mesorectal excision to eliminate intraluminal malignant cells, Positive/negative cytology, Intraoperatively
Twenty patients undergoing taTME for rectal cancer is included. Following the closure of the rectal lumen by a purse string suture, rectal washout is performed with a total of 500 ml sterile water. Fluid samples are collected after every 100 ml by instilling 50 ml of saline after each washout. A sixth sample is collected from the presacral cavity. Each sample is cytologically examined by a pathologist and labelled either malignant or non-malignant.
