Irinotecan as 3rd Line Therapy in Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China. Most patients are unresectable or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy was required for the patients with advanced stage. Platinum combined with fluoropyrimidines always were considered as first line treatment. After failure of initial therapy, single agent of taxanes was used as second line treatment. However, there is no relative standard chemotherapeutic regimen in the third therapy except oral anti-angiogenesis drug-Apatinib. So this study was designed to explore the role of single agent with irinotecan as third line treatment in patients with metastatic gastric cancer in China.
