Clinical Trial of IV OKN-007 in a Pilot Cohort of Human Recurrent Malignant Glioma Patients
This is an open label Phase 1b clinical trial of IV administration of OKN-007 in a pilot cohort of human recurrent malignant glioma patients. All patients will have been previously treated with the standard-of-care treatment which includes surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, and in some cases treatment for recurrent disease with investigational agents or bevacizumab (Avastin). Patients with unequivocal recurrence (first or greater) established by MRI with and without contrast (e.g., Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentacetic acid) and meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be eligible for OKN-007 treatment on this protocol.
