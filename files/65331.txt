A Study in Ovarian, Non-Small Cell Lung, Prostate, Colorectal, Gastroesophageal Cancers, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
The purpose of the study is to estimate the rate of response for patients with ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, colorectal, gastroesophageal, and head and neck cancers who are administered LY2523355.

Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), The percentage of participants who achieved a best response of either CR or PR, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and for prostate cancer PR was defined as a ≥50% decrease in baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value that was confirmed with a second value ≥3 weeks later. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase over nadir. Percentage is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100., Baseline until progressive disease up to 36 weeks post-baseline
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 millimeter (mm) increase over nadir. For participants who were not known to have died or to have progressed as of the data inclusion cutoff date, PFS were censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the date of any subsequent systemic anticancer therapy., Date of enrollment to progressive disease or death due to any cause up to 36 weeks post-enrollment|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Best Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD), Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and for prostate cancer PR was defined as a ≥50% decrease in baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value that was confirmed with a second value ≥3 weeks later. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase over nadir. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria., Baseline until progressive disease up to 36 weeks post-baseline|Tumor Marker Values as Relevant to Specific Tumor Types at Baseline, The number of participants with colorectal cancer (CRC), gastroesophageal cancer (GE), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, prostate cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) who had marker/molecular diagnostics performed prior to study entry to determine the mutation status of cancer genes: APC, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, HRAS and KRAS and the presence of Human Papillovirus (HPV) and Epstein Barr viruses (EBV). Mutation/virus status was defined as: positive (mutation/virus present), negative (mutation/virus not present), unknown (mutation/virus status unknown), or not done (mutation/virus status was not done)., Baseline|Change in Tumor Size at Smallest Size (Best Response), The percent change in tumor size at its smallest size. The sum of diameters of target lesions was determined at each tumor assessment. The percent change is the smallest post-baseline sum divided by the baseline (pre-treatment) sum, multiplied by 100., Baseline until cycle with maximum change from baseline up to 36 weeks|Pharmacokinetics, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2523355 and Metabolite LSN2546307, Plasma Cmax following daily doses of LY2523355 on Days 1, 2, and 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)., Day 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)|Pharmacokinetics, Intracycle Accumulation Ratio (Ra) of LY2523355, Intracycle Ra of LY2523355 is the ratio of LY2523355 maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) on Day 3 of Cycle 1 to the Cmax of LY2523355 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 following daily doses of LY2523355 on Days 1, 2 and 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle) at each dose level., Day 1 and Day 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)
Number of Participants Who Died Due to Unknown Causes During the 30-Day Post-Study Treatment Follow-Up, End of study treatment up to 30-days post-study treatment discontinuation
The purpose of the study is to estimate the rate of response for patients with ovarian, non-small cell lung, prostate, colorectal, gastroesophageal, and head and neck cancers who are administered LY2523355.
