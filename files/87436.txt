Evaluation of the Predictive Role of Choline PET/CT on the Survival of Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer.
the increase in the serum PSA (prostate specific antigen) value following radical treatment commonly involves subsequent treatment which, in the absence of morphological evidence of disease recovery, is conducted empirically through local radiotherapy or systemic hormonal therapy. The use of PET with choline is therefore of extreme clinical interest as it allows to identify the site of disease recurrence, thus being able to direct towards a specific therapeutic treatment. The diagnostic accuracy of choline PET in identifying the location of the disease has been widely demonstrated in the literature and is comparable to those of conventional diagnostic methods previously described for the restaging of patients with prostatic disease. The real advantage of this method is the possibility of obtaining the same information as conventional methods by carrying out a single exam.
