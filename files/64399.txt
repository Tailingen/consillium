The Hemodynamic Effect Between Two Types of Anesthesia in Esophageal Surgery
Continuous Paravertebral block (PVB) was reported to provide less episodes of hypotension than continuous thoracic epidural block (TEB). The maintenance of optimal tissue perfusion is essential for esophageal anastomosis in patients undergoing oesophagectomy. the aim of this study is to compare Hemodynamic effect of continous PVB compared to TEB , in patient undergoing oesophagectomy with laparoscopy and thoracotomy.
