TGRX-678 Chinese Phase I in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) Patients
The purpose of this single- arm, open-lable, dose escalation + dose expansion study is to evalulate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy of TGRX-678 in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia patients who had failure with or are intolerant to TKI treatments.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: TGRX-678
Maximal tolerated dose (MTD), To determine the MTD of TGRX-678 in CML patients, At end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) when the posterior probability of DLT of a dose level is higher than 33%|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), To detemine the RP2D of TGRX-678 in CML patients for Phase II, At completion of the study, an average of 1.5 years|Safety profile (DLT), to record and analyse subjects with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLT: collect during Cycle 1 (28 days)|Safety profile (AEs/SAEs), to record and analyse subjects with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), and, AE and SAE: through completion of the study, an average of 1.5 years
Hematologic Response, To record and analyse the hematologic response of subjects. Subjects will be determined whether complete hematologic response (CHR) or no evience of leukemia (NEL) is reached., at screening period, weekly in Cycle 1, bi-weekly in Cycle 2 and monthly starting from Cycle 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Cytogenetic Response, To record and analyse the cytogenetic response of subjects subjects will be determined whether partial or complete cytogenetic response (Ph+ \< 35%) is reached., at screening period, weekly in Cycle 1, bi-weekly in Cycle 2 and monthly starting from Cycle 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Molecular Response, To record and analyse the molecular response of subjects Subjects will be detmined whether major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 (IS) no more than 0.1%) is reached., at screening period, weekly in Cycle 1, bi-weekly in Cycle 2 and monthly starting from Cycle 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Plasma Cmax, Cmax of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma Tmax, Tmax of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma T1/2, Half life of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma AUClast, AUClast of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma AUCinf, AUCinf of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma Cmin, Cmin of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma AUCss, steady state AUC of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma Cmax,ss, steady state Cmax of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Plasma Tmax,ss, steady state Tmax of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|CL, Clearance of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28|Vd, Volume of distribution of TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, Day 1, 7, 21, 28 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2 Day 28 and Cycle 3 Day 28
This is the first-in-human trial with TGRX-678 which aims to evaluate the safety profile and preliminary efficacy profile in advanced or refractory CML patients with previous failure or intolerence to TKI treatments. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of TGRX-678, including determination of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and other safety measures of the investigational drug, such as adverse events and abnormal clinical outcomes. Preliminary efficacy profile of TGRX-678 is evaluated based on the changes in peripheral blood cells and disease-associated cytogenetic markers. The safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles, along with pharmacokinetic analysis, will be assessed together to determine the optimal dose for expansion.
