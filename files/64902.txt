Integrated Clinical-radiological Analysis of Hypoxia Markers in Pediatric Osteosarcomas
The aim of this pilot study is therefore to retrospectively measure the volume and percentage of necrosis on diagnostic MRI in T1 sequence and in parallel to study the expression of immunohistochemical markers of hypoxia (HIF-1α, CAIX , HIF-2α, pS6, phosphomTor, CD163 and CD68) on diagnostic biopsies of high-grade osteosarcomas from 2007 to 2018 in the Strasbourg center, focusing on the pediatric population. The investigators will systematically carry out a correlation analysis between these different parameters and with the clinical data of these same patients (response to chemotherapy, presence of metastases or not and overall and recurrence-free survival). This will eventually make it possible to highlight new prognostic markers at diagnosis.
Osteosarcoma in Children
Retropsective study of pediatric osteosarcomas, Files analysed retrospectively from January 01, 2007 to December 31, 2018 will be examined]
