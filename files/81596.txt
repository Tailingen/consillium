A First In Patient, Study Of Investigational Drug PF-03446962 In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of PF-03446962 when given as a single agent. Tumors require new blood vessels to support their ability to grow and to spread (metastasize). New treatments aimed at preventing these blood vessels have the ability to improve the clinical management of cancer.

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD): Part 1, MTD was defined as highest dose level for which no more than 1 participant in a dose cohort experienced DLT and at least 2 out of 3/6 participants in the next higher dose. DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the first 42 days of study drug: any grade greater than or equal to 3 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity, all non-disease-related adverse events (AEs)., Baseline up to 42 days after the start of each increased treatment dose|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D): Part 1, RP2D was defined as the lower dose level to MTD based on the safety profile., Baseline up to 42 days after the start of each increased treatment dose

Treatment-related AEs was any untoward medical occurrence in participant that was attributed to study drug. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., Cycle 1 of Day 1 up to 28 days after the last dose of treatment|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) Based on Severity: Part 1 and Part 2, AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity; Grade 0 (no change from normal); grade 1 (mild AE which did not cause any significant problem, no dose adjustment required); grade 2 (moderate AE which caused problem that did not interfere significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, dose adjustment needed due to adverse event); grade 3 (severe AE which caused problem that interfered significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, study drug stopped due to adverse event); grade 4 (life threatening AE) and grade 5 (death). Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., Cycle 1 of Day 1 up to 28 days after the last dose of treatment|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) Based on Seriousness: Part 1 and Part 2, AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Seriousness of an AE was assessed as serious adverse event (SAE) and non-serious adverse event (non-SAE). An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Non-SAE included all AE minus SAE.

PR defined as \>=30 % decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions., Baseline then 6 weeks after Cycle 1 of Day1 thereafter every 6 weeks up to Day 490|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control: Part 2, Participants who achieved either a confirmed complete Response or confirmed partial response or a Stable disease lasting at least 12 weeks from the first dose was defined as achieving disease control. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR: disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR: \>=30 % decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD and stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions.
