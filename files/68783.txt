Study of INCB040093 in Subjects With Previously Treated B-Cell Malignancies
The study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB040093, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, or a tolerated, pharmacologically active dose; Part 2 will evaluate the combination of INCB040093 and itacitinib (INCB039110), a JAK1 inhibitor, to determine the MTD of the combination or a tolerated dose that produces substantial pharmacologic inhibition of both targets; Part 3 will further evaluate the chosen doses of INCB040093 alone and in combination with itacitinib (INCB039110) in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies.
B-cell Malignancies
DRUG: INCB040093|DRUG: INCB040093 + itacitinib
Safety and tolerability of INCB040093 as monotherapy and when given in combination with itacitinib as determined by clinical laboratory assessments, physical exams, 12-lead ECG and summary of adverse events, Measured every 3 weeks until progression.
Preliminary efficacy as assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) as measured by published criteria for Hodgkin's/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Cheson et al 2007 and Owen et al 2013) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) (Cheson et el 2012), Every 12 weeks (4 cycles) until study withdrawal|Pharmacokinetic (PK) collections., Plasma concentrations of each INCB040093 and itacitinib will be used to estimate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)., Measured for each patient at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 1 Day 15
