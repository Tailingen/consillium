Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different combination chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the efficacy of cisplatin and topotecan followed by paclitaxel and carboplatin vs paclitaxel and carboplatin only, in terms of time to disease progression, in patients with newly diagnosed stage IIB-IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
* Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the clinical objective response rates in patients with measurable disease at baseline treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare the CA 125 normalization rates in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, age (65 years and under vs over 65 years), and pre-randomization surgery (no debulking vs debulking with macroscopic residual disease less than 1 cm vs debulking with macroscopic residual disease 1 cm or greater vs debulking with no macroscopic residual disease). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 of courses 1-4 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 5-8.
* Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 1-8.

In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Planned interval debulking surgery should occur after course 3 or 4.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline; on day 1 of courses 3, 5, and 7; at the end of the last course; and at 3 and 6 months after study treatment completion.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (400 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
