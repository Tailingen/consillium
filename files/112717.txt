Study of Vosaroxin and Cytarabine for the Treatment of Adults 60 Years of Age or Older With Previously Untreated AML
This is a pilot efficacy assessment clinical trial of vosaroxin and cytarabine for the treatment of adults 60 years of age or older with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 17 evaluable patients are planned to be treated on the study.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Vosaroxin and Cytarabine
Rate of Complete Remission, Percentage of patients who have complete remission as defined by the International Working Group for AML: morphologic complete remission (CR) or morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi or CRp), 2 months
Procedure or Procedure Related Adverse Events, Number of unique patients who had a procedure or treatment related (possible, probable or definite) adverse events. (graded per NCI CTC v4.0), Up to 1 year
Primary objective: rate of complete remission (morphologic complete remission or morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) Secondary objectives: (1) safety of this combination in induction therapy of older patients previously unexposed to intensive chemotherapy; (2) progression-free survival; (3) length of stay in hospital for induction; (4) 30- and 60-day mortality rate.

The treatment period will include up to 4 cycles of treatment (induction 1, induction 2, consolidation 1, and consolidation 2). In each cycle, the first day of study treatment will be considered day 1.

* Each cycle will include vosaroxin treatment on days 1 and 4 (total of 2 days) and cytarabine treatment on days 1-5 (total of 5 days) followed by a variable interval required to achieve hematologic recovery, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1000 cells/L.
* Up to 2 cycles of consolidation treatment may be completed by eligible patients in remission (morphologic complete remission or morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) if safety parameters are met.
