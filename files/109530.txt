Does Stellate Ganglion Block Decrease Stress Response of Intubation?
In this study investigators will evaluate the effect of stellate ganglion block on stress response of intubation in comparison to traditional antistress measures in adult patients
Intubation|Stellate Ganglion
PROCEDURE: stellate block|DRUG: Na.Cl 0.9% (placebo)|DRUG: lidocaine 2%
heart rate, measured in beat/min., 5 minutes
mean arterial blood pressure, measured in mm.Hg, 5 minutes
Both groups will have the same general anesthesia procedure, patients in stellate block group will receive lidocaine in the stellate block will in control group patients will receive Na.Cl as placebo. primary outcome will be stress response to subsequent endotracheal intubation measure by changes in heart rate
