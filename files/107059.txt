New Retinoid Agent Combined With Arsenic Trioxide for Untreated Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
The safety and efficacy of combining NRX 195183 with arsenic trioxide in treating untreated APL will be assessed.
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
DRUG: NRX 195183 (retinoid analogue)|DRUG: Arsenic Trioxide
The primary endpoint is achieving a partial or complete response, Bone marrow biopsies will be done monthly during induction
Safety and feasibility, Twice weekly during induction and then weekly during consolidation
The primary objectives of this study are in newly diagnosed APL patients:

* To evaluate the efficacy (complete and molecular response rates) and toxicity of NRX 195183 in induction therapy
* To evaluate the efficacy (molecular response rates) and toxicity of NRX 195183 in combination with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in consolidation therapy.
* To evaluate the efficacy (event free-survival, disease-free survival) and toxicity of NRX 195183 as maintenance therapy for patients with APL who achieve a molecular complete response.
