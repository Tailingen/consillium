Phase Ib Study of Anetumab Ravtansine in Combination With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin in Patients With Recurrent Mesothelin-expressing Platinum-resistant Cancer
Anetumab ravtansine is developed for the treatment of patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The purpose of the proposed trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of anetumab ravtansine that could be safely combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in this indication.

DRUG: Anetumab ravtansine (BAY94-9343)|DRUG: Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Anetumab ravtansine in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin when given every three weeks, MTD is defined as the highest dose of anetumab ravtansine administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin that can be given such that not more than 1 of 6 subjects at a given dose level experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., Up to 6 months, minimum: 1 cycle (=21days)|Incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events (AEs), Up to 6 months
