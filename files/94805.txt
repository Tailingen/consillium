Study to Gather Information About the Use of Healthcare Services and the Way the Disease is Cared for in Canadian Patients With Prostate Gland Cancer Which Spread Throughout the Body
Study to gather information about the optimal placement of Ra-223 in the order of different treatments in terms of the effect on patients and in terms of the use of healthcare services for the treatment of Canadian patients with prostate gland cancer which spread to other parts of the body. In order to collect this information real world data from prostate gland cancer patients from four Canadian administrative databases will be analyzed.

Data collected from patients treated with their 2nd line of life-prolonging therapy for Non-Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) initiated from 01 Jan 2012 to 31 Dec 2017. For patients included in the study, all available data from the beginning for their record until death, lost to follow-up or database cut-off will be included. The index date is the date of initiation of the 2nd line life-prolonging therapy for mCRPC.
