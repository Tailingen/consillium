Enzalutamide in First Line Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of enzalutamide, versus a conventional non-steroidal anti androgen (NSAA), when combined with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog (LHRHA) or surgical castration, as first line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: NSAA|DRUG: LHRHA or Surgical Castration
Overall Survival Time, the interval from the date of randomisation to date of death., 3 years
Prostate specific antigen progression free survival time, the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of PSA progression, clinical progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, or the date of last known follow-up without PSA progression

PSA progression is defined as: a rise in PSA by more than 25% AND more than 2ng/mL, 3 years|Clinical progression free survival time, the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first clinical evidence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, or the date of last known follow-up without clinical progression, 3 years|Adverse events, The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4.03) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events during study treatment, 3 years|Health-related quality of life (EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ C-30), Quality of Life Questionnaire for Prostate Cancer (PR-25), Euroqol 5 item preference-based measure of health (EQ-5 D-5L)), HRQL will be reported by participants using the EORTC core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ C-30) and prostate cancer specific module (PR-25). The EQ-5D-5L will be used to derive utility scores suitable for quality adjusted survival analyses, 3 years|Healthcare resource cost-effectiveness (incremental cost effectiveness ratio), Information on the following areas of health-care resource usage will be collected: hospitalisations, visits to health professionals, and medications Australian unit costs will be applied to the resource usage data to estimate the incremental cost of the addition of enzalutamide to standard treatment, 3 years
