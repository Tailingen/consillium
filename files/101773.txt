Perioperative Examination of Inflammatory Markers in Relation to Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Melanoma; a Pilot Study
We want to test if an association between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLBN) and a systemic inflammatory response can be made.
Melanoma|Surgery
PROCEDURE: Blood samples
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Ratio between neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes, 1 Day
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, 1 Day|Acute phase reactants, CRP, LDH, 1 Day
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLBN) is essential in staging melanoma and properly selecting patients for adjuvant immunotherapy. However, surgically induced inflammation can potentially aid in progression of remaining malignant cells and affect prognosis. The inflammatory marker neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is also a negative prognostic and predictive marker in serval malignancies, among melanoma. However, it is not yet established if SLNB induces a systemic inflammatory response.
