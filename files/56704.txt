4SCAR-CD44v6 T Cell Therapy Targeting Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of 4SCAR-CD44v6 T-cell therapy targeting multiple cancers. The study also aims to learn more about the function of the CD44v6 CAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients.
Cancers Which Are CD44v6 Positive
BIOLOGICAL: CD44v6-specific CAR gene-engineered T cells
Safety of infusion, Treatment-related adverse events are assessed by NCI CTCAE V4.0 criteria., 1 year|Clinical response, Objective responses (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) are assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., 1 year
CD44 variant domain 6 (CD44v6) which belongs to CD44 family has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The expression of CD44v6 was reported for the majority of squamous cell carcinomas, a proportion of adenocarcinomas of differing origin, a proportion of melanoma and lymphoma. This expression pattern has made CD44v6 an attractive target for the therapy of various types of CD44v6 positive cancers.

The T cells from patients or transplantation donors will be genetically modified with lentiviral CAR vector to recognize specific molecules - CD44v6 expressed on the surface of the cancer cells. The engineered T cells will be applied to patients through intravenous delivery.

The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CD44v6 CAR-T cell therapy in multiple cancers including - but not limited to - stomach cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and lymphoma which are CD44v6 positive. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the function of the 4SCAR-CD44v6 T cells and their persistency in the patients.
