Interest of the F18-choline as a Second Line of the Tracer for Detection of Parathyroid Adenomas
The rationale for the proposed pilot study is to investigate the ability of PET-CT with F18-choline to detect and locate the parathyroid adenoma in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and negative or non-contributory MIBI (Tc-99m sestamibi) and cervical ultrasound, in order to avoid unnecessary bilateral cervical exploration.
Hyperparathyroidism
RADIATION: F18-choline PET examination
Sensitivity (ability to identify and visualize the parathyroid adenoma), Sensitivity of PET-CT with F18-choline (FCH) to identify and visualize the parathyroid adenoma in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and negative or non-contributory parathyroid scintigraphy MIBI and cervical ultrasound, Up to 2 months
