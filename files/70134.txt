RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: rubitecan
OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of nitrocamptothecin in patients with metastatic melanoma.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (choroidal vs nonchoroidal). Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly for at least 8 weeks (2 courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
