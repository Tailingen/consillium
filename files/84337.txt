Low Dose Hemi-body Radiation For Recurrent Prostate Cancer
Older studies in animals and humans have shown cancer responses to very low doses of whole-body or hemi-body radiation. To study the effects of low doses of radiation in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, investigators will enroll up to 21 patients for 10 fractions of low dose radiation, delivered over 5 weeks. Participants will be followed on study for 12 months, capturing PSA, CBC, QoL and blood samples for immunological analysis.
