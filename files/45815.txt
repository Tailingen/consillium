NWRD09 for HPV-16 Positive and HPV-16 Related Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Cervical Cancer Patients.
This is a single-arm, open label, two cohorts, multi-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HPV-16 targeted mRNA vaccine (NWRD09) in HPV-16 positive and HPV-16 related cervical, vaginal, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (LSIL and HSIL) patients (cohort A) and HPV-16 related cervical cancer patients (cohort B).
Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: NWRD09 administered by intramuscular injection
Safety（Cohort A and B）, All adverse events (AE) will be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events, including incidence and severity of serious adverse events (SAE) (according to NCI-CTCAE Standard version 5.0 of common Terms for Adverse Events)., Within 21 days of the first dosing|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) （Cohort A and B）, It would be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events or abnormalities through evaluating systemic or local adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to the test drug occurring withinIt would be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events or abnormalities through evaluating systemic or local adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to the test drug occurring within 21 days of the first dosing will be classified as DLT during dosing climb.will be classified as DLT during dosing climb., Within 21 days of the first dosing
Immunogenicity （Cohort A and B）, Immunologic reactogenicity by measuring HPV16 E6/E7 specific T cell response (IFN-γ ELISPOT) in blood samples., To week 24.|Histopathology outcome and HPV Viral clearance （Cohort A）, Number of subjects with virologically-proven clearance of HPV 16 and number of subjects with histopathological regression of cervical lesions to CIN 1 or normal, To week 24.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) （Cohort B）, Objective Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who have either confirmed CR or confirmed PR as best overall response per RECIST 1.1., To week 24.|Progression-free survival (PFS) （Cohort B）, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the NWRD09 treatment start date to the date of the first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., To week 24.|Duration of response (DOR) （Cohort B）, Duration of response (DOR), defined as time from the date of first documented response of CR or PR to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause., To week 24.|Disease control rate (DCR) （Cohort B）, Disease control rate (DCR), defined as is the percentage of evaluable cases with response (PR + CR) and stable disease (SD) after treatment, DCR = CR + PR + SD., To week 24.
This study is divided into three dose groups in cohort A and cohort B. Each patient will be administered NWRD09 by intramuscular injection. The Maximum Tolerated Dose of NWRD09 will be determined by the classical 3+3 dose escalation schedule. The number of patients will be ranged from 9 to 18.
