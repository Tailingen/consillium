Adding Targeted Drugs to Usual Chemotherapy for Adults With Newly Diagnosed T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) and T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (T-LBL)
This phase II trial tests the safety and effectiveness of giving chemotherapy with or without venetoclax and/or navitoclax for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax and navitoclax are in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. They may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving chemotherapy with or without venetoclax and/or navitoclax may be effective treatments for patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL or T-LBL.

Treatment continues for one 9-week cycle (weeks 25-33) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

MAINTENANCE: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1 and 57 of each cycle, dexamethasone PO BID on days 1-5, and 57-61 of each cycle, mercaptopurine PO on days 1-28 and 36-84 of each cycle, methotrexate PO on days 8, 15, 22, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78 of each cycle, methotrexate IT on day 1 of each cycle, and nelarabine IV on days 29-33 of cycles 1-3. Cycles repeat every 12-weeks (84 days) for a total of 2 years from the start of Interim Maintenance in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo x-ray and EKG at screening and echocardiogram or MUGA, CT, PET, bone marrow aspiration, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture and blood sample collection throughout the study.
