The Biodistribution and Potential Diagnostic Ability of 18F FACBC in Patients With Head and Neck, Breast, and Prostate Cancer
See where the dye-like material (FACBC) goes in your body and how long it stays in your body. See how much of the dye-like material is picked up by your tumor Compare the FACBC pictures with other pictures (such as FDG PET scan) that were obtained as part of your standard imaging evaluation.

PROCEDURE: novel PET tracer FACBC
To study the biodistribution and dosimetry of FACBC in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast cancer and prostate cancer., conclusion of study
To compare these FACBC data with PET imaging findings using the current clinical standard PET tracer FDG., conclusion of study
