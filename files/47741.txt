A Study of Pancreatic Cancer in Xenografts From Liver Metastases
This is a feasibility study to perform image-guided liver biopsies in 25 patients who have pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis (cancer in the pancreas that has spread to the liver). This will contribute with samples for the bio-bank (bank of tumors) and develop xenografts (human tumors growing in mice) for further analysis of genes.

Number of patients with adverse events due to biopsies, Monitoring adverse events during trial related to biopsies, up to 2 years|Number of successful xenografts, determine the "take rate" or success of establishing xenografts, up to 2 years|Number of similarities and differences between original patient tumor sample with xenograft sample, complete histological and molecular comparison of original patient sample with murine xenograft, up to 2 years|Engraftment rate compared to clinical data (response to treatment, disease-free survival, overall survival), determine the correlation between engraftment rate and clinical data (response to treatment, disease-free survival, overall survival)., up to date of death from any cause
This study might bring a better understanding of the metastatic pancreatic cancer and evaluate the differences between the metastatic and the primary pancreatic cancer (the type that does not have metastasis).
