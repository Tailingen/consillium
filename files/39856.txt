A Study Comparing ARB With Radium-223 vs ARB Therapy With Placebo and the Effect Upon Survival for mCRPC Patients
This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, Phase III study of radium-223 plus enzalutamide or darolutamide compared to enzalutamide or darolutamide treatment plus placebo.

DRUG: Enzalutamide during Lead-in Period|DRUG: Lead-in Enzalutamide followed by Radium-223/Enzalutamide|DRUG: Lead-in Enzalutamide followed by Placebo/Enzalutamide|DRUG: Darolutamide during Lead-in Period|DRUG: Lead-in Darolutamide followed by Radium-223/Darolutamide|DRUG: Lead-in Darolutamide followed by Placebo/Darolutamide
Symptomatic Skeletal Event-free Survival (SSE-FS), SSE-FS is a composite endpoint, composed of 4 events that indicate disease progression:

* the first use of external-beam radiation therapy to relieve skeletal tumor-related symptoms
* the occurrence of new symptomatic pathologic bone fractures.
* the occurrence of new symptomatic spinal cord compression
* a tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, approximately 1 year and 8 months
Overall Survival (OS), Number of subjects who survived between RT2 randomization through data cut-off., approximately 1 year and 8 months|Time to Chemotherapy Initiation, Number of subjects who began docetaxel or cabazitaxel treatment during the study., approximately 1 year and 8 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Number of subjects with bone scan progression per PCWG3 criteria, and/or progression by CT/MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause following RT2. Radiological progression is interpreted by local assessment only., approximately 1 year and 8 months|Safety Profile of Androgen Receptor Blocker (ARB) Therapy With or Without Radium-223., Safety profile of androgen receptor blockers (enzalutamide or darolutamide) with or without radium-223; number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. Reported only in the AE reporting module., approximately 1 year and 8 months|Occurrence of AESI: Bone Fractures (Pathologic and Non-pathologic), Assess occurrence of AESI: fractures (pathologic and non-pathologic)., approximately 1 year and 8 months
The hypothesis investigators will test in this study is whether layering radium-223 following 16 weeks of enzalutamide or darolutamide exposure in patients demonstrating a biochemical response improves disease outcomes. By adding radium-223 following a potential bone flare phenomenon \[after first 12-14 weeks of therapy with an androgen receptor blocker (ARB)\], including patients expected to have durable response to systemic therapy, and mandating the use of bone protective agents during treatment, the investigators aim to demonstrate an optimal time to add radium-223 in the mCRPC landscape.
