A Study of Onartuzumab (MetMAb) in Combination With mFOLFOX6 in Patients With Metastatic Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Negative Gastroesophageal Cancer
This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of onartuzumab (MetMAb) in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with metastatic HER2-negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either onartuzumab (MetMAb) or placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6. Patients may continue to receive onartuzumab (MetMAb) or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to discontinue treatment.
