Treatment of Cabotamig (ARB202) in Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer Patients
This study aims to find out:

1. The tolerability of Cabotamig (ARB202) in adults with advanced solid gastrointestinal tumors who failed the standard treatment. People can participate if their tumor has the CDH17 marker.
2. To find out how study drug is broken down in the body
3. To know the effects of the study drug on the tumor.
