VX15/2503 in Combination with Ipilimumab or Nivolumab in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer
This phase I trial studies how well anti-semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 (VX15/2503) with or without ipilimumab and/or nivolumab work in treating patients with stage I-IVA head and neck squamous cell cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as VX15/2503, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
BIOLOGICAL: VX15/2503|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Change in immune profile in the tumor microenvironment, Specimens from surgical resection will be collected under the guidance of the collaborating pathologist and tissue procurement staff at the time of surgery to capture tissue in excess of that needed for clinical staging and diagnostic purposes. Tumor specimens will be fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and biomarkers related to activated HNSCC stroma will be assessed via immunohistochemical analysis., Baseline up to 4-8 weeks after surgery|Change in circulating percentage of immune suppressor subsets in peripheral blood, Blood samples will be collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated from these samples and stored in -80°C freezers until analysis. Multi-parameter flow cytometry will be utilized to phenotype immune effector cells. The impact of treatment on the circulating percentage of immune suppressor subsets that may serve as predictors of response to immune checkpoint inhibition. All data will be expressed as the percentage of total circulating peripheral blood cells with each respective phenotype., Baseline up to 4-8 weeks after surgery|Phenotypic shifts in T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood, Blood samples will be collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated from these samples and stored in -80°C freezers until analysis. Blood will be analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry to identify systemic phenotypic shifts mediated by VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition., Baseline up to 4-8 weeks after surgery
Incidence of adverse events assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Adverse events will be classified using MedDRA System Organ Classes and Preferred Terms. Furthermore, serious adverse events, adverse events (AEs) with a severity grade of 3 or above using NCI CTCAE version 4.0, AEs deemed related to study drug, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and AEs leading to death will also be summarized in preferred term by system organ class and listed on an individual subject basis., Up to 4-8 weeks after surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 alone and VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, on the immune profile in the tumor microenvironment and in peripheral blood.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

To extend the previously reported safety profile of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 groups.

GROUP A: Patients receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

GROUP B: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

GROUP C: Patients receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

GROUP D: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

GROUP E: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Beginning days 17-36, patients undergo standard of care surgery.

GROUP F: Patients undergo standard of care surgery.
