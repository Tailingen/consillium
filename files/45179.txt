Transplantation After Complete Response In Patients With T-cell Lymphoma
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) encompasses a broad range of post-thymic (i.e., mature) sub-entities as defined by the 2017 WHO classification. The most common entities are angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and other Tfh-phenotype PTCL or PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS), each representing approximately 20 to 25% of mature T- and NK/T-cell lymphomas. Compared to their B-cell counterparts, most PTCL confer dismal prognosis. In fact, except for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), 10-year overall survival for patients with PTCL barely exceeds 30%. Given the infrequency and the heterogeneity of these malignancies, no real consensus on first-line treatment has been established for most PTCL.

The place of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation procedure for patients with PTCL achieving a complete metabolic response after induction is still highly debated. ESMO recommendations and recent guidelines from a committee of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation currently propose ASCT as first-line therapy for transplant-eligible patients for all patients reaching at least a partial response (PR) after induction. NCCN guidelines (version 2.2017) recommend ASCT or observation in case of metabolic CR but salvage regimen in case of residual disease after induction.
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy + follow up|PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy + ASCT + follow up
to assess if ASCT is associated with a significant prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) for patient with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) reaching a complete response (CR) according to the response critter, progression-free survival defined time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of relapse or progressive disease, death due to any cause, or receipt of subsequent systemic chemotherapy to treat residual or progressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma as determined by the investigator, whichever came first., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first
Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of Overall response rate (ORR) and Complete Response Rate (CRR), Overall Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving best overall response of partial metabolic response (PMR) or complete metabolic response (CMR) at the end of ASCT (8-12 weeks after PIE). Assessment of response will be determined by investigator and based on Lugano Response Criteria 2014 (PET-CT-Based Response for FDG-avid lymphomas or CT-Based Response if not)., At the end of ASCT (8-12 weeks after post-induction evaluation)|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response will be measured from the time of attainment of CMR or PMR to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse (based on investigator disease assessment), death from any cause or receipt of subsequent systemic chemotherapy to treat residual or progressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma as determined by the investigator, whichever came first., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of time to next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented administration of new anti-lymphoma treatment., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of quality of Life, The EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D-5L) will be administered at baseline and every three months during follow-up visit., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Will be expressed as the extra cost per a quality adjusted life year. To assess the mean cost per patient of each group, the number of resources consumed and the amounts refunded will be extracted from the French National Health Insurance Information System. The number of QALYs in each group of the trial will be assessed with survival time and the validated EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D-5L)., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Comparison of chemotherapy regimens + ASCT consolidation with chemotherapy regimens alone in terms of budget Impact Analysis, budget impact analysis to assess the potential annual economic impact of the new management recommendation (with or without ASCL) for the French Public Health Insurance System across a 3-year time period., When the last randomized patient has reached two years of follow-up or when 154 events (progression/relapse/new anti-lymphoma treatment/death) occured whichever comes first|Adjusted comparison of chemotherapy regimens (CHOP vs CHOEP) in non-sALCL in terms of Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving best overall response of partial metabolic response (PMR) at the end of induction. Assessment of response will be determined by investigator and based on Lugano Response Criteria 2014 (PET-CT-Based Response for FDG-avid lymphomas or CT-Based Response if not)., at the end of induction (between 3 and 5 weeks after the last drug administration)|Adjusted comparison of chemotherapy regimens (CHOP vs CHOEP) in non-sALCL in terms of Complete Response rate (CRR), complete metabolic response is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving complete metabolic response (CMR) at the end of induction. Assessment of response will be determined by investigator and based on Lugano Response Criteria 2014 (PET-CT-Based Response for FDG-avid lymphomas or CT-Based Response if not)., at the end of induction (between 3 and 5 weeks after the last drug administration)|To evaluate the predictive value of total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) on PET-CT, Predictive value of TMTV on PET-CT, at patient enrollment|To Evaluate PET-CT Omics, PET-Omics, at patient enrollment|The assessment of the early PET-CT predictive value after four cycles of chemotherapy on treatment response according to the IWC (International Workshop Criteria) Lugano 2014, Predictive value of an early PET_CT after 4 cycles of chemotherapy on treatment response according to the IWC Lugano 2014, After four cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is 3weeks)
