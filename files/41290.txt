Investigation of Mass Balance of the Test Drug and Major Metabolites
The purpose of this study is to: a) Determine how the body takes up the test drug and distributes it into various body organs and tissues, how it processes the drug and how it ultimately removes it; and b) Examine how well the test drug works against cancer, and whether it is safe and tolerable to take
Neoplasms
DRUG: Sagopilone (BAY 86-5302, ZK 219477)
Blood, urine and fecal samples will be collected over a period of 336 hours (14 days) to measure 14C, ZK 219477 and its major metabolites following the intravenous administration of 14C-ZK 219477., 14 days|Cmax, Maximum plasma concentration for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|tmax, Time to Cmax for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|AUC, Area under the concentration time curve for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|AUC(0-tlast), AUC from administration until the last time point with measurable concentration for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|AUC(0-24), AUC from time zero to 24 hours for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|MRT, Mean residence time for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|t1/2, Terminal half-life for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|Î»z, Apparent terminal rate constant for \[14C\]-ZK 219477, ZK 219477, 14 days|CL, Total clearance for ZK 219477, 14 days|Vss, Apparent volume of distribution at steady state for ZK 219477, 14 days|Vz, Apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase for ZK 219477, 14 days
Number of participants with adverse events, Approximately 12 weeks to 30 weeks|Overall response, Determination of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), unknown, stable disease, progressive disease (PD) by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Approximately 10 to 32 weeks|Best overall response, Overall response as obtained at all time points available for an individual subject combined to the 'best overall response', Approximately 10 to 32 weeks|Responders, 'Response' was considered to be established if 'Best overall response' of PR or CR was confirmed at any time after the start of study treatment. If response was established, a subject was referred to as a 'responder', Approximately 10 to 32 weeks
