JS001+IMP4297 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is a Phase I/Ib open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and antitumor activity of toripalimab in combination with senaparib in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts, the Phase I part of the study will be a dose-escalation evaluation to determine the RP2D of senaparib to be administered in combination with the fixed dose of toripalimab, and the Phase Ib portion will further evaluate the RP2D and evaluate the efficacy of combination in specific types of advanced solid tumors.
