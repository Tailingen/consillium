Study of IV Edotecarin Vs Temozolomide or Carmustine (BCNU) or Lomustine (CCNU) in Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme
The purpose of this clinical trial is to study Edotecarin in patients with the brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who have progression or first recurrence following initial treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Edotecarin|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Carmustine (BCNU)|DRUG: Lomustine (CCNU)
To compare the overall survival associated with edotecarin versus that associated with temozolomide or BCNU or CCNU for the treatment of patients with GBM at first relapse previously treated with alkylator-based (neo)adjuvant therapy
To assess measures of tumor control To evaluate measures of clinical benefit To assess the safety profile of edotecarin To assess the PK profile of edotecarin and the potential for drug interactions between anticonvulsants and edotecarin
The purpose of this clinical trial is to study Edotecarin in patients with the brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who have progression or first recurrence following initial treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
