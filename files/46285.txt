Impact in Head and Neck Oncology of Support by a Nurse in the Patient's Care Pathway
Head and neck cancers (HNC) constitute a significant global health burden, ranking fourth in terms of cancer incidence and fifth in terms of cancer-related mortality. The management of HNC requires a complex array of consultations, examinations, rehabilitation, and lifestyle modifications, including addiction cessation. These cancers disproportionately affect economically disadvantaged, socially isolated individuals, and the elderly, resulting in disparities in healthcare access. Health coaching, an approach aimed at improving patients' health and quality of life by supporting behavior and lifestyle changes, has demonstrated effectiveness in various medical fields, including chronic diseases, medical oncology, and hematology. However, its application in head and neck cancer care remains limited, despite its potential benefits for this patient population.

OTHER: COMPLETION OF QUESTIONNAIRES
Potential benefits of personalized patient support using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire, The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact on the quality of life of patients treated for upper aerodigestive tract cancer of support by a nurse during the care pathway; and this from the moment of diagnosis and up to 12 months afterwards.

Measure of the impact on quality of life using the validated questionnaire most commonly used in oral cancerology, i.e. EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) - Head and Neck Cancer (EORTC QLQ-H\&N43)., 12 months
This study is a prospective monocentric comparative investigation conducted over 12 months. Two groups are being compared: the COACH group and the control group. The COACH group consists of newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients seen in consultation for treatment information at University Hospital during the first two months of the study. These patients receive coaching support from a specialized nurse, facilitating appointment scheduling, treatment coordination, and access to various rehabilitation services. In contrast, the control group includes patients who received treatment information during the third and fourth months of the study, without receiving specific coaching support. Both groups of patients will complete quality of life questionnaires at the time of treatment information, at 3 months, 6 months, and at 12 months.

Hypothesis: the investigators assume a minimum difference of 5 points between the control group and the coaching group.
