Obinutuzumab in Combination With Lenalidomide in Relapsed or Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma
This is a prospective, multicenter clinical study that will enroll 59 patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) MZL. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in the treatment of relapsed and refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).
Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: lenalidomide
Overall Remission Rate(ORR), Disease response evaluation after 6 cycles will be used to determine the overall remission rate, 24 weeks
2-year Progression Free Survival (PFS24):, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which tumor progresses or the date on which the patient dies for any cause. Responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last tumor assessment date., up to 4.5 years|2-year Event-Free Survival (EFS24), Event-Free Survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse, initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy or death from any cause., up to 4.5 years|Complete Response Rate (CR), Disease response evaluation after 6 cycles will be used to determine the overall remission rate, 24 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause.

Alive patients will be censored at their last date known to be alive, up to 4.5 years
Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is incurable, and the vast majority of patients with MZL eventually face disease relapse or progression.

There is no standard second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory MZL, and the synergistic effect of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide has been demonstrated in other indolent lymphomas.

The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination of obinutuzumab (GA101) and lenalidomide in the treatment of R/R marginal zone lymphoma in order to find a safe and effective option for this type of disease.
