Ibrutinib for Patients With Follicular Lymphoma Without Complete Response to Initial Chemoimmunotherapy
The purpose of this study is to find out how successful ibrutinib is at putting follicular lymphoma into full remission. In this study, remission will be determined by achieving a normal PET scan after treatment. A PET scan is an imaging test that looks for active lymphoma. People who don't have a complete remission on PET after their first treatment are at high risk for having their lymphoma return. This study will investigate if ibrutinib will help participants achieve a complete remission without giving additional chemotherapy. The study will also investigate any possible side effects of the study drug ibrutinib.

Rate of conversion from FDG-PET positive to negative, The primary objective is to determine the rate of conversion from FDG-PET positive to negative at 12 months from the start of ibrutinib in patients receiving at least 6 months of Ibrutinib consolidation therapy for follicular lymphoma achieving at least a PR but remaining FDG-PET positive after first line chemoimmunotherapy., 12 months
