Concordance of Key Actionable Genomic Alterations as Assessed in Tumor Tissue and Plasma in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
A study to determine the concordance of key actionable genomic alterations as assessed in tumor tissue and plasma from patients with non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
Concordance of Genomic Alterations in EGFR Detected in Plasma Versus Tumor Tissue in Stage IV Non Squamous NSCLC Patients Who Are Newly Diagnosed or Progressing on Treatment, Assess concordance of genomic alterations in EGFR detected in plasma (using the OncotypeSEQ Liquid Select assay) versus tumor tissue (assessed centrally using FoundationOne, or locally based on the patient's clinic) in stage IV non squamous NSCLC patients who are newly diagnosed or progressing on treatment., Time between patient tumor tissue biopsy and and blood collection, up to 8 weeks
Concordance of Genomic Alterations in ALK (EML4-ALK Fusions) Detected in Plasma Versus Tumor Tissue., Assess concordance of genomic alterations in ALK (EML4-ALK fusions) detected in plasma (using the OncotypeSEQ Liquid Select assay) versus tumor tissue (assessed centrally using FoundationOne OR locally based on the patient's clinic) in stage IV non squamous NSCLC patients who are newly diagnosed or progressing on treatment., Time between patient tumor tissue biopsy and and blood collection, up to 8 weeks|Percentage of Participants With EGFR T790M Alterations in Plasma in Patients Progressing on EGFR Targeting Therapy (Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Afatinib)., Detection of EGFR T790M alterations in plasma using the OncotypeSEQ Liquid Select assay. Progression on EGFR targeting therapy (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib) assessed clinically or radiologically, Time between patient tumor tissue biopsy and and blood collection (blood collected after the patient progressed on EGFR targeted therapy)
This is a prospective clinical study to characterize the concordance of key clinically relevant genomic alterations in tumor tissue (biopsy/excision/cytology) and liquid biopsy (blood) using the Genomic Health LBMP in patients with stage IV non squamous NSCLC, that are either newly diagnosed with metastatic disease or progressing on therapy (any line). Tissue biopsy and blood collection (liquid biopsy) should be less than eight weeks apart and with no new systemic antitumoral treatment given in the interval between the tissue biopsy and blood collection. Local assessment of tumor tissue samples will be performed at each participating institution as per their clinical standard of care practices and results from the local assessment of genomic alteration status will be used.
