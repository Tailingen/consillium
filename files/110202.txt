Phase 1/2 Study of Enasidenib (AG-221) in Adults With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies With an Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Isoform 2 (IDH2) Mutation
The primary objectives of Phase 1 Dose Escalation/Part 1 Expansion are:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with enasidenib administered continuously as a single agent dosed orally on Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day cycle in participants with advanced hematologic malignancies.
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of enasidenib in participants with advanced hematologic malignancies.

The primary objectives of Phase 1 Dose Escalation/Part 1 Expansion are:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with enasidenib administered continuously as a single agent dosed orally on Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day cycle in participants with advanced hematologic malignancies.
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of enasidenib in participants with advanced hematologic malignancies.

The primary objective of Phase 2 is:

• To assess the efficacy of enasidenib as treatment for participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation.
