Endobronchial Cryotherapy in Management of MEBO in Patients With Inoperable NSCLC
Background: In end-stage patients when all management options have been used, will often develop compromise of their airways as the cancer continues to progress. Endobronchial therapy options may help to relieve some of their symptoms, allowing improvement in their shortness of breath as they go home in combination with other palliative therapies.

Objective: to compare the safety ; efficacy; and clinical outcome of endobronchial cryotherapy combined with chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy versus chemo-radiotherapy alone on patients with Non small cell lung cancer.

Patients and method(s): A prospective randomized clinical trial was carried out on 60 patients with different ages of both sexes, diagnosed as bronchogenic carcinoma non-small cell lung cancer type (NSCLC) . The patients attended the hospital in the chest department, Qena Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University. Assessment of the patients was done and randomly assigned into two groups. Group1 ,Include 30 patients subjected to chemotherapy , radiotherapy and endobronchial cryotherapy.Group 2 , Include include 30 patients subjected to chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Non-Small Cell Carcinoma of Lung, TNM Stage 4|Bronchogenic Cancer
PROCEDURE: cryotherapy
Evaluation of the clinical changes of the cases after procedure., Evaluation of the rate of symptoms relief after therapy, the symptoms were evaluated before therapy as a baseline; and evaluated 4 weeks after procedure.|Respiratory function test evaluation, Spirometry was done (FEV1 in %, FVC in %, FEV1/FVC in %)., Change from Baseline Spirometry done before management, was compared with that was done at 4 weeks after management.|Assessment of the overall survival, Assessment of the overall survival was done by Kaplan-Meier method, The overall survival was measured by the percentage of patients who still alive for 12 months after they were started the management.|Assessment of the performance status, It was performed using the mean Karnofsky performance score, The mean Karnofsky performance score was done before treatment as a baseline; and 4 weeks after treatment.
Arterial blood gases evaluation, It included; Mean So2 (mm Hg), Mean PaO2 (mmHg), Mean PaCo2 (mm Hg)., Arterial blood gases was done before treatment as a baseline; and 4 weeks after treatment.|Six minute walk distance test, Six minute walk distance test was measured in minutes, Six minute walk test was done before treatment as a baseline; and 4 weeks after treatment.
