Evaluation of Treatment Predictors Reflecting Beta-catenin Activation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This prospective clinical trial will evaluate PET/CT and genomic liquid biopsy based biomarkers as predictors of clinical therapeutic response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary objective of this diagnostic trial is to assess the accuracy of pre-treatment fluorine-18 (18F-) fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT for predicting a lack of objective response (LOR) after 16 weeks of ICI therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Fluorine-18 fluorocholine
Lack of Objective Response, Lack of Objective Response defined after 16 weeks as meeting criteria for either Stable Disease or Progressive Disease based on RECIST v1.1, 16 weeks
Objective Response, Objective Response defined after 16 weeks as meeting criteria for either Partial Response or Complete Response based on RECIST v1.1, 16 weeks|Disease Control, Disease Control defined after 16 weeks as meeting criteria for either Partial Response, Complete Response, or Stable Disease based on RECIST v1.1, 16 weeks
This is a prospective open-label single-arm diagnostic clinical trial evaluating fluorine-18 fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT and cell-free DNA mutation profiling (also referred to as genomic liquid biopsy) as diagnostic tools for predicting therapeutic response in advanced HCC patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. All enrolled subjects will undergo diagnostic testing with FCH PET/CT and genomic liquid biopsy before ICI treatment. A fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT may also be performed before treatment and after 8 weeks if the pre-treatment FCH PET/CT shows low or heterogeneous tumor uptake. The accuracy of tumor biomarkers based on PET/CT and liquid biopsy for predicting therapeutic outcome and disease progression will be determined using objective clinical endpoints based on the radiographic classification of treatment response by RECIST v1.1 applied to CT or MRI performed after 16 weeks of treatment.
