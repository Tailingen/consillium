Single Agent Chemotherapy +/- Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Squamous or Non-squamous NSCLC With Primary Resistance to Prior PD-1 or PDL-1 Inhibitor
This is a randomized phase II study assessing the activity of single agent chemotherapy combined with nivolumab (Arm A) compared to single agent chemotherapy alone (Arm B) in squamous or non-squamous NSCLC subjects with primary resistance to prior PD-1 or PDL-1 inhibitor. The single agent chemotherapy chosen is at the discretion of the site investigator and may include pemetrexed, gemcitabine or taxotere. Institutional standards should be used for administration of the single agent chemotherapy. For both treatment arms, 21 days equals 1 cycle of therapy and subjects will be eligible to continue treatment until progressive disease by RECIST v1.1 or unacceptable toxicity.

Upon registration, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with single agent chemotherapy or single agent chemotherapy in combination with nivolumab. Randomization is un-blinded and open-label; therefore there will be no placebo treatment for subjects randomized to single agent chemotherapy
