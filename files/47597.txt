EXPLORATORY STUDY Addendum to INVAC1-CT-101 (NCT02301754)
This study will be an exploratory study of long term immunogenicity of INVAC-1 in patients who participated in the INVAC1-CT-101 phase I study (between 2014 and 2018).
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: INVAC-1 given in the previous phase 1 NCT02301754. No new injection is required in this study.
long term anti telomerase specific memory responses, will be measured by ELISPOT on blood of patients who were treated by INVAC-1 in the phase I NCT02301754 study and are still alive at the present time, 1 day visit
The primary goal of the study is to analyze anti-telomerase specific memory responses in blood of long term survival patients and to correlate these immune responses to their subsequent treatment since the end of INVAC1-CT-101 phase I study. Six patients are expected to participate in this study.
