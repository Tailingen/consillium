Trial of Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab With SRF388 or Placebo in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase 2 trial composed of an open label Lead-In followed by a Randomized Phase designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SRF388 in combination with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared to placebo (inactive substance) in combination with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in patients with first-line advanced or metastatic HCC.

A TEAE is an AE that emerges or worsens in the period from the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (Randomized Phase)., Up to 2 years|Incidence of SRF388 Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs), Percentage of patients who develop ADAs to SRF388., Up to 2 years|Incidence of atezolizumab ADAs, Percentage of patients who develop ADAs to atezolizumab., Up to 2 years|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of SRF388, Serum samples will be collected and analyzed to assess the Cmax of SRF388., Up to 2 years|Time of maximum observed serum concentration (tmax) of SRF388, Serum samples will be collected and analyzed to assess the (tmax) of SRF388., Up to 2 years|Area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point (AUC0-last), Serum samples will be collected and analyzed to assess AUC0-last of SRF388., Up to 2 years|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), Serum samples will be collected and analyzed to assess the t1/2 of SRF388., Up to 2 years|Serum concentrations of atezolizumab, Serum samples of atezolizumab will be collected to assess maintenance concentrations of atezolizumab, Up to 2 years
This is a Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SRF388 in combination with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Arm A) compared to placebo in combination with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Arm B) in patients with first-line advanced or metastatic HCC.

After a Lead-In Phase of up to 30 patients who will receive open-label SRF388 + atezolizumab + bevacizumab, the blinded Randomized Phase will randomize approximately 104 patients with a 1:1 allocation to Arm A or Arm B and stratified by geographic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (B or C).
