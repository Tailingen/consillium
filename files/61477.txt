Biomarkers of Angiogenesis for Response to Therapeutic Combination in Advanced or Metastatic Kidney Cancer
This is a multicenter, exploratory, prospective study to identify angiogenesis and immune-related biomarkers predictive of progression free survival in patients with metastatic or advanced renal cell carcinoma treated by a combination of immunotherapy and antiangiogenic.

BIOLOGICAL: Blood collection|OTHER: Tumour samples
Progression-free survival, Time from inclusion to progression documented by imaging and based on RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria or patient death. The iRECIST criteria use the same methods of monitoring tumor lesions as the RECIST 1.1 criteria but a confirmation 4-6 weeks after suspicion of progression is required to confirm or rule out progression because patients undergoing immunotherapy may present pseudo-progressions., 24 months
Objective response rate, Observation of a partial or complete response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria during the follow-up, 24 months|Response duration, Time between the observation of an objective response (partial or complete according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) and the progression, 24 months
Recently, the management of renal cell carcinoma has undergone major changes with the emergence of combined therapies associating tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as first line treatments. However, there are no criteria to guide the choice between the different combinations validated and or between ICI combinations. Angiogenesis and immunity are intimately linked and some markers related have could be interesting to predict the efficacy of these combinations. Angiogenesis and immunity are highly related. This link may lead to new biomarkers to be explored to predict the response to TKI + ICI therapy combinations. On this basis, the investigators propose to conduct an open-label exploratory, multicenter prospective trial to study the association between angiogenesis and immune markers and the effect of combined TKI+ICI treatments.
