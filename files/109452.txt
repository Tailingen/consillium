Lobectomy and Mediastinal Radiochemotherapy in Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Responding to Induction Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine if radical radiochemotherapy on the mediastinum after lobectomy can be associated with significant long term survival in patients with initially unresectable stage III NSCLC responding to induction chemotherapy but in which the residual disease is too large to be treated by radiotherapy.
Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Lobectomy followed by concomitant mediastinal chemoradiotherapy
Survival, Survival will be dated from the day of registration until death or last follow up
Operative mortality and morbidity, To be observed during the 30 days following the surgical procedure|Local control rate, After completion of treatment|Toxicity, After each course of chemotherapy and at the end of treatment
