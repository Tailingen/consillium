Multiparametric Characterization of Orbital Tumors by MRI
Prospective study on patients with orbital tumors of unknown origin. Aim of the study is to differentiate benign from malignant tumors upon MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit will be performed including standard morphological sequences and advanced sequence techniques. These advanced sequence techniques may allow to differentiate benign from malignant tumors based on their cellularity and vascularity (diffusion and perfusion imaging). These MRI data will be analysed and the level of diffusion and perfusion will be measured and compared to the histological findings. Cut-off values of diffusion and perfusion will be calculated that allow to separate benign from malignant tumors.
Orbital Tumors
OTHER: MRI
multiparametric characterization of orbital tumors by MRI, The level of diffusion and perfusion (multiparametric characterization) of the orbital tumors will be measured and the outcome measure is the ability of diffusion and perfusion imaging to predict malignancy. These parameters will be compared to histopathology in terms of separating benign vs. malignant tumors., 24 months
