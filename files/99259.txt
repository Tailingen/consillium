A Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Dynamic Effects of Different Doses of the Study Drug EMD 525797 in Prostate Cancer
This study is intended to test an experimental new drug called, EMD 525797 (Study Drug). This drug is not yet approved for sale and has only been tested in a small number of people to date (prior to this study starting another research study was carried out involving 37 healthy volunteers receiving the Study Drug). Until more is known about this Study Drug, it can only be used in research studies.

This research study is planned to answer important questions about how the Study Drug is tolerated and how it may work in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases.

This is a small study which is expected to include 24 patients, and will be conducted in approximately 3 hospitals in Germany and 1 hospital in Brussels, Belgium. The study will last until the last patient has had their last study visit which is expected to be about 18 months in total.
