: A Phase Ib/II Study To Evaluate Fruquintinib Monotherapy Or Plus Sintilimab In Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase Ib/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile and preliminary efficacy of fruquintinib monotherapy or plus sintilimab for advanced solid tumors. This study includes fruquintinib plus sintilimab treatment arm (dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase), and fruquintinib monotherapy arm.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Fruquintinib in Combination with Sintilimab
Dose escalation phase: Safety outcome evaluation - DLT, MTD/RP2D, Dose escalation phase: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of fruquintinib plus sintilimab for advanced solid tumors in the dose escalation phase, to observe dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and administration strategy of the combination therapy., From first dose to 30 days post the last dose|Dose expansion phase (except EMC cohort): efficacy outcome evaluation - ORR based on the investigator's tumor assessment, Dose expansion phase (except endometrial cancer \[EMC\] cohort): ORR assessed by investigator, very 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent|Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): efficacy outcome evaluation - ORR based on IRC's tumor assessment, Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): ORR by IRC, Every 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent|Fruquintinib monotherapy arm: efficacy outcome evaluation - ORR based on investigator's tumor assessment, Fruquintinib monotherapy arm: ORR by investigator, Every 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent
Immunogenicity Assessments for Anti-drug Antibody(ADA), Immunogenicity Assessments for Anti-drug Antibody(ADA), From Cycle 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 (each cycle is 28 days) and the safety visit for Sintilimab until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or withdrawal of consent|pharmacokinetics (PK) Assessments, To evaluate the PK profile of fruquintinib plus sintilimab, From Cycle 1 for Fruquintinib; Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 for Sintilimab in the dose escalation phase, and Cycle 1, 2, 4, 12 for dose expansion phase.|Dose expansion phase (except EMC cohort): Efficacy outcome evaluation - DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR based on the investigator's tumor assessment, Dose expansion phase (except EMC cohort): DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR by investigator, Every 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent|Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): Efficacy outcome evaluation - ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR based on the investigator's tumor assessment, Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR by investigator, Every 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent|Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): Efficacy outcome evaluation - DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR based on the IRC's tumor assessment, Dose expansion phase (EMC cohort): DCR, PFS, OS, DoR, TTR by IRC, Every 6 weeks since Cycle1 Day 1, and every 12 weeks after Week 48, until disease progression or death or new anti-cancer therapy or loss of follow-up or withdrawal of consent|Safety outcome evaluation, Overall incidence of AEs, incidence of Grade â‰¥ 3 AEs, etc., From first dose to 30 days post the last dose|Biomarker evaluation, Detect the expression of PD-L1 and/or other biomarkers in tumor tissues of patients, and analyze the relevant efficacy to provide reference for determining the dominant population., From first dose to 30 days post the last dose
Exploratory outcome, Evaluate the potential biomarkers related to the antitumor effect of fruquintinib plus sintilimab., From first dose to 30 days post the last dose
This study is composed of Fruquintinib plus sintilimab treatment arm and Fruquintinib monotherapy arm.

Fruquintinib plus sintilimab treatment arm:

* Dose escalation phase: it is planned to enroll about 26-39 patients
* Dose expansion phase: it is planned to enroll about 309-329 patients, including about 140 patients with endometrial cancer

Fruquintinib monotherapy arm: about 13 patients with advanced endometrial cancer
