The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for oral-related complications in patients with head and neck malignant tumors who receive radiotherapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* the efficacy of acupuncture for the prevention and treatment of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors
* the safety of acupuncture for the prevention and treatment of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors

Participants will:

* be treated with real acupuncture or sham acupuncture
* be evaluated to learn the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the prevention and treatment of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors

Researchers will compare real acupuncture group with sham acupuncture group to see if acupuncture has good efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the prevention and treatment of oral-related complications caused by radiotherapy for head and neck malignant tumors.
