Study of Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer
This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label Phase 1/2 study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin for patients with unresectable, advanced gastric cancer who had no prior palliative chemotherapy. Phase 1 was designed to determine the optimal dose of pemetrexed for its phase 2, which has been completed and now a total of 60 qualified patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 of this study. The treating physician will determined the maximum number of cycles of pemetrexed plus cisplatin that a patient may receive in this study.
Neoplasm, Gastric
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin
Objective Best Tumor Response, Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria., baseline to measured progressive disease (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)
Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., time of response to progressive disease or death (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)|Progression Free Survival, The period from study entry until disease progression or death on study, whichever occurred first., baseline to measured progressive disease or death (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death. For patients who are alive, overall survival is censored at the last contact., baseline to date of death from any cause (Survival follow-up were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and approximately every 3 months during post-therapy until death or up to 12 months after enrollment)
