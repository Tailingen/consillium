Effect of Ultrasound-guided Left Stellate Ganglion Block on Rapid Recovery of Patients Undergoing Cardiac Valve Replacement and Its Mechanism
In this study, Valve replacement patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly divided into control group and experimental group (SGB Group) , main outcome measures: postoperative complications (pulmonary infection, oxygenation injury, arrhythmia, hemorrhage, enteroparalysis, incision infection, renal insufficiency, cognitive impairment, etc.) and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcome measures: Hemodynamics, postoperative extubation time, length of stay and total cost of hospitalization. To investigate the effect of SGB on the rapid recovery of patients with Valve replacement heart disease after cardiopulmonary bypass.
Left Stellate Ganglion Block Can Quickly Restore the Left Stellate Ganglion|Possible Molecular Mechanism of Left Stellate Ganglion Block
PROCEDURE: stellate ganglion block
Postoperative complications, Pulmonary infection, oxygenation injury, malignant arrhythmia, hemorrhage, enteroparalysis, incision infection, renal insufficiency, cognitive dysfunction and so on, within 1 week after operation
Mortality, Mortality, Within 30 days after surgery
The concentration of blood factors in plasma, Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-Î± were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) at 1,3,6,24 and 72 h after operation., Within 3 days after surgery
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of left stellate ganglion block on the incidence and severity of postoperative complications in patients with cardiac Valve replacement undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, to compare the difference of inflammatory reaction between the control group and the stellate ganglion block group at different time points, and to preliminarily elucidate the molecular mechanism of stellate ganglion block in the protection of cardiac Valve replacement during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) . The first part is a prospective study on the effect of left stellate ganglion block on cardiac Valve replacement Hemodynamics during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) , the incidence, length of hospital stay, cost of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality of the common Valve replacement complications after cardiopulmonary bypass (pulmonary infection, oxygenation injury, arrhythmia, bleeding, intestinal paralysis, incision infection, renal insufficiency, cognitive impairment, etc.) , to determine the effect of left stellate ganglion block on rapid recovery from cardiac Valve replacement during cardiopulmonary bypass. In the second part, we collected the dynamic changes of inflammatory factors in plasma of control group and patients with stellate ganglion block before and 1,3,6,24 and 72 hours after operation, to explore the molecular mechanisms by which left stellate ganglion block promotes rapid recovery and reduces severe complications in patients with cardiac Valve replacement undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) .
