The Efficacy and Safety of BAT8001 Injection for the Treatment of HER2-positive Advanced Breast Cancer
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of BAT8001 for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, using lapatinib in combination with capecitabine as the positive control drug.
HER2-positive Advanced Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: BAT8001 for injection|DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v1.1), or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 18 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 30 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) determined on the basis of investigator assessments with the use of RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 30 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as as the time from the date of initial confirmed PR or CR to the date of disease progression or death within the study., Up to approximately 30 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response (confirmed PR or CR) or with stable disease (confirmed SD) for at least 6 months;, Up to approximately 30 months|Serum Concentration of BAT8001, Concentration of BAT8001 will be measured in serum from participants, who received BAT8001., Pre-dose and 15-30 minutes after dose on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 of each 21-day cycle during Cycles 1-4 and at completion/early termination visit (up to approximately 30 months)|Serum Concentration of total antibody of BAT8001 for injection, Concentration of total antibody will be measured in serum from participants, who received BAT8001., Pre-dose and 15-30 minutes after dose on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 of each 21-day cycle during Cycles 1-4 and at completion/early termination visit (up to approximately 30 months)|Plasma Concentration of batansine (a maytansine derivative, which is the 3AA-MDC complex), Concentration of batansine will be measured in plasma from participants, who received BAT8001., Pre-dose and 15-30 minutes after dose on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 of each 21-day cycle during Cycles 1-4 and at completion/early termination visit (up to approximately 30 months)|Percentage of Participants with Anti-therapeutic Antibodies (ATA) to BAT8001, ATA to BAT8001 were measured in serum of participants, who received BAT8001., Pre-dose on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle during Cycles 1-4 and at completion/early termination visit (up to approximately 30 months)
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled, superiority phase III clinical study. The object is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BAT8001 for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, using lapatinib in combination with capecitabine as the positive control drug.

Eligible subjects will be randomized to the experimental or control group in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by the number of HER2-positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer treatment regimens (0, 1 VS \> 1) and lesion site (organ VS non-organ).
