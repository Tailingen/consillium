Study of Pembrolizumab With Bendamustine in Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a phase 2 open-label study to test the safety and effectiveness of combining pembrolizumab and bendamustine in patients with relapsed (cancer that has come back or started getting worse) or refractory (cancer that is not responding or has stopped responding to treatment) Hodgkin lymphoma.
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma|Relapsed Cancer|Refractory Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Bendamustine Hydrochloride
Overall response rate, Complete response + partial response, 5 years|Complete response rate as determined by Lugano criteria, Assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, 5 years
Incidence of adverse events, duration from start of study until end, 5 years|Overall survival rate, for the duration of study, 5 years|Progression-free survival rate, for the duration of study, 5 years|Average duration of response, for the duration of study, 5 years
Pembrolizumab and bendamustine will be explored as a safe and effective treatment for these patients.

Although current treatment options are available for patients in the relapsed state, once these therapies fail or are not tolerated, treatment options are quite limited.

Pembrolizumab and bendamustine have both shown activity when used as a single agent as treatment for Hodgkin Lymphoma. Their side effect profiles also do not overlap, which makes them ideal to combine, with an intent to increase the amount and duration of complete responses while limiting the toxicities experienced by patients.
