Circulating Extracellular Exosomal Small RNA as Potential Biomarker for Human Pancreatic Cancer
This study is for the verification of biomarkers for pancreatic cancer treatment using small RNA liquid biopsy, combined with EUS-FNA tissues.
Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Venous sampling
senstivity, sensitivity of exo-sRNA, up to 8 weeks|specificity, specificity of exo-sRNA to differentiate between PAAD and other benigh or malignant pancreatic occupying lesions, up to 8 weeks
survival time, relationship between expression level of chosen exosomal RNA and patients' survival time in PAAD group, up to 18 months
CA19-9 is the FDA approved biomarker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, the specificity of CA19-9 to differentiate between pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or other pancreatic lesions is not satisfying enough.

Tumor cells secret abundant exosomes in the early stage. Circulating tumor cells are detected mainly in the advanced stage. Meanwhile, the role of non-coding RNA draws more and more attention in tumor area. Exosomes protect inside RNA from plasma RNase. Compared with long RNA, small RNA, including miRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, piRNA could exist more stably.

By means of next-generation sequencing, we look forward to finding new exosomal small RNA biomarkers.
