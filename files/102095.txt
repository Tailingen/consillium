A Randomized Comparative Study of a Weekly Versus Every Other Week Nurse Practitioner-led Symptom Management Clinic for Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiation
A retrospective chart review of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for oropharynx cancer was performed to compare clinical data for patients treated prior to the initiation of the NP clinic with those subsequently seen weekly in the NP clinic. The variables studied included; rate of hospitalization, dose completion and dose reductions. The results revealed an overall improvement in all variables for those patients seen in the weekly NP clinic.

To further analyze this data a randomized, prospective study is proposed to validate the findings of the retrospective study. It is predicted that a weekly NP led clinic will decrease costly hospitalizations, increase patient treatment completion and improve overall patient quality of life and satisfaction.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: Nurse Practitioner Clinic
Percentage of Patients that Experience a "Problem" during Cancer Treatment, A "problem" includes any one of three events: dose reduction, inability to complete treatment, or toxicity related hospitalization. Patients are assigned a 1 if any of these events occurs at least once during treatment or are assigned 0 if they complete treatment with no dose reductions or toxicity related hospitalizations. When data is analyzed and reported, the problem rate will be summarized along with the each individual negative component., 11 weeks
