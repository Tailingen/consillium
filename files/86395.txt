Ph. II Temozolomide + O6-BG in Treatment of Pts w Temozolomide-Resistant Malignant Glioma
Objectives:

To define role of O6-Benzylguanine (BG) in restoring Temodar (temozolomide) sensitivity in patients with Temodar-resistant malignant glioma.

To further define toxicity of combo therapy using Temodar + BG.
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Anaplastic Glioma
DRUG: Temodar and O6-Benzylguanine (BG)
Radiographic evidence of tumor response, 6 months
6 month progression-free survival, 6 months|Relationship between tumor AGT at original diagnosis & response to Temozolomide + O6-BG, 6 months
2 separate strata accrued independently of each other: Stratum 1-patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Stratum 2-patients with Anaplastic Glioma \[anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed (AA and AO)\] .

BG at 120mg/m2 administered intravenously over 1 hour followed immediately by 48-hour infusion at 30mg/m2/24hrs. Temozolomide 472mg/m2 administered orally, in fasting state, within 60 minutes of end of the 1-hour administration of BG infusion. Treatment cycles may be repeated every 28 days following dose of Temodar from previous cycle.

Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue and hyperglycemia. Hypersensitivity reactions have not yet been noted with Temodar. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs, Temodar may be carcinogenic. BG toxicities include agitation, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, elevated liver functions, \& leukemia; but, not with BG as single agent. Transient lymphopenia has been seen with BG as single agent.
