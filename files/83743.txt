Widening Aims and Giving Patients a Voice for Expanded Structures in Breast Cancer Care Jointly Developed by Patients and Physicians
The aim of this BZKF project is to record the current care structure for breast cancer patients in order to use this as a basis for developing possible future models for improvement. The active involvement of representatives of regional and national patient organizations in the creation of a patient-based and patient-oriented survey ensures that the needs of patients are the focus. In addition to and in contrast to other projects, relevant questions are explicitly addressed not only to patients but also to physicians in order to identify and specify the interfaces between patient wishes/suggestions and to develop clinical consequences for care.

The first objective is to survey the "current situation" by recording the current care structure for breast cancer. The focus is on the survey of both groups on patient-physician communication, time management and coping strategies.

By planning the future harmonization of national data structures, the basis is created for the long-term goal of an improved "target", a concept developed jointly by physicians and patients for an improved communication and care structure that focuses on the patient.

OTHER: Questionnaire patients|OTHER: Questionnaire physicians
Current state of care - patient view, The primary aim of the questionnaire is to record the current reality of care for breast cancer patients with a focus on communication., through study completion, an average of 3 years
Current state of care - physician view, Secondarily, a comparison will be made with the physicians assessment of the same topics, through study completion, an average of 3 years
