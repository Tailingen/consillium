A Trial of Chemotherapy Before and After Surgery for Stage II,III Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To determine whether chemotherapy before surgery makes better outcome than chemotherapy after surgery in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Esophageal Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell
DRUG: Surgery +(Cisplatin 80 mg/㎡+5FU 800mg/㎡×5days)×2|DRUG: (Cisplatin 80 mg/㎡+5FU 800mg/㎡×5days)×2＋Surgery
Disease free survival, year
Overall survival, year|Toxicity of chemotherapy, year|Operative morbidity, year
The previous study JCOG9204 showed that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil has a detectable preventive effect on relapse in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with surgery alone.(J Clin Oncol 2003;21:4592-4596) Therefore the standard treatment for stage II and III esophageal cancer is adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.
