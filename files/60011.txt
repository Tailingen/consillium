A Study for Participants With Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look for an improvement in progression free survival with the combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin (or cisplatin) and cetuximab in participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration from the date of enrollment to the first date of documented objective progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of new lesions. For participants who were not known to have died or to have had objective PD at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, PFS was censored at their last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to the cutoff date or the date of initiation of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy., From enrollment to measured progressive disease up to 15.3 months (tumor assessments performed every other cycle during study treatment, and then every 6 weeks during follow-up)
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. For participants who were alive at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, OS was censored at the date of last contact prior to that cut-off date., From enrollment to the date of death from any cause up to 26.4 months (assessment completed during trial period at least every 3 months)|Percentage of Participants Having a Confirmed Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR), PR or CR is classified by the investigators according to RECIST criteria version 1.0. PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesions; CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Percentage of participants having a PR or CR is calculated as a total number of participants with PR or CR from enrollment until disease progression or recurrence divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., From enrollment to objectively determined progressive disease up to 15.3 months (tumor assessments performed every other cycle during study treatment until progressive disease)|Change From Baseline in Participant-Reported European-Quality of Life-5 Dimension Instrument-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L), EQ-5D-3L is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and each of which has 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. A regression equation defines a utility value for these health states to generate an index score. The possible values for index score range from -0.594 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1 (no problem in all dimensions) on a scale where 1 represents the best possible health state. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to record a participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state on the day of questionnaire administration and is captured on a scale of 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, cetuximab monotherapy Cycles 2 and 4 (21-day cycle)|Change From Baseline in Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS-HNC), PSS-HNC is a clinician-rated instrument designed to measure speaking and eating disabilities of participants with head and neck cancer and consists of 3 subscales: normalcy of diet (NOD) subscale measures the ability of the participants to eat a normal diet, subscale ranges from 0 (non-oral feeding) to 100 (unrestricted diet); understandability of speech (UOS) subscale measures the degree a clinician is able to understand the participant's speech, subscale ranges from 0 (never understandable) to 100 (always understandable); eating in public (EIP) subscale, rating based on the participant's response to the questions of whom he/she eats with and in what setting, subscale ranges from 0 (always eats alone) to 100 (no restriction of place, food, or companion). Change from baseline: negative value represents a decrease in function and a positive value represents an increase in function., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, cetuximab monotherapy Cycles 2 and 4 (21-day cycle)
Number of Participants Who Died While on Treatment and Died During 30-Day Post-Treatment Discontinuation Follow-Up (FU), Presented are the number of participants who died due to adverse events (AEs) while on treatment and participants who died due to progressive disease (PD) during the 30-day post-treatment discontinuation FU., From enrollment to 30 days post-treatment discontinuation up to 26.4 months
The purpose of this study is to look for an improvement in progression free survival with the combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin (or cisplatin) and cetuximab in participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
