PET [89Zr]DFO-starPEG in Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, pilot study of the novel PET-imaging radiotracer \[89Zr\]DFO-starPEG. The study is designed to obtain preliminary data to support future development of this agent as an imaging surrogate to visualize enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)-mediated tracer uptake before administration of EPR-based nanomedicines.
Solid Tumor|Solid Carcinoma|Soft Tissue Lesion
DRUG: 89-zr-dfo-star polyethylene glycol (StarPEG)|PROCEDURE: Whole Body Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PROCEDURE: Specimen Collection
Median Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) by cohort, The median and range for intra-tumoral SUVmax within metastatic lesions will be descriptively reported, to assess for intra-tumoral heterogeneity and differences in uptake by site of disease., Up to 9 days|Tumor-to-background signal ratio (muscle), Adjusted SUVmax data will be averaged across up to 15 lesions within a given patient (SUVmax-avg). VOI will also be placed around the aortic blood pool and paraspinal musculature. Tumor to muscle SUV ratios will be calculated by dividing tumoral SUV by muscle SUV, respectively, Up to 9 days|Tumor-to-background signal ratio (blood), Adjusted SUVmax data will be averaged across up to 15 lesions within a given patient (SUVmax-avg). VOI will also be placed around the aortic blood pool and paraspinal musculature. Tumor to blood SUV ratios will be calculated by dividing tumoral SUV by blood SUV., Up to 9 days|Mean absorbed dose of PET [89Zr]DFO-starPEG (Cohort A), Volumes of interest (VOIs) will be drawn around regions identified on the scans that exhibits clearly elevated uptake over the background. Time-activity curves will be generated for each organ, and curve-fitting will be performed to derive the time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs, also known as residence times). TIACs will be entered into the OLINDA software. The results from all participants in the dosimetry cohort will be combined to allow the calculation of mean, standard deviation (SD), and range of radiation-absorbed doses to individual organs as well as effective dose., Up to 9 days
Proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events, Adverse events reported after infusion will be graded according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 by cohort will be reported., Up to 9 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To descriptively report patterns of \[89Zr\]DFO-starPEG uptake on whole-body PET (Cohorts A \& B).

II. To determine the radiation dosimetry following \[89Zr\]DFO-starPEG administration (Cohort A).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety of \[89Zr\]DFO-starPEG (Cohorts A \& B).

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To study the pharmacokinetics of \[89Zr\]DFO-starPEG and estimate its half-life (Cohort A).

OUTLINE:

Participants will be assigned to one of 2 cohorts:

* COHORT A: Participants will receive multiple scans over time
* COHORT B: Participants will receive a scan at a single time point

Participants will be followed for adverse events for approximately 1 week after radiotracer administration until the Day 5-9 visit.
