A Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of SCR-6920 Capsule in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
A Phase 1, open label, multi center, dose escalation and expansion study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SCR-6920 capsule in participants with advanced malignant tumors. The purpose of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to confirm the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SCR-6920 in participants with advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL).
Solid Tumor|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: SCR-6920 capsule|DRUG: SCR-6920 capsule|DRUG: SCR-6920 capsule|DRUG: SCR-6920 capsule
Dose limiting toxicity(DLT), DLT will be evaluated within 28 days since first dose. The number of DLTs will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., Up to 28 days|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Participants with solid tumor: ORR based on RECIST1.1 criteria; Participants with NHL: ORR based on Lugano criteria, Up to approximately 1 years
Number of participants with any adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), withdrawal due to AEs, dose interruptions and reductions, All AEs, SAEs and dose modifications will be collected. Adverse events as characterized by type, severity, timing and relationship to study therapy. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Up to approximately 1 years|Number of participants with clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination and organ-specific parameters., Blood and urine samples will be collected for analysis of lab parameters. Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examinations and organ-specific parameters will be collected at specified time points. Number of participants with clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination and organ-specific parameters will be reported., Up to approximately 1 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Area Under the Curve (AUC), Blood samples will be collected at given time points to determine the AUC (0-t) and AUC (0-inf) of SCR-6920, Up to approximately 1 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Blood samples will be collected at given time points to determine the Cmax of SCR-6920., Up to approximately 1 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Trough Concentration (Ctrough), Blood samples will be collected at given time points to determine the Ctrough of SCR-6920., Up to approximately 1 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax), Blood samples will be collected at given time points to determine the Tmax of SCR-6920., Up to approximately 1 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Terminal elimination half life (t1/2), Blood samples will be collected at given time points to determine the t1/2 of SCR-6920., Up to approximately 1 years|Change from Baseline in symmetrical arginine dimethylation (SDMA) as a PD measure, Evaluation of change from baseline in SDMA, a PD biomarker of PRMT5 inhibition., Up to approximately 1 years
