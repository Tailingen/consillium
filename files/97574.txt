Safety and Efficacy Study of Glufosfamide in Ovarian Cancer
Primary Objectives:

* To evaluate the effect of glufosfamide on the serum concentrations of CA125 in subjects with ovarian cancer
* To evaluate the safety of weekly glufosfamide dosing in subjects with ovarian cancer as compared with every 21-day dosing

Secondary objectives:

* To evaluate the efficacy of glufosfamide in subjects with ovarian cancer as measured by objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of glufosfamide and isophosphoramide mustard during and after treatment

Exploratory objective:

* To correlate efficacy endpoints with expression of tumor-associated glucose transporter proteins
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Glufosfamide
CA 125 Response Rate, Reduction in blood levels of CA 125 of \>50% from baseline, confirmed at the next study cycle., Duration of study, up to 18 weeks.
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate measured by RECIST v1.0, Duration of study, up to 18 weeks.|Progression-free Survival, Time from initiation of study drug to disease progression or death on study, Median measured in months|Overall Survival, Time from initiation of study drug to death., Median measured in months, until death or censorship at analysis.
Open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 dose escalation study. Subjects will be randomized to receive either once every three weeks dosing regimen or the weekly dosing regimen. Randomization will utilize a 2:1 ratio with two-thirds of the subjects randomized to the weekly dosing regimen.

In the weekly dosing schedule, treatment with glufosfamide 2,500 mg/m2 will be initiated only after the 1,660 mg/m2 treatment cohort has been enrolled and there is evidence that the dose of 1,660 mg/m2 has been well tolerated (See below Section on Pharmacokinetic/Statistical Analyses).
