A Phase Ib Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Avelumab in Combination With M9241(NHS-IL12) (JAVELIN IL-12)
The study consisted of 2 parts: Dose Escalation phase (Part A) and Expansion phase (Part B). The dose escalation phase evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of avelumab in combination with M9241 in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumors. Expansion phase assessed the safety and clinical activity of the combination regimen in selected tumor types. In Expansion phase subjects who had completed the combination treatment of avelumab at a given dose level of M9241, a safety review was performed by the Safety monitoring committee in order to make a decision on the next dose level. Successive cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects were treated with escalating doses of M9241 with avelumab intravenous (IV).
