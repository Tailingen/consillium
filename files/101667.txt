A Phase II Study of Chemoradiotherapy With Nimotuzumab in Unresectable Esophageal Cancer
This phase II clinical study is designed to evaluate the 1 year local tumor control rates after the targeted therapy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy synchronized chemotherapy with nimotuzumab combined with S-1 in local advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinomas based on Nutritional Risk Screening NRS2002.
