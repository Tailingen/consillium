Red Yeast Rice in Subjects With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance
Agents that inhibit cholesterol synthesis are being investigated in cancers dependent upon cholesterogenesis. Red yeast rice (RYR), is a reddish-purple fermented rice, containing statins which are known to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Laboratory studies have also shown that RYR has direct effects on androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer cells, inhibiting their growth. It is thought that RYR may have clinical benefit in those subjects with localized prostate cancer who have chosen to be managed by active surveillance.

Red yeast rice has been promoted as a safe and effective alternative to statin therapy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Red yeast rice has the potential to slow prostate cancer growth by inhibiting cholesterol and androgen biosynthesis. There is a strong rationale for the use of RYR in patients being managed with active surveillance for localized, low risk, prostate cancer. To date, no human studies utilizing RYR in this setting have been reported.
