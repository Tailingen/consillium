This is an open-label, multicenter phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of HLX208 (BRAF V600E Inhibitor) combined with HLX10 （anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody）in advanced NSCLC patients with BRAF V600 mutation.

For the phase Ib study, HLX208 is administered orally at two dose levels of 600mg BID or 900 mg BID. And HLX10 is administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 300mg every 3 weeks.

For the phase II study, HLX208 is administered orally with the RP2D dose. And HLX10 is administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 300mg every 3 weeks.
