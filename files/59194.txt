Project PLUS Lung Cancer Screening Promotion
Project PLUS is a pilot study that aims to develop and obtain preliminary feasibility and efficacy data on an enhanced risk communication approach to promote lung cancer screening (LCS) intentions among screening-eligible individuals from environmentally burdened communities. Project PLUS will combine qualitative interviews to explore subject awareness regarding lung cancer risk and air pollution, barriers to LCS, and perceptions regarding risk communication messaging, develop a health education video, and a between-subjects experiment to compare Data from this pilot will form the basis for enhanced community engagement efforts and subsequent communication research to examine the effectiveness of incorporating the involuntary air pollution risk information in risk communication interventions. The long term goal is to reduce lung cancer burden and disparities among environmentally burdened communities within and outside of Philadelphia.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Intervention video|BEHAVIORAL: Control video
The number of patients who intend or do obtain lung cancer screening within the next 3 months., This outcome will be measured using a post-test survey given to patients immediately after viewing a health education video assessing the patient's intention to obtain a lung cancer screening within the next 3 months., Assessed immediately after viewing the health education video.
Completion of lung cancer screening, The study team will utilize chart review and medical record data to assess whether patients scheduled or received a lung cancer screening within 6 months of enrollment in the study., 6 months of study enrollment

This study is guided by the Health Belief Model and the Reasoned Action Approach.1 The study team will engage with two community partner organizations (Chester Environmental Partnership and Clean Water Action) to obtain feedback in implementing the study procedures and input on content for the health education video. The long-term goal is to improve LCS and reduce racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in lung cancer mortality.
