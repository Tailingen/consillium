Prognostic Impact of Adjuvant Therapy in Primary Hepatic Sarcomatoid Carcinoma
In recent years, researchers have conducted extensive studies on adjuvant therapy following surgical resection of liver cancer, exploring its potential benefits and seeking effective treatment strategies. Given the rarity and high aggressiveness of primary hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma, there is a lack of reliable clinical evidence on whether postoperative adjuvant therapy can benefit patients, resulting in the absence of established standard guidelines. Therefore, we conducted a single-center retrospective study to assess the potential benefits of postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients of primary hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma.

PROCEDURE: postoperative adjuvant therapy
Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from liver resection to disease recurrence or death from any cause., From December 2018 to May 2023
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from liver resection to death or the last follow-up., From December 2018 to May 2023
