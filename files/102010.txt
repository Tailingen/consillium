A Study Explore JS001+JS002 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This open-label phase I clinical study with clinical development phase will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of JS002 combined with Toripalimab in advanced cancer patients, who has failed standard therapy OR could not tolerate standard therapy OR refused/had no standard therapy.

This study is divided into two parts:

Part A. JS002 combined with Toripalimab dose escalation and dose expansion phase; Part B.JS002 combined with Toripalimab clinical expansion phase.
