Improving Psychosocial Quality of Life in Women With Advanced Breast Cancer
Through a patient participation aid (PPA) the investigators hope to improve the psychosocial well-being of women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer by empowering them to be active participants in clinical encounters.

BEHAVIORAL: Patient-Participation Aid
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), Evaluated at 30 minutes prior to, one week after, and 3 months after the patients visit with their doctor, this measure collects scales of the social and family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being., Change in functional assessment of cancer therapy from pre-visit at 3 months post-visit
Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM-SF), A 7-item word recognition test to provide clinicians with a valid quick assessment of patient health literacy., Pre-Visit
Decision Regret Scale, Collected at post-visit, and follow-ups, this measures the patient's regret and feelings regarding the most recent treatment-related decision, Change in decision regret from pre-visit at 3 months post-visit
The team has developed a brief Patient Participation Aid (PPA) to promote patient health literacy and encourage women to be active in the decisions that are being made about their healthcare which will lead to their satisfaction with healthcare and improves their psychosocial well-being. The paper-based PPA uses adult learning principles to limit and sequence plain language messages that have been framed from a patient's perspective. The PPA uses theory-based design to increase patients' involvement in the medical visit by modeling - through text and images - how a patient can: 1) set the visit agenda, 2) formulate questions, and 3) assert personal preferences. The specific aims of this study are to: 1- Assess the effectiveness of the PPA to increase patient involvement during clinical encounters. 2- Evaluate the effectiveness of the PPA to improve patient psychosocial outcomes. 3- Explore if the effect of the PPA varies by patients' literacy skills. To achieve this aims, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the PPA among patients with a new diagnosis or progression of metastatic breast cancer at two cancer centers that serve diverse patient populations.
