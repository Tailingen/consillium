Non-invasive Brain Tumor Molecular Diagnostics and Monitoring
This prospective multicenter study aims to enroll GBM patients who will undergo repeated assessments (preoperatively and 3 months post-surgery) to detect circulating tumor cells and analyze the transcriptomic profiles of EVs in their blood. The prognostic and monitoring significance of these biomarkers to disease course (assessing treatment efficacy, resistance incidence, tumor progression) will be evaluated.

Concurrently, proteomic profiles typical of GBM will be analyzed in blood and ocular secretion samples from GBM patients, patients with low-grade gliomas, and patients without brain tumors to identify and validate novel protein biomarkers suitable for disease monitoring. Additionally, this study proposes an innovative approach to monitor GBM patients by investigating the presence of GBM-specific nucleic acid fragments in urine.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Diagnostic test
Proteomic profiles of proximal liquids in brain tumor patients, The protein profiles will be measured in ocular secretion and plasma samples of patients wiht GBM, low-grade glioma and control cohort. Candidate proteins will be correleted with clinical parameters. The number of patients with identified prognostic biomarkers will be reported., 2020-2023|Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for non-invasive monitoring of GBM patients., The number of CTCs and their molecular characteristics will be measured in peripheral blod of GBM patients. The CTCs counts will be correleted with the clinical parameters. The number of patients with the presence or absence of CTCs will be reported., 2020-2030|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) for non-invasive monitoring of GBM patients., The RNA profiles of EVs will be measured in plasma samples of patients wiht GBM. Candidate RNAs will be correleted with clinical parameters. The number of patients with identified prognostic RNAs will be reported., 2020-2030|Urine as a source of GBM-specific nucleic acids fragments for disease monitoring., The GBM-specific nucleic acids fragments will be measured in urine of GBM patients. Candidate nucleic acids will be correleted with clinical parameters. The number of patients with identified prognostic biomolecules will be reported., 2025-2030
