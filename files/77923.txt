Clinical Validation of a Urinary Exosome Gene Signature in Men Presenting for Suspicion of Prostate Cancer
Validate a non-DRE exosome gene expression test, with an NPV \>/= 90% certainty, will exclude the presence of high gleason grade/ score (\>/=7) prostate cancer in a prostate needle biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: ExoIntelliScore Prostate
Correlate an exosome gene expression signature with the presence or absence of high grade prostate cancer in the prostate needle biopsy., Validate various thresholds utilizing the exosome RNA gene signature to stratify patients based on the likelihood of having any Gleason pattern 4 disease present within the biopsy (or when available the prostatectomy specimen surgical pathology report) for first time biopsy patients in the PSA gray zone of 2.0-10 ng/mL. In our earlier cohort analyses and in the literature there is an expected 20-25% of patients who will present with Gleason score \>/=7 and the prevalence of a dominant Gleason 4 varies considerably dependent upon studies from 17-30%., one year
The purpose of this multi-center clinical study is to determine the association of an Exosome Urine Test score with the presence of high Gleason grade / score (GS\>/=7) prostate cancer on a prostate needle biopsy and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men presenting to their urologist with or without a previous negative biopsy, and recommended for an initial or subsequent biopsy. The results of this study are to support the use of this assay as a laboratory developed test. A secondary objective is to develop an assay that accurately predicts the presence of any Gleason grade prostate cancer in men at risk for prostate cancer.
