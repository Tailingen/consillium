Phase II Study of KW-0761 in Subjects With CCR4-positive Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma
To evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of KW-0761, the anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antibody, when administered weekly for 8 weeks as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg in relapsed subjects with CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.
Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: KW-0761
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Response rate defined as the proportion of responders relative to the total population and its exact 95% confidence interval were calculated for best overall response.

The antitumor response criteria (Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD)) were created based on the criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology as well as the criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by the Lymphoma Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG-LSG).Overall Response (OR)= CR + PR., From date of first subject's consent to participate in the study until the date of last protocol-specified examination for last subject completed, assessed up to 14 months.|Pharmacokinetics-Plasma KW-0761 Concentrations, Statistics of plasma KW-0761 concentrations were tabulated. Individual and mean (+standard deviation) plasma KW-0761 concentrations were plotted on a linear and a logarithmic scale against the time of blood sampling.

The baseline and maximum time point at which Cmax and Ctrough were collected are 0 to 7 days post-dose., 0 to 7 days post final dose|Pharmacokinetics-Plasma KW-0761 Concentrations (AUC0-7days), Statistics of plasma KW-0761 concentrations were tabulated. Individual and mean (+standard deviation) plasma KW-0761 concentrations were plotted on a linear and a logarithmic scale against the time of blood sampling., 0 to 7 days post final dose|Pharmacokinetics-Plasma KW-0761 Concentrations (t1/2), 0 to 28 days post final dose and follow-up examinations (1 month and 3 months after the end of the post-dosing observation period).
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from the date of first KW-0761 dosing to the date of progressive disease(PD) confirmation or death.

The antitumor response criteria including PD were created based on the criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network(NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology as well as the criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by the Lymphoma Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG-LSG)., Baseline to response|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of first KW-0761 dosing to the date of death., Baseline to response
