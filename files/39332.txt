Registry Protocol for Tracking Trial Subjects After VTI-206 Study Completion
VTI-207 (NCT01452295) is designed to follow subjects, both treated and control, for five years after their completion of study participation in protocol VTI-206 (NCT00973817) to gather information relating to the incidence of liver transplant, the incidence and type of cancer (if any), and survival.
Acute Liver Failure
DRUG: ELAD (Extracorporeal Liver Assist System)
Gather data, See previous description, Five years post study participation
Vital Therapies, Inc. (VTI) is conducting clinical trial VTI-206 in which subjects with acute on chronic hepatitis (AOCH) and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) are treated with the ELAD system to assess the safety and efficacy of this therapy. The ELAD system incorporates cloned immortalized human liver cells (C3A cells). A hypothetical risk exists that, over an extended period of time, there may be an increased incidence of tumor in subjects treated with ELAD.

The company is also collecting data related to whether a patient received a liver transplant and on survival.
