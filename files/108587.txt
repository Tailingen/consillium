FAPI PET/CT in Various FAP-Related Disease Patients
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga/18F-FAPI positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in various FAP-related disease patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Single Group Assignment
Standardized uptake value (SUV), Standardized uptake value (SUV) of FAPI for each target lesion of subject or suspected primary tumor or/and metastasis., 30 days
Diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FAPI PET/CT were calculated., 30 days
Subjects with various FAP-related disease patients underwent 68Ga/18F-FAPI PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Lesions uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 68Ga/18F-FAPI PET/CT were calculated.
