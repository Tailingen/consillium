Romiplostim Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Subjects With Low or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for study 20060198 recommended that all subjects discontinue treatment of study drug and continue to be followed for long term follow-up. Amgen adopted the DMC recommendation.

Number of Clinically Significant Bleeding Events, A clinically significant bleeding event is defined as any bleeding event of grade ≥ 2 per the modified World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale: • Grade 0 = no bleeding • Grade 1 = petechia or mucosal or retinal bleeding not requiring intervention • Grade 2 = melena, hematemesis, hematuria, hemoptysis • Grade 3 = bleeding required red cell transfusion • Grade 4 = retinal bleeding with visual impairment • Grade 5 = non-fatal cerebral bleeding • Grade 6 = fatal cerebral bleeding • Grade 7 = fatal non-cerebral bleeding. Bleeding events that continue for more than 7 days were counted as separate events every eighth day. Multiple events that arose from one organ system on one day were collapsed into one single event. Bleeding events with a start date between the first dose date and the last dose date of the test treatment period+7 days are included., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)
Annualized Rate of Platelet Transfusion Events, A discrete platelet transfusion is any number of platelet transfusion administered within a 3-day period. Transfusions administered more than 3 days apart are counted as separate events. Transfusion given in the absence of any bleeding, when platelet count is \>10x10\^9/L, is not counted as a platelet transfusion event. Events with start date between the first dose date and the last dose date of the test treatment period +7 days are included. Exposure adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years = (events / patient-years \* 100). Patient Year = total patient years of exposure to investigational product during 26 weeks test treatment period., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)|Annualized Rate of Overall Bleeding Events, The time from first dose of study drug to the last dose of 26-week test treatment period. A bleeding event is defined as any bleeding event reported during the test treatment period. Bleeding events that continue for more than 7 days are counted as separate events every eighth day. Multiple events that arose from one organ system on one day are collapsed into one single event. Exposure adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years = events / patient-year \* 100)., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)|Annualized Rate of Total Platelet Transfusion Units, The time from first dose of study drug to the last dose of 26-week test treatment period. A unit of platelets is defined as a single pack of pooled platelet-rich plasma comprised of 6 to 8 individual platelet concentrate packs (200 to 400 mL), a single pack of pooled buffy-coat concentrate, or 1 apheresis (single donor) concentrate. Exposure adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years = events / patient-years \* 100., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)|Number of Participants With Platelet Hematologic Improvement (HI-P), Platelet Hematologic Improvemen defined by the international working group (IWG) as: an absolute increase in platelet count of ≥ 30 x 10\^9/L for a patient starting with a platelet count of ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L or an increase in platelet count from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L and by at least 100% in a patient that started with a platelet count \< 20 x 10\^9/L. To account for any possible contribution from platelet transfusions, platelet counts within 3 days following administration of platelet transfusion is not counted towards the platelet hematologic improvement endpoint. If no platelet measurements are available on the weekly scheduled dose day, then that week is not counted towards the platelet hematologic improvement endpoint., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)|Exposure-adjusted Total Duration of Platelet Hematologic Improvement (HI-P) in the Absence of Platelet Transfusions, Duration for participants who did not report HI-P during the period is 0. A platelet hematologic improvement (HI-P) is defined by an MDS International Working criteria as patients with a baseline platelet count of ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L achieving an absolute increase of ≥ 30 x 10\^9/L or increasing the platelet count to above 20 x 10\^9/L and by at least 100% in patients with a baseline of \< 20 x 10\^9/L for at least 8 consecutive weeks. To account for any possible contribution from platelet transfusions, platelet counts within 3 days following administration of platelet transfusion is not counted towards the platelet hematologic improvement endpoint. If no platelet measurements are available on the weekly scheduled dose day, then that week is not counted towards the platelet hematologic improvement endpoint. The durations of HI-P are cumulative if more than one incidence occurred. Exposure adjusted event rate per 100 patient-weeks = total number of weeks / patient-weeks \* 100., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)|Number of Participants Who Died, From randomization to 58 weeks, the end of study visit or the closest available follow-up information up to 58 weeks from the long term follow-up for those who discontinued the study early, with a data cut-off date of 20 July 2012.|Time to Death, Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. For patients who discontinued early, additional information from the long term follow-up are added (closest available follow-up information up to 58 weeks)., From randomization to 58 weeks, the end of study visit or the closest available follow-up information up to 58 weeks from the long term follow-up for those who discontinued the study early, with a data cut-off date of 20 July 2012.|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Survival at Month 12, Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods., Month 12, with a data cut-off date of 20 July 2012.|Annualized Rate of Patient-reported Bleeding Events, The number of bleeding events was obtained from the thrombocytopenia symptoms (Th-symptoms) survey. Patients reported spontaneous bleeding to have occurred 0, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, or 7 or more times in the past week. The lower threshold of bleeding counts is used for conservative purposes (i.e., the "3" is used for the response option of "3 or 4 times"). Exposure adjusted event rate per 100 patient-years = number of events / patient-year \* 100., Test Treatment Period (Weeks 1-26)
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of romiplostim (formerly, AMG 531) treatment in thrombocytopenic MDS patients. The study is composed of a 26-week placebo controlled test treatment period (romiplostim versus Placebo), a 4 week interim wash-out period, a 24-week placebo controlled extended treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period followed by an End of Study (EOS) visit. During the interim wash-out period, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed in the absence of growth factor to assess changes in the marrow. In the extended treatment period, safety assessments will continue and participants will be allowed to receive any standard of care treatments for MDS. Patients will be followed for survival for an additional 60 months following the End of Study (EOS) visit.
