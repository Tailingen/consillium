A Study of Carboplatin Plus Etoposide With or Without ZKAB001 (Anti-PD-L1 Antibody) in Patients With ES-SCLC
This is a randomized, Phase III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZKAB001 in combination with carboplatin + etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in patients who have ES-SCLC and are untreated for their extensive-stage disease.

This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter III study.

Eligible patients will randomly enter the trial group or control group at 1:1, that is, ZKAB001+ carboplatin + etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide, with a treatment cycle every 3 weeks. There are 4 cycles of chemotherapy.

Stratification factors included gender (male / female), PS score (0/1) and brain metastasis (yes / no).

The study included screening period, treatment period (subjects received study treatment until confirmed disease progression, or intolerable toxic reaction, or reached the maximum medication cycle of 2 years, or the subject voluntarily requested the end of the study treatment) and follow-up period (including safety follow-up and survival follow-up).
