A First-in-human Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Anti-tumor Activity of SAR439459 Monotherapy and Combination of SAR439459 and Cemiplimab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objectives:

Dose escalation (Part 1)

Part 1A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum administered dose (MAD) of SAR439459 when administered intravenously as monotherapy in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

Part 1B (SAR439459 and cemiplimab combination therapy)

* To determine the MTD and/or MAD of SAR439459 administered intravenously in combination with cemiplimab administered intravenously in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

Dose expansion (Part 2)

Part 2A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

* To determine optimal dose of SAR439459 administered intravenously in adult patients with advanced melanoma who have failed a prior therapy based on anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1) or anti-PD-L1.

Part 2B (SAR439459 and cemiplimab combination therapy)

* To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of SAR439459 in combination with cemiplimab in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors by evaluation of antitumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

Secondary Objectives:

* Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile SAR439459 monotherapy and combined with cemiplimab, PK profile of cemiplimab combined with SAR439459.
* Immunogenicity of SAR439459 monotherapy and combined with cemiplimab.

Dose escalation (Part 1)

* Overall safety/tolerability profile of SAR439459 monotherapy and combined with cemiplimab.
* Preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (pRP2D) of SAR439459 as monotherapy or combined with cemiplimab.

Dose expansion (Part 2)

* Progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), ORR, and safety of SAR439459 as monotherapy and PFS, TTP, duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and safety in combination with cemiplimab.
* To confirm the optimal dose of SAR439459 administered in combination with cemiplimab.

The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1 or 2 cycles (21 or 14 days per cycle, respectively), an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. For the urothelial cancer cohort in Part 2B, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months until death, study cut-off date, or upon cancellation of Survival follow-up at the discretion of the Sponsor at any prior timepoint. For the overall survival analysis (approximately 12 months after last patient first dose), whichever comes first.

Patients who have no disease progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s), will be allowed to continue treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose unless the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is approximately 42 months.
