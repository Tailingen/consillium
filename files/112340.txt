PARP Inhibitor With 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate PRRT in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumours
This phase 1 dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of talazoparib in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with metastatic pancreatic or midgut neuroendocrine tumour (NET).
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Talazoparib
Maximum tolerated dose Talazoparib with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate, Maximum tolerated dose of Talazoparib when given in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate, Through study completion, up to 18 months following first administration of PRRT.|Dose limiting toxicity talazoparib, The toxicity (haematologic or non-haematologic) that prevents further administration of the trial talazoparib treatment at that dose level., Each cohort of 3 patients be assessed for DLTs in the first 6 weeks (cycle 2) of treatment and a dose for the next cohort will be determined (each cycle is 8 weeks)
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events measured using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, Safety of the combination will be measured by AEs and SAEs, Through Study completion, up to 18 months after the last patient commences treatment.|Radiographic progression free survival, The time from treatment initiation to the first date of progression on imaging or death due to any cause. Imaging progression will be assessed by RECIST 1.1. Patients who commence new systemic therapy before evidence of disease progression on conventional imaging will be considered to have progressed., Through study completion, up to 18 months following first administration of PRRT.|Overall Survival, The time from treatment initiation to the date of death due to any cause. For patients alive, the time will be censored at the last time the patients was known to be alive., Through study completion, up to 18 months following first administration of PRRT.|Treatment discontinuation due to toxicity, The number of patients who discontinue treatment at any time due to treatment related toxicity will be reported and will be also categorised by dose level., Through study completion, up to 18 months following first administration of PRRT.|Rate of Treatment discontinuation due to toxicity, The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment due to treatment related toxicity will be reported and will be also categorised by dose level, Through study completion, up to 18 months following first administration of PRRT.
This phase 1, single arm, single centre study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of talazoparib in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate in patients with metastatic NET.

Patients will receive 1 cycle of 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate alone followed by 3 cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-Octreotate combined with 5 days of talazoparib.
