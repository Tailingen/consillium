A Biomarker Study of Palbociclib + Fulvestrant for Second, and Third Line of Postmenopausal Women With hr+/her2- Advanced Breast Cancer
The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant and/or palbociclib in the population of patients with metastatic lesions harboring ESR1 mutations was reported. In the PALOMA 3 study, the combination of Fulvestrant+ Palbociclib seems to be active in patients whose tumour harbours ESR1 mutations. This study will confirm these data on this population and will allow us to identify if other gene alterations or a genomic signature can correlate with fulvestrant +palbociclib resistance.
