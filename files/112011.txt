Phase 1/2 Study of Autologous SCG142 TCR T Cells in Patients With HPV16/52-positive Carcinoma
This is a phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicenter study in patients with advanced or metastatic HPV16- or HPV52-positive carcinomas who have progressed after at least one line of systemic therapy, including but not limited to combination chemotherapy and/or combination chemo-immunotherapy

This study will be conducted in 2 parts:

The Phase 1 part of the trial consists of a dose-escalation portion designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SCG142, and to identify the RP2D.

The Phase 2 part of the trial is designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SCG142 in the same patient populations.
