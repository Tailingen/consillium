Proteomic Guided First-line Precision Treatment of Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma
Based on different subtypes, subjects will be placed in one of three treatment groups to explore individual efficacy and safety of various treatment regimen.
Kidney Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Anlotinib, Everolimus and Tislelizumab
Objective Response Rate, ORR(objective response rate) is defined as the proportion of participants who had best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator using RECIST 1.1., 6 months
Progression Free Survival, PFS(progression-free survival), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death (whichever occurred first), 3 years|Overall Survival, OS(overall survival) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., 3 years
MSKCC Prognostic Model and IMDC(International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium) Criteria are derived from cytokine and targeted therapy era, separately. In order to adapt to immunotherapy era and achieve the precision treatment in patients with kidney cancer, a new molecular typing map is urgent to be set up. In this study, patients with renal cell carcinoma will be divided into three types, FuDan-GP1(glycoprotein I) subtype (targeted sensitive type), FuDan-GP2(glycoprotein 2) subtype (Cold tumor) and FuDan-GP3(glycoprotein 3) subtype (progenitor infiltrating type) in accordance with the condition of response to TKIs(tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and the infiltration of immune cells, which dates from previous protein genomics study published by Nature Communications. Based on the gene proteomic analysis of tissue samples, a molecular typing map was set up and the efficacy and safety of anlotinib, anlotinib combined with everolimus, and anlotinib combined with tislelizumab in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma will be evaluated.
