A Study Comparing Pharmacokinetic and Safety of QL2107 and Keytruda® (Marketed in China and the United States) in Healthy Adults
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic and safety similarity of QL2107 with Keytruda® marketed in China and the United States in healthy male volunteers.

Participants will receive a single injection of QL2107/ Keytruda® （China）/Keytruda® （US）.Researchers will compare pharmacokinetic, safety, and immunogenic similarities between the three groups.

This is a phase I,single center, randomized, double-blind and parallel group clinical trial .

The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic similarity of single injections of QL2107 or Keytruda® （China/US） in healthy volunteers.

The secondary objective are to assess the clinical safety and immunogenicity similarity of single injections of QL2107 or Keytruda® （China/US） in healthy volunteers.

Subjects would receive a single 100mg（4ml） of QL2107or Keytruda® （China/US）injection.
