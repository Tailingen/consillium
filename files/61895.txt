A Phase 1/2 Study of SC-43 in Combination With Cisplatin
SC-43 is STAT3 inhibitor. Based on the phase I data of SC-43 monotherapy, this is a Phase 1/2, Open-label, Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of SC-43 Administered in Combination with Cisplatin in Subjects with Advanced or Refractory Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Biliary Tract Carcinoma
Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer|Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: SC-43|DRUG: Cisplatin
Recommended phase 2 dose(RP2D) of SC-43, to determine a RP2D of SC-43 for each population of non-small cell lung cancer and biliary tract carcinoma subjects, 18 weeks|preliminary antitumor activity of SC-43, the preliminary antitumor activity of SC-43 in combination with other anticancer agents as measured by overall response rate (ORR) according to standard criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \[RECIST v1.1\]), 18 weeks
incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, incidence of treatment-related adverse events in combination with cisplatin in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer and biliary tract carcinoma. All adverse events will be assessed for severity based on NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, 18 weeks|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), PK blood samples will be collected at predefined time intervals, and the maximum plasma concentration will be determined., day 1 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycle 2 (each 21-day cycle)|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), PK blood samples will be collected at predefined time intervals, and the AUC from time 0 to the last time point will be calculated., day 1 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycle 2 (each 21-day cycle)|Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response evaluated according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 on MRI or CT results, 18 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1, Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as best overall response evaluated according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 on MRI or CT results., 18 weeks|Duration of response(DOR) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1, Duration of response(DOR) is defined as the time between the date of first response and the date of disease progression., 18 weeks|Progression free survival(PFS) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1, progression free survival(PFS) is defined as the time between the date of first dose of SC-43 and the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, 18 weeks|overall survival(OS) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1, overall survival(OS) time is defined as the length of time from the first dose of SC-43 to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death, 18 weeks
phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3(p-STAT3) status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects, levels of p-STAT3 (with and without cytokine stimulation) before and after dosing, day -14 to -1(prior to dosing), day 1 of cycle 2 and cycle 3, and end of treatment (each 21-day cycle)
Based on the ongoing Phase 1 study in refractory cancer types, it is deemed adequate to select the starting dose at 50 mg in combination with cisplatin for NSCLC or BTC. The safety monitoring committee (SMC) will review the starting dose of 50 mg data and decide whether it is adequate to escalate the dose to 100, then 150 mg according to Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design. Moreover, based on the PK profiles and modelling, the loading dose 100 mg QD for 7 days will keep the minimal efficacy concentration and effectively maintain the p-STAT3 level low enough to translate the anticancer efficacy with clinical efficacy for the study drug SC-43.

The cisplatin efficacy for NSCLC and BTC, the chosen dose and dosing schedules 75 mg/m2 in a 3-week cycle in combination with SC-43 are supported by previous clinical experience of observed efficacy and safety profiles for the indicated study populations.
