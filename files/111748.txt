Observational Study of Sex Differences in Symptoms During Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment for People With Cancer
This study aims to learn more about symptoms that patients experience while receiving immunotherapy for cancer.
Hematopoietic and Lymphatic System Neoplasm|Malignant Solid Neoplasm
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Patient-reported symptoms, Will compare the number, severity, and burden of symptoms by sex. Will be assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria and Adverse Events v1.0 (PRO-CTCAE) reporting tool., Baseline, weekly thereafter up to 26 weeks|Patient-reported QOL - Part 1, Will use the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29 (PROMIS-29), Baseline, month 3, month 6|Patient-reported QOL - Part 2, PROMIS Cognitive Function instruments, Baseline, month 3, month 6|Patient-reported QOL - Part 3, Selected questions from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to evaluate the impact of immunotherapy on QOL., Baseline, month 3, month 6|Clinician-assessed patient symptoms, Clinicians will rate patient symptoms according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 scoring system, which grades adverse events according to 5 categories of severity and requires evaluation of the extent to which the adverse event can be attributed to treatment ("unrelated" to "definite"). Will examine agreement using intraclass correlations by patient gender., Baseline, month 3, month 6
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Characterize sex differences in patient-reported symptomatic immune-related adverse events.

II. Determine the level of discordance between clinician-assessed and patient-reported symptomatic immune-related adverse events according to patient gender.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients complete surveys and have their medical records reviewed on study.
