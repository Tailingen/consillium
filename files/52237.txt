First-In-Human Study of STX-721 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations
Study STX-721-101 is an open label, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure, and preliminary antitumor activity of STX-721 in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying EGFR/HER2 exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations.
