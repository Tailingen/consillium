Interprofessional Versus Monoprofessional Case-based Learning in Childhood Cancer
Interprofessional education in childhood cancer is a multifaceted field. It involves multiple healthcare professionals with general and specialised knowledge and skills. Complex treatment, care and rehabilitation require continuous professional development and maintenance of healthcare professionals' competencies in their own professional field. Limited knowledge exists on comparing interprofessional and monoprofessional education and only few randomised studies have evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of interprofessional education. One clinical area among others where healthcare professionals collaborate is in gastrointestinal toxicities and side effects. These are frequent and potentially severe clinical problems in childhood cancer that involve multiple healthcare professionals.

Objectives: To study the effect of interprofessional versus monoprofessional case-based learning on healthcare professionals' attitudes on interprofessional learning and collaboration.

Trial design: single centre investigator-initiated cluster randomized trial

Methods:

Participants: Employees with patient-related work at the childhood cancer departments and affiliated with childhood cancer at Rigshospitalet are eligible for inclusion. The setting is the childhood cancer department.

Outcome: The primary outcome is to improve healthcare professionals' interprofessional attitude.

Measurements:

The primary outcome is attitudes measured by the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS). Secondary outcome is Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) Questionnaire, and Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ). Knowledge will be measured by written test as multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ).

Timepoints: The self-reported questionnaires will be distributed to the participants approximately one month before and one month after the educational intervention. On the day of the educational intervention, participants will answer the multiple choice questionnaire.

Analysis: Linear mixed regression will be used to compare differences in mean scores postintervention, adjusted for differences between the two groups.

Results: We hypothesise that interprofessional case-based learning positively affects the healthcare professionals' interprofessional attitudes.

Change in the participants' interprofessional collaboration, Primary outcome: change in the participants' interprofessional attitude to collaboration measured by Assessment of interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS). The scale contains three main categories: 1)Partnership/shared decision making (19 items), 2) Collaboration (11 items), 3) Coordination (7 items) that are rated on a scale from 1-5 (1= "never"; 2= "rarely"; 3="occasionally"; 4="most of the time"; 5="Always"). The scales procedures scores from 48 to 240. Higher scores indicate a better outcome, Measured 1 month before intervention and 1-3 months after intervention in both groups
Change in the participants' interprofessional attitudes, Secondary outcome: measured by Change in Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Survey (RIPLS). 29 items on a five-point scale 4 subscales; 1)Teamwork and collaboration, 2)Negative professional identity, 3)Positive professional identity, 4)Roles and responsibility.

The items are rated on a scale from 1-5 (1= "strongly disagree"; 2= "agree"; 3="undecided"; 4="agree"; 5="strongly agree"). Higher scores indicate a better outcome, Measured 1 month before intervention and 1-3 months after intervention in both groups|Change in participants' knowledge of gastrointestinal toxicities and side effects, measured by written test as multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ). There are three options to chose from in this multiple choice questionnaire, one correct answer and two wrong answers. This MCQ is developed and validated for the purpose of this particular education session, measured at the actual intervention day 30 minutes prior to the session and immediately after the education session (maximum 15 minutes after)
