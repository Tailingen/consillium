A Study to Assess Adverse Events and Change in Disease Activity in Participants With Platinum-Resistant Advanced High-Grade Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancers With High Folate Receptor-Alpha Expression Treated With Intravenously (IV) Infused Mirvetuximab Soravtansine
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of for Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in participants with platinum-resistant advanced high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (platinum-resistant ovarian cancer) (PROC) whose tumors express a high level of folate receptor alpha (FRα).

Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational antibody drug conjugate designed to selectively kill cancer cells. The antibody (protein) part of MIRV targets tumors by delivering a cell-killing drug to cancer cells carrying a protein called folate receptor alpha (FRα). There are 2 cohorts in this study, the Randomized Phase 2 Cohort and the Hepatic Impairment Cohort. In the Randomized Phase 2 Cohort, participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each treatment arm receives MIRV on a different schedule (on day 1 every 21 days or on days 1 and 15 every 28 days). The Hepatic Impairment Cohort is designed to determine the starting dose of MIRV in patients with moderately abnormal liver function. Around 110 participants will be enrolled in the study at approximately 75 sites worldwide.

The total study duration will be approximately 24 months.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, and scans.
