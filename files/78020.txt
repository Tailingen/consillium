SBRT vs. Conventional Fractionation With HDR Boost for Prostate Cancer
Random assignment between SBRT and conventionally fractionated boost following HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer

Many treatment options exist for prostate cancer. One common treatment approach is to combine high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (temporary insertion of radiation into the prostate) and external beam radiation. External beam radiation typically requires daily radiation treatment for three to five weeks. Improvements to radiation planning and delivery has allowed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to be implemented in many types of cancer. SBRT has been implemented as a standard treatment option after HDR brachytherapy in response to the COVID pandemic. We are seeking to evaluate whether it is feasible to randomly assign men between SBRT (which will be five treatments of radiation or conventional radiation (3-5 weeks of daily treatment) following HDR brachytherapy
