Early DVC Ligation and Urinary Continence Recovery After RARP
The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of early deep venous complex ligation (eDVCL) in patients affected by clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with or without pelvic lymph node dissection. Overall, 312 patients will be randomized to the standard technique vs. eDVCL. The primary endpoint is represented by early urinary continence recovery. The secondary endpoints are perioperative outcomes, erectile function recovery and positive surgical margins.
