Study of the PI3K Inhibitor SL-901 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Study STML-901-0119 was a dose-escalation study evaluating multiple doses and schedules of orally administered SL-901 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SL-901
To Identify the MTD, Appropriate Dosing Regimen, PK Profile, and Perform Initial Assessment of the Safety Profile of SL-901, * Safety endpoints include identification of DLTs; rate of TEAEs and SAEs; identification of abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and ECG findings.
* PK endpoints include assessment of SL-901 plasma concentration over time; assessment of any changes in the PK properties of SL-901 between initial administration and steady-state and between cycles of treatment; explore the correlation between PK parameters and toxicity., Approximately 2 years
Assess Preliminary Clinical Activity of SL-901 - Best Overall Response, Clinical activity endpoints include the rate of objective response, rate of CR, DOR, PFS, and OS., Approximately 2 years|Assess Preliminary Clinical Activity of SL-901 - PFS, Progression-free Survival - Investigator's Assessment, Approximately 2 years
Study STML-901-0119 was a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation, and regimen-finding study aimed to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of SL-901 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study initially included two parts: Part 1a, which used a 3+3 dose-escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose and an appropriate dosing regimen of SL-901 when administered on both once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) schedules; Part 1b, which was intended to evaluate the clinical activity of SL-901 at the selected dose in patients with advanced solid tumors with specific genetic alterations.

The study was stopped after careful consideration of the landscape of similar drugs and evolving standard of care. As a result, Part 1b was not initiated. In Part 1a, eligible patients were enrolled to receive SL-901 orally on a 28-day cycle. Study enrollment was conducted in 2 centers in the United Kingdom, and patients were assigned to either the QD or BID dosing regimen based on their cohort assignment.
