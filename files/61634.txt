NANOTECH RCC Biomarkers
The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC or kidney cancer) in men exceeds that of pancreatic cancer or leukemia. In women, the incidence of RCC is similar to that of leukemia, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer; thus, RCC is significant health issue. This study focuses on identifying specific molecules \[biomarkers\] of RCC that can be used to develop a reliable low-cost screening method at the point of service. If successful, our method would provide a diagnostic test to distinguish benign kidney masses from malignant ones, eliminating the need to surgically remove a kidney with a benign tumor.
