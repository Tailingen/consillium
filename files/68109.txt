Study of 225Ac-SS0110 in Subjects With ES-SCLC or MCC (SANTANA-225 )
This study aims to determine safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary antitumor activity of 225Ac-SSO110 with standard of care (SoC) therapy in patients with somatostatin receptor 2 expressing (SSTR2+) extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).
