LILRB4 STAR-T Cell Therapy for Monocytic Leukemia
This is a single-center,single-arm,open-label phase I clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of LILRB4 STAR-T cells in Monocytic Leukemia subjects.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: LILRB4 STAR-T cells injection
Evaluate safety and tolerability, Subjects are observed for dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) after LILRB4 STAR-T cells infusion, with the recording of adverse events(AE) and serious adverse events(SAE), with a focus on cytokine release syndrome(CRS) and immune cell-associated neurotoxicity(ICANS).All of the AE ratings were assessed according to the CTCAE., 12 months
Antitumor efficacy, After infusion of LILRB4 STAR-T cells, the subjects underwent bone marrow puncture every month to evaluate the tumor load in the bone marrow. The efficacy evaluation included complete morphological remission, complete remission with incomplete recovery of blood cytology, and partial remission., 12 months
This study will recruit LILRB4-positive monocytic leukemia subjects who will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5 to -3 prior to cell infusion, followed by LILRB4 STAR-T cells. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LILRB4 STAR-T cells in subjects with monocytic leukemia. The secondary objective was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of LILRB4 STAR-T cells.
