Clinical Study on the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of ScTIL (Genetically Modified Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes) in the Treatment of Gynecological Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of ScTIL in the treatment of recurrent or refractory cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and malignant trophoblastic tumor, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ScTIL, and to explore and analyze the changes of CTC, ctDNA and immunohistochemical Library of malignant tumor subjects before and after ScTIL treatment.Treatment will be terminated upon progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Subjects with responses other than progressive disease will receive subsequent rounds of ScTIL treatment.

DRUG: Toripalimab + ScTIL
Objective response rate, The proportion of patients with complete or partial response of cervical and ovarian cancer according to RECIST version 1.1, malignant trophoblastic tumor according to serum hCG level. Complete response was defined as a normal hCG level measured for 3 consecutive weeks. Partial response was defined as a â‰¥50% decrease in hCG level from baseline after 2 cycles., 12 weeks
Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of cases with remission and stable lesions after treatment in the total number of evaluable cases., 12 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the first evidence of response to disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 12 weeks|Progression-free survival, The time from the treatment initiation to disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 12 weeks|Overall survival, The time from the treatment initiation to the date of death or end of follow-up., 12 weeks

The primary endpoint was objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial response. Secondary endpoints were duration of response (time from the first evidence of response to disease progression or death, whichever came first), progression-free survival (time from the treatment initiation to disease progression or death, whichever came first), overall survival (time from the treatment initiation to the date of death or end of follow-up).
