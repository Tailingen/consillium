Safety and Tolerability of Ranibizumab in Patients With Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Age-related Macular Degeneration
This extension study will investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of ranibizumab administered to patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration who have been previously treated in either of the two ongoing ranibizumab studies CRFB002A2302 (EXCITE) or CRFB002A2303 (SUSTAIN
