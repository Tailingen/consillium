A Study of XZB-0004 in Patients With Solid Tumors
XZB-0004 is a novel and potent small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL.

This is an open-label, multicentre phase I study of XZB-0004 in patients with solid tumors. Part 1 is a dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of XZB-0004, and then to identify a safe and pharmacologically active dose for evaluation in subsequent cohorts or clinical studies. Part 2 is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XZB-0004 combined with Penpulimab in patients with NSCLC or advanced solid tumors.
