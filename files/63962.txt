Phase I Dose Escalation Study of Intravenous VCN-01 With or Without Gemcitabine and Abraxane® in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of VCN-01 either administered alone or in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine, and to determine the recommended phase II dose of VCN-01 alone or in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine.
Locally Advanced Solid Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
GENETIC: VCN-01|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Abraxane®
Safety and Tolerability by means of Adverse Events (AEs) and laboratory data, At least 6 months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) by determination of highest feasible dose (MFD) and any Dose Limiting Toxicities, At least 6 months
Presence of VCN-01 in tumor, Determination of VCN-01 by analyzing viral genome copies in tumor biopsy, Day 8-10|Viral Pharmacokinetics, Determination of VCN-01 half-life by analyzing viral genome copies in blood, Up to 48 h|Viral Shedding, And at least up to 6 months follow-up in patients at the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Up to day 28|Neutralizing antibodies anti-VCN-01, At least up to 6 months follow-up in patients at the MTD, 30 days after end of treatment phase|Preliminary anti-tumor activity by Overall Response Rate (ORR), CT or MRI scans every 8 weeks until disease progression|Preliminary anti-tumor activity by Progression Free Survival (PFS), CT or MRI scans every 8 weeks until disease progression
The study consists of three parts:

* Part I is a dose escalation study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous injection of VCN-01 alone
* In Part II the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine.
* In Part III the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine in a "delayed" schedule compared with Part II.
