Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Focal Prostate Ablation
The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of combining focal prostate ablation therapy ((aka Focal Therapy, a surgical procedure) and androgen deprivation therapy (hormone therapy).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)|PROCEDURE: Focal prostate ablation (focal therapy)
Number of participants with clinically significant residual prostate cancer in ablated prostate tissue following study treatment, Proportion of participants that have residual cancer in ablated prostate tissue. Residual disease will be measured by MRI., End of Treatment (approximately 4-5 months)|Number of participants with clinically significant residual prostate cancer in unablated prostate tissue following study treatment, Proportion of participants that have residual cancer in unablated prostate tissue. Residual disease will be measured by MRI., End of Treatment (approximately 4-5 months)|Number and grade of complications [Safety], Number and grade of complications will be reported.

Number and grade of complications will be reported.

The number and severity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade of reported complications will be reported., 6-months following treatment
Measuring change in genitourinary and sexual function and health-related quality of life (measured by HRQoL), Define change in genitourinary and sexual function from baseline following ADT and FT by measuring the subject's HRQoL, 6-and 12-months after FT|PSA response to the combination treatment, Determine the PSA response to the combination treatment by measuring the subject's PSA at "baseline" (PSA at time of initial diagnosis) 3-months, 6-months, and 1-year from FT, Baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 1-year from FT|Proportion of men converting therapy or dying of prostate cancer during study, Determine the proportion of men converting to whole gland therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) and/or requiring systemic therapy and/or developing metastases and/or dying of PCa during the course of study., 12 months after FT|Post Treatment biopsy with no prostate cancer, Determine the proportion of men without any prostate cancer on any post treatment prostate biopsy., 6 months after FT|Proportion of men with normal baseline serum, Determine the proportion of men with normal baseline serum testosterone who had testosterone recovery (defined as testosterone levels \>300 ng/dL) at 6-, 9- and 12-months after FT.

Testosterone recovery: Number of men who have recovered normal serum testosterone levels will be expressed as proportions of total number of eugonadal patients and the 95% confidence interval of the proportion will be presented., 6-, 9- and 12-months after FT.
