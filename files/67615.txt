Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With WH002 in Women With HER2-negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of bi-weekly WH002(Paclitaxel Medium and Long Chain Fat Emulsion Injection,Cholesterol Bound) vs Paclitaxel both followed by bi-weekly Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide as neoadjuvant treatment in women with HER2-negative breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: WH002|DRUG: paclitaxel injection
All reported adverse events, serious adverse events and the percentage of drug-related adverse events, serious adverse events during the treatment period., A summary of TEAEs, SAEs and other non-serious adverse events (AEs), regardless of causality, will be reported.Compare the safety and tolerability between the WH002 group and the Paclitaxel® group during the treatment period. Patients will be assessed for adverse events by clinical examination, questioning for symptoms of toxicity, laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG and LVEF.

Neurological toxicity and other toxicities will be assessed throughout the study according the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Version 5.0., From the first administration of the medication until 28 days after the breast cancer surgery, or 28 days after the last administration of the medication.

This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, positive-drug parallel-controlled phase Ib trial. The primary aim of this study was to compare the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of a dose-dense regimen of bi-weekly WH002 followed by bi-weekly epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (ddWH002-ddEC) versus bi-weekly Paclitaxel® followed by bi-weekly EC (ddP-ddEC) as neoadjuvant treatment in women with HER2-negative high-risk early-stage and locally advanced breast cancer. Patients randomly assigned to ddP-ddEC received premedication with oral prednisolone (12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel), IV dexchlorpheniramine, and cimetidine or ranitidine (30 minutes before paclitaxel). Whereas all of these premedication was not required in the ddWH002-ddEC group before receiving WH002.

Eligible subjects are those with biopsy-confirmed, HER2-negative breast cancer as verified by the research center, and whose tumor staging, as determined by imaging, falls into the categories of early high-risk (T1c-2, N1; T2, N0) or locally advanced (T1c-2, N2-3; T3-4, N0-3). Upon fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the WH002 followed by EC group (Group A) or the Paclitaxel® followed by EC group (Group B).Stratified randomization between the two groups based on tumor molecular subtypes:

* Luminal type (HER2-negative, ER or progesterone receptor positive),
* Triple-negative (HER2-negative, ER and progesterone receptor negative).
