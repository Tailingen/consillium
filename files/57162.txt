The Effect of Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition in Women With Breast Cancer
The objective of this study is to evaluate intermittent fasting after the treatment of breast cancer with surgery and radiation therapy. All participants will either delay their first meal of the day or advance their last meal to achieve an approximate 16-18 hour fasting period four times per week. Over six months, the innovative protocol will 1) assess adherence, and is expected to 2) improve body composition, quality of life and inflammatory and metabolic variables linked with outcomes after breast cancer treatment. The long-term goal of this project is to incorporate this dietary strategy as a standard component of care for breast cancer patients.
