Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of MM-302 in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
This study is a Phase 1 and pharmacologic open-label dose-escalation trial using a "3+3" design. Successive cohorts of three or more patients will be treated at escalating doses until a maximum tolerated dose is identified. Once the maximum tolerated dose is identified, an Expansion Cohort will be enrolled at that dose to further characterize safety and pharmacologic endpoints. Additional arms will be enrolled to explore the combination of MM-302 with trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.
