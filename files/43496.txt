The PRECISION Trial (Profiling Early Breast Cancer for Radiotherapy Omission): A Phase II Study of Breast-Conserving Surgery Without Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Favorable-Risk Breast Cancer
This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about whether patients can omit radiation treatment after undergoing a lumpectomy, also known as "breast conserving surgery". In this trial, we are attempting to identify which patients may not need radiation.
Breast Cancer Radiation
DEVICE: Prosigna
Five-Year Risk of Local Regional Recurrence in the Ipsilateral Breast or Lymph Nodes in Women without Adjuvant Radiotherapy, Using information gathered from follow-up physical examinations and mammography, the 5-year risk of local regional recurrence in women who omit radiotherapy post-lumpectomy will be evaluated., 5 years
Five-Year Risk of Any Recurrence: Local, Regional or Distant, Using information gathered from follow-up physical examinations and mammography, the 5-year risk of any recurrence in women who omit radiotherapy post-lumpectomy will be evaluated., 5 years|Overall Survival, Using information gathered from follow-up appointments and other record sources, 5-year survival rates will be evaluated., 5 years|Disease-Free Survival, Using information gathered from follow-up physical exams, mammography and other imaging as necessary, the rate of disease-free status at 5 years will be evaluated., 5 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational treatment to learn whether it is appropriate for treating a specific disease.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain patients between the ages of 50 and 75 can safely omit radiation treatment after having a lumpectomy.In this research study, the investigators are using standard laboratory tests along with the Prosigna test to see if certain patients can avoid radiation, without having a higher risk of the cancer coming back in the future.

A portion of the participant surgical specimen will be prospectively maintained for future study using institutionally-approved tissue banking procedures.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has cleared the Prosigna test for generating a risk category and numerical score to assess the risk of distant recurrence, and has cleared us to investigate the use of the Prosigna test for helping with decisions about radiation.
