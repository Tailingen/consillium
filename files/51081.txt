Intravenous BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib in Relapsed/Refractory CLL Patients Who Have Been Pre-treated With at Least One Prior Line of Systemic Therapy, and Who Are Eligible for Treatment With Ibrutinib
Intravenous BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients who have been pre-treated with at least one prior line of systemic therapy, and who are eligible for treatment with ibrutinib. Objectives of the trial are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of BI 836826, and to document the safety and tolerability of BI 836826 when given in combination with ibrutinib

Recommended Phase 2 Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib, The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D ) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib would be either the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or a lower dose and would be determined by the safety review committee based on safety and efficacy considerations., First treatment cycle, 4 weeks from first administration of BI 836826.|Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During the First Treatment Cycle, Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) during the first treatment cycle. DLT was defined as any non-hematologic adverse event (AE) of Grade â‰¥ 3 related to BI 836826 and/or ibrutinib except infusion-related reaction (any Grade), Grade 3 Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)- and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) elevation without concomitant bilirubin, elevation or any other asymptomatic Grade 3 laboratory abnormality with spontaneous recovery within 1 week. The following hematologic AEs related to BI 836826 and/or ibrutinib were considered DLT: Grade 4 neutropenia with concomitant infection, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia not resolving within 72 hours with appropriate treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, growth factor support), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, Grade 4 anemia, any Grade 5 hematologic AE., First treatment cycle, 4 weeks from first administration of BI 836826.
Maximum Tolerated Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Ibrutinib, To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib, participants were entered sequentially into dose cohorts starting at 100 mg of BI 836826 and escalating to the MTD in combination with ibrutinib (fixed dose of 420 mg daily). Stepwise dose escalation of BI 836826 was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with overdose control. The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating estimates of the probability of observing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in the first treatment cycle (4 weeks) for each dose level as participant information becomes available. The MTD would be considered reached if the following criteria were fulfilled. The posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval \[0.16 - 0.33) of the MTD is above 0.50 or at least 15 participants have been treated in the study, of which at least 6 at the MTD., First treatment cycle, 4 weeks from first administration of BI 836826.
