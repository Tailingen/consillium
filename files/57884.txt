A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of KQB168 as Monotherapy and in Combination in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if KQB168 works to treat advanced solid tumor cancer in adults. It will also learn about the safety of KQB168. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the safe dose of KQB168 by itself or in combination with pembrolizumab?
* Does KQB168 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab decrease the size of the tumor?
* What happens to KQB168 in the body?

Participants will:

* Take KQB168 daily, alone or in combination with pembrolizumab
* Visit the clinic about 8 times in the first 8 weeks, and then once every 3 weeks after that
