ACTolog in Patients With Solid Cancers
The study purpose is to learn about the safety and tolerability of IMA101 alone (Cohort 1) or in combination with atezolizumab (Cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid cancers that express pre-defined Immatics tumor targets.
Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: IMA101 product|BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant human interleukin-2|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: IMADetect|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Incidence of adverse events (Safety and tolerability) of IMA101 alone or in combination with atezolizumab, up to 18 months
Peripheral T-cell persistence (assessment of frequency of T-cells over time), up to 18 months|Tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), up to 18 months
SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) and the main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be collected with a leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA101 product.

MANUFACTURE: IMA101 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

TREATMENT: IMA101 product will be administered to the patient intravenously after lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide).

Low-dose IL-2 will be self-administered twice daily for a total of 28 doses after infusion of IMA101 product. In Cohort 2, atezolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks, starting no earlier than 3 weeks after the IMA101 product infusion and after hematologic recovery.

Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study.
