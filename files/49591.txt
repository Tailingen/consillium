Implementing Geriatric Assessment for Dose Optimization of Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitors in Older Breast Cancer Patients
IMPORTANT study is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized-controlled, non-inferiority trial with a pragmatic approach involving older patients (≥ 70 years old) with advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, not amenable for curative treatment and without prior therapy for advanced disease, who are suitable to receive CDK 4/6-inhibitors plus endocrine therapy as first line therapy. The study implements two approaches with high level of evidence, namely the use of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) approach in treatment decision making and the use of CDK 4/6-inhibitors as the initial treatment of choice, to investigate whether a common clinical practice (starting dose reduction of CDK 4/6-inhibitors in older patients) with evidence of low certainty can be standardized using a more individualized-based approach.

On the basis of baseline CGA assessment, patients will either receive full dose of CDK 4/6-inhibitors plus endocrine therapy (if patients are fit according to CGA) or be randomized to full dose vs. reduced initial dose of CDK 4/6-inhibitors (if vulnerable or frail according to CGA). The study hypothesis is that adjusting the dose according to vulnerability will allow patients to tolerate treatment better without jeopardizing the treatment efficacy.

DRUG: CDK 4/6 inhibitors|DRUG: Endocrine therapy
Time to treatment failure, The time from randomization to treatment discontinuation because of any reason including disease progression, treatment toxicity, or death due to any cause., Up to 5 years from treatment initiation
Overall treatment utility (OTU), A composite endpoint that will be assessed at the first efficacy evaluation. OTU incorporates objective and participant-reported outcome measures of anticancer efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of treatment providing a simple "good, intermediate or poor" categorization of outcome., Three months after treatment initiation|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 5 years from treatment initiation|Progression free survival, The time from randomization to first documented evidence of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 5 years from treatment initiation|Time to chemotherapy initiation, The time from randomization until the initiation of chemotherapy at any treatment line after CDK 4/6-inhibitors., Up to 5 years from treatment initiation|Frequency of adverse events, Adverse events will be assessed based on adverse events, as graded by CTCAE v 5.0 before each cycle and up to 28 days after the end of CDK 4/6-inhibitors., Up to 5 years from treatment initiation|Assessment of Quality of life, Quality of life will be assessed using three validated questionnaires, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, Elderly (ELD)-14, and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L)., Until disease progression, participant / physician decision to stop, death, or up to 24 months from treatment initiation whichever occurs first|Time until Quality of life deterioration, QoL deterioration, defined as the time from randomization until any clinically meaningful worsening (using minimal important differences as cut-off) of any QoL aspect measured by the questionnaires., Until disease progression, participant / physician decision to stop, death, or up to 24 months from treatment initiation whichever occurs first|Cost effectiveness, Resource use, length of life and quality of life data will be collected during the trial for the purpose of conducting an economic evaluation., Up to 24 months from treatment initiation
