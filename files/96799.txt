Optimized Diffusion-Weighted Imaging for the Evaluation of Post-Treatment Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Neck: Comparative Study With FDG PET/CT
The investigators propose a longitudinal study evaluating post-treatment changes in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the neck using an innovative optimized diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) pulse sequence to identify more accurately recurrent tumors as well as early non-responders to therapy.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DEVICE: Diffusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance imaging|DEVICE: FDG PET/CT
Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Mean (ADCmean), * ADC=measure of the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue
* The primary tumor, suspicious lesion, and/or area of post-treatment change will be identified in anatomical images \& then outlined in the ADC sequence, excluding areas of cystic change and necrosis. If there are multiple lesions, only the dominant lesion with the lowest ADC will be used for analysis
* A histogram analysis method will examine the distribution of ADC values within each region of interest (ROI)
* ADCmean will describe distribution of ADC measurements in tumor/non-tumor tissues \& independent sample t-test will compare ADC measurements between the 2 groups, 2-3 weeks post-standard of care treatment|Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Lowest Value in a Tumor (ADCmin), * ADC=measure of the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue
