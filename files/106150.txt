Cancer|Solid Tumors|Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: AZD8055
Assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, urinalysis), glucose management (s-glucose, s-insulin, haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, weight and body temperature), Laboratory values, vital sign, physical examination every week during Cycle 1 and 2.
To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of AZD8055 following both single and multiple oral dosing in patients with advanced solid tumours, According to protocol specified schedule, the number of PK samples collected during Cycle 1|To seek preliminary evidence of the anti-tumour activity of AZD8055 in patients with advanced solid malignancies as measured by objective tumour response (according to RECIST criteria), Every cycle
