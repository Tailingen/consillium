Medical Food for the Dietary Management of Advanced/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is a single arm study evaluating the tolerability and markers of pancreatic cancer with a specially designed medical food restricted in specific amino acids for the dietary management of subjects with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects who are eligible to receive two FDA approved first line drug therapies, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (gem+nabP), routinely prescribed in combination for pancreatic cancer may be included in this study.
