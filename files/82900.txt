PEGPH20 Plus Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Compared With Nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in Participants With Stage IV Untreated Pancreatic Cancer
This study is designed to compare the treatment effect of PEGPH20 combined with nab-paclitaxel (NAB) and gemcitabine (GEM) \[PAG\] to NAB and GEM \[AG\] in participants with Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

The study will have 2 run-in phases, one for each formulation of PEGPH20 (original and new formulations), and a Phase 2 portion. The 2 run-in phases will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the PAG treatment using the original and new succinic acid PEGPH20 formulation, respectively, compared with AG treatment. Phase 2 will have 2 stages due to a partial clinical hold that occurred from April through July 2014. The participants will be randomized in 3:1 for the run-in phases. The first stage will randomize participants in a 1:1 ratio. The second stage will randomize participants in a 2:1 ratio (PAG:AG).

This is an open-label study. To minimize bias to the progression-free survival endpoint, disease progression will be based on the assessment of the Central Imaging Reader (CIR). Determination of clinical progression by the Investigator without corresponding CIR confirmation will be documented with the relevant signs and symptoms.

DRUG: PEGPH20|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Enoxaparin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS: time from randomization until first occurrence of disease progression, either by central radiologic determination (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \[RECIST\] version 1.1) or by clinical progression determined by Investigator, or death during treatment period from any cause. Radiological disease progression was defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study thus far, nadir (this included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study); Sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm); Appearance of one or more new lesions; Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Surviving participants without disease progression were censored for PFS analysis at the date of last evaluable post-baseline tumor assessment. Surviving participants without any post-baseline disease assessment were censored on Day 1. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death from any cause (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG, and 20.27 months for AG)|Percentage of Participants in the PAG Arm Who Experienced Any Thromboembolic (TE) Event in Stage 2 of the Study, TE events were identified by applying the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) search strategy for 3 SMQs: TE arterial, TE venous, and TE vessel type unspecified and mixed arterial and venous. TE events were considered by the Sponsor to be adverse events (AEs) of special interest. All TE events, regardless of type of event, severity, or seriousness were reported. Participants with multiple events were counted only once. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported AE section'., From first exposure to any study drug (PEGPH20, NAB, GEM) through 30 days after end of treatment visit (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG)
PFS in Relation to Tumor Hyaluronan (HA) Levels, PFS was defined as time from randomization until first occurrence of disease progression, either by central radiologic determination (RECIST version 1.1) or by clinical progression determined by Investigator, or death during treatment period from any cause. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study thus far, nadir (this included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study); Sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; Appearance of one or more new lesions; Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Surviving participants without disease progression were censored for PFS analysis at the date of last evaluable post-baseline tumor assessment. Surviving participants without any post-baseline disease assessment were censored on Day 1. PFS was estimated using KM method. PFS was measured in HA-high and HA-low participants., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death from any cause (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG, and 20.27 months for AG)|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, ORR was defined as percentage of participants who achieved either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) regardless of confirmation, as assessed by RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Any pathological or non-pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From the date of randomization until last date on study treatment (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG, and 20.27 months for AG)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Participants who died or were lost to follow-up by the date of analysis data cutoff were censored at their last contact date., From randomization until death from any cause (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG, and 20.27 months for AG)|Percentage of Participants With AEs, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported AE section'., From first exposure to any study drug (PEGPH20, NAB, GEM) through 30 days after end of treatment visit (maximum exposure: 30.72 months for PAG and 20.27 months for AG)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of PEGPH20, Samples were analyzed for PEGPH20 concentration using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Plasma samples to assess the potential effects of NAB+GEM on PEGH20 pharmacokinetic (PK) were collected in the PAG treatment group in the run-in phases (Run-in Phase 1: Original PEGPH20 formulation \[3.5 mg/mL\], and Run-in Phase 2: New PEGPH20 formulation \[0.3 mg/mL\])., Pre-PEGPH20 dosing and 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours post-PEGPH20 dosing on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of PEGPH20, Samples were analyzed for PEGPH20 concentration using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
