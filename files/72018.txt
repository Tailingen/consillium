To examine the impact of additional parenteral nutrition (APN) we prospective evaluated 32 pts suffering APC and progressive cachexia. This assay is based on a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a proven tool for nutritional investigation in patients with chronic disease. Phase angle, determined by BIA, has been found to be a prognostic indicator in several chronic and malignant conditions, such as HIV, liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.
