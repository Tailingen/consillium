MoLiMoR - A Study With FOLFIRI-based First-line Therapy With or Without Intermittent Cetuximab
This is an open-label, prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent addition of cetuximab to a FOLFIRI-based first line therapy to patients with RAS (Rat sarcoma)-mutant mCRC (Metastatic colorectal cancer) diagnosis who convert to RAS wild-type using monitoring of the RAS mutation status by liquid biopsy.
