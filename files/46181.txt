Interval Cytoreductive Surgery With or Without HIPEC for Ovarian Cancer
Primary stage III-IV epithelial ovarian cancer randomizing between interval cytoreductive surgery with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin
Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), From randomization to time of first progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years|Cancer-specific survival, From randomization to the date of death due to ovarian cancer, assessed up to 5 years|Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), the interval from the last day of the last cycle of a prior regimen of chemotherapy to the first day of the first cycle of the subsequent regimen for each course of chemotherapy, from the last day of the last cycle of a prior regimen of chemotherapy to the first day of the first cycle of the subsequent chemotherapy, assessed up to 5 years|Treatment-related adverse events, assessed by CTCAE ver.5.0, From randomization up to the end of treatment plus 4 weeks|Health-related quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status., Over the 5 year surveillance period|Health-related quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-OV28), The EORTC QLQ-OV28 is a specified questionnaire for patients with ovarian cancer. Participant responses to the question are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized so that scores range from 0 to 100. A lower score indicates a better outcome., Over the 5 year surveillance period|Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), Each dimension in the EQ-5D-5L has five response levels: no problems (Level 1); slight; moderate; severe; and extreme problems (Level 5)., Over the 5 year surveillance period|Cost-effectiveness analysis, assessed by Quality-Adjusted Live Years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), At time of completion of 5-year surveillance period
The goal of this phase III randomized controlled trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of HIPEC with cisplatin (trial arm) compared to no HIPEC (control arm) during interval cytoreductive surgery followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in patients with stage III-IV primary epithelial ovarian cancer.
