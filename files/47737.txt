Function Integrity of Neck Anatomy in Thyroid Surgery
Recent trends in the management of patients with low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma who have a nonsuspicious or cytologically benign contralateral nodule call into question the need for routine total thyroidectomy. Although the lobectomy for the unilateral thyroid cancer with contralateral benign nodules is sufficient treatment, some of the patients might suffer from the anxiety of the residual benign thyroid nodule and tend to choose total thyroidectomy, which might be overtreatment.

Thermal ablation has been proven to be effective in achieving nodule shrinkage and being also free from major complications. In our institution, intraoperative RFA was a proposed alternative strategy to treat the contralateral benign nodules after the thyroid lobectomy for the malignant lobe, which was found to have a better quality of life on anxiety, physiological health, social family, psychological and sensory mentions with a considerable complication rate.
