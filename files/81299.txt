Dose Finding Trial With a New Treatment (Degarelix) for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of degarelix when comparing six different doses. The patients participating in the trial were treated with degarelix every month for a year. During the treatment the patients had to visit the clinic for investigations. Blood samples for testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and Prostate Specific Antigen were taken and analysed throughout the trial.

Degarelix was not FDA regulated at the time of the trial. After completion of the trial degarelix has been approved by the FDA and is thus an FDA regulated intervention.
