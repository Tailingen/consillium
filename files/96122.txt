9 Minutes for Colonoscopy Withdrawal
A withdrawal time of at least 6 minutes has been considered to be necessary to guarantee the adenoma detection rate and the critical quality criterion of colonoscopy. However, several large observational investigations demonstrated that 9 minutes will be in favor of higher adenoma detection rate and lower risk of interval colorectal cancer, when compared with 6-minute withdrawal. Meanwhile, a few studies also indicated that no significant benefit were observed in longer withdrawal time. Up to now, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to give a definitive conclusion. Therefore, we performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized Controlled trial to compare adenoma detection rate of 6-minute and 9-minute withdrawal in colonoscopy.
Colon Polyps|Colorectal Adenomas
PROCEDURE: 9-minute withdrawal|PROCEDURE: 6-minute withdrawal
adenoma detection rate(ADR), ADR was calculated adenoma detection rate is the number of patients with at least one adenoma, divided by the total number of patients., 30mins
adenomas per colonoscopy(APC), APC was calculated as the number of adenomas detected during colonoscopy withdraw divided by the number of colonoscopies., 30mins
