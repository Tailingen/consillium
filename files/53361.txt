Project MILANO: Connections Between Patients With Brain Tumors and Their Pets: an Analysis of Concerns and Needs
Context and problem

In France, 61% of households own a pet, highlighting the significant role pets play in the daily lives. Patients diagnosed with brain tumors face specific challenges that may affect their ability to care their pets, including:

* Progressive neurological deficits (cognitive and/or motor), limiting their autonomy,
* A life-threatening prognosis.

In this context, the well-being of pets when their owner's health deteriorates becomes a critical concern. Indeed:

* Social isolation and the progressive loss of physical and cognitive abilities complicate pet care, particularly during prolonged hospitalizations or in the event of death,
* The lack of appropriate facilities and care solutions causes stress for pets, who are often unprepared for such transitions, and adds to the emotional burden on patients.

Why focus on patients with brain tumors?

* These patients have specific needs due to the rapid progression of their condition,
* A local study showed that 12% of patients with gliomas live alone, a significantly higher rate than in other cancer types. Patients who live alone are particularly exposed to issues related to their pet's future,
* Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with brain tumors, proactive planning for pet care is particularly urgent.
