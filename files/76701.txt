Sensitivity and Specificity of Cytokines in the Diagnosis of Lymphoma-associated HLH
Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lympohistiocytosis is a refractory immune disorder with high mortality. Early identification and diagnosis of lymphoma-associated HLH has become the key to improve the prognosis of lymphoma-associated HLH. Therefore, we conduct a multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study to explore the sensitivity and specificity of cytokines for the early diagnosis of lymphoma-associated HLH.

The sensitivity and specificity of cytokines to predict lymphoma-associated HLH, The sensitivity and specificity of cytokines as a means of early diagnosis of lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 1 year
Dynamic changes of cytokine levels during treatment, To monitor the correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity, treatment response and prognosis of lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 1 years
Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lympohistiocytosis is a refractory immune disorder with high mortality. Without early intervention, the median survival time is less than 2 months. Early identification and diagnosis of lymphoma-associated HLH has become the key to improve the prognosis of lymphoma-associated HLH. Therefore, it is urgent to find a method for the early diagnosis of lymphoma-associated HLH. We conduct a multicenter, prospective, observational clinical study to explore the sensitivity and specificity of cytokines for the early diagnosis of lymphoma-associated HLH, and its correlation with disease severity, treatment response, and prognosis.
