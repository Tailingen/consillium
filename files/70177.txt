For patients with high-risk lymphoid malignancies, patients will undergo allo-HSCT from HLA matched sibling, unrelated (9\~10/10) donor or hallo-identical donors. For all patients will receive myeloablative conditioning with 5-day fludarabine, 2-day VP-16 and 3-day busulifan. For prophylaxis graft versus host disease (GVHD), patients will receive cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg daily on D+3 and +4 with subsequent tacrolimus starting at D+5.
