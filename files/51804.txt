ART-Pro: Clinical Trial Evaluating Biparametric MRI and Advanced, Quantitative Diffusion MRI for Detection of Prostate Cancer
This is a multicenter, multinational trial to evaluate advanced MRI techniques for improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The study will enroll 500 participants at 5 clinical centers (100 participants per center). The current standard MRI technique for prostate cancer screening is multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), but two drawbacks include need for intravenous (IV) contrast and dependence on radiologist expertise. The investigators expect that the combination of two other techniques, biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and Restriction Spectrum Imaging restriction score (RSIrs), will help non-expert radiologists achieve similar performance to expert radiologists using bpMRI or mpMRI for detection of csPCa, while avoiding the drawbacks that are present when using mpMRI.

ART-Pro will be conducted in two phases (ART-Pro-1 and ART-Pro-2) and will evaluate bpMRI, mpMRI, and RSIrs (an advanced quantitative diffusion technique), for detection of csPCa. ART-Pro-1 will evaluate these techniques prospectively, by having each patients' MRI exam read by 2 expert radiologists, both using different subsets of the images to evaluate the different techniques. ART-Pro-1 will additionally evaluate RSIrs as a stand-alone quantitative biomarker. ART-Pro-2 will evaluate these same techniques retrospectively using radiologists of varying experience levels (novice, basic, and expert), and findings will be evaluated against the expertly created dataset from ART-Pro-1. Patients will be followed after initial enrollment for the purpose of extracting relevant medical outcomes, such as biopsy results or surgery pathology.
