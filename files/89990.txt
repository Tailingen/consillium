Cadonilimab for PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade-refractory, MSI-H/dMMR, Advanced Colorectal Cancer
KEYNOTE-177 is currently the only randomized controlled phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard chemotherapy combined with targeted first-line therapy for dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer. The study was conducted at 192 centers in 23 countries and enrolled a total of 307 subjects. The results of the study showed that the median PFS of pembrolizumab was 16.5 months, which was double the 8.2 months in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-0.80; P = 0.0002). In addition, the ORR was 45.1% in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group, and a higher percentage of patients achieving a complete remission (CR) with pembrolizumab than in the chemotherapy group (13.1% vs. 3.9%). The U.S. FDA approved pembrolizumab in June 2020 for the first-line treatment of MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.

The results of the KEYNOTE-177 study showed that 29% of patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer experienced direct disease progression (PD) after first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. This may suggest that some dMMR/MSI-H patients have primary resistance to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. In the first-line treatment cohort of the CheckMate 142 study using nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, the proportion of patients with direct PD was 13%, suggesting that the combination of PD-1 inhibitors and anti-CTLA-4 mAb may have help overcome this primary resistance. In addition, in the second-line and above cohort of the CheckMate142 study, 12% of patients receiving nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab experienced PD directly, compared with 26% of patients receiving nivolumab alone.

A study published on 《The Lancet Oncolog》 on the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab monotherapy and ipilimumab combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody-resistant melanoma Retrospective study. The study included 355 patients with unresectable metastatic stage III or IV melanoma who received ipilimumab monotherapy after failure of anti-PD-(L)1 monoclonal antibody (n=162), or Ipilimumab combined with anti-PD-1 therapy (n=193). The ORR was 31% in the combination arm, significantly higher than the 13% in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm. In addition, the median OS and PFS of the combination therapy group were 20.4 months and 3.0 months, respectively, which were also significantly higher than those of the single-agent group of 8.8 months and 2.6 months.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of Cadonilimab, a bispecific anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-refractory, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR), advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Stage IV|Mismatch Repair-deficient (dMMR)|Microsatellite Instability-high (MSI-H)
DRUG: Cadonilimab
12-month Progression-free survival (PFS) rate, The PFS was defined as the time from enrollment until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. The 12-month PFS rate was defined as the proportion of patients without disease progression or death at the 12th month after initiation of the study. treatment., 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR)., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., 5 years|Toxicity assessed using the The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0., The grade of toxicity will be assessed using the NCI-CTCAE, version 5.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 (lowest level) through 5 (highest level) with unique clinical descriptions of severity., 2 years
