Study Evaluating Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Increasing CD8+ Cell Infiltration in Advance Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Focusing on the clinical question of whether patients with advanced gastric cancer can benefit from immunotherapy, this project intends to detect the degree of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte infiltration in patients with advanced gastric cancer before and after receiving neoadjuvant combined immunotherapy and neoadjuvant therapy alone. To explore the evolving nature of tumor immune response before and after neoadjuvant therapy for gastric cancer, and quantitatively present it through chemical immunohistochemical techniques to achieve a more accurate diagnosis and treatment and improve the long-term efficacy of patients.
