All outpatient patients were found to have \>3 cm uterine myoma or adenomyosis were invited to participate in this study. The size and location of uterine myoma or adenomyosis and the uterus should be assessed by ultrasonography. Besides, all enrolled female patients will be asked to complete overactive bladder symptom score, female bladder function (UDI-6 \& IIQ-7), female sexual function index, and bowel incontinence assessment questionnaires. In addition, patients who underwent surgeries for myoma or adenomyosis will be requested to complete the above questionnaires at 3 months after surgery. Women with intact uterus should be assessed again by ultrasonography. At least 30 women with age and body mass index matched and without uterine myoma or adenomyosis will be invited to participate in this study as the control group.
