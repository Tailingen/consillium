Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With AIDS-Related Hodgkin's Disease
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with lomustine, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and procarbazine in treating patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease.

BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: lomustine|DRUG: procarbazine hydrochloride|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival of patients receiving lomustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide/procarbazine (CECP) for stage IIB-IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease., The course is repeated every 6 weeks. Patients will be followed every 3 months until death.
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and survival of patients receiving lomustine/etoposide/cyclophosphamide/procarbazine (CECP) for stage IIB-IV AIDS-related Hodgkin's disease.
* Assess the feasibility and toxic effects of CECP in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral etoposide on days 1-3, and oral cyclophosphamide and procarbazine on days 22-31. Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42. The course is repeated every 6 weeks.

Patients with a complete or partial response after 1 course of treatment receive two additional courses, but lomustine is omitted in the second course. Patients with partial response or stable disease receive radiation therapy and/or continued chemotherapy. Patients failing to respond after 1 course are removed from the study.

Patients will be followed every 3 months until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 16 evaluable patients will be accrued.
