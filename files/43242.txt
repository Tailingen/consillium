BAriaTric Surgery After Breast Cancer Treatment (BATS)
This is a feasibility study to gain an understanding of the willingness of women with a history of early stage breast cancer and current obesity to enroll in a weight-loss study, accept an assigned intervention (bariatric surgery with lifestyle intervention or lifestyle intervention alone), and comply with the study plan for 1 year. If there is successful enrollment in this study, the plan is to use what is learned in this study to design a larger, longer-term clinical trial to look at the effect of weight loss and incidence of cancer recurrence.
