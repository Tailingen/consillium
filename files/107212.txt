Apatinib Versus Placebo as a Third Line Treatment in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib can improve progression free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy.
Gastric Carcinoma
DRUG: apatinib tablet
Progression free survival, 8 weeks
Overall survival safety, 8 weeks|DCR (Disease control rate), 8 weeks|ORR (Objective response rate), 8 weeks|QoL (Quality of life), 8 weeks|Toxicity, 8 weeks
Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, the efficacy of these treatment is still unsatisfied for their toxicity and limitation in prolonging survival. Based on the promising results of apatinib in the phase I study, this clinical trial has been designed to evaluate whether apatinib can improve progression free survival in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy compared with placebo. Patients will be randomized to 3 groups, one group patients will receive the treatment of apatinib 850mg qd, one group patients will receive apatinib 425mg bid, and the other group will receive placebo.
