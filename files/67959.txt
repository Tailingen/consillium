Peri-operative Zimberelimab vs Zimberelimab in Comb With Domvanalimab in Resectable Mismatch Repair Deficient/Micro-satellite Unstable Gastric & Gastro-oesophageal Junctional Adenocarcinoma (ZODIAC)
A phase II study of peri-operative anti-PD1 (Zimberelimab) +/- anti-TIGIT (Domvanalimab) in resectable mismatch repair deficient (MMRd)/ high micro-satellite instability (MSI-H) gastric/gastro-oesophageal junctional (GOJ) adenocarcinoma (AC)
Locally Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma|MSI-H/dMMR Gastric Cancer|MSI-H/dMMR Gastroesophageal-junction Cancer
DRUG: Single agent zimberelimab|DRUG: Combination zimberelimab + domvanalimab
Efficacy of zimberelimab +/- domvanalimab in patients with resectable MMRd/MSI-H gastric/GOJ adenocarcinoma who proceed to surgery, Complete pathological response (pCR) rate, to be assessed following surgery by pathological review pCR defined as complete disappearance of tumour cells in the primary tumour surgical specimen and lymph nodes, pCR graded using Mandard TRG grading system, 5 years
Efficacy of zimberelimab +/- domvanalimab in patients with resectable MMRd/MSI-H gastric/GOJ adenocarcinoma (all patients treated with study drug(s)), Clinical complete response rate (cCR), defined as either pCR in patients who have completed surgery, or a complete response on pre-operative imaging in patients who do not have surgery, 5 years|Assess the safety of zimberelimab+/- domvanalimab with the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation or delays, irAEs, deaths and laboratory abnormalities per CTCAEv5 grade, Incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation or delays, irAEs, deaths and laboratory abnormalities per CTCAEv5 grade, 5 years|Further assess the anti-tumour effect of zimberelimab +/- domvanalimab and any additional benefit of domvanalimab with radiological response, R0 resection rate, and major surgical complications and survival, EFS,OS, Overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1, R0 resection rate, length of hospital stay, major surgical complications, 5 years
Exploratory - Translational analyses to exploring response to immunotherapy. To review immune surveillance, immune editing and immune association, and the role of T-cells in modulating disease and response, and the overall disease evolution, Dynamic ctDNA changes, mIF IHC, and assessment of tumour immune environment including PDL1 status, TMB, genomic changes by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing, immune surveillance by TCR sequencing, HRD testing, Dynamic ctDNA tracking up to 2 years. The other exploratory translational analyses will be performed at specific time points - the archival biopsy and surgical resection
Primary objective The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of zimberelimab +/- domvanalimab as peri-operative treatment in resectable MMRd/MSI-H gastric/GOJ adenoca. A chemotherapy-sparing approach. The primary endpoint is pathological complete response rate at surgery, and to identify which is the most promising experimental arm (zimberelimab alone vs zimberelimab in combination with domvanalimab).

Secondary objectives

* To assess the safety and tolerability of zimberelimab+/- domvanalimab in this disease setting
* To further assess the efficacy of zimberelimab+/- domvanalimab in terms of radiological response rate, R0 resection rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
* To evaluate surgical outcomes following treatment with zimberelimab +/- domvanalimab

Translational analyses on tissue and blood biomarkers aimed at identifying those who derive the most benefit from this immunotherapy combination, and those who are non/poor responders.
