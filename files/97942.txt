Evaluation of a New Anti-cancer Immunotherapy After Chemotherapy in Adult Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study is being done to evaluate the safety of a WT1 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (WT1 ASCI) as post-consolidation therapy in adult patients with WT1-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia in first complete remission. It will also be analyzed to what extent this treatment induces an immune response, specific to the malignancy.
Leukaemia, Myelocytic, Acute
BIOLOGICAL: GSK Biologicals' recombinant WT1 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI)
Number of Patients With Severe Toxicities, Severe toxicities (as classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0) during the study treatment period defined as a study product-related or possibly study product-related:

* Grade 4 toxicity (exception: Grade 4 fatigue - including lethargy, asthenia, and malaise - had to have a duration of at least 48 hours to be taken into account).
* Grade 3 toxicity lasting for at least 48 hours (exceptions: myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and fever, regardless of duration).
* An allergic reaction/hypersensitivity Grade 2 toxicity (i.e., rash, flushing, urticaria, and dyspnea). Drug fever was not part of this definition.
* Decrease in renal function, with a calculated creatinine clearance \< 40 mL/min.
* Grade 2 cardiac ischemia/infarction (i.e., asymptomatic and testing suggesting ischemia; stable angina)., During the study treatment period (From Day 0 to Month 48)|Seropositivity Rates for Anti-Wilms Tumor Antigen 1 (WT1) Antibodies, Seropostivity rate was defined as the number of patients with anti-WT1 antibody concentration greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value of 9 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) units per milliliter (EU/mL)., At Baseline [Week 0], at Cycle 1 visits [Weeks 5, 9, 13], at Cycle 2 visits [Weeks 15, 21, 32], at Cycle 3 visits [Weeks 40, 54], at Cycle 4 visits [Months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30 and 49 (concluding visit)] and at Follow-up Visits [Months 52, 55, 58, 61]|Concentrations for Anti-WT1 Antibodies, Antibody concentrations were presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and expressed as ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL)., At Baseline [Week 0], at Cycle 1 visits [Weeks 5, 9, 13], at Cycle 2 visits [Weeks 15, 21, 32], at Cycle 3 visits [Weeks 40, 54], at Cycle 4 visits [Months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30 and 49 (concluding visit)] and at Follow-up Visits [Months 52, 55, 58, 61]|Number of Patients With Anti-WT1 Antibody Response, Treatment response was defined as:

For initially seronegative patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 9 EU/ML; For initially seropositive patients: post-administration antibody concentration ≥ 2 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration., At Cycle 1 visits [Weeks 5, 9, 13], at Cycle 2 visits [Weeks 15, 21, 32], at Cycle 3 visits [Weeks 40, 54], at Cycle 4 visits [Months 15, 18, 21, 24, 30 and 49 (concluding visit)] and at Follow-up Visits [Months 52, 55, 58, 61]
Number of Patients With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events, An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination., Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) post-administration period|Number of Patients With Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include any medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. An event that was part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) was captured in the study as an efficacy measure, therefore, it did not need to be reported as an SAE. Death due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form in the Clinical Report Form (CRF), but not as an SAE., During the whole study duration (From Day 0 up to the concluding visit, at Month 49)|Number of Patients With Serious Adverse Events Related to Study Treatment, Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences related to treatment administration that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. An event that was part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression, recurrence) was captured in the study as an efficacy measure, therefore, it did not need to be reported as an SAE. Death due to progressive disease was recorded on a specific form in the CRF, but not as an SAE., During the whole study duration (From Day 0 up to the concluding visit, at Month 49)
In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of WT1 ASCI according four cycles over a period of four years.

This protocol summary has been updated according to the Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 10 Sept 2014).

There will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion of the treatment. The study will end 30 days after the last dose will be administered, so the patients will not be further exposed to unnecessary study related procedures.. In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant. Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.
