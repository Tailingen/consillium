18F-AraG PET/CT as a Non-Invasive Imaging Biomarker for Chemoradiation Treatment Response in Esophageal Cancer
To learn if 18F-FAraG PET scans can find tumors in participants with esophageal cancer and predict a participant's response to treatment.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: ArabinoFuranosylGuanine [18F]F-AraG
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives

* Evaluate the ability of 18F-FAraG PET imaging to detect tumors in participants with esophageal cancer;
* Evaluate 18F-FAraG PET as a predictor of pathologic complete response

Secondary Objectives

* Evaluate the correlation of 18F-FAraG PET with clinical characteristics
* Evaluate the correlation of 18F-FAraG PET with scRNA-seq data
* Evaluate tissue and blood biomarkers as predictors of treatment response and disease recurrence
* Evaluate functional imaging with 18F-FAraG PET and tissue and blood biomarkers as predictors of overall survival and disease-free survival
* Compare 18F-FAraG PET SUV update to the change in standard 18FDG-PET SUV parameters before and after chemoradiation.
