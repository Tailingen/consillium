P-PSMA-101 CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Subjects With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and Advanced Salivary Gland Cancers (SGC)
An open-label, multi-center, single and cyclic ascending dose study of P-PSMA-101 autologous CAR-T cells in patients with mCRPC and SGC.

Assess the Safety of P-PSMA-101, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, Baseline through 15 years|Determine the maximum tolerated dose of P-PSMA-101, Rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Baseline through Day 28|Assess the efficacy of P-PSMA-101 (ORR), According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, secondarily Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), and Prostate Cancer Response assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria: Overall Response Rate (ORR)-Percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Baseline through 15 years
This is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 study that will follow a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts of single and multiple doses of P-PSMA-101 to determine a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Additional participants will be treated with P-PSMA-101 at the determined RP2D.

Following consent, enrolled participants will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which will be sent to a manufacturing site to produce P-PSMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the investigational site and administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.
