PET/MRI in Endometrial Cancer
This study is investigating if positron emission tomography (PET)/Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more effective than the currently used imaging modalities (computed tomography \[CT\], or PET/CT) for high-risk endometrial cancer.

The name of the intervention involved in this study is:

Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI)
Cytoreductive Surgery|Grade 3 Endometrial Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma|High Grade Serous Carcinoma|Endometrial Undifferentiated Carcinoma|Endometrial Mixed Cell Adenocarcinoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: PET/MRI with radiotracer ([18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose) and a gadolinium-based contrast agent
Percentage of patients with a metastatic lesion noted on PET/MRI that have a true malignancy noted on surgical pathology of that lesion, Sensitivity of PET/MRI to detect metastatic lesions, Baseline|Percentage of patients without any metastatic lesion noted on PET/MRI that do not have malignancy noted on surgical pathology, Specificity of PET/MRI to detect abscence of metastatic lesions, Baseline
This research study involves undergoing a diagnostic imaging procedure called positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). This type of scan uses a powerful magnet and a special drug that emits a small but detectable amount of radiation to show detailed images of tumors. This study, will examine the diagnostic effectiveness of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), which will be the intervention. The study will compare the results of this scan to either the computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT that participants would normally undergo as a standard of care for high-risk endometrial cancer.

The research study procedures include a screening for eligibility and a single study visit.

* Participants will undergo the PET/MRI in one study visit of approximately four hours.
* It is expected that about thirty-three (33) people will take part in this research study.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PET/MRI scanner as a diagnostic modality option for indications that include for high-risk endometrial cancer.
