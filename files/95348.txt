Preventive Effects of Parecoxib on Postoperative Complications in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Undergoing Hepatic Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization
This study is aiming to understand the effects of parecoxib on the postoperative complications of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hepatic transcatheter arterial embolization (TACE). The investigators enrolled 242 patients who were diagnosed with HCC for the first time and who received hepatic TACE at the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Center of Sun Yat-sen University from October 2014 to March 2015 were prospectively enrolled. The patients were divided into study and control groups according to whether parecoxib sodium was administered postoperatively. Pain scores,body temperature, vomiting, and changes in liver function after surgery, as well as the length of the hospital stay, were recorded and compared.
