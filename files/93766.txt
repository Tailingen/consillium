A Study Using Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide to Treat Glioblastoma in Patients Over 70
In this study we propose to determine outcomes of patients age 70 or older treated with radiation over 2 weeks given with temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily during radiotherapy and as a post radiation treatment of 150 mg/m2 - 200 mg /m2 for 6 cycles or until the disease progresses.
Glioblastoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy|DRUG: Temozolomide
Number of patients who stop treatment due to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or above toxicities.., If \< 4 out of 10 patients in the initial analysis stop treatment due to toxicity it can proceed to phase II., baseline, 14-28 days post-surgery, 4 weeks post chemo-radiation therapy, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months post Radiation Therapy|Overall survival, Survival status will be collected after completion of chemo-radiation at minimum every 3 months for up to 12 months, then every 6 months until date of death., From date of intervention until the date of first documented disease progression or death, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision) or death from any cause, whichever is first, assessed up to 100 months.
Estimate progression-free survival (PFS), Survival/Documentation of progressive disease status will be collected every 3 months post chemo-radiation up to 12 months, then every 6 months until death, or from the date of disease progression, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision), or from the date of the last dose of study drug (concomitant or adjuvant) if no disease progression., From date of intervention until the date of first documented disease progression or death, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision) or death from any cause, whichever is first, assessed up to 100 months.|Tolerability (feasibility) of hypo-fractionated radiaton therapy and Temozolomide, Quality of life will be measured by Fact-BR assessment., From date of intervention until the date of first documented disease progression or death, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision) or death from any cause, whichever is first, assessed up to 100 months.
Explore association of Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) with 06-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) methylation status, Survival/Documentation of progressive disease status will be collected 4-weeks post chemo-radiation therapy then every 3 months up to 12 months, then every 6 months until death, from either the date of disease progression, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision), or from the date of the last dose of study drug (concomitant or adjuvant) if no disease progression., From date of intervention until the date of first documented disease progression or death, the date of study discontinuation (e.g. toxicity, PI decision) or death from any cause, whichever is first, assessed up to 100 months.|Explore changes in quality of life (QOL), To explore changes in QOL measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-BR) and its predictors., 14-28 days after surgery then within 4 weeks from end of chemotherapy-radiation then 1,4, and 6 months post initiation of adjuvant treatment
In this study we propose to determine outcomes of patients age 70 or older treated with radiation over 2 weeks given with temozolomide 75 mg/m2 daily during radiotherapy and as a post radiation treatment of 150 mg/m2 - 200 mg /m2 for 6 cycles or until the disease progresses.
