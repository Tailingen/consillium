Study of Prognostic Factors in Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
Retrospective observational study with systematic collection of data on filiation (age at diagnosis and sex), clinical data (IPI, ECOG, early response to chemotherapy, overall response to chemotherapy), biological (strain B or T, infiltration of the nervous system central \[CNS\], bone marrow \[MO\], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at the time of diagnosis, as well as genetic patients included in the study, as well as the PETHEMA protocol used in the treatment of same patients The study will review the PETHEMA protocols from 2003 to the present
