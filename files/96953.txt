A Study of FG-3246 in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FG-3246, a cluster of differentiation 46 (CD46) targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in the treatment of participants with mCRPC who have progressed following treatment with one prior second-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) in any setting and no prior taxane therapy in the mCRPC setting.
