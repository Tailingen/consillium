nutritional status, Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed,BCM / ECM index, phase angle, body fat was measured. Increase of body weight and body mass index and and also weight loss were investigated., 12 weeks|Quality of life, Quality of life was determined using the European EORTC QLQ-C30 form, along with an additional disease specific pancreatic cancer module PAN26 and also Brief Fatique Inventory (BFI)., 12 weeks|survival, Survival time in days was calculated from time of diagnosis until death., 1 year|hospital stay, time of hospital stay, 1 year
Pancreatic cancer has the lowest 5-year survival rate of any cancer and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death world wide. Several metabolic changes are present in the whole body in case of cancer so the investigators conducted a placebo controlled, double blinded, randomized, prospective and multicentre study to investigate, whether L-Carnitine supplementation may have an impact on malnutrition, cancer cachexia and cancer related fatigue in advanced pancreatic cancer.
