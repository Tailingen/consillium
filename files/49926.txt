A Trial to Evaluate the Improvement in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation With or Without Brachytherapy
A trial to improve the quality of life of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by evaluating the symptomatic improvements in lung cancer patients receiving external radiation with or without high dose internal radiation.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: EBR plus HDRIB|RADIATION: EBR
For each subject, a lung cancer-related symptomatic improvement at 6 weeks post randomization, defined as a 10-point improvement on a 100 point scale from the summary question of lung cancer symptoms, 6 weeks from randomization
Improvement in each lung cancer symptom as measured by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) as defined by a 10-point improvement for cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis and pain on the LCSS at 6 weeks post randomization, 6 weeks post randomization|Improvement in each lung cancer symptom and overall symptoms at any time after randomization, at 3, 6, 12, 18, 26, 34, 42 and 50 weeks post-randomization|A Quality of Life (QOL) improvement as measured be overall score of the LCSS, at each scheduled assessment point following randomization (Weeks 3, 6, 12, 26, 34, 42 and 50), Weeks 3, 6, 12, 18, 26, 34, 42 and 50|Symptomatic progression-free survival (SPFS), defined as the time from randomization until death, use of chemotherapy, or the first post-randomization score on LCSS #7 which is 10 points or greater than the baseline score, or scored at 100., From date of randomization until the date of first documented use of chemotherapy, or progression whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Overall survival, calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause assessed up to 48 months
In patients with advanced NSCLC to compare the added benefit of High Dose Rate Intraluminal Brachytherapy (HDRIB) with External Beam Radiation (EBR). Benefit will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients who achieve symptomatic improvement in lung cancer symptoms.
