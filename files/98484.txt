Quizartinib or Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Patients With FLT3-ITD Negative AML
This study will compare the effects of Quizartinib versus placebo in combination with chemotherapy in participants with newly diagnosed FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) negative acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

DRUG: Quizartinib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Overall Survival (Arm A vs Arm B), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Date of first patient randomized to the target number of deaths reached, up to approximately 42 months
Event-free survival (Arm A vs. Arm B), Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as failure to achieve Complete Remission (CR) (as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)) at end of induction, relapse after CR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Date of randomization up to approximately 42 months|Duration of complete response (Arm A vs. Arm B), Duration of complete response (DoCR) is defined as time from the first documented CR until documented relapse or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, Date of randomization up to approximately 42 months|Relapse-free survival (Arm A vs. Arm B), Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as time from randomization, for participants who achieve CR in the Induction Phase, until relapse or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, Date of randomization up to approximately 42 months|Complete remission rate (Arm A vs. Arm B), Complete remission rate (CR) is defined as proportion of of participants who achieved a CR, At end of Induction Phase, up to approximately 120 days|Complete remission rate with minimal or measurable residual disease (Arm A vs. Arm B), Proportion of participants achieving CR with minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity, At end of Induction Phase (Cycle 1 or Cycles 1 and 2) and at the end of 2 cycles (2 cycles of induction or 1 cycle induction and 1 cycle consolidation)(1 Induction cycle is up to 60 days, 1 Consolidation cycle is 28 days), up to approximately 120 days|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Arm A vs. Arm B), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as those AEs with start or worsening date during the on-treatment period (from the first dose date of quizartinib/placebo to 30 days after the last dose date of quizartinib/placebo)., Date of first dose up to 30 days after last dose, up to approximately 42 months
This is a clinical trial to compare the effect of quizartinib versus placebo (administered with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, then administered as maintenance therapy for up to 36 cycles) on the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in adult patients with newly diagnosed FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) negative acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Participants will be tested for FLT3-ITD mutation status in a central laboratory using a validated assay.
