A Study Comparing Perioperative Stress Reduction vs. Standard of Care in Ovarian Cancer (PRESERVE)
The purpose of this study is to see if propranolol and etodolac along with mind-body resilience training/MBRT and music therapy help participants who are experiencing physiological stress before, during, and after primary debulking surgery/PDS or IDS and also if it's better than the standard-of-care approach (no intervention for reducing stress).

Number of participants successfully completing over 80% of the bundled interventions, The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a multimodal PSRB in women undergoing PDS or IDS for advanced EOC. This will be measured as number of patients successfully completing over 80% of the bundled interventions, including a preoperative integrative medicine session, postoperative integrative medicine session, total intravenous anesthesia on day of surgery, and perioperative beta blocker and COX2 inhibitor, 21 days after surgical procedure
