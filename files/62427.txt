Number of Participants Who Achieved Low Disease Activity (LDA) Based on Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Month 6: Tofacitinib Overall Versus TNFis Overall, CDAI was a simplified index for assessing the disease activity comprising of the swollen joint counts (SJC), tender/painful joint counts (TJC), participant's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) and physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA). CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: SJC and TJC (based on 28-joint assessment range from 0 to 28, higher scores meant worse condition), PtGA and PGA (score range from 0 to 10, assessed on 0-10 centimeter (cm) visual analog scale; higher scores indicated greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score = 0 (no disease) to 76 (severe disease), higher scores indicated worse condition.
