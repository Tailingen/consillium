Irinotecan Liposome Combined with S-1 in PD-1/L1 Inhibitor Refractory Recurrent or Metastatic NPC
This is a prospective, single-arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Irinotecan Liposome injection combined with S-1 in patients with recurrent (unable to local curative treatment) or metastatic NPC who failed at least first-line anti-PD-1/L1.
Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Irinotecan liposome|DRUG: S-1
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival PFS is defined as the duration from the date of treatment to progression or death, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the date of treatment to death or last follow-up, with no restriction on the cause of death., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Incidence of adverse events, NCI-CTCAE 5.0 standard is adopted., 1 year
Fifty-six recurrent (unable to local curative treatment) or metastatic NPC patients who had failed at least first-line anti-PD-1/L1, whether or not combined with chemotherapy, were eligible to receive Irinotecan Liposome injection combined with S-1 for up to 6 cycles. All patients will be treated until disease progression as determined by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, intolerable toxicity, subject withdrawal of informed consent, initiation of new antitumor therapy, loss of follow-up, death, or study completion, whichever occurs first. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment regimen.
