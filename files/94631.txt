Panomic Approach to Immune-Connected Assays in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The scope of the PICASSO project is to apply an innovative patient-based pan-omic approach to immune-assays, that will include multi-omics tumour characterization (genome, proteome, transcriptome), blood immune-cells and cytokine profiling, serological screening for paraneoplastic autoantibodies, clinical and metabolic measurements.

The PICASSO project is aimed to validate in real world population the predictive role of SCLC transcriptomic classification (particularly, I-SCLC subtype) and to explore correlations with dynamic changes in peripheral blood immunity. Additionally, investigators expected to validate the predictive/prognostic role of emerging new variables, including metabolic-induced meta-inflammation alterations and subclinical auto-immunity.
