Study on TIL for the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Autologous TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA lymphodepletion treatment with hydroxychloroquine(600mg,single-dose) and cyclophosphamide.

Adverse Events (AE), To characterize the safety profile of GC101 TIL in patients with advanced melanoma as assessed by incidence of adverse events., 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1):

ORR (proportion of patients) = # with CR + # with PR / # with CR + # with PR + # with SD + # with PD.

( Except baseline evaluation within 28 days before GC101 TIL infusion，PET/CT scan will be performed at 6 weeks after TIL infusion, and than every 6 weeks for 6 months, and then every 6 months after that for up to 3 years), Up to 36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR）, Percentage of patients that meet CR, PR and SD criteria set in this study according to RECIST v1.1： DCR (proportion of patients) = # with CR + # with PR + # with SD / # with CR + # with PR + # with SD + # with PD., Up to 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The time length between the first confirmed objective response per RECIST 1.1 to the treatment and the subsequent disease progression per RECIST 1.1, Up to 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time length between GC101 TIL infusion and confirmed subsequent disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), The length of time from the date of the start of GC101 TIL treatment that the patients are still alive, Up to 36 months
Change in Quality of Life, Comparison of patients' quality of life before and after GC101 TIL treatment as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-30 (V3.0)., Up to 36 months
