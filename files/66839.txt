TACE-HAIC Plus Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab for Unresectable HCC: a Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Transartial chemobolization plus hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy showed performance for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether the additional of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab will improve the response rate for those patients is still unknown. This phase 2 clinical trial aims to investigate the objective response rate for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
