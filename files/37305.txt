Phase 2 Study to Assess Activity & Safety of Front-line Ibrutinib + Rituximab in Unfit Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The present study aims at evaluating whether treatment with two different drugs, Ibrutinib and Rituximab is both efficient and safe for newly diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia|Adult Patients
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab
Number of patients on progression-free survival, To estimate Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 12 months in patients treated with Ibrutinib plus Rituximab combination in unfit patients with CLL., At 12 months from treatment start
Number of patients in complete response (CR) or partial response (OR), Rate of Overall Response Rate (ORR) measured in terms of number of patients in CR/PR at the end of induction therapy., At the end of induction therapy, that is, 7 months from treatment start|Number of patients in CR, Rate of Complete Responses (CR) measured in terms of number of patients in CR at the end of induction therapy., At the end of induction therapy, that is, at 7 months from treatment start|Number of negative minimal residual disease CRs, Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in terms of rate of MRD-negative CRs at the end of induction therapy., At the end of induction therapy, that is, at 7 months from treatment start|Number of days from treatment discontinuation to new treatment restart., Time To Next Treatment (TTNT) after treatment discontinuation., At the end of the study, that is, 90 months from treatment start|Number of patients in event-free survival, event-Free Survival (PFS) at 36 months., At 36 months from treatment start|Number of patients in overall survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) at 36 months., At 36 months from treatment start|Number of patients in which there is a hematological improvement, Rate of hematological improvement in patients with baseline anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia defined by hemoglobin \>11 g/dL or increase ≥50% over baseline, granulocyte \>1500 mm3 or platelet count \>100,000/mm3, respectively., At the end of the study, that is, at 90 months from treatment start|Number of patients with improvement in the immunoglobulin levels, Rate of patients with improvement in the immunoglobulin levels., At 90 months from treatment start|Number of adverse events and serious adverse events, At 90 months from study start|Number of patients requiring hospitalization, Rate of patients requiring hospitalization, emergency department visits, blood product transfusions and use of hematopoietic growth factors., At 90 months from study entry|Number of patients in which clinical and biological features can be linked, Rate of ORR, CR, PFS, EFS, TTNT and OS according to clinical and biologic variables: age, size of nodes, CIRS score, stage, ß2-microglobulin, lymphocyte count, stage, CD38, CD49d, ZAP-70, IGVH mutation status, FISH profile (11q del; 17p del; trisomy 12; 13q del; no aberrations) and mutations of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3., At 90 months from study entry|Number of leukemic subpopulations, Proportion of leukemic and of normal lymphocyte subpopulations, including evaluation of cytokine receptors/adhesion molecules on peripheral blood lymphocytes at week +2 from the start of treatment., At 90 months from start|Number of patients with RS identified by FDG-PET/CT, Rate of cases of patients with RS or SM identified by FDG-PET/CT, At 90 months from study start
Given that:

* Ibrutinib as single agent has been associated with a high response rate and PFS in previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and biologic features.
* Ibrutinib as single agent has proven activity and is associated with a good safety profile in elderly patients with CLL.
* The Ibrutinib plus Rituximab combination has been associated with a high response rate and PFS in previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and biologic features.
* The combined administration of Ibrutinib and Rituximab could be an effective and safe front-line treatment schedule for unfit patients with CLL.
* The current study is designed to evaluate whether first line treatment with Ibrutinib and Rituximab results in a significant improvement in PFS at 12 months as compared with chlorambucil plus rituximab in patients unfit for fludarabine- or bendamustine-based treatments.
