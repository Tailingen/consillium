Efficacy of the combined regimen is evaluated primarily by objective remission rate, including complete remission, unverified complete remission and partial remission, also by duration of remission, progression free survival, and overall survival.

Safety is accessed by:

1. The type, incidence, severity of incidents related to the use of the regimen.
2. Laboratory abnormalities, including the type, incidence, severity, relationship with the use of the regimen.
3. Incidence of level 3-4 incidents and laboratory abnormalities.
