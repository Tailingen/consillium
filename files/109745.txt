Improving Outcomes for Older Adults Undergoing Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to improve healthcare received by people â‰¥ 65 years who are receiving radiation therapy (RT). The study will primarily examine patients ability to complete RT, changes in a patients' daily function and self-reported toxicities. To collect this information, study participants will be asked to complete surveys and physical and cognitive function assessments at five different timepoints in their treatment: before RT, End of RT, and at 1, 3, and 6 months follow up visits. Findings of this study will help radiation oncologists make more informed decisions for future patients receiving RT.

* Global health status/quality of life (2 items) with scores ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 7 (Excellent).
* Functional scales (15 total items addressing either physical, role, emotional, cognitive, or social functioning), each item scores ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much).
* Symptom scales (13 total items addressing either fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, or financial impact), each item scores ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

All domain scores are calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0 to 100 score range.
