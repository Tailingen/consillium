Patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer who have no other effective treatment options will be offered the treatment. These patients have a poor prognosis, and there is a strong need for improved therapy.

The patients will be given adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with Radium-1 TCR+ T cells transiently redirected against the TGFβRII frameshift antigen which is expressed in MSI+ colon cancer. The first report on TCR therapy in colon cancer was targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) where some evidence of clinical response was seen, but the T-cell function may have been inhibited due to the necessity to resolve the severe colitis which occurred due to the presence of CEA in normal cells in the colon. This demonstrates the feasibility of T-cell therapy in metastatic colon cancer, but also the limitations of targeting CEA as an antigen.
