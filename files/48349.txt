Evaluation of HPGD and SCLO2A1 Expression in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients
This study aims to investigate the role of HPGD in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Specifically, it will focus on HPGD's impact on proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and prognosis. The study will analyze gene expression data from clinical samples and use techniques like RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to assess HPGD expression levels. Additionally, the research will explore the relationship between HPGD and patient survival outcomes. By elucidating HPGD's contribution to cancer progression, the study seeks to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving renal cancer treatment.

HPGD Expression Levels in clear cell renal cell carcinoma（ccRCC） Patients, The primary outcome will measure the expression levels of HPGD in ccRCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its correlation with clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)., 2024.1-2024.6
This study is designed to comprehensively explore the role of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( HPGD) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma development and progression. HPGD has been implicated in various cancers, with evidence suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis, EMT, and poor prognosis. However, its specific function n clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still unclear. This research will analyze clinical samples, including tumor tissues and normal adjacent tissues, to evaluate HPGD expression through a combination of advanced laboratory techniques such as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA sequencing.

Furthermore, HPGD-interacting proteins were predicted using STRING and TCGA data, followed by PCR, Western blot validation, and IHC. Mechanistically, HPGD positively correlated with the solute carrier organic anion transporter 2A1 (SLCO2A1), and SLCO2A1 knockdown partially attenuated the tumor-suppressive effects of HPGD overexpression..

This study underscores the tumor-suppressive role of HPGD in ccRCC, highlighting its capacity to hinder cell proliferation and EMT via its interaction with SLCO2A1. Targeting the HPGD-SLCO2A1 axis may offer a promising novel therapeutic approach for ccRCC management.
