Preoperative Chemotherapy vs. Chemoradiation in Esophageal / GEJ Adenocarcinoma
The best treatment for resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is unknown. Although an operation to remove the esophagus is the most common treatment, previous studies have shown that patients live longer when either perioperative (before and after surgery) chemotherapy or preoperative (before surgery) chemotherapy plus radiation is given, compared to surgery alone. However it is unknown which of these treatments (perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation) is more effective in improving survival. A study where patients with resectable esophageal / GE junction cancer are chosen at random to receive one of the two preoperative treatments would help determine if one form of treatment improves survival compared to the other.

Patients with localized esophageal / GE junction cancer (adenocarcinoma) will be randomized to receive either preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery.

The main objective of this pilot trial is to determine the possibility of conducting a larger study with many centers participating. If this study proves to be feasible with enough patients enrolled and able to tolerate treatments without major side effects then we can hopefully proceed to perform a larger multi-center trial to look for survival outcome differences between patients who receive preoperative chemotherapy and those who receive preoperative chemoradiation. The results of this trial would ultimately help us choose the most effective treatment of resectable esophageal cancer and hopefully improve survival.

RESEARCH PLAN Phase III randomized 2-arm parallel group pilot study

1:1 randomization to A) or B)

TREATMENT REGIMEN A) PERIOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY (OPTION of CHEMO REGIMEN 1 or 2) 1) FLOT - Four x 14 day cycles FLOT preoperatively and 4 cycles postoperatively: 5-Fluorouracil 2600 mg/m², day 1 IV every 14 days Leucovorin 200 mg/m², day 1, IV., every 14 days Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m², day 1, IV, every 14 days Docetaxel 50mg/m2, day 1, IV, every 14 days

OR

2) ECF / ECX - Three x 21-day cycles ECF preoperatively and 3 cycles postoperatively (within 4-10 weeks after surgery): Epirubicin (50 mg/m²,) day 1 IV Cisplatin: 60 mg/m², day 1 IV 5-Fluorouracil: 200 mg/m², daily for 21 days by continuous IV infusion 5-FU may be substituted with Capecitabine (Xeloda) 625mg/m2, BID (ECX)

OR

B) NEOADJUVANT CHEMORADIATION

1) -carboplatin and paclitaxel given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29

* paclitaxel: 50 mg / m2 IV
* carboplatin: dosed to an area under the curve of 2, by Calvert formula Radiation Therapy 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk Upon completion of neoadjuvant therapy, all patients will be considered for surgery.

Patients will be deemed acceptable for surgery provided:

* repeat imaging performed after neoadjuvant therapy does not demonstrate distant metastases or local invasion of the primary tumor into vital structures (heart, great vessels, trachea)
* maintenance of adequate performance status and ability to tolerate esophagectomy

Surgery will be performed preferably within 8 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant therapy.
