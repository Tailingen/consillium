Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are hematological malignancies. Some patients are over 65 years old, have poor response to traditional chemotherapy, and rarely have the opportunity to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, resulting in poor prognosis and short survival.

In recent years, with the advent of molecular targeted drugs Bcl-2 inhibitors, the treatment of elderly AML/ high-risk MDS has achieved breakthrough progress. In particular, the combination of demethylated drugs (decitabine/azacidacidin) and Bcl-2 inhibitors of chemotherapy-free regimen has been recommended by NCCN as the first-line treatment for elderly and frail patients.

However, how to achieve the optimal combination of decitabine and Bcl-2 inhibitors is an urgent problem to be solved.

Our previous pilot trial showed that prolonged low-dose decitabine combined with venetoclax (Bcl-2 inhibitor) resulted in higher complete remission rate, longer disease-free survival, and lower treatment-related risks.

The purpose of this study was to expand the multi-center sample to explore the efficacy and safety of prolonged low-dose decitabine plus venetoclax regimen in primary diagnosed elderly or frail AML/ high-risk MDS.
