Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from testicular cancer in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 9,720.
Deaths: 600.
Testicular cancer is a highly treatable, usually curable cancer that most often
develops in young and middle-aged men.  Most testicular  cancers are germ cell tumors.  For treatment planning, germ cell tumors are  broadly divided
into seminomas and nonseminomas  because they have different prognostic and treatment algorithms.  For patients with seminomas (all
stages combined), the cure rate exceeds 90%.  For patients with low-stage
seminomas or nonseminomas, the cure rate approaches 100%.[

Risk Factors
Risk factors for testicular cancer include the following:[
7
]
An undescended testis (cryptorchidism).
A family history of testis cancer (particularly in a father or brother).
A personal history of testis cancer.
Surgical correction of an undescended testis (orchiopexy) before puberty appears to lower the risk of testicular cancer, but this is not certain.[
8
]
Histopathology
Types of testicular germ cell tumors: Seminomas versus nonseminomas
There are five histopathological subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors:
Seminomas.
Embryonal carcinomas.
Teratomas.
Yolk sac tumors.
Choriocarcinomas.
Tumors that are 100% seminoma are considered seminomas.  All other tumors, including those that  have a mixture of seminoma and nonseminoma components, are considered and should be
managed as nonseminomas.   Most nonseminomas consist of a mixture of the different germ cell tumor subtypes. Tumors that appear to have a seminoma histology but are accompanied by an elevated
serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) should be treated as nonseminomas because seminomas do not produce AFP.
Prognosis and Staging
Serum tumor markers and testis cancer: AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) play an important role as serum tumor markers in the staging and monitoring of germ cell tumors and should be measured prior to removing the involved testicle.[
9
]  For patients with nonseminomas, one of the most significant predictors of prognosis is the degree of tumor-marker elevation after the cancerous testicle has been removed.[
10
]  Elevated levels of serum tumor markers are often the earliest sign of relapse, making these markers useful for monitoring all stages of nonseminomas and metastatic seminomas.
AFP:
Elevation of serum AFP is seen in 40% to 60% of men with nonseminomas.  Seminomas do not produce AFP. Men who have an elevated serum AFP have a mixed germ cell tumor (i.e., nonseminomatous germ cell tumors [NSGCT]) even if the pathology shows a pure seminoma—unless there is a more persuasive explanation for the elevated AFP, such as liver disease.
Beta-hCG:
Elevation of beta-hCG is
found in approximately 14% of patients with stage I pure seminomas before orchiectomy and in about one-half of patients with metastatic seminomas.[
11
-
13
]  Approximately 40% to 60% of men with nonseminomas have an elevated serum beta-hCG.
Significant and unambiguously rising levels of AFP and/or beta-hCG signal relapsed germ cell tumor in most cases and are an indication for treatment even in the absence of radiological evidence of metastatic disease.  Nonetheless, tumor marker elevations need to be interpreted with caution.  For example, false-positive beta-hCG levels can result from cross reactivity of the assay with luteinizing hormone in which case an intramuscular injection of testosterone should result in normalization of beta-hCG values.  There are also clinical reports of marijuana use resulting in elevations of serum beta-hCG and some experts recommend querying patients about drug use and retesting beta-hCG levels after a period of abstinence from marijuana use.  Similarly, AFP is chronically mildly elevated in some individuals for unclear reasons and can be substantially elevated by liver disease.
LDH:
Seminomas and nonseminomas alike may result in elevated LDH but such values are of unclear prognostic significance because LDH may be elevated in many conditions unrelated to cancer.  A study evaluated the utility of LDH in 499 patients with a testicular germ cell tumor who were undergoing surveillance after orchiectomy or treatment of stage II or III disease. It found that 7.7% of patients had elevated LDH unrelated to cancer, while only 1.4% of patients had cancer-related increases in LDH.[
14
]  Among 15 patients with relapsed disease, LDH was elevated in six patients and was the first sign of relapse in one patient.  Over 9% of the men had a persistent false-positive increase in LDH.  The positive predictive value for an elevated LDH was 12.8%.
A second study reported that among 494 patients with stage I germ cell tumors who subsequently had a relapse, 125 had an elevated LDH at the time of relapse.  Of these 125 patients, all had other evidence of relapse:  112 had a concurrent rise in AFP and/or beta-hCG, one had computed tomography (CT) evidence of relapse before the elevation in LDH, one had palpable disease on examination, and one complained of back pain that led to imaging that revealed retroperitoneal relapse.[
15
]  On one hand, measuring LDH  appears to have little value for predicting relapse during surveillance of germ cell tumors.  On the other hand, for patients with metastatic NSGCT, large studies of prognostic models have found the LDH level to be a significant independent predictor of survival.[
10
,
16
]
Staging and risk stratification
There are two major prognostic models for testicular cancer: staging[
17
] and, for risk stratification of men with distant and/or bulky retroperitoneal metastases, the International Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group classification.[
10
]  The prognosis of patients with testicular germ cell tumors is determined by the following factors:
Histology (seminoma vs. nonseminoma).
The extent to which the tumor has spread (testis only vs. retroperitoneal lymph node involvement vs. pulmonary or distant nodal metastasis vs. nonpulmonary visceral metastasis).
For nonseminomas, the degree to which serum tumor markers are elevated.[
10
]
For men with disseminated seminomas, the main adverse prognostic variable is the presence of metastases to organs other than the lungs (e.g., bone, liver, or brain).  For men with disseminated nonseminomas, the following variables are independently associated with poor prognosis:
Metastases to organs other than the lungs.
Highly elevated serum tumor markers.
Tumor that originated in the mediastinum rather than the testis.
Nonetheless, even patients with widespread metastases at
presentation, including those with brain metastases, may  have curable disease and
should be treated with this intent.[
18
]
Radical inguinal orchiectomy with initial high ligation of the spermatic cord
is the procedure of choice in diagnosing and treating a malignant testicular mass.[
19
] 
As noted above, serum AFP, LDH, and beta-hCG should be measured before an orchiectomy. Transscrotal biopsy is not considered appropriate because of the risk of local
dissemination of tumor into the scrotum or its spread to inguinal lymph nodes.  A
retrospective analysis of reported series in which transscrotal approaches were used showed a small but statistically significant increase in local
recurrence rates, compared with when the inguinal approach was used (2.9% vs. 0.4%).[
20
][
Level of evidence C2
]  However, distant recurrence and survival rates  were
indistinguishable in the two  approaches.
Diagnostics
Evaluation of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, usually by CT scan,  is an important aspect of
staging and treatment planning in adults with testicular cancer.[
21
,
22
]  Patients with a negative result have
a substantial chance of having microscopic involvement of the lymph nodes.  Nearly 20% of patients with seminoma and 30% of patients with nonseminoma who have normal CT scans and serum tumor markers will subsequently relapse if not given additional treatment after orchiectomy.[
23
-
25
] For patients with nonseminoma, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) increases the accuracy of staging, but as many as 10% of men with normal imaging, normal tumor markers, and benign pathology at RPLND will still experience a relapse.[
26
]  After RPLND, about 25% of patients with clinical stage I
nonseminomatous testicular cancer are restaged as pathological stage II, and about 25% of clinical
stage II patients are restaged as pathological stage I.[
26
-
28
] In
prepubertal children, the use of serial measurements of AFP has proven sufficient for
monitoring response after initial orchiectomy.  Lymphangiography and
para-aortic lymph node dissection do not appear to be useful or necessary in
the proper staging and management of testicular cancer in prepubertal boys.[

Childhood Testicular Cancer Treatment
.
Follow-Up and Survivorship
Patients who have been cured of testicular cancer have approximately a 2% cumulative risk of developing cancer in the opposite testicle during the 15
years after initial diagnosis.[
30
,
31
] Within this range, men with nonseminomatous primary tumors appear to have a lower risk of subsequent contralateral testis tumors than men with seminomas.
Men with HIV are reported to be at increased risk of  developing testicular
seminomas.[
32
] Depending on comorbid conditions such as active
infection, these men are generally managed similarly to patients without HIV.
Because  most patients with testicular cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy are
curable, it is necessary  to be aware of possible long-term effects of
 the various treatment modalities, such as the following:
Fertility:
Many patients have oligospermia or sperm abnormalities before
therapy, but semen analysis results generally become more normal after treatment.  The impact of standard chemotherapy on fertility in patients with testicular cancer is not well defined, although it is well documented that most men can father children after treatment, often without the use of cryopreserved semen.   In two large studies, roughly  70%  of patients fathered children  after treatment for testicular cancer.[
33
,
34
] The likelihood of recovering fertility is related to the type of treatment received.  The children do not appear
to have an increased risk of congenital malformations, but the data are not adequate to properly investigate this issue.[
35
,
36
] It is recommended that men wait at least 3 months after completing chemotherapy before conceiving a child (unless using cryopreserved sperm collected before  chemotherapy was administered).[
36
]
Radiation therapy, used to treat pure seminomatous testicular cancers, can
cause fertility problems because of  radiation scatter to the remaining testicle
during radiation therapy to retroperitoneal lymph nodes (as evidenced in the SWOG-8711 trial, for example).[
37
]   Depending on scatter
dose, sperm counts fall after radiation therapy but may recover over the course of 1
to 2 years.  Shielding techniques can be used to decrease the radiation scatter
to the remaining normal testicle. Because chemotherapy, RPLND, and radiation therapy can each result in infertility, men can be offered the opportunity to bank sperm before undergoing any treatment for testicular cancer other than orchiectomy.
Secondary leukemias:
Several reports of elevated risk of secondary acute
leukemia, primarily nonlymphocytic, have appeared.[
38
,
39
]  An increased risk of leukemia has been associated with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[
38
] Etoposide-containing regimens are also associated with a
risk of secondary acute leukemias, usually in the myeloid lineage, and with a
characteristic 11q23 translocation.[
40
,
41
]  Etoposide-associated leukemias
typically occur sooner after therapy than alkylating agent-associated
leukemias and often show balanced chromosomal translocations on the long arm of
chromosome 11.  Standard etoposide dosages (<2 g/m
2
cumulative dose) are associated with a relative risk of 15 to 25, but this
translates into a cumulative incidence of leukemia of less than 0.5% at 5
years.  Preliminary data suggest that cumulative doses of more than 2 g/m
2
of etoposide may confer higher risk.
Renal function:
Minor decreases in creatinine clearance occur (about a 15%
decrease, on average) during platinum-based therapy, but they  appear to remain
stable in the long term, without significant deterioration.[
42
]
Hearing:
Bilateral hearing deficits occur with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, but they generally occur at sound frequencies of 4 kHz to 8
kHz, which is outside the range of conversational tones. Therefore, hearing
aids are rarely required  if standard doses of cisplatin are given.[
42
]
Lung function:
A study of pulmonary function tests in 1,049 long-term survivors of testicular cancer reported a cisplatin-dose-dependent increase in the incidence of restrictive lung disease.[
43
]  Whereas men receiving up to 850 mg of cisplatin had a normal risk of restrictive lung disease, men who received over 850 mg of cisplatin had a threefold increased risk.  In absolute terms, patients who received no chemotherapy had an incidence of restrictive lung disease of less than 8%, whereas the incidence of restrictive lung disease among those receiving over 850 mg of cisplatin was nearly 18%.  However, only 9.5% of those with pulmonary function testing indicative of restrictive lung disease reported dyspnea.  Although cisplatin was more strongly associated with decreased lung function in this study, cumulative bleomycin dose was also associated with a decline in forced vital capacity and the 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) but not with restrictive lung disease.
Although acute pulmonary toxic effects may occur with bleomycin, they are rarely fatal at
total cumulative doses of less than 400 units.  Because life-threatening
pulmonary toxic effects can occur, the drug should be discontinued if early
signs of pulmonary toxicity develop.  Although decreases in pulmonary
function are frequent, they are rarely symptomatic and are reversible after chemotherapy ends.  Survivors of testis cancer who were treated with chemotherapy have been reported to be at increased risk of death from respiratory diseases, but it is unknown whether this finding is related to bleomycin exposure.[
44
]
Radiation therapy, often used in the management of pure seminomatous germ cell
cancers, has been linked to the development of secondary cancers, especially
solid tumors in the radiation portal, usually after a latency period of a
decade or more.[
45
,
46
]  These secondary cancers include melanoma and cancers of the stomach, bladder, colon,
rectum, pancreas, lung, pleura, prostate, kidney, connective tissue, and thyroid. 
Chemotherapy has also been associated with an elevated risk of secondary cancers.
Other risk factors
Cardiovascular disease in testicular cancer survivors
Men with testicular cancer who have been treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are at increased risk of cardiovascular events.[
47
-
49
]  Other studies have reported that chemotherapy for testicular cancer is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and hypogonadism.[
50
,
51
]  Moreover, an international population-based study reported that men treated with either radiation therapy or chemotherapy were at increased risk of death from circulatory diseases.[
44
]
In a retrospective series of 992 patients treated for testicular cancer between 1982 and 1992,  cardiac events were increased approximately 2.5-fold in patients treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, compared with  those who underwent surveillance for a median of 10.2 years.  The actuarial risks of cardiac events were 7.2% for patients who received radiation therapy (92% of whom did not receive mediastinal radiation therapy), 3.4% for patients who received chemotherapy (primarily platinum-based), 4.1% for patients who received combined therapy, and 1.4% for patients who underwent surveillance management after 10 years of follow-up.[
48
]
A population-based retrospective study of 2,339 testicular cancer survivors in the Netherlands, treated between 1965 and 1995 and followed for a median of 18.4 years, found that the overall incidence of coronary heart disease (i.e., myocardial infarction and/or angina pectoris) was increased 1.17 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.31) compared with  the general population.[
49
]  Patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum had a 2.5-fold (95% CI, 1.8–3.4) increased risk of coronary heart disease, and those who also received chemotherapy had an almost threefold (95% CI, 1.7–4.8) increased risk.  Patients who were treated with infradiaphragmatic radiation therapy alone had no significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease.  In multivariate Cox regression analyses, the older chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin, used until the mid-1980s, was associated with a significant 1.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2–2.9) increased risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure combined).  The newer regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin was associated with a borderline significant 1.5-fold (95% CI, 1.0–2.2) increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, an international pooled analysis of population-based databases reported that the risk of death from circulatory disease was increased in men treated with chemotherapy (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.58) or radiation therapy (SMR = 1.70).[

Although testicular cancer is highly curable, all newly diagnosed patients are
appropriate candidates for clinical trials designed to decrease
morbidity of treatment while further improving cure rates.

Cellular Classification of Testicular Cancer
The following histological classification of malignant testicular germ cell tumors (testicular cancer) reflects the classification used by the World Health Organization (WHO).[
1
]  Less than 50% of malignant testicular germ cell tumors have a single cell type, approximately 50% of which are seminomas.  The remaining tumors have more than  one cell type, and the relative proportions of each cell type should be specified.  The cell type of these tumors is important for estimating the risk of metastases and the response to chemotherapy.   Polyembryoma presents an unusual growth pattern and is sometimes listed as a single histological type, although it might better be regarded as a mixed tumor.[

In addition to the clinical stage definitions, surgical stage may be designated
based on the results of surgical removal and microscopic examination of tissue.
Stage 0
Stage 0 testicular cancer is testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN), also referred to as intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN). TIN is analogous to carcinoma
in situ
. In most cases, TIN is diagnosed as a result of an orchiectomy that was performed to remove an invasive germ cell tumor (pT1–T4); generally, TIN has  already been removed from the body at the time of diagnosis and requires no treatment. A more challenging situation arises if a biopsy is performed of the contralateral testis and TIN is discovered. Because of the low incidence and low mortality rates associated with contralateral germ cell tumors, such biopsies are performed rarely in the United States. Therefore, TIN is almost never diagnosed in testicles that do not also have an invasive tumor. Consequently, a treatment decision about TIN in stage 0 testicular cancer  is  rarely faced in the United States. Treatment options for ITGCN include radiation therapy, surveillance, and orchiectomy.
Stage I
Stage I testicular cancer is limited to the testis.  Invasion of the scrotal
wall by tumor or interruption of the scrotal wall by previous surgery does not
change the stage but does increase the risk of spread to the inguinal lymph
nodes, and this must be considered in treatment and follow-up.  Invasion of the
epididymis tunica albuginea and/or the rete testis does not change the
stage.  Invasion of the tunica vaginalis or lymphovascular invasion signifies a T2 tumor, while invasion of the spermatic cord signifies a T3 tumor, and invasion of the scrotum signifies a T4.  Increases in T stage are associated with  increased risk of occult metastatic disease and recurrence.  Men with stage I disease who have persistently elevated serum tumor markers after orchiectomy are staged as IS, but stage IS nonseminomas are treated as stage III. Elevated serum tumor markers in stage I or II seminoma are of unclear significance except that a persistently elevated or rising beta-hCG usually indicates metastatic disease.
Stage II
Stage II testicular cancer involves the testis and the retroperitoneal or
periaortic lymph nodes usually in the region of the kidney.  Retroperitoneal
involvement should be further characterized by the number of nodes involved and
the size of involved nodes.  The risk of recurrence is increased if more than five
nodes are involved or if the size of one  or more involved nodes is more than 2
cm.  Bulky stage II disease
(stage IIC) describes patients with extensive retroperitoneal nodes (>5 cm), which portends a less favorable prognosis.
Stage III
Stage III disease has spread beyond the retroperitoneal nodes based on physical
examination, imaging studies, and/or blood tests (i.e., patients with retroperitoneal adenopathy and highly elevated serum tumor markers are stage III).  Stage III can be further stratified based on the location of metastasis and the degree of elevation of serum tumor markers.  In the favorable group (IIIA), metastases are
limited to lymph nodes and lung, and serum tumor markers are no more than mildly elevated. Stage IIIB patients have moderately elevated tumor markers, while stage IIIC patients have highly elevated markers and/or metastases to liver, bone, brain, or some organ other than the lungs. These subclassifications of stage III correspond to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification system for disseminated germ cell tumors.[

Treatment Option Overview for Testicular Cancer
In This Section
Good Prognosis
Intermediate Prognosis
Poor Prognosis
Testicular cancer is broadly divided into seminomas and nonseminomas for
treatment planning. Seminomatous types of testicular cancer are more
sensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy and are less prone to distant metastases than nonseminomatous types. Nonseminomas may include teratomatous elements, which tend to be resistant to chemotherapy and often require surgery for cure.  By definition, pure seminomas do not contain elements of teratoma.  Therefore, surgery plays a larger role in the management of nonseminomas than in the management of seminomas.  Nonseminomatous testicular tumors include the following:
Embryonal carcinomas.
Yolk
sac tumors.
Choriocarcinomas.
Teratomas.
Mixed germ cell tumors.
An international germ cell tumor prognostic classification has been developed
based on a retrospective analysis of 5,202 patients with metastatic
nonseminomatous and 660 patients with metastatic seminomatous germ cell
tumors.[
1
]  All patients received treatment with cisplatin- or carboplatin-containing therapy as their first chemotherapy course.  The prognostic
classification, shown below, was agreed on in 1997 by all major clinical
trial groups worldwide.  It is used for reporting  clinical trial
results of patients with germ cell tumors.
A meta-analysis of treatment outcomes for patients with advanced nonseminoma suggested that 5-year survival rates have improved for those patients with a poor prognosis during  the period of 1989 to 2004.[
2
] In addition to improved therapy, the improvement in survival rates could be the result of  publication bias, changes in patient selection in reported clinical trials, or more sensitive staging methods that could migrate less-advanced stages to more-advanced stage categories (i.e., stage migration).
Good Prognosis
Nonseminoma:
Testis/retroperitoneal primary, and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases, and
Good markers–all of:
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) less than 1,000 ng/mL, and
Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) less than 5,000 IU/mL (1,000 ng/mL), and
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) less than 1.5 × the upper limit of normal
A total of 56% to 61% of nonseminomas are good prognosis. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate is 89%; the 5-year survival rate is 92%–94%.
Seminoma:
Any primary site, and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases, and
Normal AFP, any beta-hCG, any LDH
A total of 90% of seminomas are good prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 82%; 
the 5-year survival rate is 86%.
Intermediate Prognosis
Nonseminoma:
Testis/retroperitoneal primary, and
No nonpulmonary visceral metastases, and
Intermediate markers–any of:
AFP 1,000  ng/mL or more and 10,000 ng/mL  or less, or
Beta-hCG 5,000 IU/L or more  and 50,000 IU/L or less, or
LDH 1.5 or more × N* and less than 10 × N*
*[
Note: N  indicates the upper limit of normal for the LDH assay.
]
A total of 13% to 28% of nonseminomas are intermediate prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 75%; the 5-year survival rate is 80%–83%.
Seminoma:
Any primary site, and
Nonpulmonary visceral metastases, and
Normal AFP, any beta-hCG, any LDH
A total of 10% of seminomas are intermediate prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 67%; the 5-year survival rate is 72%.
Poor Prognosis
Nonseminoma:
Mediastinal primary, or
Nonpulmonary visceral metastases, or
For markers–any of:
AFP more than 10,000 ng/mL, or
Beta-hCG more than 50,000 IU/mL (10,000 ng/mL), or
LDH more than 10 × the upper limit of normal
A total of 16% to 26% of nonseminomas are poor prognosis. The 5-year PFS rate is 41%; the 5-year survival rate is 71%.
Seminoma:
No patients are classified as poor prognosis.

Treatment of Stage 0 Testicular Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Among men diagnosed with an invasive testicular germ cell tumor (stages I–III), 0.5% to 1.0% will present with tumors in both testes, and another 1% to 2% will develop a subsequent invasive germ cell tumor in the contralateral testis.[
1
-
3
]  Death from metachronous contralateral germ cell tumors is rare. One study of 29,515 U.S. men with testicular germ cell tumors who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2001 reported that 287 men developed a metachronous contralateral testis cancer, one of whom died.[
3
] As a result, there is limited rationale for performing biopsies to search for testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in men diagnosed with invasive testicular cancer.
If biopsies of the contralateral testis are performed  in men with testicular cancer, 4% to 8% of men will be found to have contralateral TIN. The treatment is typically radiation therapy (18 Gy–20 Gy), surveillance, or orchiectomy. Men undergoing radiation therapy or orchiectomy will subsequently be sterile. Men undergoing orchiectomy will also be hypogonadal as will many men undergoing radiation therapy.[
4
]
Treatment options:
Radiation therapy for TIN is associated with a low risk of relapse. One study of 122 patients with TIN treated with 18 Gy to 20 Gy  of external-beam radiation therapy reported three relapses (2.5%).[
4
]
Surveillance with annual transscrotal ultrasonography and monthly self-examinations are also options for men with TIN. Approximately one-half of the TIN cases will progress to invasive germ cell tumors with a median time to progression of roughly 3 years.[
4
]
Chemotherapy does not appear to be very effective at preventing the development of invasive testicular germ cell tumors. One series reported progression to invasive cancers in 10 of 30 patients treated with two cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP); the same progression was found in 7 of 51 patients  treated with three or more cycles of BEP; 2 of 15 patients treated with carboplatin also showed a progression to invasive cancers.[

Current Clinical Trials
Stage I Seminoma
Patients with stage I seminomas have a cure rate that approaches 100%, regardless of whether  postorchiectomy adjuvant therapy is given.
Treatment options:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy with no retroperitoneal node radiation therapy followed
by chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans
of the abdomen and pelvis (surveillance).  These studies are typically performed every 4 months for the first 3 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for an additional 4 years.[
1
]
Results of multiple clinical series, including more than 1,200
patients with stage I seminoma managed by postorchiectomy surveillance, have
been reported.[
2
-
9
]  The overall 10-year tumor recurrence rate is 15% to 20%, and nearly
all patients whose disease recurred were cured by radiation therapy or
chemotherapy.  Thus, the overall cure rate is indistinguishable from that
achieved with adjuvant radiation therapy or carboplatin chemotherapy. Relapses after 5 years are unusual but can occur in as many as 4% of patients.[
6
]  Independent risk factors for relapse include tumor size greater than 4 cm and invasion of the rete testis.[
2
]  The 5-year risk of relapse is about 10% without either risk factor, 16% with one risk factor, and 32% with both risk factors.
Treatment options when surveillance is not chosen:
The surveillance-after-orchiectomy treatment option  is associated with a cure rate that approaches 100%.  Relapses requiring additional therapy occur in about 15% of patients who are treated with the  surveillance treatment option.  The surveillance strategy avoids the need for radiation or chemotherapy in most patients.  However, some patients are uncomfortable with surveillance only and wish to minimize the risk of relapse.  For such patients, one of the following options may be used; however, there is controversy about which strategy is preferred:[
10
]
Removal of the testicle via radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by radiation
therapy is an approach that is associated with a 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of 95% to 96% and a 5-year disease-specific survival rate over 99% in multiple large series and randomized controlled trials.[
11
-
17
]
One of the following two treatment fields is typically used: a para-aortic strip covering the retroperitoneal nodes or a dog-leg field that includes the ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes as well as the retroperitoneum. The dose ranges from 20 Gy to 26 Gy. Relapse rates and toxic effects were studied in a randomized
comparison (MRC-TE10) of para-aortic radiation therapy alone versus para-aortic radiation
therapy with an added ipsilateral iliac lymph node field.[
13
,
18
]   The 5-year
RFS rates were virtually identical (96.1% for patients who were treated with the para-aortic strip vs. 96.2% for patients who were treated by a dog-leg field) as
were overall survival (OS) rates (one death from seminoma occurred in the para-aortic radiation therapy arm).  Pelvic RFS
rates were 98.2% versus 100%; the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in
pelvic RFS  rates was 0% to 3.7%.  A statistically
significant increase was observed in leukopenia and diarrhea associated with the ipsilateral
iliac radiation therapy.
In a randomized trial (MRC-TE18), a radiation dose of  20 Gy over 10 daily fractions was clinically equivalent to 30 Gy over 15 fractions after a median follow-up of 7 years in both  RFS and OS.  Patients reported that  lethargy and their ability to perform normal work were better in the lower-dose regimen.[

Level of evidence A1
]
Radiation therapy for clinical stage I testicular seminoma is no longer favored because of evidence that this treatment is associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies and an increased risk of death from secondary malignancies. An analysis of data from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)  Program registries in the United States between the years 1973 and 2001 indicated that among 7,179 men receiving radiation therapy for stage I seminoma, 246 had an increased risk of death from secondary cancers compared with the general population (standardized mortality ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.67–2.14).[
19
] An international study of more than 40,000 testicular cancer survivors reported that among the 7,885 survivors who had been followed for 20 to 29 years, radiation therapy was associated with a doubling of the risk of secondary cancers (relative risk,  2.0; 95% CI, 1.8–2.3).[
20
]
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by either one or two doses of carboplatin adjuvant therapy.
In a large, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial (
MRC-TE19
[NCT00003014]), 1,477 men with stage I seminomas were assigned to undergo  para-aortic (or dog-leg field, if clinically indicated) radiation therapy or to receive  a single dose of carboplatin (concentration-versus-time or area-under-the-curve [AUC]  × 7) after radical inguinal orchiectomy study participants were followed up for a median of 6.5 years.[
18
,
21
] The RFS rate at 5 years was 94.7% in the carboplatin arm and 96.0% in the radiation therapy arm (1.3% difference; 90% CI, 0.7%–3.5%; hazard ratio [HR],  1.25 [nonsignificant trend in favor of radiation therapy]; 90% CI, 0.83–1.89).  The one death from seminoma occurred in the radiation therapy arm.  There was a reduced number of contralateral testicular germ cell tumors in the carboplatin arm:  2 versus 15 (HR,  0.22; 95% CI, 0.05–0.95;
P
= .03).[
21
][
Level of evidence A1
]  In this trial, AUC dosing was based on radioisotope measurement of glomerular filtration rate; dosing based on calculations of creatinine clearance is not equivalent, has not been validated in this setting, and is discouraged.
Phase II studies, including several with more than  4 years median follow-up, have consistently reported lower relapse rates (0%–3.3%) when two doses of carboplatin were administered either 3 or 4 weeks apart and  dosed either at 400 mg/m
2
or at an AUC of 7.[
3
,

,
22
-
26
]  Administration of two doses of carboplatin has never been compared with a single dose nor with radiation therapy in a randomized trial.
Stage I Nonseminoma
Stage I nonseminoma is highly curable (>99%).  Orchiectomy alone will cure about 70% of patients, but the remaining 30% will relapse and require additional treatment.  The relapses are highly curable, and postorchiectomy surveillance is a standard treatment option, but some physicians and patients prefer to reduce the risk of relapse by having the patient undergo either a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) or one or two cycles of chemotherapy.  Each of these three approaches has unique advantages and disadvantages, and none has been shown to result in longer survival or superior quality of life.
Treatment options:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by a regular and frequent surveillance schedule.
Typically, patients are seen monthly during the first year, every 2 months during the second year, every 3 months during the third year, every 4 months during the fourth year, every 6 months during the fifth year, and annually for the subsequent 5 years.[
27
-
29
]  At each visit, the history is reviewed, a physical examination is given, determination of serum markers are performed, and a chest x-ray is obtained (sometimes at alternating visits).  An additional key aspect of surveillance involves abdominal or abdominopelvic CT scans, but the preferred frequency of such scans is controversial.
A randomized controlled trial (
MRC-TE08
[NCT00003420]) compared a schedule that used only two scans at 3 months and 12 months with a schedule that used five scans at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months.[
30
]  With over 400 randomly assigned patients and a median follow-up of 40 months, all relapsing patients had either good- or intermediate-risk disease, and there were no differences in the stage or extent of disease at relapse between the two arms.  No deaths were reported.  Nonetheless, some organizations recommend CT scans every 3 to 4 months during the first 3 years of follow-up and continuing but less-frequent CT scans thereafter.  While this study would appear to indicate that scans at 3 and 12 months are adequate during the first year, longer follow-up will be needed to assess whether discontinuing scans after 12 months is safe.[
30
][
Level of evidence A1
] With regard to chest imaging, disease recurrence is rarely detected by chest x-ray alone, so chest x-ray may play little or no role in routine surveillance but is nonetheless included in the mainstream surveillance schedules.[
27
]
The need for long-term follow-up has not been adequately investigated.  Surveillance series with long follow-up times have reported that fewer than 1% of clinical stage I patients relapse after 5 years.[
31
,
32
]  Late relapses often occur in the retroperitoneum when they do occur.  Therefore, some schedules discontinue CT scans after 12 months, while others recommend at least annual scans for 10 years.
The option of a radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by a regular and frequent surveillance schedule should be considered only if:
CT scan and serum markers are negative.
The patient accepts the need for and commits to frequent surveillance visits. Children are adequately followed by alpha-fetoprotein serum markers, chest x-rays, and clinical examination.[
33
]
The physician accepts responsibility for seeing that a follow-up schedule is maintained as noted.
Removal of the testicle through the groin followed (in adults) by
RPLND.
A nerve-sparing RPLND  that preserves ejaculation in virtually every patient has
been described in clinical stage I patients and appears to be as effective as
the standard RPLND.[
34
-
36
]  Surgery should be followed by monthly
determination of serum markers and chest x-rays for the first year and every-other-month determinations for the second year.[
27
]
Men undergoing RPLND, who are found to have pathological stage I disease, have a roughly 10% risk of relapsing subsequently, whereas men with pathological stage II disease (i.e.,  those who are found to have lymph node metastases at RPLND) have as much as a 50% risk of relapse without further treatment.[
37
] Two cycles of post-RPLND chemotherapy using either bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) or etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) lowers the risk of relapse in men with pathological stage II disease to about 1%.[
38
,
39
]  Most patients in studies of RPLND underwent the operation at a center of excellence with a urological surgeon who had performed hundreds of such operations.  The ability of less-experienced urologists to achieve similar results is unknown.
In patients with pathological stage
I disease after RPLND, the presence of lymphatic or venous invasion or a predominance of embryonal carcinoma in the
primary tumor appears to predict for relapse.[
40
-
42
] In a large, Testicular Cancer
Intergroup Study, the relapse rate among men with pathological stage I disease was 19% in those with vascular invasion
versus 6% in those without vascular invasion.  One study reported that the relapse rate for men with pathological stage I disease was 21.2% (18 of 85 men relapsed), if their tumors were predominantly embryonal carcinoma and 29% if there was a predominance of embryonal carcinoma plus lymphovascular invasion versus 3% (5 of 141 men relapsed), if there was not a predominance of embryonal carcinoma.[
40
,
41
]
Among pathological stage II patients, the relapse rate was 32% among men with embryonal carcinoma-predominant tumors compared with 15.6% in the other stage II patients.  The risk of metastatic disease (i.e., either pathological stage II disease or relapsed pathological stage I disease) in men with tumors showing a predominance of embryonal carcinoma plus lymphovascular invasion was 62% compared with 16% in men with neither risk factor.
These data have shown that high-risk patients undergoing RPLND have a substantial risk of subsequently receiving chemotherapy.  Data from one institution have shown that about one-half of men with stage I pure embryonal carcinoma undergoing RPLND will subsequently receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy.[
43
]
Retroperitoneal dissection of
lymph nodes is not helpful in the management of children, and potential
morbidity of the surgery is not justified by the information obtained.[
33
]  In
men who have undergone RPLND,  chemotherapy is employed immediately on first evidence of recurrence.
Adjuvant
therapy consisting of one or two courses of BEP chemotherapy in patients with clinical stage I disease.
A randomized controlled trial compared a single cycle of BEP chemotherapy with RPLND in 382 patients.  The 2-year recurrence-free survival  rates were 99.5% with chemotherapy versus 91.9% with RPLND (absolute difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 3.1%–12.1%).  There were no treatment-related or cancer-specific deaths in either arm of the study.[
44
]
A Swedish and Norwegian study reported results of a risk-adapted therapy protocol in which patients with nonseminomas with lymphovascular invasion underwent postorchiectomy chemotherapy with one or two cycles of BEP chemotherapy, while those without lymphovascular invasion underwent either surveillance or a single cycle of BEP.[
45
]  The study included 745 patients and, with a median follow-up of 4.7 years and 2-year follow-up of 89% of patients, there were no deaths from testicular cancer, although one patient died of a stroke immediately after completing chemotherapy for relapsed disease.  OS was 98.9% and cause-specific survival was 99.9%.  Both of these studies were conducted at community-based hospitals and demonstrated that postorchiectomy chemotherapy could be delivered at a regional or national level without depending on centers of excellence.
Several phase II studies and case series reporting results after two cycles of BEP in patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease have identified relapse rates ranging from 0% to 4% (average, 2.4%).[
46
]  Less than 1% of patients in these series died of testicular cancer. When compared with RPLND or surveillance, chemotherapy produces the lower relapse rate and a comparable disease-specific survival rate. However, it is unknown whether a brief course of chemotherapy results in late toxic effects or an increased risk of late relapse.  Longer follow-up is awaited.
There is no consensus about the optimal management of men with stage I nonseminomas, but each of the three strategies above produces a disease-specific survival rate of about 99%.  Some clinicians have advocated a risk-adapted approach such that patients with low-risk disease undergo surveillance, while others undergo either RPLND or chemotherapy.  The goal of this approach is to minimize the side effects of treatment, but risk-adapted therapy has never been demonstrated to result in better outcomes.  Some experts prefer a surveillance strategy generally so as to minimize unnecessary treatment. Others prefer RPLND to obtain more accurate staging, to reduce the risk of needing chemotherapy (and, therefore, chemotherapy's  side effects and toxicity) and to, theoretically, reduce the risk of late relapse.  At the same time, many experts reject RPLND as insufficiently effective at lowering relapse rates and prefer chemotherapy.  Surveillance and chemotherapy have been tested at the regional and national level with excellent results, however, the limited data concerning RPLND in patients with regional disease have shown higher than expected in-field relapse rates but no deaths.[

With regard to risk stratification, data suggest that relapse rates are higher in patients with histological evidence
of lymphatic or venous invasion or a predominance of embryonal carcinoma.[

Stage II Seminoma
Stage II seminoma is divided into bulky and nonbulky disease for treatment
planning and expression of prognosis.  Bulky disease is generally defined as
tumors larger than 5 cm on a computed tomography (CT) scan (i.e., stage IIC disease). Nonbulky disease can be further subdivided into stage IIA, meaning no lymph node mass larger than 2 cm, and stage IIB, meaning a lymph node mass between 2 cm and 5 cm.
Nonbulky stage II disease has a cure rate of about  90% to 95%  with radiation
therapy alone at doses of 30 Gy to 36 Gy.[

] Most patients with relapsed disease can be cured with chemotherapy.  Cure rates are slightly higher for patients with stage IIA disease than for those with IIB disease, but the figures are within the range given above.  Risk factors for relapse include multiple enlarged nodes.
Results for patients with stage IIC disease have been less favorable.  For example, one institution reported that among patients with stage IIC disease, 9 of 16 (56%) had a relapse following radiation therapy, compared with only 1 of 23 patients (4%) treated with chemotherapy.[
3
]  A pooled analysis of earlier studies reported a 65% relapse-free survival (RFS) rate for men receiving radiation therapy for bulky stage II seminoma.[
5
] Unfortunately, only sparse contemporary data are available on the use of radiation therapy to treat bulky stage II seminomas, and there are no randomized trials comparing radiation therapy with chemotherapy in this population.  Combination
chemotherapy with cisplatin is effective therapy in patients with bulky
stage II seminomas  and has become the most widely accepted treatment option.[

,

]
Residual radiological abnormalities are common at the
completion of chemotherapy.  Many abnormalities gradually regress during a period
of months.  Some clinicians advocate empiric attempts to resect residual masses 3 cm or larger, while others advocate close surveillance, with intervention only if the residual mass increases in size.  Postchemotherapy radiation therapy is no longer favored, in part because of a retrospective
study of a consecutive series  of 174 patients with seminoma and postchemotherapy residual
disease seen at ten treatment centers. The study reported that empiric radiation was not associated with
any medically significant improvement in progression-free survival after
completion of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.[

Level of evidence C2
]
In some series, surgical resection of specific masses has yielded a
significant number of patients with residual seminoma who require additional therapy.[
5
] 
Nevertheless, other reports indicate that the size of the residual mass does not
correlate well with active residual disease, most residual masses do not grow,
and frequent marker and CT scan evaluation is a viable option even when the
residual mass is 3 cm or larger.[
6
]
A more recent approach has been to obtain a fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) scan following chemotherapy.  A study of 56 patients reported that positron emission tomography (PET) scans correctly identified eight of ten patients with residual seminoma with no false positives among the 46 patients with benign masses.[
8
]  In this study, PET scans were 100% accurate in patients with residual masses greater than 3 cm in greatest diameter whereas residual malignant masses less than 3 cm were only detected in one of three men.  This study provides support for observing men with residual 18F-FDG PET-negative masses greater than 3 cm and for performing a biopsy or resection of any 18F-FDG PET-positive mass.
Treatment options for patients with nonbulky tumors:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by
radiation therapy to the retroperitoneal and ipsilateral pelvic lymph nodes.  Prophylactic radiation therapy to the mediastinum is contraindicated because of  cardiovascular toxic effects, and prophylactic radiation to the supraclavicular fossa is not standard.  Radiation therapy to inguinal nodes is not standard unless there has been
some damage to the scrotum to put inguinal lymph nodes at risk.
Systemic chemotherapy using three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin  (BEP) or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin.  This approach is generally reserved for stage IIA and IIB patients who have multiple areas of adenopathy in the retroperitoneum or a contraindication to radiation therapy such as a horseshoe or pelvic kidney, or inflammatory bowel disease.[

,

-
11
]
Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) may be performed in those rare men who have contraindications to radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Treatment options for patients with bulky tumors:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by
combination chemotherapy (with a cisplatin-based regimen) using three cycles of BEP or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin.[
7
,
9
-
11
]
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by radiation therapy to
the abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes.  The recurrence rate is higher after
radiation therapy for men with bulky stage II tumors than radiation therapy for nonbulky tumors,
leading some authors to recommend primary chemotherapy for patients with bulky
disease (≥5 cm–10 cm).[
3
,
12
]
Stage II Nonseminoma
Stage II nonseminoma is highly curable (>95%). Men with stage II disease and persistently elevated serum tumor markers are generally treated as having stage III disease and receive chemotherapy.  For men with normal markers after orchiectomy, nonseminomas are divided into stages IIA, IIB, and IIC for treatment purposes.  In general, stage IIA patients undergo RPLND to confirm the staging.  As many as 40% of clinical stage IIA patients will have benign findings at RPLND and will be restaged as having pathological stage I disease.[
13
]  RPLND can thus prevent a significant number of patients with clinical stage IIA  disease from receiving unnecessary chemotherapy.
In contrast, patients with stage IIB and IIC nonseminoma are usually treated with systemic chemotherapy for disseminated disease because these patients have a higher relapse rate after RPLND.  One study reported that by limiting RPLND to patients with earlier stage II disease and normal serum tumor markers, 5-year RFS rates increased from 78% to 100% after RPLND, while RFS did not change significantly among stage II patients receiving chemotherapy (100% vs. 98%).[
14
]  However, the question of whether to treat patients with stage II nonseminoma germ cell tumors with RPLND or chemotherapy has never been subjected to a randomized trial.
Treatment options:
For patients with clinical stage II disease and normal postorchiectomy serum tumor markers, radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by removal of retroperitoneal lymph
nodes with or without fertility-preserving RPLND followed by monthly checkups,
which include physical examination, chest x-ray, and serum marker tests (e.g., alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase).
This
option of surgery and careful follow-up, reserving chemotherapy for relapse, is
particularly attractive for patients who have pathological stage I or IIA disease (fewer than six positive nodes at
RPLND, none of which are larger than 2
cm in diameter).  Such
patients appear to have a relapse rate of about 10% if followed
without chemotherapy, and most are curable with standard chemotherapy if their disease relapses.[
13
,
15
]  Presence of lymphatic or venous invasion and the proportion of the primary tumor that is embryonal carcinoma also help to
predict which patients may have disease relapse.[
16
-
18
]   In one study, the relapse rate in men with pathological stage I disease was 3% in men with nonembryonal carcinoma-predominant tumors, 21% in men with embryonal carcinoma-predominant tumors, and 31% in those with embryonal carcinoma-predominant tumors and lymphovascular invasion.[
17
,
18
] In children, surgical resection of retroperitoneal nodes is generally not
performed.  Patients with clinical stage II disease are given chemotherapy.[
19
]
For patients with clinical and pathological stage II disease and normal postorchiectomy serum tumor markers, radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by removal of retroperitoneal lymph
nodes followed by two cycles of chemotherapy (i.e., etoposide and cisplatin either with or without bleomycin) and then monthly checkups.
This option of RPLND plus adjuvant chemotherapy applies to patients who have pathologically confirmed lymph node metastases as a result of RPLND and is most attractive for patients with pathological stage IIB or IIC disease.  The results of a
large study comparing the first treatment option with the second treatment option  were published.[
20
]  Two courses of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy (either cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin [PVB] or
vinblastine, dactinomycin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin [VAB VI])
prevented a relapse in  more than 95% of patients.  A 49% relapse
rate was seen in patients assigned to observation; however, most of these patients
could be effectively treated, and no significant differences were found in overall survival.  The study concluded that adjuvant
therapy will most often prevent relapse in patients treated with optimal surgery, follow-up, and
chemotherapy. However, observation with chemotherapy only for relapse will lead to a similar cure
rate.
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy with subsequent surgery
 to remove any residual masses (if present) followed by monthly checkups.[
13
]
This
option is useful for patients with elevated serum tumor markers and/or clinical stage IIB or IIC disease.  The combination of chemotherapy plus resection of residual masses in these patients results in cure in more than  95% of patients.[
14
,
21
]
Chemotherapy regimens include:
BEP:  Bleomycin plus etoposide plus cisplatin for three courses.[
22
,
23
]  A  modified
regimen has been used in children.[
19
]
EP:  Etoposide plus cisplatin for four  courses in patients with a good prognosis.[
24
]
A randomized study has shown that bleomycin is an essential component of the
BEP regimen when only three courses are administered.[
25
]
Other regimens that appear to produce similar survival outcomes but are no longer considered standard include:
PVB:  Cisplatin plus vinblastine plus bleomycin.
VAB VI:  Vinblastine plus dactinomycin plus bleomycin plus cyclophosphamide plus
cisplatin.[
26
]
VPV:  Vinblastine plus cisplatin plus etoposide.[
27
]
In a randomized comparison of PVB versus BEP,  equivalent anticancer
activity was seen but with less toxic effects with the use of BEP.[
20
,
28
]
If these patients do not achieve a complete response with chemotherapy, surgical
removal of residual masses should be performed.  The timing of such surgery
requires clinical judgment but would occur most often after three  or four  cycles of
combination chemotherapy and normalization or stabilization of serum markers.  The presence of persistently elevated markers is not a contraindication to resection of residual masses, but patients with rising markers at the end of chemotherapy are generally treated with salvage chemotherapy.  Despite numerous studies, no sufficiently accurate predictors of the histology of residual masses have been validated.  Therefore, the standard of care is to resect all residual masses
apparent on scans in patients who have normal or stable markers after responding to
chemotherapy.  The presence of persistent
nonseminomatous germ-cell malignant elements in the resected specimen is a poor prognostic sign and is often a trigger for additional chemotherapy. However, men with only microscopic residual cancer have a much more favorable prognosis than men with more substantial residual disease.[
29
,
30
]  Identifying the  patients who benefit from additional chemotherapy is not possible from existing data.
In some cases, chemotherapy is
initiated before orchiectomy because of life-threatening metastatic disease. 
When this is done, orchiectomy after initiation or completion of
chemotherapy is advisable to remove the primary tumor.  There is a
higher incidence (approximately 50%) of residual cancer in the testicle than in
remaining radiographically detectable retroperitoneal masses after platinum-based chemotherapy.[

Current Clinical Trials
Stage III seminoma and nonseminomas are usually curable but have different  criteria for estimating prognosis.
Patients with disseminated seminomas can be divided into good-risk and intermediate-risk groups based on whether nonpulmonary visceral metastases are present.  Patients with good-risk disease (i.e., those with metastases only to lymph nodes and/or lungs) have 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall  survival (OS) rates of 82% and 86%, respectively. Patients  with intermediate-risk seminoma have 5-year PFS and OS rates of 67% and 72%, respectively.[
1
]
Patients with disseminated nonseminomas can be divided into good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups based on whether  nonpulmonary visceral metastases are present, the site of the primary tumor (i.e., mediastinal vs. either gonadal or retroperitoneal), and the level of serum tumor markers.[
1
]
Poor-risk:  Men with mediastinal primary tumors, nonpulmonary visceral metastases, or very highly elevated serum tumor markers  are considered to be at poor risk. For more information, see the
Stage Information for Testicular Cancer
section.
Intermediate-risk: Men with intermediate tumor markers levels are considered to be at intermediate risk.
Good-risk: Men with good-risk disease have a testis or retroperitoneal primary tumor, metastases limited to lymph nodes and/or lungs, and tumor markers that are in the good-risk range.
In the 1997 analysis that established these risk groups, the 5-year OS rates were 92%, 80% and 48% in the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups, respectively. The PFS rates were 89%, 75% and 41% in the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups, respectively.  However, a 2006 pooled analysis of chemotherapy trials reported improved outcomes compared with the 1997 paper:  survival rates in the good-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups were 94%, 83%, and 71%, respectively.[

Clinical Trials of Chemotherapy for Disseminated Testis and Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors
Four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy as a standard-of-care treatment option for patients with metastatic testicular germ cell tumors was established by a randomized trial showing that it produced similar outcomes with fewer toxic effects in comparison with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB).[
3
] Two randomized trials comparing four  courses of BEP with four  courses of etoposide plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin (VIP) showed
similar OS and time-to-treatment failure for the two regimens in
patients with intermediate- and poor-risk advanced disseminated germ cell tumors who had not received prior
chemotherapy.[
4
-
6
][
Level of evidence A1
]  Hematologic toxic effects were
substantially worse with the VIP regimen.
For good-risk patients, two randomized trials compared three versus four cycles of BEP and reported no significant benefit from longer treatment in that population.[
7
-
9
]
Numerous attempts have been made to develop a regimen superior to BEP for men with poor-prognosis germ cell tumors but none have been successful.  Most recently, four cycles of BEP was compared with two cycles of BEP followed by two cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin, but there was no difference in survival between the two arms.[
10
]  Earlier trials of higher dose cisplatin or long-term maintenance chemotherapy were similarly disappointing.
For patients with good-risk disease, the goal of clinical trials has been to minimize the toxic effects of  treatment  without sacrificing the therapeutic effectiveness.  As noted above, no difference in outcome was seen when comparing three versus four cycles of BEP chemotherapy.  However, attempts to eliminate bleomycin produced more ambiguous and usually disappointing results.  A randomized controlled trial comparing three cycles of BEP with three cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) reported lower OS rates (95% vs. 86%,
P
= .01) in the EP arm.[
11
]  Similarly, when three cycles of BEP was compared with four cycles of EP in a randomized trial in more than  260 patients, there were 6 relapses and 5 deaths in the bleomycin arm compared with 14 relapses and 12 deaths in the EP arm, but these differences were not statistically significant.[
12
]  Several other studies have compared bleomycin-containing regimens to etoposide and cisplatin and in every trial, the trend in survival has favored the bleomycin arm, but the differences have not usually been statistically significant.[
13
-
15
] These results have led to some controversy as to whether three cycles of BEP is superior to four cycles of EP.
Special Considerations During Chemotherapy
In most patients, an orchiectomy is performed before starting chemotherapy. If the diagnosis has been made by biopsy of a metastatic site (or on the basis of highly elevated serum tumor markers and radiological imaging consistent with an advanced-stage germ cell tumor) and chemotherapy has been initiated, subsequent orchiectomy is generally performed because chemotherapy may not eradicate the primary tumor. Case reports illustrate that viable tumor has been found on postchemotherapy orchiectomy despite complete response of metastatic lesions.[
16
]
Some retrospective data suggest that the experience of the treating institution
may impact the outcome of patients with stage III nonseminoma.  Data from 380 patients
treated from 1990 to 1994 on the same study protocol at 49 institutions in the
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Medical
Research Council were analyzed.[
17
]  Overall, the 2-year survival rate for the 55
patients treated at institutions that entered fewer than five patients onto the
protocol was 62% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48%–75%) versus 77% (95% CI, 72%–81%) in the
institutions that entered five or more patients onto the protocol.
Similarly, a population-based study of testis cancer in Japan in the 1990s reported a significant association between survival and the number of testis cancer patients treated.  The relative 5-year survival rate was 98.8% at high-volume hospitals compared with 79.7% at low-volume hospitals.  After adjusting for stage and age, the hazard ratio for death in a high-volume hospital was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.025–0.495).[
18
] Several other studies have reported similar findings.[
19
-
21
] As in any
nonrandomized study design, patient selection factors and factors leading
patients to choose treatment at one center versus  another can make interpretation
of these results difficult.
Many patients with poor-risk, nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors who
have a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level higher than 50,000
IU/mL at the initiation of cisplatin-based therapy
(BEP or PVB) will still have an elevated beta-hCG level at the completion of
therapy, showing an initial rapid decrease in beta-hCG followed by a plateau.[
22
] 
In the absence of other signs of progressing disease, monthly evaluation with
initiation of salvage therapy, if and when there is serologic progression, may be
appropriate.  Many patients, however, will remain disease free without further
therapy.[
22

Level of evidence C3
]
Residual Masses After Chemotherapy in Men With Seminomas
Residual radiological abnormalities are common at the completion of chemotherapy. 
Such masses are not treated unless they grow or are histopathologically shown to contain viable cancer.   In a combined retrospective consecutive series of 174 seminoma
patients with postchemotherapy residual disease seen at ten treatment centers,
empiric radiation was not associated with any medically significant improvement
in PFS  after completion of platinum-based combination
chemotherapy.[
23
][
Level of evidence C2
]  In some series, surgical
resection of specific masses has yielded a significant number of patients with residual
seminoma that require additional therapy.[
24
] Larger masses are more likely to harbor viable cancer, but there is no size criteria with high sensitivity and specificity.  Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scans have been shown to be helpful in identifying patients who harbor viable cancers, but the false-positive rate is substantial in some series.[
25
-
27
]  The strength of positron emission tomography (PET) scans in residual seminoma masses is that they have a very high sensitivity and a low false-negative rate.  Thus, for men with residual masses for whom resection is being planned, a negative PET scan provides evidence that surgery is not necessary.
Although larger residual masses are more likely to harbor viable seminoma, the size of the residual mass is of limited prognostic value.[
24
-
26
] Most residual masses do not grow, and regular marker and computed tomography (CT) scan evaluation is a viable
management option for large or small masses.[
28
] 
An alternative approach is to operate on larger masses, to resect them when possible, and to perform biopsies of unresectable masses.  Postchemotherapy masses are often difficult or impossible to resect because of a dense desmoplastic reaction.  Historically, such surgery has been characterized by a high rate of complications or additional procedures such as nephrectomy or arterial or venous grafting.[
29
]
Residual Masses After Chemotherapy in Men With Nonseminomas
Residual masses following chemotherapy in men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors often contain viable cancer or teratoma,  and the standard of care is to resect all such masses when possible. However, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating this issue.  Instead, the practice is based on the fact that viable neoplasm is often found at surgery in these patients, and the presumption is that such tumors would progress if not resected.  If serum tumor markers are rising, salvage chemotherapy is usually given, but stable or slowly declining tumor markers are not a contraindication to resection of residual masses.
Case series of men undergoing postchemotherapy resections have reported that roughly 10% will have viable germ cell cancer, 45% will have teratomas, and 45% will have no viable tumors.[
30
]  Numerous attempts have been made to identify the patients who need surgery and the patients who can be safely observed.  Variables predictive of finding only necrosis or fibrosis at surgery include the following:[
31
]
Absence of any teratoma in the primary tumor.
Normal prechemotherapy serum alpha-fetoprotein, beta-hCG, and lactase dehydrogenase.
A small, residual mass.
A  large diminishment in mass size during chemotherapy.
However, only a small proportion of men have favorable enough features to have less than a 10% chance of having viable neoplasm in their residual masses, and thus the utility of current models has been questioned.[
24
,
32
]
When multiple sites of residual disease are present, all residual masses are generally resected.  If it is not surgically feasible, resection is generally not performed.  Some patients  may have discordant pathological findings (e.g., fibrosis/necrosis,      
teratoma, or carcinoma) in residual masses in the abdomen versus the            
chest. Some medical centers  perform simultaneous retroperitoneal      
and thoracic operations to remove residual masses,[
28
,
33
]  but most do not.   Although
the agreement among the histologies of residual masses found after chemotherapy
above the diaphragm versus those found below the diaphragm is only moderate (kappa statistic, 0.42),
 some evidence exists that if retroperitoneal resection is performed first,
results can be used to guide decisions about whether to perform a
thoracotomy.[

In a multi-institutional case series of surgery to remove
postchemotherapy residual masses in 159 patients, necrosis only was found at
thoracotomy in about 90% of patients who had necrosis only in their
retroperitoneal masses.  The figure was about 95% if the original testicular
primary tumor had contained no teratomatous elements.  Conversely, the
histology of residual masses at thoracotomy did not predict nearly as well the histology of retroperitoneal masses.[
34
] Nonetheless, some centers continue to support resection of all residual masses, even if necrosis is found in the retroperitoneum.[
35
]
The presence of persistent malignant
elements in the resected specimen is considered by some clinicians to be an indication for additional
chemotherapy.[
36
]  However, there are no prospective trials investigating the benefit of such treatment.  In some cases, chemotherapy is initiated before the
orchiectomy because of life-threatening metastatic disease.  When this is done,
orchiectomy after initiation or completion of chemotherapy is advisable to remove the primary tumor.  A
physiological blood-testis barrier seems to appear, and there is a higher incidence (approximately
50%) of residual cancer in the testicle than in remaining radiographically
detectable retroperitoneal masses after platinum-based chemotherapy.[
16
]  Some
investigators have suggested that in children, 90% of whom have yolk sac
tumors, radiation therapy should be given to residual masses after chemotherapy
rather than surgery.[
37
]
Treatment options for initial treatment for nonseminoma patients with good-risk disease:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by multidrug chemotherapy.[
38
]
Chemotherapy combinations include:
BEP: Bleomycin plus etoposide plus cisplatin for three 21-day cycles.[

,
11
]
EP: Etoposide plus cisplatin for four 21-day cycles.[
13
,
39
,
40
] Four cycles of EP should be considered for men with good-risk metastatic seminoma who have a contraindication to receiving bleomycin.
Treatment options for initial treatment for nonseminoma patients with intermediate- and poor-risk disease:
Radical inguinal orchiectomy followed by multidrug chemotherapy.[
38
]
Chemotherapy combinations include:
BEP:  Bleomycin plus etoposide plus cisplatin.[

]
VIP: Etoposide plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin.[

,
41
] Four cycles of VIP should be considered for patients with intermediate-risk metastatic seminoma who have a contraindication to receiving bleomycin.
Management of residual masses following chemotherapy for patients with seminoma
In
patients with seminoma, the residual masses after chemotherapy are usually fibrotic
but may contain
residual seminoma that requires additional therapy.[
43
,
44
] There are  three standard management strategies:
Observation with no additional treatment or biopsies unless the residual mass(es) increase(s) in size.
Observation of masses smaller than 3 cm and surgical resection of masses larger than 3 cm.
18F-FDG PET scan 2 months after chemotherapy is completed with observation of PET-negative masses and resection of PET-positive masses.
Management of residual masses following chemotherapy for patients with nonseminoma
Patients with residual masses following chemotherapy should have all such masses resected if technically feasible.  If some, but not all, residual masses can be resected, surgery is not usually performed.  The rationale for surgery in this setting is that about half of the masses will contain viable tumor, either teratoma or cancer.

Treatment of Recurrent Testicular Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Deciding on further treatment depends on many factors, including the specific
cancer, previous treatment, site of recurrence, and individual patient
considerations.  Salvage regimens consisting of ifosfamide, cisplatin, and
either etoposide or vinblastine can induce long-term complete responses in 
about 25% of patients with disease that has persisted or recurred
following other cisplatin-based regimens.  Patients who have had an initial
complete response to first-line chemotherapy and those without extensive
disease have the most favorable outcomes.[
1
,
2
]  This regimen is now the standard
initial salvage regimen.[
2
,
3
]  Few, if any, patients with recurrent
nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of extragonadal origin, however,  achieve long-term
disease-free survival (DFS) using vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin if their
disease recurred after they received an initial regimen containing etoposide
and cisplatin.[
2
][
Level of evidence C2
]
High-dose chemotherapy with
autologous marrow transplant has also been used in uncontrolled case series in patients with recurrent disease.[
4
-
11
] However, a randomized controlled trial  comparing conventional doses of salvage chemotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow rescue showed more toxic effects and treatment-related deaths in the high-dose arm without any improvement in response rate or overall survival.[
12
][
Level of evidence A1
]  In some highly selected patients with chemorefractory
disease confined to a single site, surgical resection may yield long-term
DFS.[
13
,
14
]  One case series suggested that a maintenance regimen of daily oral
etoposide (taken 21 days out of 28 days) may benefit patients who achieve a complete
remission after salvage therapy.[
15
]
A special case of late relapse may include  patients who relapse more than 2 years
after achieving complete remission; this population represents less than 5% of
patients who are in complete remission after 2 years.  Results with
chemotherapy are poor in this patient subset, and surgical treatment appears to
be superior, if technically feasible.[
16
]  Teratoma may be
amenable to surgery at relapse, and teratoma also has a better prognosis than carcinoma after late
relapse.  Teratoma is a relatively resistant histological subtype,
so chemotherapy may not be appropriate.
Clinical trials are appropriate and should be considered whenever possible,
including phase I and phase II studies for those patients who do not achieve a complete
remission with induction therapy, or for those who do not achieve a complete remission
following etoposide and cisplatin for their initial relapse,  or for patients who
have a second relapse.[
