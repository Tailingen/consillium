FUSCC Refractory TNBC Umbrella (FUTURE)
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center umbrella study evaluating the efficacy and safety of multiple targeted treatment in patients with refractory metastatic TNBC.The specific grouping of patients' depends on FUSCC 500+ gene panel testing and IHC subtype staining.

DRUG: Pyrotinib with Capecitabine|DRUG: AR inhibitor combined with everolimus(B1) or CDK4/6 inhibitor(B2),or EZH2 inhibitor (B4)|DRUG: anti PD-1 with nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: PARP inhibitor included therapy|DRUG: BLIS with anti-VEGFR included therapy|DRUG: MES with anti-VEGFR included therapy|DRUG: mTOR inhibitor with nab-paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of participants whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the end of study (approximately 3 years)
Disease Control Rate(DOR), Complete remission or partial remission or stable disease (according to RECIST1.1), Baseline through end of study (approximately 3 years)|Progression Free Survival(PFS), time to progressive disease (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the end of study (approximately 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), time to death due to any cause, Randomization to death from any cause, through the end of study (approximately 3 years)
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center,umbrella study evaluating the efficacy and safety of multiple targeted treatment in patients with metastatic TNBC who had disease progression during or following standard treatment with chemotherapy(anthracyclines,taxanes,platinums, vinorelbine,capecitabine,and gemcitabine included).300-400 patients will be screened and eligible participants will enter different treatment arms according to their molecular subtype (IHC staining) and FUSCC 500+ gene panel testing results. These tests would be done on their rebiopsy tumor specimen. Specifically, as to TNBC molecular subtyping,FUSCC data identified the genomic aberrations that drive each TNBC subtype by applying an integrative analysis combining somatic mutation, copy number aberrations (CNAs) and gene expression profiles, which classified TNBC patients into four subtypes, namely luminal androgen receptor (LAR), immunomodulatory (IM), basal-like immune suppressed (BLIS), and mesenchymal-like (MES). Then, FUSCC conducted a IHC subtyping model to replace complex genomic sequencing, which have been validated in FUSCC cohort.FUSCC 500+ gene panel was developed combining public database(TCGA, METABRIC, 560WES, MSKCC-IMPACT ect.) and FUSCC private TNBC database.New treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment arms may be closed during the course of the study on the basis of ongoing clinical efficacy and safety as well as the current treatments available.
