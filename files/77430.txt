Auranofin and Sirolimus in Treating Participants With Ovarian Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well auranofin and sirolimus work in treating participants with ovarian cancer. Immunosuppressive therapy, such as auranofin and sirolimus, is used to decrease the body?s immune response and may increase blood cell count.
Ovarian Serous Tumor|Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma
DRUG: Auranofin|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Sirolimus
Number of Participants With a Confirmed Tumor Response (Partial Response [PR] or Complete Response [CR] at Least 4 Weeks Apart), The outcome measure is the number of participants with a confirmed tumor response (partial response \[PR\] or complete response \[CR\] at least 4 weeks apart). PR and CR are defined using RECIST 1.1 criteria. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalisation of tumour marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm., 1 year 4 months
Number of Participants With a Confirmed Tumor Response (PR or CR at Least 4 Weeks Apart) in the Subset of Participants That Have Over-expression of Protein Kinase C (PKC) Iota, The outcome measure is the number of participants with a confirmed tumor response (partial response \[PR\] or complete response \[CR\] at least 4 weeks apart) in the subset of participants that have overexpression of PKC iota. PR and CR are defined using RECIST 1.1 criteria. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalisation of tumour marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm., 1 year 4 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who receive the study drug, but then never return for an evaluation will be censored on their last follow-up date. PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Progression is defined using RECIST 1.1 criteria; Progression: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression), Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression), or appearance of new malignant lesions., 1 year 4 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death from any cause. OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier., 1 year 4 months|Number of Participants Experiencing at Least One Grade 3 or Worse Adverse Event (AE), The outcome measure is the number of participants experiencing at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event (AE)., 1 year 4 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of metastatic serous ovarian cancer across all patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of metastatic serous ovarian cancer within patients that have overexpression of PKCiota.

II. To estimate progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events from the combination of auranofin and sirolimus.

CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore whether PKCiota-relevant biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer tumors are associated with treatment response patterns, such as ORR, progression free survival, and overall survival.

OUTLINE:

Participants receive auranofin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and sirolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
