A Prospective Clinical Trial of Colostomy-replacement Combined With Bio-mesh Placement in the Prevention of SSIH
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the safety and effectiveness of stoma reversal combining bio-mesh placement in patients with high risk of stoma site incisional hernia (SSIH). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Whether bio-mesh placement is safe for patients with a high risk of SSIH.
* Whether stoma reversal combining bio-mesh placement is a preventive strategy for patients with high risk of SSIH.
* Whether stoma reversal combining bio-mesh placement will trigger other complications.

Participants who are eligible and are enrolled in this study will receive stoma reversal combining bio-mesh placement surgery. After that, they will be followed up for one year to evaluate the occurrence of SSIH and other complications.
