PEACH TRIAL- Precision Medicine and Adoptive Cellular Therapy
A Phase I open-label, multicenter study, to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of treating children with newly diagnosed DIPG or recurrent neuroblastoma with molecular targeted therapy in combination with adoptive cell therapy (Total tumor mRNA-pulsed autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs) (TTRNA-DCs), Tumor-specific ex vivo expanded autologous lymphocyte transfer (TTRNA-xALT) and Autologous G-CSF mobilized Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)).
Neuroblastoma|Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor-specific ex vivo expanded autologous lymphocyte transfer (TTRNA-xALT)
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To evaluate the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of treating children with molecular targeted therapy in combination with adoptive cellular therapy, 2 years
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To evaluate the overall safety profile of study treatment, 2 years plus 30 days|Number of Participants that are able to have vaccine produced and delivered, To evaluable the feasibility of producing and administering the protocol directed therapy, 2 years|Number of participants with progression free survival (PFS) during study, To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on Progression free survival (PFS), 7 years|Number of participants with overall survival (OS) during study, To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on Overall Survival (OS), 7 years|Determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants using INSS Response Evaluation Criteria for NB and RANO criteria for DIPG, To determine the activity of treatments chosen based on Overall Response Rate (ORR), 2 years
