Loreline Study: Characterization of Long Responders Under Eribuline
There is currently no strict recommendations for the management of patients who have received at least one or two lines of anthracyclines-based chemotherapy and taxane therapy for advanced breast cancer. However, Halaven® can represent a therapeutic alternative at this stage of the disease.

Indeed, since march 2011, Halaven® has been granted Marketing Authorization (MA) for patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, whose disease has progressed after at least two lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease (3rd line). In these patients, the indication for marketing authorization specifies that the previous treatment must have included an anthracycline and a taxane except in patients who can not receive these treatments.

An extension of indication was obtained on 27/06/2014 with a marketing authorization obtained in the treatment of locally advanced or second-line metastatic breast cancer.

According to the Transparency Commission of the High Authority of Health (HAS dated September 23, 2015), Halaven® (Eribulin), administered as monotherapy, in the third line of treatment and beyond, represents a therapeutic option, because it brings an improvement of medical service rendered compared to Capecitabine (XELODA®) and Vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®).

In addition, Halaven® (Eribuline) administrated as monotherapy in second-line of treatment is an alternative to other monotherapies recommended for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic relapsed breast cancer, such as Capecitabine (XELODA®). and Vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®). But, no improvement of medical service rendered has been reported in second line of treatment.

According to these results, it would be interesting to have additional data concerning the use of Halaven® (Eribulin), in the second and third lines, but also in the fourth line.

For this purpose, the investigators propose to perform a study in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed treatment after the first line and beyond.

In this study, the investigators will be particularly interested in "long-responder" patients, that is to say, in objective response or with stability for 6 months or more under Halaven®, in order to better characterize these patients. Patients must have been treated by Halaven between September 2011 and December 2016, to have a sufficient follow-up for the survival data of the patients.

The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed treatment after the first line and beyond.

In this study, the investigators will be particularly interested in "long-responder" patients, that is to say, in objective response or with stability for 6 months or more under Halaven®, in order to better characterize these patients. Patients must have been treated by Halaven between September 2011 (the year of obtaining the MA in the 3rd line of treatment) and December 2016, to have a sufficient follow-up for the survival data of the patients.

The investigators will also focus on patients with liver metastases because there is limited data in this population.
