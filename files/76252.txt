Evaluating the Safety of Shortened Infusion Times for dIfferent Oncological Immunotherapie
This study is an interventional, explorative, prospective study to show whether shortening of infusion times for patients using nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, durvalumab or atezolizumab continues to be associated with an acceptable safety profile.

Infusion times will be gradually shortened if tolerability allowes.
Oncology|Infusion Reaction
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Incidence of infusion related reactions, During or within 30 minutes after the end of the infusion
Plasma levels of the administered mAb, Within 15 minutes before start of the infusion
Satisfaction with shortened infusion time assessed by the VAS, Scale 1-10, 1: not satisfied at all, 10: most satisfied, Directly after infusion in fourth cycle (cycle length ranges from 21-42 days, depending on the specific antibody)
After two cycles with normal infusion times, infusion time will be shortened to 15 mintues en 10 minutes subsequently if no infusion reaction occurs.

Patient satisfaction will be evaluated.
