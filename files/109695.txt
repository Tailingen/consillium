Prostate Cancer IMAGing IN Early Detection (IMAGINED Trial)
The researchers hope to learn if specific types of MRI software and techniques can help improve early prostate cancer detection at time of a MRI-guided prostate biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Restricted Spectrum Imaging-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RSI-MRI)
RSM mapping value, Radiologists will report a standard Prostate Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (PI-RADS) and document the RSM values associated with each lesion. Change in value will be reported from baseline to routine biopsy follow-up., Baseline to approximately 9 months
A phase 2 prospective, interventional, non-randomized clinical trial design to investigate whether Restricted Spectrum Maps (RSM) attained from RSI-MRI (On-Q Prostate) improves PI-RADS accuracy compared to PI-RADS alone for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. Patients who have agreed to undergo an MRI and subsequent prostate needle biopsy will be approached to participate in the trial.

The aims of the study are as follows:

Goal 1. Validate RSI-MRI imaging biomarker performance using a prospective clinical trial.

Goal 2. Calibrate the RSM values across different MRI scanner manufacturers. Goal 3. Translate RSI using a net clinical benefit model.
