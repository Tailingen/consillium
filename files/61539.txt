An Observational Study Examining the Effect of Added MabThera Therapy in Patients With Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This study will examine the effectiveness of MabThera therapy added to a standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients who have received a single prior MabThera plus chemotherapy treatment are eligible. The overall response rate of patients treated for approximately 5 months (as per current label guidelines) will be analysed according to various factors (i.e., age, concurrent treatment, and chromosomal abnormalities).
