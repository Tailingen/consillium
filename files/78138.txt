Group A ;( opioid based multimodal anesthesia) One hundred and twenty pediatric patients will do elective tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy surgery using opioid based multimodal anesthesia.

Group B ;( opioid free pterygopalatine ganglion block based multimodal anesthesia) One hundred and twenty pediatric patients will do elective tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy surgery using opioid free pterygopalatine ganglion block based multimodal anesthesia.

For each patient, intraoperative hemodynamics, additional intraoperative analgesia required, the length of PACU stay, administration of postoperative opioids, administration of postoperative non-opioid analgesics, postoperative (visual analogue score) VAS score, will be recorded.
