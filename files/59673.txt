OPTIMAL>60 / DR. CHOP, Improvement of Therapy of Elderly Patients with CD20+ DLBCL Using Rituximab Optimized and Liposomal Vincristine
The purpose of this study is to improve the outcome of elderly patients with CD20-Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma and to reduce the toxicity of standard used Immuno-Chemotherapy by using an optimised schedule of the monoclonal antibody Rituximab, substituting conventional by Liposomal Vincristine and by a PET-guided reduction of therapy in Combination with Vitamin D Substitution.
CD20+ Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Conventional Vincristine|DRUG: Liposomal Vincristine|DRUG: Ricover-scheme rituximab|DRUG: optimised rituximab-schedule
Progression-free survival, "OPTIMAL\>60 Less Favourable": To test the effects of substitution of conventional by liposomal vincristine and of a 2-week applications of 8x rituximab by an optimised application of 12 x rituximab stratified log rank tests will be performed for each question (stratified for IPI-factors). Proportional hazard models will be used to investigate treatment interaction and to obtain estimates for the single treatment effects (HR) adjusting for the IPI-factors.

"OPTIMAL\>60 Favourable" Grade of neurotoxicity will be estimated and indicated with a 95% confidence interval (CI) separated to each type of vincristine. To investigate the 3-year PFS with 95% CI the Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used., 9 years
for efficacy: CR-rate, PR-rate, rate of primary progressions, relapse rate, EFS and OS; rate and CTC grades of PNP. Prognostic value of the FDG-PET derived imaging biomarkers for lymphoma load: SUV, MTV, TLG., Secondary endpoints: To analyze how (i. e. in which direction) and how often a pre-treatment FDG-PET-based assignment (PET-0) would have affected the assignment of a patient to a different stage, IPI risk group or treatment, respectively. The different FDG-PET derived imaging biomarkers for lymphoma load (SUV, MTV, TLG) will be analyzed for their relationship with CR-rate, PR-rate, rate of primary progressions, relapse rate, EFS, PFS and OS.

To compare the efficacy and side effects of the (post-induction therapy FDG-PET-based) individualised treatment strategy in OPTIMAL\>60 with the fixed (pre-defined) treatment strategy in RICOVER-60.

Rates and grades of polyneuropathy will be determined according to CTC-v4.03. Comparison of the patients without vitamin-D-substitution with patients receiving a vitamin-D-substitution., 9 years
Primary objective of study:

"OPTIMAL\>60 Less Favourable" Patients with less favourable prognosis: To test whether progression-free survival (PFS) can be improved by substituting conventional by liposomal vincristine; To test whether PFS can be improved by 12 optimised applications instead of 8 2-week applications of rituximab.

"OPTIMAL\>60 Favourable": Patients with favourable prognosis: Comparison of neurotoxicity of conventional and liposomal vincristine; Determination of PFS for the treatment strategy of reducing treatment in patients with negative FDG-PET after 4 x R-CHOP/CHLIP-14 (PET-4) and comparison with the corresponding patient population in RICOVER-60.

Comparison of the prognostic value of a pre-treatment FDG-PET (PET-0) with conventional CT/MRT.

Prospective evaluation on the role of (metabolic) tumor volume to confirm or refuse the hypothesis that optimized rituximab should improve the outcome of patients with a high (metabolic) tumor volume more than that of patients with low MTV and to analyse the substitution of conventional vincristine by liposomal. â€¢ Estimation of the vincristine-related neurotoxicity ("OPTIMAL\>60 Less Favourable only, since vincristine related neurotoxicity is primary objective of the study in favourable patients") and other toxicities (all patients).
