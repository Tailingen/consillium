Abdominoperineal Extra-Elevators Rectal Resection for Cancer: Prone Position vs. Supine Position
Prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the prone vs. the supine position of the perineal time of the Miles operation in patients with advanced rectal cancer.

Primary objective:

- Pathological circumferential resection margin

Secondary objectives:

* 5 year oncological outcomes
* Morbimortality rates
* Surgical specimen quality
* Perineal hernia incidence
Rectal Cancer|Abdominoperineal Resection
PROCEDURE: Abdominoperineal extra-elevators rectal resection for low lying rectal cancer
Assessment of the circumferential resection margin, Histopathological report of the circumferential resection margin of the surgical specimen obtained in patients that underwent perineal time of Miles procedure in prone vs supine position., 15-30 days after surgery date
Histopathological quality of surgical specimen, Comparison of the quality of the surgical specimen in terms of integrity of the circumferential resection margin, accidental iatrogenic rupture etc., 15-30 days after
Oncological outcomes, Compare the incidence of local oncological disease, distance metastasis and survival in a 5 year follow up time span., 5 years|Morbidity of the perineal incision., Evaluation the clinical outcome of the perineal wound in terms of infection, dehiscence, perineal hernia etc., 1 day, 60 days ,1 ,2,3,4 and 5 years after surgery
Prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the prone vs. the supine position of the perineal time of the Miles operation in patients with advanced rectal cancer.

Primary objective:

- Pathological circumferential resection margin

Secondary objectives:

* 5 year oncological outcomes
* Morbimortality rates
* Surgical specimen quality
* Perineal hernia incidence
