Hyperfractionated RT With BCNU Versus Conventional RT With BCNU for Supratentorial Malignant Glioma
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy (RT) to 72.0 Gy with BCNU will be compared to conventional radiation therapy to 60.0 Gy with BCNU to determine if hyperfractionated RT can improve the median survival time of adults with supratentorial malignant gliomas.
