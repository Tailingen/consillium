We analyzed clinicopathological data from patients with lymph node-negative gastric cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy at four institutions between 2010 and 2020. The 3-year OS was assessed using landmark analysis. Independent risk factors associated with 3-year OS were identified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
