Lymphedema Treatment in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the result of treatment for neck lymphedema on throat pressure in patients who have received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DEVICE: Flexitouch Plus system
Internal lymphedema measurement, The pressure in the throat will be measured using a device called high-resolution manometry before and after wearing a treatment jacket (Flexitouch plus device)., 2 hours
External lymphedema measurement, Neck circumference measurement will be done using standard tape measure before and after wearing a treatment jacket (Flexitouch plus device)., 2 hours
Lymphedema is a failure of lymphatic system to transfer fluid from the connective tissue to the circulatory system. The lymphedema seen in patients treated for head and neck cancer can be seen externally on the neck and face, as well as internally in the lining of the throat. In this study, the investigators plan to treat the external lymphedema with a device called the Flexitouch Plus, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lymphedema treatment, and to measure the degree of internal lymphedema using a pressure sensor to detect throat muscle pressure before and after the treatment with the Flexitouch Plus device.
