Precision Medicine Applied to the Study of Endometrial Cancer: Application of NGS for Molecular Classification
In recent years, knowledge about cancer biology has expanded significantly. The study of gene expression profiles has revealed the heterogeneous nature and potential reclassification of the various tumor subtypes based on specific genetic alterations. This is of great importance since it allows a therapeutic approach more directed to the intrinsic characteristics of each tumor (precision medicine).

Integrating clinicopathological information with molecular classification could provide new guidelines when approaching patients with EC, both in preoperative assessment and in adjuvant treatment and surveillance.

The application of molecular classification in endometrial carcinomas shows a subgroup of patients with an excellent prognosis, corresponding to the POLEmut subgroup that could be reclassified with eventual therapeutic de-escalation.

The clinical guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial cancer proposed by ESGO/ESTRO/ESP in 2020 recommend the use of this new classification, and warn that clinical management may be modified by the molecular classification in scenarios where adjuvant chemotherapy is considered (high-grade/high-risk disease).

Distribution of Endometrial Cancer Molecular Subtypes Identified by Immunohistochemistry and POLE Sequencing, Proportion of patients in each of the four molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer (POLE-ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, copy-number high) determined using immunohistochemistry for MMR proteins and TP53, and NGS-based sequencing of the POLE gene., At study inclusion (retrospective evaluation of cases from the last 5 years). Units: Percentage of patients per subtype
