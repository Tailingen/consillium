EPOCH Chemotherapy +/- IL-12 for Previously Untreated and EPOCH Plus Rituximab for Previously Treated Patients With AIDS-Associated Lymphoma
The prognosis of AIDS-related Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is poor, especially in the relapsed setting. There is no standard treatment, and the few small studies that have been conducted have reported dismal outcomes. The purpose of this study is to pilot the use of EPOCH plus rituximab in previously treated AIDS-related lymphoma. Clinical endpoints of the study include toxicity and response. Progression-free and overall survival will be measured. Tumors will be evaluated for p53 mutations, p-16, bcl-2 expression, tumor proliferation, c-myc and EBV when possible.
