Non-Invasive, Real-Time Technology for Diagnosis of Cervical Tissue
In general, to determine the sensitivity of light transport to tissue from morphological features of clinical significance.

Determine how specific structural features contribute to light scattering. Investigate light scattering differences in tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells.

Develop and implement quantitative and sensitive methods for measuring morphological properties.

Clinical measurements.
Cervix|Cancer
PROCEDURE: Colposcopy, Spectroscopy, and Biopsy
The objective of this study is to determine whether non-invasive measurements of light transport through tissue can identify pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions., 6 years
Patients undergoing a colposcopy will also have spectroscopy measurements taken and an extra biopsy of suspicious tissue.
