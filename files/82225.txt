First Line Treatment Trial in Multiple Myeloma, Finnish Myeloma Group- Multiple Myeloma 02
The purpose of this study is to determinate the efficacy and safety of the 3-drug induction treatment (RVD; lenalidomide plus bortezomib plus dexamethasone)followed by randomized autologous stem cell mobilization, autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide maintenance. Primary endpoint is the immunophenotypic remission rate.During the randomized mobilization phase two active comparator arms Cyclophosphamide (CY)2g/m2 + Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF) vrs G-CSF will be compared regarding efficacy, costs and safety.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Filgrastim
Immunophenotypic response, Response will be measured by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidelines, and if the response is stringent CR and immunophenotypic remission, those patients will be followed also by allele-spesific oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction assay (ASO-PCR) to find out molecular remission rate., Change from the start of induction treatment at 3 months, change from the start of induction at 6 months, at 9 months, at 12 months, at 16 months, at 20 months, at 24 moths
Progression free survival, From date of inclusion until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause whatever come first assessed up to last patient 2 years on maintenance
Proportion of pts collected with >/= 3 x 10e6/kg CD34+ with </= 2 apheresis after mobilization with CY 2g/m2 + filgrastim (group A) or filgrastim alone (group B), Assessed up to 2 weeks from the start of mobilization
