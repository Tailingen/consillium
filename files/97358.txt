A Study of Tumor-Treating Fields in Combination With Durvalumab and Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in Biliary Tract Cancers
Unresectable BTC represents an area of unmet medical need due to its very aggressive nature, limited treatment options, and poor prognosis. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding TTF to the established regimen of durvalumab plus GemCis for the treatment of patients with previously untreated, unresectable BTC.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment until the date of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)-defined radiological PD or death., Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.
Safety profile, Safety profile is defined as the incidence, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) noted in patients treated with study treatments., Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the rate of best objective response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)., Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of treatment until death due to any cause, Up to 24 months after the enrollment of the last patient.
