Pilot Study of Strength and Balance Training Program for Persons With Oxaliplatin Induced Neuropathy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on strength, balance, and neuropathic symptoms (numbness, tingling, pain, weakness) of a 12 week, bi-weekly, 60 minute, group exercise program designed to improve lower extremity strength and balance with persons with oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy.

OTHER: 12 Week Exercise Program
Number of Screened Patients Who Participate and Complete the Study, To evaluate feasibility, the percentage of patients screened to percentage enrolled in the study and the percentage enrolled to percentage that completes the study will be calculated. Patients who do not complete the study will be contacted to determine why they were unable to complete the study and the reasons will be recorded. How many sessions were attended will also be recorded., 10 Months
Number of Participants Who Experience Side Effects, To evaluate tolerability, at each session, data regarding any participant who was unable to complete the entire session will be recorded along with any side effects that participants report. Participants will also be asked to rate the level of exercise they perform at each session as either a) too easy b) just right c) too challenging., 10 Months|Number of Participants With Measured Improvement, Treatment-effect size will be evaluated by means of changes in muscle strength, balance, and neuropathy from the beginning to completion of the study., 10 Months
