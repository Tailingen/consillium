A Study of Reolysin For Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer
Researchers doing this study want to evaluate the side effects of Reolysin when given together with paclitaxel. As these drugs have not been given together before, 6-9 patients will be treated with paclitaxel plus reolysin to ensure that side effects are tolerable.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Reolysin
Progression free survival, 24 months
Response rate, To investigate additional potential measures of efficacy including Objective response rate, overall survival (OS) and CTC counts., 24 months|Tumour and tissue response of potential molecular factors, Potential molecular factors which may be prognostic or predictive of response by assessment of archival tumour tissue, CTCs, and serial blood samples, 24 months|Number of patients with adverse events, To determine the tolerability and toxicity of reolysin and paclitaxel when given in combination., 24 months
The purpose of the randomized part of this study is to find out if giving Reolysin in combination with paclitaxel can offer better results than standard therapy with paclitaxel.
