Osimertinib With or Without Savolitinib as 1L in de Novo MET+, EGFR+ NSCLC
This is a prospective, pilot, two-arm, randomized, multicenter study exploring the efficacy and safety of osimertinib with or without savolitinib as first-line therapy in patients with de novo MET positive, EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Savolitinib
ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) of the tumor using Investigator assessment as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), 12 weeks after the last patient enrolled
PFS, Progression-free survival (Investigator assessment as defined by RECIST 1.1), 18 months after the last patient enrolled|DoR, The duration between the date the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail) and the date of disease recurrence or progression as objectively recorded, 18 months after the last patient enrolled|DCR, the incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease, 18 months after the last patient enrolled|percentage change from baseline in tumor size, Absolute change and percentage change from baseline in TL's tumor size at 12 weeks will be based on RECIST TLs measurements taken at baseline and at Week 12, 12 weeks after the last patient enrolled|OS, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause, 18 months after the last patient enrolled|12m OS rate by Investigator assessment, Proportion alive at 12 months, 12 months after the last patient enrolled
Approximately 44 eligible patients will be enrolled to randomly assigned to study interventions so that approximately 40 evaluable participants complete the study, based on an assumption of 10% of participants not completing the study.

All eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with osimertinib (80 mg daily) or osimertinib (80 mg daily) in combination with savolitinib (300 mg BID) in this study. Treatment will continue until either objective disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn or another discontinuation criterion is met.

Patients who progress on first-line treatment of osimertinib monotherapy will have the opportunity to receive second-line treatment of osimertinib plus savolitinib after confirmation of MET status at disease progression.
