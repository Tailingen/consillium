Anastomotic Leak Testing in Gastrectomy
Anastomotic leak after radical gastrectomy is a serious complication. Intraoperative leak testing was often used to assess the integrity of the anastomosis. However, the reliability, clinical benefits and safety of intraoperative leak testing are controversial. Our aim is to evaluate the effect and safety of intraoperative leak testing, and to compare the surgical complications of patients in intraoperative leak testing group with patients in non-intraoperative leak testing group.

PROCEDURE: Introperative leak testing
Anastomotic leakage, all patients underwent upper gastrointestinal radiography after surgery for detecting the integrity of anastomosis. X-ray to detect the integrity of the anastomosis, 2 months
Postoperative surgical complications, Any surgical complication that occured postoperatively, 3 months

However, the reliability, clinical benefits and safety of intraoperative leak testing are controversial. Our aim is to evaluate the effect and safety of intraoperative leak testing, and to compare the surgical complications of patients in intraoperative leak testing group with patients in non-intraoperative leak testing group. patients underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, with esophagojejunostomy reconstruction.
