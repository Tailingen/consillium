Comparison Study of MDX-010 (CTLA-4) Alone and Combined With DTIC in the Treatment of Metastatic Melanoma
The objectives of this study are to determine the safety and activity profile of multiple doses of MDX-010, and to determine the whether the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy (decarbazine \[DTIC\]) can augment the effects of MDX-010 in patients with chemotherapy naïve metastatic melanoma with a tolerable toxicity profile.
