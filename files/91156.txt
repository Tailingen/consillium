Sulfasalazine in AML Treated by Intensive Chemotherapy: Elderly Patients-first Line Treatment
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal myeloid neoplasm where abnormal proliferation and impaired differentiation of hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cells impedes normal hematopoiesis. Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is a broadly available, well tolerated anti-inflammatory medicine approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Intact SSZ, but not its metabolites 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine, competitively inhibits xCT.21 SSZ is thus an ideal candidate for drug repurposing in AML.The purpose of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of such strategy, provide preliminary signals of efficacy, and identify potential biomarkers
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Sulfasalazine
Dose Limiting Toxicity (for phase I part of the trial), Defined as any of the following events:

* Prolonged myelosuppression defined as Grade ≥ 3 Neutropenia or Thrombocytopenia on Day 42 from start of therapy or later without evidence of leukemia (assessed by bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy)
* Grade ≥3 hemorrhages until day 42.
* Grade ≥3 non- hematological toxicity until day 42 with the exception of: Grade 3 infection, grade 3 fever with neutropenia (NB. grade 4 infections and grade 4 fever with neutropenia are considered as DLTs), Grade ≥3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that can be managed to ≤ Grade 2 within 72 hours of symptomatic treatment, Grade ≥3 asymptomatic liver enzymes elevation that improves to ≤ Grade 2 within 72 hours of onset, Grade ≥3 tumor lysis syndrome that resolves within 72 hours of onset with medical treatment, 42 days|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative Complete Response (for phase II part of the trial), Defined as:

* Complete Remission CR or CRi (CR with incomplete hematologic recovery, meaning CR with platelet count \<100,000/μL or absolute neutrophil count \<1000/μL) and CRh (CR with partial hematologic recovery, meaning CR not fulfilling CR or CRi peripheral blood count criteria but with platelet count \>50,000/μL AND absolute neutrophil count \>500/μL).
* MRD-negativity is defined as an 8-color bone marrow FCM MRD \< 0.1% at EOI.
* Of note, NPM1 (nucleoplasmin)-transcript based MRD in the Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood will be carried as exploratory endpoint in NPM1-mutated patients., Day 28 to 42
