Percentage of Participants Who Achieve or Maintain Any Best Response for Adult Participants With PTCL-NOS, AITL, the Other PTCL, and Pediatric Participants With PTCL, Best response is defined as the cumulative numbers of participants who achieve each level of best response including complete response (CR), complete response uncertain (CRu) (when no positron emission tomography \[PET\] data are available), partial response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD) after treatment. Best response was assessed by the antitumor response criteria for adult PTCL. Reported data are divided into 2 populations; with or without PET data for each group.

The drug being tested in this survey is called Brentuximab Vedotin intravenous infusion 50 mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the safety of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL (excluding ALCL) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or HL in the routine clinical setting. The number of observed patients will be approximately 86 as total (80; Adult participants and 6; Pediatric participants).

This multi-center observational survey will be conducted in Japan.
