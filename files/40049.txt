Neo-TACE-HAIC for BCLC B Stage HCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a common disease in the East Asia. Although BCLC (Barcelona clinical liver cancer) system recommend to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for BCLC B stage patients, increasing studies suggested that hepatic resection provided survival benefit for those patients. However, a relative high recurrence risk leads surgeons to investigate the value of preoperative treatment.

Recently, FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil) based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) exhibited high response rate for unresectable HCC.

Pilot study showed TACE combined HAIC (TACE-HAIC) had better tumor response, with low progression disease rate.

Whether TACE-HAIC would improve survival for patients with BCLC B stage is need to further to study. A randomized clinical trial compared neo-TACE-HAIC with surgery versus surgery alone is aimed to answer this question.
