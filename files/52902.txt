Ex Onc SLED: a Study Utilizing a Weighted Sled for Horizontal Resistance Training
This protocol seeks to analyze patient adherence and outcomes after monitored exercise sessions utilizing primarily weighted sled pushes and pulls for linearly progressed resistance training of individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer.
Cancer
Change in Adipose Tissue (InBody, kg), Change in adipose tissue (kg) pre and post resistance training regimen measured via InBody 970 bioelectrical impedance analysis, Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Change in Adipose Tissue (Ultrasound, Lbs), Change in adipose tissue (pounds) pre and post resistance training regimen measured via ultrasound., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Change in Muscle Mass, Changes in percent muscle mass (measured by InBody bioelectrical impedance analysis) and percent fat-free mass (measured by ultrasound) from baseline to six months, Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.
Intervention Compliance Rate during Exercise Program (Adherence), Percentage of exercise sessions attended by each participant, Through study completion, up to 6 months.|Feasibility of the Exercise Program, Tracking of participant completion status., Through study completion, up to 6 months.|Adverse Events (Safety), Through study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in Timed Up and Go Test Performance at baseline and post-exercise assessment, An individual stands from a chair, walks ten feet and back, and then sits down. This is timed and recorded in seconds., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in Functional Mobility Score at baseline and post-exercise assessment, During the test, 7 movement patterns are assessed and each one is rated between 0 and 3 by an examiner. These movements include the deep squat, hurdle step, inline lunge, shoulder mobility test, active straight leg raise, trunk stability push up, and rotary stability test. A score of zero is given if any pain is felt during the movement, 1 if the subject is unable to perform the movement, 2 if the subject performs the movement through compensatory movements, and 3 if the movement is performed correctly. Each movement score is summed and a final score out of 21 is calculated. A score below 14 is felt to identify individuals at risk of injury., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in Y-Balance Test Scores at baseline and post-exercise assessment, Reach distances in three directions (anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral) measured in centimeters., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) at baseline and post-exercise assessment, EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels total score for the 5 questions ranges from 5 (no problems on any dimension) to 25 (extreme problems on all dimensions). This is calculated by assigning scores of 1 (minimum), 2, 3, 4, and 5 (maximum), to the response categories of "no problems", "slight problems", "moderate problems", "severe problems", and "extreme problems"/"unable to", respectively. Higher scores mean worse outcomes., Baseline assessment (prior to program) and at exercise program completion.|Changes in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) depression score at baseline and post-exercise assessment, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 total score for the 9 questions ranges from 0 (no depression) to 27 (highest level of depression). This is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (minimum), 1, 2, and 3 (maximum), to the response categories of "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days", and "nearly every day", respectively. Higher scores mean a worse outcome., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) anxiety score at baseline and post-exercise assessment, General Anxiety Disorder-7 total score for the seven questions ranges from 0 (no anxiety) to 21 (highest level of anxiety). This is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (minimum), 1, 2, and 3 (maximum), to the response categories of "not at all", "several days", "more than half the days", and "nearly every day", respectively. Higher scores mean a worse outcome., Baseline and study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in grip strength at baseline, throughout, and post- exercise assessment, Assessed via a Jamar Hand Dynamometer Grip Strength Measurement Meter bilaterally at the neutral position and with the arm over the head, Through study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in load lifted during sled exercises at baseline, throughout, and post- exercise assessment, Maximum weight lifted during sled training, Through study completion, up to 6 months.|Changes in resting metabolic rate at baseline and post-exercise assessment, Through study completion, up to 6 months.
