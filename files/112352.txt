A Pilot Study of Combined Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Combination With Ablative Therapies in Subjects With Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) or Biliary Tract Carcinomas (BTC)
BACKGROUND:

* Various tumor ablative procedures and techniques have been shown to result in immunogenic cell death and induction of a peripheral immune response. The term ablative therapies applies to trans-arterial catheter chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CA).
* The underlying hypothesis of this study is that the effect of immune checkpoint inhibition can be enhanced by TACE, CA and RFA in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract carcinomas (BTC). We have already demonstrated proof of principle as well as safety and feasibility of this approach with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy.
* Based on the concept of programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1)-mediated adaptive resistance and the emerging role of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) therapy in HCC, we would like to evaluate the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab (with ablative therapies) in HCC and BTC.

Objectives:

- To preliminarily evaluate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) of combining tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with advanced HCC (either alone or with cryoablation, TACE or RFA) and in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) (either alone or with cryoablation or RFA).

ELIGIBILITY:

* Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC or biliary tract carcinoma OR histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological characteristics which, together with the pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of HCC (or biliary tract carcinoma).
* Childs-Pugh A/B7 cirrhosis only is allowed. If patient does not have cirrhosis, this limitation does not apply.
* Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection, radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.

DESIGN:

We will evaluate the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab (with ablative therapies) in cohorts A (HCC; N=40) and B (BTC; N=30). The first N=10 patients in both cohorts will receive tremelimumab and durvalumab only (i.e. No interventional radiologic procedures).

* A: Advanced HCC, BCLC# Stage B/C

  * N= 1st 10 pts: No ablative procedure Cryoablation/RFA/TACE##
  * Tremelimumab 75mg flat dose every (q)28 days for 4 doses; Durvalumab 1500mg flat dose q28 days until end of study (EOS)###
  * 40 total: 10 trem+ dur alone; 10 trem+ dur + TACE; 10 trem + dur + RFA; 10 trem + dur + cryo
* B: Intra/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma

  * N= 1st 10 patients (pts): No ablative procedure; RFA/ cryoablation
  * Tremelimumab 75mg flat dose q28 days for 4 doses; Durvalumab 1500mg flat dose q28 days until EOS###
  * 30 total: 10 trem+ dur alone; 10 trem + dur + RFA; 10 trem

    * BCLC = Barcelona clinic liver cancer staging system

      * For BCLC stage B patients TACE may be repeated as per standard of care

        * EOS = End of study treatment or meeting any of the off-treatment or off study criteria.

6 Month Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the median amount of time subject survives without disease progression 6 months after treatment. Progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., At 6 months
Number of Grades 1-5 Adverse Events Related to Tremelimumab and Durvalumab, Adverse events were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)v4.0. Grade 1 is mild, grade 2 is moderate, grade 3 is severe, grade 4 is life-threatening, and grade 5 is death related to adverse event., 60 days after last treatment, an average of 44.89 months
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 62 months and 3 days for the RFA/TACE group, and 27 months and 24 days for the RFA/CA group.
