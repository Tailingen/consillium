Pyrotinib, Dalpiciclib(SHR6390) and Endocrine Therapy in Subjects With Dual-receptor Positive(ER+/HER2+) Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a single-center Ib / II study of triple targeted drug combination (endocrine therapyï¼Œnovel HER2-targeted small molecule inhibitor pyrotinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor dalpiciclib(SHR6390) ) as a first or second line of therapy in patients with relapsed/metastatic hormone receptor positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dalpiciclib|DRUG: Pyrotinib|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Fulvestrant
The number of patients in the Phase 1b part of the study with any adverse events (AE)., To measure safety and tolerability of SHR6390 used in combination with and letrozole and pyrotinib (phase Ib part) we will assess the incidence, nature and severity of all adverse events (AE) that occur on or after C1D1 of therapy, AE severities will be classified using the CTCAE criteria., 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), According to recist1.1 standard, the proportion of patients whose best remission was CR or PR accounted for the total number of evaluable patients., 12 months
This is a single-center, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study of endocrine therapy in combination with novel human epidermal growth factor receptor-2(HER2)-targeted tyrosine kinase Inhibitor pyrotinib and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6(CDK4/6) Inhibitor dalpiciclib(SHR6390) in subjects with hormone receptor(HR)+/HER2+ relapsed or metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll natural postmenopausal women, or women who have undergone bilateral oophorectomy.The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety and tolerability of the combination of endocrine therapy, pyrotinib and dalpiciclib to define that appropriate dose of dalpiciclib for phase II.Data from phase Ib showed the triplet of pyrotinib, dalpiciclib, andendocrine therapy had an acceptable safety profile and encouraging efficacy, potentially offering a chemotherapy-sparing treatment option for patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.Once the recommended regimen has been identified, subjects with the selected tumor type will be enrolled into expansion cohorts for the purpose of assessing efficacy and safety of the combination treatment.
