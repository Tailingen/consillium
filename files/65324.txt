Study to Assess Biomarkers in Patients With Resectable Oral Cavity Cancer Randomized to Receive Preoperative Treatment
The objective of this study is to assess the biological effects in the primary tumor following a short, pre-operative course of treatment with PF-00298804 in patients with Oral Cavity Cancer.
Oral Cavity Cancer
DRUG: PF-00299804
To assess the degree of modulation of the proliferation index, ki-67, in the primary tumor of OCC specimens following a short, preoperative course of PF-00299804, 8-11 months
To evaluate changes in tissue and blood-based biomarkers before, during and after treatment with PF-00299804 and attempt to correlate with gene expression changes, EGFR variant III mutation status, EGFR amplification and histopathological changes, 8-11 months|To assess the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and molecular changes detected in OCC tumor specimens, 8-11 months|To assess the safety and tolerability of pre-operative PF-00299804, 8-11 months|To quantitatively assess the effect of PF-00299804 on tumorigenic cells expressing CD44+/Lin- markers in paired OCC tumor specimens, 8-11 months|To evaluate gene expression changes in tumor tissue before and after treatment with PF00299804, 8-11 months
This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, biomarker driven, preoperative window of opportunity study with a pharmacodynamic primary endpoint. Patients with resectable, histologically confirmed OCC for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management, will be randomized 2:1 to receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively at a dose of 45 mg once daily orally for 7-11 days or to Matching Placebo for 7-11 days depending on surgery schedule. The target is a total of 8 days of treatment but with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 dosing days. All patients will receive surgery as per standard of care without delay. Biomarkers from the surgical specimen and baseline tumor biopsy or consent to provide a tumor block from existing primary diagnostic tumor biopsy completed within 90 days will be evaluated for primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.
