A Dose Randomization Study of Bulumtatug Fuvedotin in TNBC Patients Previously Treated With ADCs
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate if treatment with bulumtatug fuvedotin is effective in triple-negative breast cancer patients who have previously received treatment with an antibody-drug conjugates.
