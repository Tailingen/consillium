PCSK9 Inhibitor and PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for pMMR/MSS Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study aimed at conducting a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy and safety of combining PCSK9 inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors (dual inhibitors) with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with pMMR/MSS locally advanced rectal cancer.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC)
DRUG: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Combined with PD-1 inhibitor Immunotherapy and PCSK9 Inhibitor Therapy
CR, complete response rate=(number of pathological complete responses + number of clinical complete responses)/total number of patients, pCR :within 2 weeks after surgery; cCR :2 weeks after radiotherapy ends|AE rate, Adverse event rate, During neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, an average of 6 months
DFS, Disease-free survival, 5 years|OS, Overall survival time, 5 years|ORR, objective response rate, within 2 weeks after surgery|TRG, Tumor regression grade, At the time of postoperative pathological assessment (within 1 week after surgery)|OPR, organ preservation rate, immediately after surgery
This study aims to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate of PCSK9 inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor combination therapy (dual inhibitors) in conjunction with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pMMR/MSS locally advanced rectal cancer. Specifically, the study will assess the pathological complete response (pCR) rate two weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, the clinical complete response (cCR) rate under the "watch-and-wait" strategy, objective response rate (ORR), R0 resection rate, tumor regression grade (TRG), and sphincter preservation rate. Additionally, the study will evaluate the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) following dual-inhibitor combined neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The safety and tolerability of this combination therapy will also be comprehensively assessed based on NCI-CTCAE 4.03 criteria.
