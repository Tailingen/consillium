Sequential Infusion of CD19 and BCMA CAR-T Cells to Improve PTR in Patients With AL
Alloimmune-mediated platelet transfusion refractoriness(PTR) was usually caused by repeated blood transfusions and pregnancy and accounts for about 20-25% of PTR patients. Patients with acute leukemia need repeated platelet infusion in myelosuppression period after chemotherapy, and PTR incidence is more higher.PTR was associated with adverse events,including longer hospital stays,severe hemorrhages and an increased risk of early deaths and may have a negative impact on the success of HSCT. The current management of patients with PTR includes specific transfusion strategies, IVIG, rituximab,thrombopoietin-receptor agonists(TPO-RA) ,bortezomib or splenectomy,have been largely unsatisfactory. As we know, HLA antibodies are mainly secreted by the plasma cells. Researchers want to see if sequential infusion of CD19 and BCMA CAR-T cells can clear the B cells and plasma cells, can help increase platelet levels and reduce bleeding in patients with platelet transfusion refractoriness. To see if sequential infusion can increases platelet levels more after a transfusion. To see if it reduces the chance of bleeding. Adults 16-65 years old who diagnosed with acute leukemia in CR and alloimmune platelet transfusion refractoriness.

BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T infusion
Number of Subjects With Sustained Platelet Transfusion Responsiveness, To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of CD19 and BCMA CAR-T cells to improve PTR, estimate by platelet increment, defined as Corrected Count Increment (CCI) \>7500/μL at 10-60 min together with CCI\>5000/μL at 18-24 hrs post platelet transfusion in patients with platelet transfusion refractoriness., 12 months|Adverse events after sequential infusion of CAR-T, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0., 12 months
B lymphocytes/plasma cell clearance, To investigate the possible mechanisms of sequential infusion in alloimmune-mediated PTR, 12 months|Amplification,distribution and persistence of CAR T-cells in vivo, To evaluate the persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo, 12 months|Alloimmune antibodies(include HLA and HPA) in PB after sequential transfusion, To evaluate the clearance of alloimmune antibodies., 12 months
The patients will receive infusion of CAR T-cells targeting CD19 and BCMA to confirm the safety and efficacy of CD19 and BCMA CAR T-Cells Sequential infusion in acute leukemia with alloimmune-mediated platelet transfusion refractoriness.
