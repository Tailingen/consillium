Id-KLH Vaccine + T Cells in Subjects With Myeloma Undergoing Transplant
This study will enroll myeloma subjects undergoing autotransplantation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether infusions of Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes mediate a more intense Id-specific immunity than non Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes. There will be 2 arms in the study, one receiving a DLI with non Id-KLH vaccine and one receiving aDLI with Id-KLH vaccine.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: CD3/CD28
Participants With Id-specific Immunity, Evaluate whether infusions of Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes mediate a more intense Id-specific immunity than non Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes. RNA was isolated from CD4 and CD8 T cells pre-vaccine, and at day 30, 90 and 180 post-vaccine for gene expression analysis. The Nanostring Human immunology V2 kit, a multiplex assay for 594 genes involved in the human immunology response, was used with an nCounter digital analyzer to quantify immune response gene expression levels. Subjects were considered to have Id-specific immunity if they induced expression of effector (TBX21, KLRG1) and memory (CCL5) associated genes in CD8 T cells in post-vaccine time-points compared to baseline., 180 DAYS
The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate whether infusions of Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes mediate a more intense id-specific immunity than non id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes. The secondary objectives of this study is to demonstrate that doses of 1 times 10e10 Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 autologous lymphocytes can be infused safely and effectively in more than 80 percent of eligible patients, to determine whether Id-KLH primed CD3/CD28 activated autologous lymphocytes and to determine if the presence of Id-specific immunity correlates with disease response.
