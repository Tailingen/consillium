Minimally Residual of Esophageal Cancer 001
This trial aims to assess changes in minimal residual disease (MRD) status before and after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy and adjuvant immunotherapy after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in patients with inoperable stage II-III esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), and correlate with the efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapy.

The differences in the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in patients with positive versus negative blood MRD prior to radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) combined with immunotherapy following neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, Differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between MRD positive and negative patients after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. OS is defined as time from start of treatment to death (from any cause). PFS is defined as the time between the start of treatment and the onset of (any aspect of) tumor progression or death (from any cause)., 2023/2/22-2027/12/31|The differences in the immune microenvironment in patients with different efficacy responses after radical CCRT combined with immunotherapy, MRD status and T-lymphocyte differences across efficacy responses after receiving radical CCRT combined with immunotherapy.

Presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is indicative for minimal residual disease (MRD) and has high predictive value for efficacy and tumor recurrence. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy becomes the standard of care for unresectable, locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer, and the addition of immunotherapy to radiotherapy has been shown to increase efficacy without increasing side effects. The ECMRD-001 trial aims to assess changes in MRD status before and after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy and adjuvant immunotherapy after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in patients with inoperable stage II-III esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). The specimen collection time points were divided into MRD-related blood collections, MRD-related tissue collection, T-cell immunohistobank-related blood collections, and T-cell immunohistobank-related tissue collection before, during, and after treatment and follow-up. Primary endpoint is the relationship between MRD status at different time points and treatment efficacy. Secondary endpoints include the relationship between MRD status and immune microenvironment, radiotherapy dose, and tumor recurrence. Exploratory endpoint is to investigate ctDNA mutations in ESCC patients receiving adjuvant immunotherapy. To the investigators' knowledge, the ECMRD-001 study is the first clinical trial to investigate ctDNA-based MRD guided strategies in stage II-III ESCC patients who receive radical chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy followed by adjuvant immunotherapy. After our research it may be possible to confirm that ctDNA-based MRD may be a predictive marker for the efficacy and tumor recurrence of inoperable ESCC patients; elevated ctDNA-MRD may predict tumor recurrence earlier than imaging; ctDNA-based MRD analysis and ctDNA-based MRD guided diagnosis and treatment may be implemented into clinical practice to improve efficacy and reduce tumor recurrence of inoperable stage II-III ESCC.
