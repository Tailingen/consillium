PARP Inhibition for Gliomas (PI-4G or Ï€4g)
The purpose of this study is to determine what effects (good and bad) niraparib has on patients with recurrent brain cancer.
Recurrent Glioblastoma|Recurrent Astrocytoma|Recurrent Oligodendroglioma|Recurrent Glioma
DRUG: Niraparib
Number of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events, Number of patients who experience adverse events with individualized starting dose (ISD) of niraparib using CTCAE v5.0, Up to 17 months|Efficacy of Treatment in Dose Expansion Phase, Percentage of patients who respond to niraparib monitored by disease control rate (stable disease and better) using RANO from start of treatment for up to 12 months., up to 12 months|Number of Patients Who Experience Toxicities With Individualized Starting Dose (ISD) of Niraparib Using CTCAE v5.0, Number of patients who experience toxicities (defined as grade 3 or 4 adverse events) with individualized starting dose (ISD) of niraparib using CTCAE v5.0, 5 months
Progression Free Survival in Dose Expansion Phase, Proportion of patients who have progression-free survival from date of study entry until the first documented date of progression or date of death, whichever comes first., 20 months|Overall Survival in Dose Expansion Phase, Proportion of patients with overall survival on the study defined as time from date of study entry to death by any cause., 20 months|Duration of Disease Control of All Patients, Duration of response in patients treated with niraparib defined as time from date of first response (stable disease or better) to the first date of non-response post treatment on the study., up to 4 years
Patients will have tests and exams to see if they are eligible for the clinical trial. If found eligible, the patient will receive treatment with niraparib in the form of capsules taken every day for the first 28 days. If this dose is tolerated well, the patients will continue to take the capsules and more patients will be enrolled on the study.

Patients will continue treatment with niraparib while on the study unless there is evidence of tumor growth or they experience unacceptable side effects.

Patients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment completion for up to four years from the time they enrolled on the study.
