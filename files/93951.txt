A number of clinical studies have shown that PD-1 immunotherapy combined with anti-vascular target drugs has achieved good clinical efficacy in primary liver cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esophageal cancer and other tumors. For sarcomatoid carcinoma, which is a rare tumor with large heterogeneity, poor treatment effect and poor prognosis, clinicians are facing great confusion on how to find a good treatment regimen in clinic. The purpose of this study is to explore the treatment of advanced sarcomatoid carcinoma with PD-1 antibody Camrelizumab combined with anti-vascular target drug Apatinib.
