IG-VMAT for Localized Prostate Cancer
To determine if hypofractionated IG-VMAT (70 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks) will result in disease-free survival (DFS) that is no worse than DFS following conventionally fractionated IG-VMAT (80Gy in 40 fractions over 8 weeks) in patients treated for localized prostate cancer. Analysis the local progression, disease-specific survival (DFS), freedom from biochemical recurrence (FFBR), and overall survival (OS) of two groups. Observe the incidence of GI and GU toxicity.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: hypofraction|RADIATION: convention
Biochemical progression free survival, Number of participants who are free of biochemical relapse after a specified duration of time.Phoenix definition of biochemical failure., up to 18 months
Incidence of "acute" adverse events as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v. 4.0, From the start of radiation therapy (RT) to first occurrence of worse severity of adverse event within 30 days after the completion of RT|Time to "late" grade 2+ adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v. 4.0, From the date of completion of RT to the date of first grade 2 or above adverse event occurring 30 days after the completion of RT|Overall Survival, up to 5 years
