PCLE for the Diagnosis of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia, Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and Carcinoma
Early detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) intraepithelial neoplasia (IN), and gastric cancer are essential to improve patients' outcomes. This study aims to compare the diagnostic yield of GIM, IN and early gastric cancer (EGC) by iScan combined probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and iScan alone.
Diagnostic Yield of Gastric Neoplasia
DEVICE: pCLE-TB|DEVICE: virtual chromoendoscopy-TB
the diagnostic yield of intestinal metaplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia, and gastric cancer, 12 months
the biopsy number needed for diagnosis, 12 months
