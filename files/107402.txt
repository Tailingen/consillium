Study of Upfront Surgery Versus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer (SUNNY)
The purpose of this study is to answer the fundamental question, should the physicians choose Surgery or Chemotherapy (SOC-2) in advanced ovarian cancer?
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Upfront cytoreductive surgery|PROCEDURE: Interval debulking surgery
Overall survival, The time from entry into the study to any cause of death., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death
Progression-free survival, The time from entry into the study to the diagnosis of the first progression or recurrence or death, whichever occurs first., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|Post-operative complications, The surgical complications will be evaluated at 30-day after upfront cytoreductive surgery or interval debulking surgery., Participants will be followed up to 6 months after randomization|Quality of life assessments, QOQ-C30,FACT-O( baseline; 6months, 12 months and 5 years after randomization), Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|Accumulated treatment-free survival (TFSa), The overall survival time minus the total treatment time of surgery and chemotherapy after randomization, but maintenance of targeted agents is considered off-treatment., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|Time to first subsequent anticancer therapy (TFST), The date of randomization until the starting date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first. Maintenance treatments following a cytostatic treatment are NOT considered separate treatment lines., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|Time to second subsequent anticancer therapy (TSST), The date of randomization until the starting date of the second subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first. Maintenance treatments following a cytostatic treatment are NOT considered separate treatment lines., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|The pattern of the first relapse, The number and sites of the first relapse, including pelvic, abdominal, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, distant metastases and ascites will be compared between the two groups., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|The rate of 5-year progression-free survival, The rate of the patients without progression or recurrence or death at 5 years., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death|Outcomes of pulmonary embolism, The incidence of pulmonary embolism prior to primary treatment in the ITT and hospital populations. Its effect on survival between groups in the ITT and hospital populations., Participants will be followed for at least 5 years after randomization or until death
OBJECTIVES: Compare the efficacy and safety in patients with AJCC TNM stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery versus upfront surgery.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive upfront maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy or 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery, and then at least 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients are followed every 3 months within the first 5 years, and then every 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 488 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
