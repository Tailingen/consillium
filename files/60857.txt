Safety and Efficacy of Cryoablation With Karelizumab and Apatinib for Multiple Lung Cancers
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficacy of cryoablation combined with carlizumab and apatinib in multiple primary lung cancer without known driver genes.Main included population criteria:Clinical and pathological diagnosis of multiple primary lung cancer;Three pulmonary nodules were diagnosed initially or before surgery, without lymph node metastasis;Male or female is 18 years old, and 75 years old;Up to one surgical resection treatment with 2 remaining pulmonary nodules, and postoperative pathology confirmed MIA or AIS and so on.The main questions it aims to answer is safety of cryoablation combined with carilizumab and apatinib in multiple primary lung cancer.Participants will take carplus with apatinib started 2-3 weeks after cryoablation. Carelizumab 200mg, q3w, apatinib 250mg, qd. Every 3 weeks is for one treatment cycle. Until PD, intolerable toxicity, death, patient withdrawal or investigator discretion requires termination.
