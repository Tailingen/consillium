Patient-reported Outcomes in Preoperative Immunochemotherapy/Radiotherapy-treated Esophageal Cancer Patients
Preoperative Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have revolutionized the treatment landscape of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, there are still a significant proportion of patients who could not benefit from such treatment modality. Currently, no effective biomarkers were identified to stratify responders and non-responders. Early dynamic and persistent relief of dysphagia may act as a predictive biomarker to reflect the on-treatment anti-tumor activity. In this prospective study, we aimed to explore the feasibility of using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to predict the pathological complete response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy with or without short-term radiation as well as to assess the efficacy and safety of short-term radiotherapy in PROs-insensitive patients after one cycle of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy.
