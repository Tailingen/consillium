A Study of V934/V935 Vaccine in Cancer Participants With Selected Solid Tumors (V934-002)
This is a two-part study to test the safety, tolerability, and immune response for V934/V935 vaccine using a new prime-boost regimen in participants with selected solid tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: V935|BIOLOGICAL: V934-EP
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as a vaccine- or EP-related adverse event (AE) including the following: Hematological (Grade 3 neutropenia with fever, Grade 4 neutropenia ≥5 days, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia) or non-hematological AE, Grade 3, 4 or 5 with the exception of Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) elevation, alopecia, Grade 3/4 creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation or inadequately treated hypersensitivity. Any Grade 3/4 related AE that failed to return to ≤Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days was also considered a DLT., Day 1 up to 30 days following the last vaccination (up to 77 weeks); Treatment Period + Acute Follow-up (FU) Period|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), This analysis includes the number of participants with AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) during the Treatment Period plus the Acute Follow-up (FU) Period (up to 30 days following last vaccination). An AE was defined as any unfavorable or unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the product, including any worsening of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the product. An SAE was defined as an AE resulting in death, was life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly, a cancer, an overdose or other important medical event., Day 1 up to 30 days following the last vaccination (up to 77 weeks); Treatment Period + Acute Follow-up (FU) Period
Number of Participants With Immunologic Response to V934/V935 (Immunologic Response Rate), An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISPOT) assay was planned to be used to demonstrate a cell mediated immune response to V935 and/or V934 in vaccinated participants. Collection of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and serum took place at baseline (Screening and pre-vaccination Day 1), and various time points post vaccination across the three distinct regimens to be tested. A positive immune response was to be defined by a minimum number of spot-forming cells per million PBMC (SFC/10\^6 PBMCs) for the antigen well and a minimum n-fold increase in the antigen well over the control well., From pre-vaccination to Week 69
Two vaccines will be administered: V934-electroporation (EP) either low dose (LD) or high dose (HD), and V935 either LD or HD. In Part A, participants will be assigned to V935 vaccine alone or in combination with V934-EP. Part B will be an optional part of the study, offering V934-EP vaccine booster to participants who were enrolled in Part A.
