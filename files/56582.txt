Phase 1b Combo w/ Ribociclib, Alpelisib, or Everolimus
This is a Phase 1b open-label, 2-part study in 3 treatment groups. The 3 treatment groups are as follows:

Treatment Group 1: OP-1250 in combination with ribociclib (KISQALI®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation).

Treatment Group 2: OP-1250 in combination with alpelisib (PIQRAY®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation).

Treatment Group 3: OP-1250 in combination with everolimus.

DRUG: OP-1250|DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Everolimus
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3). The incidence of DLTs will be assessed in the Dose Escalation part (Part 1) of the study., The first 28 days of treatment|Characterize the incidence, nature and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib, alpelisib, or everolimus, Characterize the incidence, nature and severity of TEAEs and SAEs of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3) according to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 35 days after end of treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1) or alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3)., To assess the PK of OP-1250 in combination with ribociclib, alpelisib, or everolimus plasma levels of OP-1250 (and potential metabolites) and ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), plasma levels of OP-1250 (and potential metabolites) and alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or plasma levels of OP-1250 (and potential metabolites) and everolimus (Treatment Group 3) will be assessed at predefined intervals to establish PK parameters (including: Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, AUC, and t1⁄2) and OP-1250 trough concentration at steady state)., Every 28 days
Preliminarily assess the anti-tumor activity (ORR) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3), as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Tumor response will be evaluated in patients with measurable or evaluable disease using RECISTv1.1 guidelines., Up to 1 year|Evaluate clinical benefit rate (CBR) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3), CBR will be assessed as proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) with duration of at least 24 weeks., Up to 1 year|Evaluate duration of response (DoR) of OP-1250 when administered with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3), DoR will be calculated as the number of days from the start date of PR or CR (whichever response is achieved first) to the first date that progressive disease is documented., Up to 1 year
Part 1 (Dose Escalation): This part will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a range of doses of OP-1250 administered orally (PO) daily to subjects in combination with 600 mg of ribociclib administered PO daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment (Treatment Group 1) or with 300 mg or 250 mg of alpelisib administered PO daily (Treatment Group 2) or with everolimus 10 mg administered PO daily (Treatment Group 3) and determine the RP2D (Recommended Phase 2 Dose) for each treatment group.

Part 2 (Dose Expansion): This part of the study will further evaluate the safety and PK of OP-1250 at the RP2D in combination with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1), alpelisib (Treatment Group 2), or everolimus (Treatment Group 3) and provide an exploratory estimate of anti-tumor activity of the combinations. An additional group of OP-1250 at an alternate dose level in combination with ribociclib (Treatment Group 1b) will be explored to optimize the RP2D of OP-1250.
