Detection of Oncogenic Tumor Mutations in the Urine and Blood of Lung and Colorectal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to see whether gene mutations can be found in the urine or blood of lung cancer patients and urine of colorectal cancer patients. Gene mutations are when DNA in a gene is damaged in a way that changes the genetic message carried by that gene. Gene mutations can sometimes cause lung cancers. These gene mutations are only found in lung and colorectal cancer cells, not the normal cells in your body. All lung cancer tumors and colorectal cancer tumors are now tested for different gene mutations as their presence affects lung cancer treatment. Tumor samples obtained from a biopsy or surgery are typically tested for these gene mutations.

EGFR detection in urinary cell free DNA [cfDNA], The Trovagene urine-based assay will test to determine the presence of EGFR mutation in cfDNA or RAS/RAF mutation in colorectal cancer, 2 years|To validate the Trovagene urine assay, urine assay to identify EGFR mutations as compared to the gold standard of tumor tissue., 2 years
EGFR detection in plasma circulating tumor cells [CTC] and plasma cfDNA), The plasma-based assay will test to determine the presence of EGFR mutation in CTC and in cfDNA., 2 years
