Tarceva/Rapamycin for Children With Low-grade Gliomas With or Without Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)
This study will evaluate the feasibility of combining two drugs, Tarceva (an anti-EGFR agent), and Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), in children with progressive low-grade gliomas who have failed initial conventional treatment. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of this drug regimen, the potential efficacy of the regimen will be assessed.
