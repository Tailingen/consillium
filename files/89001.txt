HAI Via Interventionally Implanted Port Catheter Systems
Procedures to provide interventional implantation of a port catheter system into the hepatic artery and adjacent regional chemotherapy of the liver are optimized in the scope of an open, single-arm trial in patients with metastases and cancers confined to the liver. The primary objective is the improvement of indication, implantation procedure, and regional chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are port patency, comparison of complications with a historical collective of patients provided with a surgical hepatic arterial port device (colorectal cancer patients only), progression free and overall survival, efficacy of maintaining regional chemotherapy with 5-FU in combination with systemic treatment in patients with extrahepatic progression, quality of life.

After enrollment, an a port catheter catheter system is interventionally implanted into the hepatic artery and the patient is scheduled for regional chemotherapy according one out of 8 pre-defined chemotherapy schedules. All regimens are based on 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, and optionally contain intraarterial mitomycin, oxaliplatin, or additional intravenous irinotecan.

Patients are followed up and evaluated for primary and secondary endpoints. After the inclusion of 50 patients treated and follow up at our institution, the study population has been extended to 100 patients in 8/2004.
