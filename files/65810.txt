XCHT for Irinotecan-Induced Gut Toxicities (Randomized Controlled Trial)
Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) study, to determine the impact of XCHT on irinotecan-induced severe delayed-onset diarrhea (SDOD), and to determine the feasibility of using plasma raloxifene-4'-glucuronide as a probe for intestinal UGT activity.

Incidence of diarrhea (grade ≥2), The diarrhea severity will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0 Grade 2 is defined as Stool is increased by 4-6 times each day relative to baseline; discharge from stoma moderately increased., Through study completion, an average of 2 months
Incidence of diarrhea (grade ≥3), The diarrhea severity will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 months|Incidence of other chemo-related adverse effects, Other adverse reactions will be evaluated following standard criteria in NCI-CTC AE 5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 months|Occult blood test for stool, Occult blood test for stool, reported as negative, weak positive, and positive., Through study completion, an average of 2 months|PK parameters(Cmax), Cmax ,if with complete data, in each cycle of Cmax for XCHT and their metabolites (14 compounds) and intestinal UGT enzyme probe (raloxifene and metabolites), The blood samples (2.0 ml) will be collected at 4 points for each cycle(hour 0, hour 1, hour 2, hour 4 after raloxifene administration)|PK parameters(AUC), AUC 0-24hr, if with complete data, in each cycle of AUC0-24hr for XCHT and their metabolites (14 compounds) and intestinal UGT enzyme probe (raloxifene and metabolites), The blood samples (2.0 ml) will be collected at 4 points for each cycle(hour 0, hour 1, hour 2, hour 4 after raloxifene administration)|PK parameters(T1/2), T1/2, if with complete data, in each cycle of T1/2 for XCHT and their metabolites (14 compounds) and intestinal UGT enzyme probe (raloxifene and metabolites), The blood samples (2.0 ml) will be collected at 4 points for each cycle(hour 0, hour 1, hour 2, hour 4 after raloxifene administration)
A total of 98 patients, who are planning to recieve at least 3 cycles of irinotecan chemotherapy, will be randomly assigned, at a 1:1 ratio, to XCHT group or placebo group, using a central randomization system. Patients will be administered with XCHT/placebo (9 g, qd, po) for 5 days each cycle of chemotherapy for 3 cycles. The XCHT/placebo administration begins 3 days before chemotherapy in each cycle, that is the chemotherapy begins on the 4th day of XCHT/placebo administration. Plasma will be collected for pharmacokinetic testing (using raloxifene 60mg po as probe), on the day before chemotherapy, that is on the 3rd day of XCHT/placebo administration in each cycle. The purpose of this study includes 1) to determine the safety and efficacy of XCHT for prevention of irinotecan-induced diarrhea; 2) to determine the PK profile of SN-38, SN-38G, raloxifene, raloxifene-glucuronide, and XCHT components; and 3) to validate the use of raloxifene-4'G as a probe for irinotecan-induced diarrhea.
