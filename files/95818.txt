Impact of Human-Animal Interactions on Children With Life-Threatening Conditions and Their Parents
This study will evaluate the effects of human-animal interaction on reducing anxiety, depression, worry, and pain and enhancing quality of life in children ages 6-17 years old with a life threatening cancer and their parent caregivers.

BEHAVIORAL: Animal-Assisted Interactions
Pediatric Quality of Life, The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) was administered to children and their parents (proxy for child quality of life) at baseline, week 4, and week 8 visits. Weeks 4 and 8 were after interacting with a therapy dog. Baseline surveys collected without seeing a therapy dog. The PedsQL Measurement is a validated scale to assess health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with acute and chronic health conditions. Scores are scaled from 1-100, with higher scores indicative of better quality of life., Up to 2 months|Anxiety, The state-trait anxiety inventory State sub scale was administered to children (STAI-Child) and their parents (STAI) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. The 20-item STAI-CH is a validated scale for anxiety in children aged 5-17; the 20-item STAI is validated to assess anxiety in adult participants. The State subscale is intended to assess level of anxiety at the time of survey administration. Possible range of scores of the STAI-CH State subscale is 20-60, while the possible range from the STAI state subscale for adults is 20-80. Higher scores are indicative of increased anxiety. Baseline data were obtained without seeing a therapy dog, whereas STAI-CH and STAI surveys were conducted after seeing the therapy dog at weeks 4 and 8., Up to 2 months
Objectives:

* To examine the feasibility of human-animal interaction (HAI) sessions for children with a life threatening cancer and a primary caregiver, specifically to:

  * To identify and document necessary modifications for a safe and feasible intervention
  * To obtain recruitment estimates and determine potential recruitment barriers
  * To evaluate elements of implementation fidelity (design, training, delivery/receipt of treatment, enactment)
  * To verify safety
* To determine the preliminary efficacy of human-animal interaction sessions:

  * On children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of qualify of life, anxiety, depression, worry, and pain
  * On caregivers of children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of stress and anxiety

Exploratory Objective:

- To explore mechanisms (reduced salivary cortisol and urinary norepinephrine levels) associated with 8 weeks of human-animal interaction.
