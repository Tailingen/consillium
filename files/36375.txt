Menopur® Versus Follistim® in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
This multicenter, randomized, open-label exploratory study will be performed in approximately 200 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) but otherwise healthy females undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Each study center will follow its standard practice for in vitro fertilization (IVF) within the study parameters as noted in this protocol. The study centers will use marketed products purchased from Schraft's Pharmacy for all phases of the study (down-regulation, stimulation, ovulation induction, and luteal support). Subjects will be randomly assigned to highly purified menotropin (Menopur®) or follitropin beta (Follistim Pen®) for stimulation and progesterone vaginal insert (Endometrin®) or progesterone in oil for luteal support. Subjects will return to the study center for regular scheduled clinic visits as required per in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocol at the site and at specified times during the cycle (Stimulation Day 6, Day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and first serum pregnancy test) for estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) labs. All subjects will be required to complete a final study visit at completion of luteal support or negative serum pregnancy test following embryo transfer.
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome|Infertility
DRUG: Menotropin|DRUG: Progesterone vaginal insert|DRUG: Follitropin beta|DRUG: Progesterone in oil|DRUG: leuprolide acetate
Participants With Cycle Cancellation Due to Risk of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) Between Weeks 1 - 3, A count of participants whose discontinuation was clearly documented on the study completion/termination form as cycle cancellation for risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)., weeks 1-3
Number of Follicles Observed at Day 15, The mean number of follicles observed in both ovaries at the last transvaginal ultrasound in the stimulation phase., approximately day 15|Number of Oocytes Retrieved at Day 18, The mean number of oocytes retrieved approximately 36 hours after hCG (Novarel®) administration and fertilized (by insemination or intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)) according to site-specific procedures., approximately day 18|Percentage of Oocytes Fertilized of the Total Number of Oocytes Retrieved, The fertilization rate for each participant was the percentage of the number of oocytes inseminated of the total number of oocytes retrieved., approximately day 19|Number of Embryos Transferred at Three Stages of Development Before Implantation, The number of embryos, morulas and blastocysts transferred to the study participant on either day 3 or day 5 following fertilization. Embryos represent the earliest development stage and contain 2-8 cells.

Morulas, the next stage, continued cellular cleavage results in a 16-30 cell solid sphere. Morula further develop into blastocyst, which contains 70-100 cells in a hollow spherical shape., approximately day 24|Number of Embryos Frozen, The number of embryos that were not transferred but instead were frozen for future use., approximately day 24|Percentage of Participants With Biochemical Pregnancy at Approximately Day 38, Biochemical pregnancy is a positive β-hCG pregnancy test 12-14 days post embryo transfer., approximately day 38 (Day 14 post embryo transfer)|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Pregnancy at Week 7, Clinical pregnancy is the confirmation of the presence of intrauterine gestational sacs on pregnancy ultrasound examination., approximately Day 52|Percentage of Participants With Ongoing Pregnancy at Week 9, Clinical pregnancy is the confirmation of the presence of intrauterine gestational sacs on pregnancy ultrasound examination., approximately Day 65|Estradiol Levels at Day 6, Estradiol monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Blood tests sent to a central laboratory to obtain estradiol levels., Day 6|Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Levels at Day 6, Blood tests were sent to a central laboratory to obtain hCG levels., Day 6|Progesterone Levels at Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Administration, Blood tests were sent to a central laboratory to obtain progesterone levels., approximately day 16|Number of Live Births Resulting From the In Vitro Fertilization Process, Number of live births resulting from the IVF process, Approximately 10 months|Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) that started after first treatment. Severity used a three point scale:

mild=awareness of signs/symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity moderate=event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing) severe=event causes inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable) Relatedness to study treatment used a four point scale: unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable.

Seriousness refers to death, hospitalization, a life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly., Week 1 to week12
