Tirelizumab in Combination With Carboplatin and Polymeric Micellar Paclitaxel for Neoadjuvant Therapy in cN+ HNSCC
To explore the efficiency and safety of Tislelizumab combinated with carboplatin and polymeric micellar paclitaxel as a new neoadjuvant treatment regimen for resectable HNSCC patients with clinical positive lymph node metastasis

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Polymeric Micellar Paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection of Primary +/- Neck Dissection|RADIATION: Post-operative radiation therapy
Major pathological response (MPR) rate of metastatic lymph nodes, the proportion of cN+ patients with the percentage of residual viable tumor cells in the tumor bed of metastatic lymph nodes less than 10%, 10days after surgery
Major pathological response (MPR) rate of primary tumor, the proportion of cN+ patients with the percentage of residual viable tumor cells in the tumor bed of primary tumors less than 10%, 10days after surgery|Event-free survival (EFS), In cancer, the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient remains free of certain complications or events that the treatment was intended to prevent or delay., 1 years and 3 years|Overall survival（OS）, The time(years) from day 1 of study treatment until death from any cause., 1 years and 3 years|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, CTCAE 5.0, from the first day of treatment to 30 days after surgery；if adjuvant immotherapy is omitted, time frame is from the first day of treatment to 30 days after last administration|EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life evaluation, from 1 week before treatment to 30 days after surgery|pathological downstaging rate, Percentage of patients with tumor downstaging(pathological stage≦ ypT1N0M0), 10days after surgery|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS) rate, The DMFS rate is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 1 year and 3 year|logical regional-free survival(LRFS) rate, The LRFS rate is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first logical regional metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 1 year and 3 year
Correlation between ctDNA dynamic detection and 1-year and 2-year EFS and OS rate after Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, The ctDNA dynamic detection will contain NGS test including mutations(both somatic and germline), copy number variations, gene fusions along with genetic interpretation for each and every mutation identified in each test(both blood and tissue) during the whole therapeutic process, Six months after consolidation treatment
The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with clinical N-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is less than 50%, and the clinical outcomes of these patients still need improvement.

Immunotherapy, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, has shown excellent efficiency in treating malignant tumors. Anti PD-1 therapy has been approved as a first-line treatment for recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. The results of several phase II clinical trials have shown that neoadjuvant immunotherapy for locally advanced resectable HNSCC has been proven to be safe and feasible. However, immunotherapy has a lower MPR rate for locally advanced HNSCC patients with lymph node metastasis.

Paclitaxel has been used as a first-line induction therapy for locally advanced HNSCC and is an important drug in mediating immunogenic death, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Previous studies on lung cancer have confirmed that nano-paclitaxel has better induction efficacy than solvent paclitaxel and reduces the rate of distant metastasis.

In summary, the investigators designed this study to explore the efficiency and safety of Tislelizumab combinated with carboplatin and polymeric micellar paclitaxel as a new neoadjuvant treatment regimen for patients with clinical N positive resectable HNSCC, aiming to provide a new treatment option for those patients.
