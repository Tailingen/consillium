Physical Activity Intervention Among Older Women With Gynecologic Cancers (Fit4Treatment)
The primary purpose of the study is to determine which of four components (symptom-burden tailored app, exercise partner, oncology provider engagement, coaching) added to a core intervention of a wearable activity tracker and commercially available app, will improve physical activity. The findings will generate meaningful knowledge about how to best increase physical activity in older gynecologic cancer patients receiving systemic cancer therapies to improve quality of life and cancer-specific survival.

BEHAVIORAL: Fit4Treatment
Change in Physical Activity, The primary outcome of average steps per day over a 7 day period will be measured with Actigraph. Patients will wear an accelerometer for 7 days prior to study intervention, 7 days at the conclusion of the 12-week Fit4Treatment intervention, and 7 days at the conclusion of the 12 week follow up period., 24 weeks
Change in Functional Performance, Patients will complete the short performance physical battery (SPPB). This is a well validated physical performance measure specifically in an older patient population and consists of balance testing, a 4-meter walk test and timed standing from a chair., 24 weeks|Change in Frailty, Frailty will be assessed using the Fried's phenotype method., 24 weeks|Change in Anxiety, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for anxiety will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Item Bank v1.0 - Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 7a, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 is the best outcome.

PROMIS measures are validated, reliable measures of health states that can be completed with minimal patient burden and have been used in myriad studies of both older adults and cancer patients., 24 weeks|Change in Fatigue, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for fatigue will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Item Bank v1.0 - Fatigue - Short Form 7a, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 is the best outcome.

PROMIS measures are validated, reliable measures of health states that can be completed with minimal patient burden and have been used in myriad studies of both older adults and cancer patients., 24 weeks|Change in Physical Function, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for physical function will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Item Bank v1.0 - Physical Function - Short Form 10a, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 is the best outcome.

PROMIS measures are validated, reliable measures of health states that can be completed with minimal patient burden and have been used in myriad studies of both older adults and cancer patients., 24 weeks|Change in Pain Interference, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for pain will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Item Bank v1.0 - Pain Interference - Short Form 6a, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 is the best outcome.

PROMIS measures are validated, reliable measures of health states that can be completed with minimal patient burden and have been used in myriad studies of both older adults and cancer patients., 24 weeks|Change in Sleep Disturbance, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for sleep disturbance will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Item Bank v1.0 - Sleep Disturbance - Short Form 6a, using a scale of 1-5, where 1 or 5 is the best outcome, depending on the question.

PROMIS measures are validated, reliable measures of health states that can be completed with minimal patient burden and have been used in myriad studies of both older adults and cancer patients., 24 weeks|Change in Global Quality of Life, Quality of Life will be measured at baseline, after the 12-week intervention, and after 24 weeks using the Global Quality of Life (QOL) scale of 1-5, where 5 is the best outcome., 24 weeks|Treatment Outcomes, Medical record review will be performed to examine treatment(s) administered and treatment delays., 3 years|Treatment Complications, Medical record review will be performed to monitor complications of systemic treatment., 3 years|Healthcare Utilization, Medical record review will be performed to monitor for hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and unscheduled clinic visits., 3 years|Survival Outcomes, Medical records will be reviewed for three years to monitor for cancer recurrence., 3 years|Adverse Events, The number of adverse events will be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v5.0., 3 years
Gynecologic cancers include ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers and represent 102,000 cases of cancer in the United States every year; 60% occur in women greater than age 60. Older patients with gynecologic cancers have higher rates of advanced stage at presentation, more aggressive histology and more commonly require adjuvant treatment with systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapies. This chemotherapy, as well as underlying cancer, cause accelerated aging and toxicity, leaving women vulnerable to functional decline, increased frailty, decreased health related quality of life, and ultimately, less systemic therapy completion and inferior cancer survival.

Physical activity has been shown to improve functional health, improve quality of life, slow aging, and decrease rates of frailty. In fact, physical activity, and the multi-system health benefits that result, is the most recommended frailty intervention. Physical activity interventions in cancer survivors reduce sedentary time, decrease functional decline, and lower mortality. Studies specific to patients on active cancer treatment are less common, however, several randomized trials have found less decline in cardiorespiratory fitness, less chemotherapy toxicity, and fewer chemotherapy dose reductions. Although older adults with gynecologic cancer have a high likelihood of benefit from physical activity, challenges exist in accessing current interventions. Traditional in-person strenuous physical activity interventions with static goals may not be appropriate for older women undergoing chemotherapy, where symptom burden is high and varied, and healthcare visits frequent.

Remotely delivered mobile health (mHealth) technology-based physical activity interventions increase physical activity in diverse populations including those with metastatic cancer. Four evidence-based strategies to increase physical activity have demonstrated efficacy in cancer patients and older adults, including, 1) symptom burden tailored goal setting 2) exercise partners 3) oncology provider engagement and 4) coaching. This study will determine which components of a physical activity intervention (Fit4Treatment) meaningfully contribute to improving physical activity (steps) among older women with gynecologic cancer receiving systemic treatment such as chemotherapy.
