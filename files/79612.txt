Study of IDE196 in Patients with Solid Tumors Harboring GNAQ/11 Mutations or PRKC Fusions
This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label basket study designed to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of IDE196 in patients with solid tumors harboring GNAQ or GNA11 (GNAQ/11) mutations or PRKC fusions, including metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM), cutaneous melanoma, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors.

Phase 1 (dose escalation - monotherapy) will assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IDE196 via standard dose escalation scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Safety and anti-tumor activity will be assessed in the Phase 2 (dose expansion) part of the study.

Phase 1 (dose escalation - binimetib combination) will assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IDE196 and binimetinib via standard dose escalation scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Safety and anti-tumor activity will be assessed in the Phase 2 (dose expansion) part of the study.

Phase 1 (dose escalation - crizotinib combination) will assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IDE196 and crizotinib via standard dose escalation scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Safety and anti-tumor activity will be assessed in the Phase 2 (dose expansion) part of the study. Evaluation of safety and efficacy across multiple doses may be explored in the dose optimization part of the study.

Crizotinib monotherapy with crossover to combination cohort may be assessed for safety and to show the contribution of each study drug to anti-tumor activity.

As of Protocol Amendment 10, Phase 1, Phase 2 dose expansion in IDE196 monotherapy, and Phase 2 dose expansion of IDE196 in combination with binimetinib have been fully enrolled. There were no patients enrolled in the crizotinib monotherapy cohorts.
