Upfront Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors With Deferred Cytoreductive Nephrectomy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Study Objective: To determine the efficacy of upfront immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy in treating metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

Primary Endpoint: Pathological Major Response (MPR), defined as the percentage of residual tumor cells \<10% in the primary tumor after nephrectomy.

Study Design:

Population: Participants meeting the diagnostic criteria with biopsy-proven clear cell renal cell carcinoma, IMDC score ≤3, or ≤5 metastatic lesions involving ≤3 organs.

Sample Size: 20 participants.

Patient Grouping: Non-randomized.

Interventions: Eligible participants will receive upfront treatment with a combination of Axitinib and Toripalimab for 4 cycles. After 2 cycles of treatment, radiological assessment will be conducted using RECIST 1.1 criteria. If disease progression is observed, the clinical trial will be terminated, and second-line treatment will be initiated according to guidelines. If disease progression is not observed, treatment will continue for 2 additional cycles followed by repeat radiological assessment before undergoing surgery.
