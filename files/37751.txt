Prevention and Treatment of Pyrrolitinib-associated Diarrhea
In this study, patients taking pyrrolitinib alone or combined with pyrrolitinib were recruited (170 cases of secondary prevention and 300 cases of non-secondary prevention).

Non-secondary prevention: Explore the recovery time of oral loperamide 4mg T.I.D. for pyrrolitinib induced diarrhea of 1-2 degrees.

Secondary prevention: To explore the incidence of grade 3 and above diarrhea during c1D1-C1D22 in patients with oral loperamide 4 mg, T.I.D. (D1-7) →4 mg, B.I.D. (D8-21).
