Study of Physiological and High Dose Estradiol in the Treatment of Hormone Receptor Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study aims to examine whether estradiol is an appropriate for future Phase 3 studies as second or third line endocrine treatment. In addition the protocol explores several approaches to enhance the safety of estrogen therapy, including the establishment of the efficacy of a lower dose than that currently recommended and through the early identification of non-responders to avoid drug exposure in patients who are unlikely to benefit to estrogen treatment.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Estradiol
Clinical Benefit Rate (CR Plus PR Plus SD), Complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) using RECIST 1.0

CR = disappearance of all target lesions

PR = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter

SD = neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease

SD is defined as lack of disease progression by 24 weeks., 24 weeks after start of treatment
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from treatment initiation to disease progression or death.

Time of last observation for patients remaining in the study and the time at which dose reductions, study drug termination, and withdrawal of consent occurred were treated as censored data.

Indicated as number of participants who had not progressed at 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 48 weeks.

Progression per RECIST 1.0 = at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 48 weeks|Quality of Life, Surveyed using a 6 item estrogen adverse effect questionnaire (headaches, bloating, breast tenderness, retention of fluid, nausea, and vomiting).

Used a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

The scores from the 6 estrogen adverse effect items were summed to produce a single score, ranging from 0-24, with higher scores indicating higher adverse effects., Baseline and Day 28|Quality of Life (FACT-B Mean Score), Surveyed using the multidimensional Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire

The FACT-B (version 4) questionnaire consists of 36 items with five-point scale, ranging from 0-4, where a total score ranges from 0-144 and higher scores indicate better QoL. The total FACT-B score is the sum of scores for five subscales including: physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items), and specific breast cancer concerns (9 items)., Day 28|Frequency of Response to Re-treatment With the Same Aromatase Inhibitor That Immediately Preceded Treatment With Estradiol on Protocol., Best overall response, 12 weeks post-treatment termination|Frequency of Response to Re-treatment With Estradiol for Patients Who Have a Secondary Response to an Aromatase Inhibitor After the First Response to Estradiol., Every 3 months|Overall Survival (OS), Until patient death
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two doses (6 mg and 30 mg) of Estradiol, a type of estrogen. This and other forms of estrogen used at doses much higher than those used for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy have been shown to cause tumor growth stabilization or shrinkage in patients with breast cancer.
