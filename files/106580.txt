Clinical Study of Lung Protective Ventilation Strategies and Tumor Microenvironment
This study will be conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. Sixty colorectal cancer(CRC) patients are randomized into traditional ventilation strategy group (control group) and lung protective ventilation strategy group (experimental group), there were 30 cases in each group. The control group adopted conventional ventilation strategy; the experimental group used lung protective ventilation strategy. 4ml of central venous blood was extracted at 3 time points within 24h, and relevant experimental indexes were determined. Observe the effect of lung protective ventilation strategy on the microenvironment of tumor inflammation and related hematological indexes in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Follow-up frailty score and quality of recovery score at 1,3,6, and 12 months after surgery (QoR-15 score scale).

Comprehensive blood index, Values for NLDA (NLDA = neutrophil count/lymphocyte count × D-dimer count/albumin), 10 minutes before anesthesia and 24 hours after the procedure|Comprehensive blood index, Values for PDM (PDM = platelet× D-dimer count), 10 minutes before anesthesia and 24 hours after the procedure|Comprehensive blood index, Values for SII (SII= platelet× neutrophil / lymphocyte count), 10 minutes before anesthesia and 24 hours after the procedure|Comprehensive blood index, Values for PNI (PNI = albumin + 5 × lymphocytes), 10 minutes before anesthesia and 24 hours after the procedure
This study will be conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University. Sixty CRC patients are randomized into traditional ventilation strategy group (control group) and lung protective ventilation strategy group (experimental group), there were 30 cases in each group. The control group adopted conventional ventilation strategies: tidal volume (VT)=10-12 ml/kg, respiratory rate ( f)=12 breaths / minute, positive end expiratory pressure（PEEP）=0 cmH₂O, fraction of inspired oxygen =0.5; the experimental group used lung protective ventilation strategies: tidal volume ( VT)=6-8 ml/kg, f=12 breaths / minute, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)=6-8 cmH₂O, fraction of inspired oxygen =0.5, mechanical ventilation every 30 minutes (continuous positive airway pressure 30 cmH₂O about 30 seconds). 4 ml of central venous blood was extracted at 3 time points within 24h, and relevant experimental indexes were determined. Observe the effect of lung protective ventilation strategy on the microenvironment of tumor inflammation and related hematological indexes NLDA, PDM, SII and PNI in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Follow-up frailty score and quality of recovery score at 1,3,6, and 12 months after surgery (QoR-15 score scale).
