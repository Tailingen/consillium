Thalidomide 100 mg/Day Versus Thalidomide 400 mg/Day in Relapse Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The objective of this study is to show that thalidomide at a dose of 100 mg/d (with remedial treatment with dexamethasone if a progression occurs) is equivalent in terms of efficacy with thalidomide at 400 mg/d (with remedial treatment with dexamethasone if a progression occurs) in the treatment of refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma after at least two courses of treatment. The use of thalidomide at 100 mg/d should reduce the side effects and improve the safety of the treatment.
