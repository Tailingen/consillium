Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy is one of the important means for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. A multicenter randomized controlled study has confirmed that modified FOLFOX hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy can significantly improve the prognosis of patients with advanced liver cancer and prolong the survival period of patients. The 2020 edition of CSCO guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer has recommended oxaliplatin based FOLFOX arterial infusion regimen as the first-line treatment of advanced liver cancer. FOLFOX regimen is safe and effective, but fluorouracil needs more than 46 hours of long-term infusion, patients have difficulty in moving during catheterization, and increase the risk of thrombosis, so it is urgent to find a short-term infusion of fluorouracil. As a new antimetabolic drug, raltitrexed can be used for short-term infusion, and its plasma concentration half-life is longer than that of fluorouracil. Previous studies have shown that compared with FOLFOX arterial infusion regimen, oxaliplatin combined with raltitrexed regimen has longer overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. In addition, as an advanced liver cancer, lenvastinib has been recommended as a targeted drug for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC. This study intends to explore the efficacy and safety of modified FOLFOX regimen compared with oxaliplatin combined with raltitrexed (Rox regimen) in the treatment of lenvastinib combined with HAIC, so as to provide more clinical schemes for further improving the survival rate of patients with advanced liver cancer.
