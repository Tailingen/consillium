Phase II Trial of Tunlametinib in NRAS-Mutant Advanced Thyroid Cancer
This phase II trial evaluates Tunlametinib (MEK inhibitor) ± PD-1 in NRAS-mutant advanced thyroid cancer.

Key Objectives:

Assess efficacy (ORR by RECIST v1.1) Evaluate safety profiles

Study Design:

Single-arm, single-center 4 cohorts based on:

* Histology (differentiated vs. poorly/undifferentiated)
* Prior therapy status

Treatment:

* Cohorts 1-2: Tunlametinib monotherapy (12mg BID)
* Cohorts 3-4: Tunlametinib + PD-1 (commercially available)

Key Procedures:

Screening: NRAS testing + full staging (CT/MRI/PET) Monitoring: q3-week labs, q9-week imaging Follow-up: 30-day safety visit + q3-month survival tracking

Endpoints:

Primary: ORR Secondary: Safety (CTCAE), PFS, DoR

Unique Aspects:

First study targeting NRAS in thyroid cancer with MEK+PD-1 Includes rare aggressive subtypes (poorly/undifferentiated)
Radioactive Iodine-refractory, Differentiated Thyroid Cancer With NRAS Mutation|Advanced PDTC or ATC With NRAS Mutation
DRUG: Tunlametinib|DRUG: Tunlametinib+PD-1 mAb
Objective Response Rate, Complete remission rate and partial remission rate, up to approximately 3-5 years

Research Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tunlametinib (monotherapy or in combination with PD-1 mAb) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NRAS-mutant thyroid cancer.

Study Endpoints:

Primary Endpoint:

Objective response rate (ORR) assessed per RECIST v1.1 (sum of partial and complete response rates).

Secondary Endpoints:

Efficacy:

Disease control rate (DCR) Duration of response (DoR) Time to response (TTR) Progression-free survival (PFS) Overall survival (OS), 6-month survival rate, 12-month survival rate

Safety:

Adverse events (AEs): Type, incidence, severity (graded by NCI-CTCAE v5.0), duration, and relationship to study treatment

Study Design:

This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-center Phase II exploratory trial evaluating Tunlametinib ± PD-1 mAb in NRAS-mutant thyroid cancer.

Study Phases:

Screening: ≤28 days prior to enrollment (informed consent to baseline assessments).

Treatment: Until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or investigator decision.

Follow-up:

Safety visit at 30 days (±7) post-treatment. Survival follow-up every 3 months (telephone/medical records).

Cohorts \& Treatment:

Cohort 1 (n=10): Untreated, radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer.

Cohort 2 (n=10): Previously treated, radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer.

Regimen: Tunlametinib 12 mg BID (3-week cycles).

Cohort 3 (n=10): Untreated, poorly differentiated/anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Cohort 4 (n=10): Previously treated, poorly differentiated/anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Regimen: Tunlametinib 12 mg BID + PD-1 mAb(commercially available; per approved labeling).

Dose Adjustments:

Tunlametinib: Stepwise reduction (12 mg → 9 mg → 6 mg BID) for intolerance. Re-escalation permitted if toxicity resolves (e.g., 6 mg → 9 mg after ≥6 weeks).

PD-1: Adjusted per investigator judgment and drug labeling.

Efficacy Assessments:

Imaging (CT/MRI) every 9 weeks (3 cycles) per RECIST v1.1. Real-time ORR analysis by investigators and sponsor (Shanghai Kezhou Pharmaceutical).

Follow-up Procedures:

Safety visit: Day 30 (±7) post-treatment (vitals, labs, AE assessment). Survival follow-up: Quarterly until death/loss to follow-up/study termination.
