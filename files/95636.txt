Blinatumomab for Treatment of R/R or MRD-positive CD19-Positive MPAL
This is a research study to find out if a drug called blinatumomab is effective for treating patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) or measurable residual disease (MRD) CD19-positive mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL). Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) means that there are a small number of cancer cells remaining after treatment
Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL)|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD)
DRUG: BLINCYTO (Blinatumomab)
Cohort A response rate, The rate of achievement of CR+CRh after the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab in Cohort A subjects, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Cohort B response rate, The rate of achievement of MRD-negativity (\< 0.01%) after the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab in Cohort B subjects, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Cohort A survival, To evaluate the following outcomes in subjects with R/R CD19-positive MPAL

* Achievement of MRD \< 0.01% within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab
* Relapsed free survival (RFS)
* Event free survival (EFS)
* Overall survival (OS)
* Proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after blinatumomab treatment
* Overall incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)
* CD19-negative and CD19-positive relapse post-blinatumomab
* The type of lineage switch, as applicable, post-blinatumomab
* CD19 expression in CSF relapse following blinatumomab, as applicable
* CAR T-cell treatment of subjects with CSF relapse following blinatumomab and those subjects' outcomes, as applicable, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Cohort B survival, To evaluate the following outcomes in subjects with CD19-positive MPAL in CR/CRh/CRi/CRp after at least one chemotherapy block of standard ALL or AML treatment and detectable MRD at a level of ≥ 0.1% using an assay with a minimum sensitivity of 0.01%

* Achievement of undetectable MRD (\< 0.01%) within one cycle of blinatumomab treatment
* RFS
* OS
* Proceeding to allo-HSCT after blinatumomab treatment
* Overall incidence and severity of AEs, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
CD 19 measurement, - Measurement of CD19 trafficking, as a potential mechanism of resistance to blinatumomab by performing flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, next generation mRNA sequencing of CD19, CD81, and CD21 exons, through study completion, an average of 1 year|CD3-positive measurement, - Measurement of CD3-positive T-cells subset as well as function/activity to assess T-cell exhaustion, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Leukemic blasts evaluation, - Evaluate changes to immunophenotypic characteristics of leukemic blasts in subjects whose disease do not respond to blinatumomab, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Subject response evaluation, - Evaluate subject responses according to disease-specific features in blasts such as chromosomal amplifications and rearrangements as well as somatic mutations as necessary, through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study evaluating the efficacy of blinatumomab to achieve the following objectives:

1. The best morphologic response after the first two cycles of therapy in subjects with morphologic R/R CD19-positive MPAL
2. MRD-negativity in subjects with CD19-positive MPAL in CR, or CRh, or CRi or CRp after receiving at least one chemotherapy block of standard ALL or AML treatment with MRD-positivity at a level of ≥ 0.1% using an assay with a minimum sensitivity of 0.01%

The trial consists two groups (Group A and B) and three phases ( induction, consolidation and maintenance) of therapy. Subject will receive study drug blinatumomab by continuous IV infusion (CIV). Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days of blinatumomab CIV followed by a 14±3 days treatment-free interval for induction, 28±3 days treatment-free interval for consolidation, and 56±3 days treatment-free interval for maintenance

Blinatumomab is approved by Food and Drug Administration \[FDA\] and European Medicines Agency \[EMA\] for use in people with another type of acute leukemia called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but not MPAL.
