Mindful Movement in Women Receiving Adjuvant or Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer
The investigators hypothesize that a personalized yoga program with mindful movement implemented during breast cancer therapy will benefit women in multiple ways. The investigators predict that women participating in the program will experience less weight gain and fatigue and will have an improved quality of life compared to women not participating in the program. The investigators predict that this will be associated with decreased markers of inflammation. The investigators will also evaluate whether there is improved pathologic response rate compared to historical controls. This study will provide pilot data for a larger randomized controlled trial assessing whether program can provide long-term improvement in quality of life, weight maintenance, and the serum and tumor changes correlating with a reduced risk of recurrence and mortality.
