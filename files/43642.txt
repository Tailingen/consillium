A Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C]ASP8273 in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a study to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion of \[14C\] labeled ASP8273 in subjects with solid tumors harboring EGFR mutations (per local testing). This study consists of two parts (A and B).

Clinical laboratory evaluations include hematology, chemistry and urinalysis., Up to 36 months
This study consists of two parts (A and B).

In Part A, eligible subjects will be admitted to the site on day -1 and remain confined at the site until postdosing discharge criteria are met. Subjects will receive a single dose of \[14C\] ASP8273 solution on study day 1.

Once Part A has been completed, subjects may elect to continue participation in Part B. Subjects will receive oral administration of ASP8273 (nonradiolabeled) once daily in 28-day cycles.
