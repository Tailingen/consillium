Neuroendocrine Mechanisms in Adiposity: An Integrated Approach to the Characterization of Potential Pharmacological Novel Targets Based on Experimental and Clinical Models
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate, retrospectively and prospectively, the effect of different hormonal and neuropeptide dysfunctions on the body composition of patients suffering from hypothalamic-pituitary pathologies, and to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of surgical and medical treatments with agonists and antagonists of hypothalamic neuropeptides, currently available, on the development and treatment of adiposity and negative cross-talk between adiposity and muscle/bone tissue
