IBI3001 in Participants With Unresectable, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 multicenter, multi-regional, open-label, first-in-human study of IBI3001 in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to identify the MTD/RP2D of IBI3001, and to explore the preliminary efficacy of IBI3001.
