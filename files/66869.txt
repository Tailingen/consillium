Thymosin Alpha 1, Interferon Alpha, or Both, in Combination With Dacarbazine in Patients With Malignant Melanoma
The purpose of the study is to test safety and efficacy of different doses of thymosin alpha 1 (1.6 mg, 3.2 mg, and 6.4 mg) in combination with dacarbazine and with or without Interferon alpha in treating patients affected by stage IV melanoma.

Primary end-point is Tumor Response evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary end-points are Overall Survival and Progression Free Survival.

Ninety-five patients are allocated to each arm to test the hypothesis that P0 \<= 0.05 vs the alternative hypothesis that P1 \>= 0.15 (alpha = 5%, within-group statistical analysis beta = 95%).

Overall Tumor Response, Tumor response is measured according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) computing number of Complete Response plus Partial Response, 1 year
Overall Survival, The survival time for each patient is defined as the time between randomization and death. Patients lost to follow-up or still alive at the date of last evaluation have been censored., 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization to progression or death, 2 years
