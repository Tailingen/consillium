Cognitive impairments (such as problems with attention, executive functions, memory and language abilities) are common in people with brain metastases as a result of disease and/or treatment effects. These impairments can significantly limit functional independence, participation in valued roles and activities, and overall quality of life.

Building on research in other cognitively-impaired populations, we designed a brief, structured, patient-centered Cognitive Support Program (CSP) for brain metastases patients, who have the option of participating with a caregiver. Program contents include supportive psychoeducation, mindfulness practice, and strategy training (e.g., strategies to improve memory or concentration). This prospective, single-arm study will enroll 24 brain metastases patients to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the CSP. A battery of outcome measures is administered (1) prior to intervention, (2) after completing the CSP, and (3) after an additional 3 months to evaluate longer-term outcomes. Feasibility assessment will include program retention and adherence. Reliable change analyses will examine treatment effects, with regression analyses to explore moderating effects of select patient, disease and treatment factors (e.g., severity of baseline cognitive impairment, number of brain lesions, cranial radiation dose and distribution). Results of this trial will inform further development and implementation of evidence-based supportive care for cognitively-impaired brain metastases patients.
