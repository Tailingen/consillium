Colorectal Metastasis and Liver Transplantation With Organs From Deceased Donors
MELODIC trial is an prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, parallel trial, aimed at assessing the efficacy (in terms of overall survival: OS) of liver transplantation (LT) in unresecable CRC liver-only metastases, compared with a matched cohort of patients bearing the same tumor characteristics, and treated with chemotherapy. Synthesis of Inclusion parameters: "10;10;10;100"
