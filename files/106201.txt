Validation of FDG-PET Segmentation Tools for Tumor Delineation by Correlation of CT- and FDG-PET Volume Measurements With Histopathology of Nodal Metastases of Head and Neck Carcinomas.
Various methods of FDG-PET signal segmentation will be validated by correlation of histopathologically measured tumor dimensions in lymph node dissection specimens of head-and-neck cancer patients.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: CT-FDG/PET scan of the head-and-neck region
How accurate are the various FDG-PET segmentation tools?, Measurements are performed in conjunction with the clinical pathologist directly postoperatively.
