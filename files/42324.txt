Bortezomib and Vorinostat in Younger Patients With Refractory or Relapsed MLL Rearranged Hematologic Malignancies
This study will test the safety and effectiveness of adding bortezomib and vorinostat to other chemotherapy drugs commonly used to treat relapsed or refractory leukemia. Both drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat other cancers in adults, but they have not yet been approved tor treatment younger patients with leukemia.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

* To estimate the overall response rate of patients with MLL rearranged (MLLr) hematologic malignancies receiving bortezomib and vorinostat in combination with a chemotherapy backbone.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

* Estimate event-free and overall-survival.
* Describe toxicities experienced by participants during treatment.

OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES

* To identify all genomic lesions by comprehensive whole genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing on all patients.
* To compare minimal residual disease (MRD) results by three modalities: flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and deep sequencing.

Overall Response Rate in All Participants, For the purpose of the statistical analysis of the primary objective, response is assessed at the end of first treatment block at maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat (i.e., Induction Ia or Ib for myeloid and Induction for lymphoid and mixed lineage). Any eligible patient who starts first treatment block is considered evaluable. Response of CR, CRi, PR, or PRi is considered a success; otherwise a failure, which will include the cases of No-response, as well as off- treatment or off-study before response can be assessed, except cases found ineligible after enrollment. A patient found ineligible after enrollment will be taken off study and replaced by enrolling an additional MLLr patient.

The rate (probability) of response will be estimated by the sample proportion of patients who responded (CR, CRi, PR, PRi) to Induction, along with the 99% confidence interval and lower confidence bound. Three interim analyses will be performed to monitor the possible lack of efficacy., End of first treatment block (up to 2 months)
Number of Participants With 3 Year Event Free Survival (EFS), All eligible patients who started the treatment will be included in this analysis. Patients later found ineligible will be replaced and excluded from the estimation. In addition to death for any reason, no-response (i.e., other than CR, CRi, PR or PRi), off-treatment or off-study (except for the reason of being found ineligible), disease progression, relapse, and second malignancies will be considered as failures. The time to EFS will be set to 0 for patients who fail to respond.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the OS and EFS functions will be computed, along with estimates of standard errors by the method of Peto. Three-year OS and EFS rates, as well as longer term survival rates (5 year and 10 year) will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals., Three years after the last enrollment|Number of Participants With 5- Year Event Free Survival, All eligible patients who started the treatment will be included in this analysis. Patients later found ineligible will be replaced and excluded from the estimation. In addition to death for any reason, no-response (i.e., other than CR, CRi, PR or PRi), off-treatment or off-study (except for the reason of being found ineligible), disease progression, relapse, and second malignancies will be considered as failures.

All toxicities will be monitored until the completion of therapy (up to 500 days) for patients that do not go on to bone marrow transplant. If a patient goes on to receive a bone marrow transplant, at that point, they will no longer be monitored for toxicity, as any further toxicities may be secondary to the transplant and not the study regimen.

This outcome reports those toxicities that are that were possibly, probably or definitely related to therapy. Participants were separately monitored for frequency of grade 5 events, grade 4 sepsis, grade 4 hemorrhage, and grade 4 hepatic toxicity across all patients in the stratum. Grade 4 and 5 events that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes or disease progression will be excluded. Higher grade events are considered more severe than lower grade., From on-therapy date up to 18 months
Frequency of Identified Genomic Lesions, Frequencies of the identified lesions will be described by counts and proportions. An established method (Pounds et al., 2013) will be applied to identify genes and pathways frequently hit by the genomic lesions., Once at enrollment|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), MRD will be monitored until the completion of therapy (up to 500 days) for patients that do not go on to bone marrow transplant. If a patient goes on to receive a bone marrow transplant, at that point, they will no longer be monitored for minimal residual disease.

Concordance and associations of the MRD levels across three modalities (flow cytometry, PCR, and deep sequencing) as continuous measurements will be assessed by Pearson's and Spearman's correlations and Kendall's tau; MRD levels categorized into ordinal values will be analyzed by contingency tables with or without ordered margins., Various time points until completion of therapy (up to 18 months)
All participants will undergo diagnostic lumbar puncture and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy \[Cytarabine, methotrexate, hydrocortisone (ITMHA)\] prior to cycle 1. Throughout all phases of therapy, dexrazoxane will be given as supportive care for all participants prior to receiving mitoxantrone or doxorubicin.
