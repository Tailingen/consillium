Vitamin D for Women at Increased Risk of Developing Ovarian, Fallopian, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose of this research is to study Vitamin D3 replacement for patients at high risk of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, and see if the Vitamin D3 replacement may be able to prevent the cancer.

This study is being done because in the United States ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. Women with BRCA mutations, a personal history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast and ovarian cancer are at high risk of developing ovarian, fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancer. Novel treatments other than surgery which can decrease the risk of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are important. Vitamin D has been shown to reduce the risk of developing bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, gallbladder, gastric, lung, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, renal, vulvar and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it may play a role in the prevention of ovarian cancer.

The Outcomes That Will be Measured for the Primary Objectives of This Study Will be Surrogate Endpoint Biomarkers Markers of Cancer Prevention, Activation of apoptosis via immunohistochemical measurement of activation of caspase activity, as well as expression of BAX and BCL-2 The primary marker outcomes will be assessed for normality and compared between groups using a two-sample t-test or a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Other markers will be compared similarly if continuous, or by Fisher's exact test if categorical., Up to 24 months|Other Surrogate Endpoint Biomarkers Markers of Cancer Prevention, Decrease in cellular proliferation measured by immunohistochemistry staining with KI67, Up to 24 months
Review of Standard Pathologic Evaluation With Specific Attention to Histologic Markers, The outcomes that will be measured for the secondary objectives of this study will include the following:

Review of standard pathologic evaluation with specific attention to histologic markers including serous hyperplasia, tubal atypia, and p53 signature in the ovary and fallopian tube, and examine via immunohistochemistry the effects of vitamin D supplementation on expression of the TGF-beta isoforms and CYP24, Up to 24 months|Review of the Differences in the Types and Incidence of Toxicities Associated With Vitamin D3 Replacement., Differences in the types and incidence of toxicities associated with Vitamin D3 replacement, specifically hypercalcemia, with increasing levels of Vitamin D3 along with the effectiveness of Vitamin D3 supplementation on increasing serum levels of Vitamin D, Up to 24 months
