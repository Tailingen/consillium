Impact of HPV Vaccination on HPV Infection and Cervical Related Disease Burden in Real-World Settings (HPV-RWS)
Take AS04 adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine as an example to evaluate the impact of HPV vaccination on HPV infection and related disease burden in the real world based on prospective cohort and Yinzhou Regional Health Information Platform (YRHIP), in order to bridge the gap in relevant evidence in China.
