VERIFY: Vedolizumab for the Prevention of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Related Diarrhea or Colitis in Patients With Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the prevention of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) related diarrhea/colitis using vedolizumab in participants with unresectable stage III or metastatic stage IV cancer, starting standard of care (SOC) immunotherapy
Cancer|Cancer Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: Vedolizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Hazard Ratio of Patients achieving ICI-related diarrhea and colitis-free survival a 6-months, ICI-related diarrhea and colitis will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and a grade ≥2 will be considered an event., Start of immunotherapy therapy and for 6 months
Proportion of patients with histologically confirmed colitis-free survival at 6 months, Colitis-free survival will be defined as CTCAE grade ≥2 based on a biopsy taken at time of patient meeting the primary endpoint or at 6 months., 6 months|Proportion of patients with severe diarrhea or colitis at 6 months, Severe diarrhea or colitis will be defined as CTCAE grade ≥3, 6 months|Hazard Ratio of patients with diarrhea or colitis after 6 months, Diarrhea or colitis will be defined as CTCAE grade ≥2, 6-12 months|Total average dose of checkpoint inhibitor therapy received within 6 and 12 months, The total average dose of ICI therapy will be used, 0 to 6 months; and 0 to 12 months|Proportion of participants who require temporary ICI discontinuation due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), Temporary discontinuation of ICI therapy will be defined as any delay of 1-week or more resulting from an immune-related adverse event (irAE), as identified and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0)., 0 to 12 months|Proportion of participants who require permanent ICI discontinuation due to irAEs, Permanent discontinuation of ICI therapy will be defined as stopping ICI therapy, and not restarting within the 1-year time window of the trial resulting from an immune-related adverse event (irAE), as identified and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0)., 0 to 12 months|Proportion of patients requiring rescue corticosteroids for ICI related diarrhea/colitis, Any patient who receives rescue corticosteroids within the first 6 months or within the first 12 months will be considered an event., at 6-months and 12-months|Total average prednisone equivalent dose of rescue corticosteroids required, The prednisone equivalent dose will be calculated using the following conversions:

Cortisone 5mg = Prednisone 1mg Hydrocortisone 4mg = Prednisone 1mg Prednisolone 1mg = Prednisone 1mg Methylprednisolone 0.8mg = Prednisone 1mg Dexamethasone 0.15mg = Prednisone 1mg, at 6-months and 12-months|Proportion of participants requiring all-cause hospitalization by Day +180 and Day +365, Chart review will be used to identify hospitalizations., at day 180 and 365|Proportion of participants requiring ICI-related diarrhea/colitis-specific hospitalization by Day +180 and Day +365, Chart review will be used to identify hospitalization and determine the cause of hospitalization., at day 180; at day 365|Mean change in the EuroQol EQ-5D instrument at Day +180 and Day +365 compared to baseline, The EuroQol EQ-5D is a validated questionnaire for patients with inflammatory bowel disease., baseline to day 180; baseline to day 365|Overall survival (measured as death) at +180 and Day +365 compared to baseline, All-cause mortality will be used to compare the survival rate of the therapy and placebo arms. The rates will be calculated for 6 months (defined at day 180) and 1-year (day 365)., Day +180 and Day +365|Progression-free survival at 6- and 12-months, defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), v1.176, Progression-free survival will be defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), v1.176, At Day +180 and Day +365|Proportion of participants experiencing any adverse events (AEs), Adverse events will be defined as described in good clinical practice., At Day +180 and Day +365|Proportion of participants experiencing serious AEs, Serious adverse events will be defined as described in good clinical practice., At Day +180 and Day +365|Proportion of participants experiencing other irAEs, Adverse events will be defined as described in good clinical practice. Those that are immune related will be used for this outcome., At Day +180 and Day +365
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo up to a 2-week screening period to confirm their eligibility. Eligible patients will be randomized in a double-blind manner (participant and investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to Vedolizumab or placebo and given their first dose within 2 weeks of starting their SOC immunotherapy. Vedolizumab or placebo will be administered at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22.
