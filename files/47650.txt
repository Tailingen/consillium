Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Cetuximab for EGFR Wild Type Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
A number of pilot studies had shown high rate of complete resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone for local advanced rectal cancer(LARC), but they did not increase the ratio of pathological complete response (pCR) which was associated with improvement of overall survival (OS). On the other hand,some clinical trials show that triple active cytotoxic agents (Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, FOLFOXIRI) combined with cetuximab for EGFR wild type metastatic colorectal cancer had more effective than double agents.Therefore,a hypothesis is the FOLFOXIRI+Cetuximab as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen might improve the patient's ratio of pCR.

This is a multicenter, phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of triplet regimen (FOLFOXIRI) combined with cetuximab for patients with EGFR wild type LARC. After 4 cycles of FOLFOXIRI+cetuximab and 2 weeks later, the patients will be evaluated by senior radiologist, oncologist and surgeon through pelvic MRI, CT and Positron Emission Computed Tomography (PET-CT). The patients will go to surgery (TME) if the tumor response is good enough to have complete resection under the decision of the multidisciplinary team (MDT),otherwise, the patients will receive pelvic radiotherapy(45Grey/25Fraction and 5.4Grey/3Fraction boost to the tumor bed) combined with capecitabine(625 mg/m²,bid po,d1-5,qw), and additional four cycles of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or Oxaliplatin 135mg/m²plus Capecitabine 1.0/m², bid po(XELOX) of each 3 weeks cycle for 2 cycles chemotherapy before TME. All patients will receive 6-8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 4-5 cycles XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy after TME.

FOLFOXIRI+Cetuximab Irinotecan 165 mg/m² + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² + leucovorin 200 mg/m² + 5-FU 2800 mg/m² cont. inf. 46h + Cetuximab 500 mg/m²,all on day 1 of each 2 weeks cycle for 4-6 cycles,
