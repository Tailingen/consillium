CD30 CAR T-cells Post AutoHSCT for Poor-risk Hodgkin Lymphoma
Patients with poor risk classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) will undergo myeloablative chemotherapy (MAC) with autologous stem cell transplantation (AutoHSCT) and subsequently receive autologous CD30+ CAR T-cells.
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD30 CAR T-cell
Safety of administering CAR T-cells, To evaluate the incidence of adverse events related to autologous CD30+ CAR T-cell infusions including not limited to infusions related reactions (IRR) (CTCAE 5.0), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (ASCTC), and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) (ASCTC) and all general grade 3-5 toxicities (CTCAE 5.0) in children, adolescent, and young adult patients with poor-risk CD30+ cHL following MAC AutoHSCT., 2 years|Feasibility of Central Manufacturing of CAR T-cells, To evaluate the feasibility of local site PBMC collection and central GMP CD30 CAR T cell manufacturing with a 75% success rate in children, adolescent, and young adult patients with poor-risk CD30+ cHL following MAC AutoHSCT., 1 year
Eligible patients will be screened for study entry and proceed to cell procurement at local sites with collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CD30+ CAR T-cell manufacturing at UNC. Patients will then have autologous stem cells collected (PBSC) and stored for future AutoHSCT.

After another screening for MAC+AutoHSCT, patients who meet criteria will receive BEAM conditioning followed by AutoHSCT. About 21-42 day after the autologous stem cell infusion, patients will receive their autologous CD30+ CAR T-cell infusion, if they meet subsequent pre CD30+ CAR T-cell eligibility criteria.
