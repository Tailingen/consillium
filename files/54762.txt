UARK 2003-25: A Study of Intravenous (IV) Busulfan (Busulfex®) in Multiple Myeloma Patients
The purpose of this study is to find out if patients with high risk disease because of age or kidney status can be treated more safely with a drug called Busulfex® followed by autologous transplant compared to treatment with the standard drug called melphalan, which has been shown to be quite difficult to tolerate in patients with poor kidney function and patients over the age of 65 when given in high doses.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Busulfan
Maximal Dose of Busulfex® Given in a 2, 3, or 4 Day Period With Acceptable Toxicity to Myeloma Patients, maximal dose of Busulfex® that can be given in a two, three, or four day period with acceptable toxicity to myeloma patients, who either are \> or = 65 years of age or have renal insufficiency, defined as creatinine \> 3g/dL or creatinine clearance \< 30 ml/min, three years
This trial will determine the maximal dose of Busulfex® that can be given in a two, three, or four day period with acceptable toxicity to myeloma patients, who either are \> or = 65 years of age or have renal insufficiency, defined as creatinine \> 3g/dL or creatinine clearance \< 30 ml/min.
