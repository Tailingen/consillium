A Study of LY2801653 in Advanced Cancer
Part A- The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY2801653 to be given to participants with advanced cancer and to determine any side effects that may be associated with LY2801653 in this participant population. Efficacy measures will be used to assess the activity of LY2801653.

Part B- The dose determined in Part A will be used along with efficacy measures to assess the activity of LY2801653 in participants with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), uveal melanoma with liver metastasis, and cholangiocarcinoma.

Part C - the objective of Part C is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with HNSCC when taken with standard doses of cetuximab Part D - the objective of Part D is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with a standard dose of cisplatin.

Part E - the objective of Part E is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

Part F - the objective of Part F is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that may be safely given to participants with gastric cancer when taken with ramucirumab.
