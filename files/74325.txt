Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4 or N+) are assigned to receive preoperative 5 Ã— 5 Gy irradiation over 5 days with consolidation chemotherapy consisting two cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug for two cycles. Subsequent surgical therapy is performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy.
