A Phase I Study of BR115 for Injection Alone in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, single-arm and first-in-human clinical study of BR115 for injection. The study objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, anti-tumor activity and immunogenicity of BR115 for injection in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

Patients will receive two doses at the first week of treatment, followed by once per week until intolerable toxicity, disease progression, pregnancy, withdrawal of informed consent, death, study discontinuation, or withdrawal from the study.
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: BR115 for injection
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following Treatment With BR115, Adverse events (AEs) will be assigned severity grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or date of documented unacceptable toxicity , assessed up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate, Defined as participants (who will achieve CR and PR) will be assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or date of documented unacceptable toxicity , assessed up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), TProgression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or date of documented unacceptable toxicity , assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) by independent central review is defined as the time interval from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to 2 years.|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR; defined as participants who will achieve CR, PR, and SD) will be assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or date of documented unacceptable toxicity , assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR)., Duration of response (DoR) by independent central review is defined as the time between the date of the first complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and PD as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or date of documented unacceptable toxicity , assessed up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of BR115 will be assessed., Cycle 1, Day1，Days 4 and Days 8: 0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours; 24 hours; Days 8:72 hours; Days 15: 0 hours; cycle2: Days 1,Days 8,Days 15; cycle3：Days1: 0 hours,4 hours,8 hours ,24 hours,72 hours ,Days 8;Cycle 4-n: Day 1: 0hours (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC), Area under the concentration-time curve of BR115 will be assessed, Cycle 1, Day1，Days 4 and Days 8: 0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours; 24 hours; Days 8:72 hours; Days 15: 0 hours; cycle2: Days 1,Days 8,Days 15; cycle3：Days1: 0 hours,4 hours,8 hours ,24 hours,72 hours ,Days 8;Cycle 4-n: Day 1: 0hours (each cycle is 21 days)|The anti-drug antibody (ADA), The anti-drug antibody (ADA) of BR115 will be assessed, Cycle 1, Day1: before first infusion; Days 8: before third infusion; Days 15: before fourth infusion; Cycle 2~n, Day 1: before first infusion ; (each cycle is 21 days)
