Renovated Prediction Model for Difficult Transoral and Submental Endoscopic Thyroidectomy
The investigators have previously proposed a prediction model for difficult transoral and submental thyroidectomy through a retrospective study. In order to better promote transoral and submental endoscopic approach for thyroid surgery and to set up an appropriate training course, the investigators aim to renovate and validate the prediction model through a prospective study.

a postoperative parathyroid hormone level of less than 10 pg/ml a postoperative parathyroid hormone level of less than 10 pg/ml, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of participants with mental nerve injury, a postoperative numbness in the lower lip and submental area, through study completion, an average of 1 year|operative time, operative time was defined as the duration from incision to closure, and was collected from anesthesia record sheet, immediately at the end of the surgery
hospitalization, days of hospitalization, Length of stay from hospitalisation to discharge|degree of pain, pain intensity was assessed using a standard visual analogue score, with a score of 0 to 10 corresponding to no pain to the most severe pain, approximately 4 hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1
Male sex, age, BMI, neck length and certain thyroid disease such as thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism have been long cited as indicators of a difficult thyroidectomy. The investiagtors hypothesized that neck extension was critical to the exposure and visualization of the surgical field in the endoscopic thyroidectomy. Therefore, several measurements were innovatedly integrated into the prediction model, including neck circumference, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, ratio of height-to-thyromental distance, ratio of height-to-sternomental distance.
