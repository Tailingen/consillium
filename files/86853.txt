Personalized Targeted Glioblastoma Therapies by ex Vivo Drug Screening
Patient derived cell line (PDC) -based drug screening will be applied to formulate a personalized treatment approach.

Overall survival time, Change in overall survival in patients receiving extensive diagnostic work up including the standard histology analysis and PDC- based drug screening in addition (interventional arm) compared to patients receiving only standard histology diagnostic work up (standard arm), From date of randomization until date of death from any cause or last follow up whichever came first, assessed up to 144 months
Feasibility of PDC-based drug screening, Number not interpretable results of the PDC-based drug screening; Number of interpretable results of the PDC-based drug screening, From date of randomization until date of communication of the tumor board outcome, asses up to 144 months|Comparison of Quality of life measurements, Difference between the interventional and the standard arm using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ- C30) and the brain cancer specific questionnaire (QLQ-BN20). The scale is from 0 to 100, with higher values reporting better quality of life., From date of randomization until date of death from any cause or last follow up whichever came first, assessed up to 144 months|Comparison of neurocognitive function scale, differences in neurocognitive function between the interventional and standard arms using the Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale, From date of randomization until date of death from any cause or last follow up whichever came first, assessed up to 144 months
Patient derived cell line (PDC) -based drug screening will be applied to formulate a personalized treatment approach. Patients will be randomized between the investigational group receiving in addition to standard histology analysis also the PDC-based drug screening and the standard group receiving only standard histology analysis. Outcome results will be compared in a randomized, interventional clinical performance study. The PDC-based drug screening will be performed only in accordance with the approved Performance Study Plan on subjects who have signed an informed consent form.
