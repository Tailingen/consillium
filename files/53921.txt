A Study on Efficacy and Safety of iNK Cells for CAEBV /EBV-HLH After Allo-HSCT
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNK cells infusion in patients with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) and EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)
CAEBV (Chronic Active Epstein-Barr Virus Infection) Syndrome|EBV|Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytoses
OTHER: NCR300（Allogenic Ipsc-derived Natural Killer cells ）
Disease-free survival time (DFS), Assessment of CAEBV, EBV-HLH systemic disease status and peripheral blood EBV-DNA levels, 1 year|complete remission rate (CR), EBV-DNA negative rate in relapsed/non-remitting patients, 1 year|Recurrence rate (RT), EBV-DNA reactivation rate for high-risk patients, 1 year
cytomegalovirus DNA, Incidence of post-transplant infection-related comorbidities, 1 year|Adverse Event（AE）, Assess the frequency and extent of adverse events, 1 year
It is a prospective, open-lable study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNK cell infusion in CAEBV/EBV-HLH patients after allo-HSCT. The study will enroll fifteen subjects who will receive ongoing least 4 doses of iNK cells intravenously infusion after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. All subjects will assess the incidence of disease relapse and EBV-DNA reactivation up to one year.
