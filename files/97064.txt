A Phase III Multicenter, Randomized Study Comparing RIT Vs ASCT in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory (FL)
This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized and controlled study to compare the efficacy of a consolidation therapy with RIT versus ASCT in patients with FL in CR or PR after second or third line chemotherapy supplemented with rituximab.

Progression Free Survival from randomization (rPFS), PFS will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause., 36 months
Overall Survival from randomization (rOS), OS will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause., 36 months|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of any treatment failure including death, disease progression or relapse, discontinuation of treatment for any reason (toxicity, patient preference, initiation of new treatment without documented progression)., 36 months|Treatment Free Survival from randomization (TFS), TFS will be defined as the time between the date of the end of primary treatment until the institution of the next unplanned chemotherapy in randomized population., 36 months|Progression Free Survival from enrolment (ePFS), PFS will be defined as the time between the date of enrolment and the date of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause., 42 months|Overall Survival from enrolment (eOS), OS will be defined as the time between the date of enrolment and the date of death from any cause, 42 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate, Proportion of CR according to the Cheson 2007 response criteria at the end of consolidation phase., At the end of the consolidation phase (6 months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR at the end of the consolidation phase is defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response according to the Cheson 2007 response criteria., At the end of the consolidation phase (6 months)|Toxicity, Incidence of grade 3 or higher Toxicity measured by CTCAE v.4.03 during therapy., 42 months|Molecular Response rate (MR), Rate of MR will be defined as the proportion of patients achieving PCR negativity after the consolidation phase and during follow up., 36 months|Molecular Response rate conversion (cMR), Rate of conversion will be defined as the proportion of patients with baseline PCR-positivity converting to PCR-negativity during treatment., 6 months|Molecular Relapse Rate (MRR), Rate of molecular relapse will be defined as the proportion of patients with PCR-negativity after treatment converting to PCR-positivity during the first two years of follow-up., 24 months
This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized and controlled study to compare the efficacy of a consolidation therapy with RIT vs. ASCT in patients with FL in CR or PR after second or third line chemotherapy supplemented with rituximab. Patients with FL will be eligible for screening at the time of relapsed or refractory disease after two or less chemotherapy lines at least one containing rituximab.

This study will be conducted in six steps as follows. Screening Phase, Enrolment and Induction chemotherapy (STEP I) Randomization (STEP II) Stem cell mobilization and collection (STEP III) Consolidation (RIT vs ASCT) (STEP IV) Maintenance (STEP V) Follow-up Phase (STEP VI)
