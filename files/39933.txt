Stem Cell Transplant for High Risk Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors
The primary goal of this study is to determine if a stem cell transplant in patients with newly diagnosed high risk CNS tumors (glioblastoma multiforme \[GBM\], high grade astrocytoma, pineoblastoma, rhabdoid tumor, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor \[PNET\]) increases overall survival.

PROCEDURE: Stem Cell Transplant
To determine if the use of sequential myeloablative chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue will increase the overall survival rate in patients with newly diagnosed high risk CNS tumors, To end of study
The overall survival and progression free survival in children with recurrent CNS malignancies after obtaining a state of minimum residual disease with submyeloablative chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation., To end of study|To determine the progression free survival and overall survival using sequential myeloablative chemotherapy as compared to historical controls with single autologous stem cell rescue following myeloablative chemotherapy., To end of study|Determine the long term neurocognitive, endocrinologic, cardiopulmonary, and hematologic sequelae of sequential myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell rescues in patients treated for high risk CNS and recurrent CNS tumors., To end of study|Determine the feasibility and utility of the myeloablative preparatory regimen of Carboplatinum, VP-16 and Thiotepa administered in an outpatient setting, and to determine the cost savings obtained via this strategy., To end of study
The primary goal of this study is to determine if a stem cell transplant in patients with newly diagnosed high risk CNS tumors (glioblastoma multiforme \[GBM\], high grade astrocytoma, pineoblastoma, rhabdoid tumor, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor \[PNET\]) increases overall survival.
