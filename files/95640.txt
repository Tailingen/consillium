Exploring Outcomes and Characteristics of Myasthenia Gravis 2
The goal of this prospective observational study is to create a network repository of clinical data and biological samples to help researchers learn more about myasthenia gravis.

The EXPLORE-MG2 (EXPLoring Outcomes and chaRactEristics of Myasthenia Gravis 2) study is a multi-center natural history study of myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by weakness of the voluntary muscles. MG has a prevalence of approximately 14-40 per 100,000 people in the United States. There is no cure for MG, however, understanding the disease is crucial to pave the way for development of new therapies and a deeper mechanistic understanding to improve patient outcomes. Thus, EXPLORE-MG2 aims to accomplish comprehensive clinical phenotyping linked to bio-specimen collection in an effort to better understand disease characteristics and identify treatment predictive and responsive biomarkers. The primary purpose of this project is to create a network repository of data and biological samples to help researchers learn more about myasthenia gravis.
