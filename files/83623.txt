Multimodality US Based on Angio Planewave Ultrasensitive Imaging and Shear Wave Elastography to Evaluate the Malignancy Risk Value of Thyroid Nodules
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the value of a multimodal ultrasound model based on Angio Planewave Ultrasensitive Imaging, Shear Wave Elastography and grayscale ultrasound in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Can an innovative ultra-microvascular classification system based on Angio Planewave Ultrasensitive Imaging distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules? How about the performance of multimodal ultrasound model to Guide the Fine-Needle Aspiration Management of Thyroid Lesions?

Participants will:

Undergo grayscale ultrasound, SWE, and Angio Planewave Ultrasensitive Imaging multimodal thyroid ultrasound examination within one week before surgery Undergo surgery and obtain the postoperative pathological diagnosis
