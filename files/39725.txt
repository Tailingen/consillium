Using OCZ103-OS in Patients With Unresectable and Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Standard Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the use of OCZ103-OS in combination with standard of care as a second line treatment in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: OCZ103-OS [pentamidine bis(2-hydroxyethanesulfonate)], mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI
Tumor size (CT scan), To assess the antitumor activity of OCZ103-OS in combination with standard of care in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer in terms of tumor growth during treatment, 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), To assess the antitumor activity of OCZ103-OS in combination with standard of care in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer in terms of progression free survival, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), To assess the antitumor activity of OCZ103-OS in combination with standard of care in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer in terms of overall survival, 2 years
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of OCZ103-OS, * To assess the peak plasma concentration of OCZ103-OS after administration on day 1 of first cycle.
* Amount of OCZ103-OS in serum on day 1 of first cycle., 2 months|Number of participants with Adverse Events (AE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, - To assess the number of adverse events in participants due to IV OCZ103-OS in conjunction with standard chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6- or FOLFIRI-contained regimen) in patients with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer requiring second-line chemotherapy from baseline., 2 years|Objective response (OR), - To assess the effect of OCZ103-OS on overall objective response (OR) in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer treated concurrently with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI., 2 years|Duration of response (DR), - To assess the effect of OCZ103-OS on duration of response (DR) in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer treated concurrently with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI., 2 years
This is a single arm, open label study to investigate the safety and efficacy of the use of OCZ103-OS in combination with standard therapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) as a second line treatment in subjects with unresectable and locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.
