Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of IM19 CAR-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory (R/R) Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is a phase I/II, open-label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of IM19 CAR-T cells in adult R/R Mantle Cell Lymphoma subjects
Lymphoma|Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell|Neoplasms by Histologic Type|Neoplasms|Lymphoproliferative Disorders
BIOLOGICAL: IM19 CAR-T cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory test results as assessed by CTCAE V5.0, Up to 28 days after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano(2014), At 3 months after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano(2014), At 28 days and 6 months after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from CAR-T cell infusion to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) , as determined by the investigator according to Lugano(2014), Up to 24 weeks after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) in Stage 1, as determined by the investigator according to Lugano(2014), Up to 24 weeks after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), OS , defined as the time from IM19 CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause, Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion|Persistence of CAR-T cells (cell counts and cell percentage in peripheral blood), The persistence over time of CAR T cells in the peripheral blood as determined by flow cytometry and qPCR, Up to 24 weeks after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion|Anti-therapeutic IM19 CAR-T cells antibody, Up to 24 weeks after IM19 CAR-T cell infusion
