Chemo-immunotherapy (Gemcitabine, Interferon-alpha 2b and p53 SLP) in Patients With Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
This study investigates the feasibility and immunogenicity of the triple combination of gemcitabine, Peg-Intron and p53 SLP vaccination in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Interferon Alfa-2b|DRUG: Interferon Alfa-2b|BIOLOGICAL: p53 SLP
Feasibility (change in grade III and IV toxicity) and change in immunogenicity of the triple combination of gemcitabine, Peg-Intron and p53 SLP vaccination, During the trial we will measure the incidence and severity of all side effects (according to CTC version 4.0). The change in immunogenecity will be measured according to the induction of p53-specific T cells upon treatment., Before treatment, after 2 months and after 6 months after start therapy
Clinical outcome (response (RECIST 1.1), Clinical outcome will be tested by analyzing CA125 in sera and tumor size at CT (by RECIST 1.1)and time from start treatment until death, Before treatment, after 2 months and after 6 months after start therapy|The effect of this new treatment combination on the immune system, Changes in plasma signature and tumor tissue will be measured, Before treatment, after two months and after 6 months after treatment|progression free survival, Before treatment, after 2 months and after 6 months after start therapy|overall survival, Before treatment, after 2 months and after 6 months after start therapy
Recurrent ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis and there is a pressing need to identify more efficient therapies. Ovarian cancer is highly immunogenic and good survival is tightly linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells and the absence of immunosuppressive immune cells. This anti-tumor immune response might be primed by chemotherapy.

Gemcitabine has immune-modulatory properties in addition to its direct cytotoxic effect in platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Additionally, Peg-Intron allows the full maturation of dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor response. Moreover, the tumor-associated self-antigen p53 is commonly over-expressed in ovarian cancer and can serve as a target for immunotherapy. Therefore, chemo-immunotherapy with gemcitabine and Peg-Intron plus/minus p53 SLP vaccination seems an attractive treatment for recurrent, p53+ ovarian cancer patients.
