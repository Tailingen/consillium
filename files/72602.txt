Phase 1/2a Study of Oral BAL101553 in Adult Patients With Solid Tumors or Glioblastoma or High-grade Glioma
First in human, open-label, dose escalation (Phase I) and expansion study (Phase 2a) of oral lisavanbulin (BAL101553) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors and adult patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM) or high-grade glioma (HGG).

Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Daily Oral Lisavanbulin, First 28-day treatment cycle dose limiting toxicities (DLT) graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) in the MTD-determining population in Phase 1 based on the number of participants with adverse effects as measure of tolerability at various dose levels, During first 28 day cycle|Phase 2a: Best Objective Response, The best objective response was calculated as the proportion of patients responding (i.e., with a best observed objective response of complete or partial response) based on "radiological assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO)" criteria, Until the study discontinuation, on average 161 days (maximum of 381 days)|Phase 2a: Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was calculated as the percentage of patients (rate) with complete and partial responses and its 95% Confidence Interval (CI) based on RANO criteria, Until the study discontinuation, on average 161 days (maximum of 381 days)
Number of Patients With CTCAE Grade 3-4 TEAEs, Number of patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) of CTCAE Grade 3 or 4, TEAEs were defined as all events occurring after lisavanbulin treatment began and up to 28 days after last study drug administration which corresponded to a maximum of 1653 days (4,5 years)|Cmax of Avanbulin (BAL27862), Pharmacokinetic parameter "Peak Plasma Concentration" Cmax of avanbulin Lisavanbulin (BAL101553) is the prodrug of avanbulin (BAL27862), Plasma PK profiles were obtained on Cycle 1, Day 1 and on Cycle 2, Day 1 (pre-dose and from 0 up to 24 h post-dose) for all patients in the Phase 1 study who received lisavanbulin. For Phase 2 a study, PK parameters were obtained only on Cycle 1, Day 1|Tmax of Avanbulin (BAL27862), Pharmacokinetic parameter "Time to Peak Plasma Concentration" Tmax of avanbulin (BAL27862) Lisavanbulin (BAL101553) is the prodrug of avanbulin (BAL27862)., Plasma PK profiles were obtained on Cycle 1, Day 1 and on Cycle 2, Day 1 (pre-dose and from 0 up to 24 h post-dose) for all patients in the Phase 1 study who received lisavanbulin. For Phase 2 a study, PK parameters were obtained only on Cycle 1, Day 1|AUC of Avanbulin (BAL27862), Pharmacokinetic parameter "Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve" AUC of avanbulin (BAL27862) Lisavanbulin (BAL101553) is the prodrug of avanbulin (BAL27862)., Plasma PK profiles were obtained on Cycle 1, Day 1 and on Cycle 2, Day 1 (pre-dose and from 0 up to 24 h post-dose) for all patients in the Phase 1 study who received lisavanbulin. For Phase 2 a study, PK parameters were obtained only on Cycle 1, Day 1|Phase 1: Best Objective Response, The best objective response was calculated as the proportion of patients responding (i.e., with a best observed objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v1.1 for patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors); and based on RANO criteria for patients with recurrent or progressive GBM / HGG, Until the end of treatment, on average 151 days (maximum of 1653 days), every other 28 day cycle|Phase 1: Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was calculated as the percentage of patients (rate) with complete and partial responses and its 95% CI based on RECIST criteria v1.1 for patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors; and based on RANO criteria for patients with recurrent or progressive GBM / HGG, Until the study discontinuation, on average 151 days (maximum 1653 days), every other 28 day cycle|Phase 2a: PFS, PFS was defined as the interval between the date of drug administration and the earliest date of objective disease progression based on RANO criteria for patients with recurrent or progressive GBM / HGG. Patients who have not progressed or died at the end of the study were censored at the time of their latest objective tumor assessment., 1 year|Phase 2a: PFS at 6 Months, Percentage of patients without disease progression based on RANO criteria 6 months after the start of treatment. The values were determined using the Kaplan-Meier and Brookmeyer-Crowley methods., 6 months|Phase 2a: Overall Survival (OS) at 12 Months, Percentage of patients alive 12 months after the start of treatment. The values were determined using the Kaplan-Meier and Brookmeyer-Crowley methods., 1 year
This was the first study of the oral formulation (hard capsules) of lisavanbulin. Lisavanbulin was administered once daily during each day of a 28-day treatment cycle to adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or progressive GBM / HGG who had failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy was available.

In Phase 1, the highest dose of lisavanbulin was determined that could safely be given to adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors, recurrent or progressive GBM / HGG.

In Phase 2a, the tolerability and potential anticancer activity of oral lisavanbulin was assessed in patients with recurrent GBM whose tumor tissue tests positive for end-binding protein 1 (EB1). The study also measured pharmacokinetics.
