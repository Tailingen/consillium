Study of GEC255 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors With KRAS p.G12C Mutation
The overall objective of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of daily oral dosing with GEC255 tablets in subjects with advanced solid tumor with Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) p.G12C mutation. To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on assessments of multiple dose escalation and expansion in target cohorts.

This First-in-human dose escalation and expansion study of GEC255 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS p.G12C mutation aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of orally administered GEC255, to determine the MTD, DLT (if exists) and RP2D, and explore the potential biomarker associated with efficacy or drug resistance.
