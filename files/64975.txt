Green Tea Extract in Treating Patients With Stage 0, Stage I, or Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Green tea extract contains ingredients that may slow the growth of certain cancers.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of green tea extract and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage 0, stage I, or stage II chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Polyphenon E
Number of Participants With a Confirmed Response [Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR)] on 2 Consecutive Evaluations at Least 4 Weeks Apart, National Cancer Institute working group criteria (NCIWG) was used to assess response.

* CR: no lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms; normal complete blood count; confirmed by bone marrow (BM) aspirate \& biopsy
* PR: 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, liver/spleen size, presence/absence of constitutional symptoms; plus ≥1 of the following: ≥1500/μL polymorphonuclear leukocytes, \>100000/μL platelets, \>11.0 g/dL hemoglobin or 50% improvement for these parameters without transfusions, 6 months|Number of Participants With Biological Response (Bio-R) on 2 Consecutive Evaluations at Least 4 Weeks Apart, Bio-R: A reduction in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of more than 20% from the pretreatment level for at least 2 months or a \>= 30% reduction in all palpable lymphadenopathy without meeting the NCIWG criteria for PR was required, 6 months
Number of Participants With a Confirmed Complete Response (CR), A confirmed complete response is a CR which is reported on 2 consecutive cycles at least 4 weeks apart. CR is defined in Primary Outcome Measure #1., 6 months
24 Month Treatment Free Survival Rate, Percentage of participants who were alive and treatment (for progressive CLL) free at 24 months. The 24 month treatment free survival, with 95% CI, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., 24 months (from registration)
OBJECTIVES:

Phase I

* Determine the maximally tolerated dose of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) in patients with previously untreated stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
* Describe the dose-limiting toxicity of green tea extract (Polyphenon E).

Phase II

* Evaluate the response rate and response duration of patients with previously untreated, asymptomatic Rai stage 0-II chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with green tea extract (Polyphenon E) for 6 months at the MTD.
* Further characterize toxicity.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) followed by a phase II study.

* Phase I: Patients receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E) once or twice daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of green tea extract (Polyphenon E) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

* Phase II: Patients receive green tea extract (Polyphenon E) as in the phase I portion of the study at the MTD.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients will be accrued for this study.
