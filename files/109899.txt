Clinical Study of Vaginal Lactobacilli and Estriol (Gynoflor®) for Atrophic Vaginitis in Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to assess the long term safety and efficacy of the vaginal application of Gynoflor®, an extremely low dosed estrogen therapy with lactobacilli, on atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal breast cancer patients who have been treated with aromatase inhibitors.
Atrophic Vaginitis
DRUG: Estriol 0.03 mg, lyophylized lactobacillus
Serum Concentrations of Estriol (E3), Estrogens were analyzed using a highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 10.00 pg/ml for E3, 1.The coefficient of variation (CV, intra-assay variation) was 2.0 % for E3 (calibration range (CR) 10.00-500.00 pg/).

The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 1.00 pg/ml for E2, and 2.00 pg/ml for E1.The coefficient of variation (CV, intra-assay variation) was 4.2 % for E2 (CR 1.00-150.00 pg/ml), and 3.4 % for E1 (CR 2.00-300.00 pg/ml)., -0.5, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours on days 0 and 28|Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Estriol: Cmax, Cmax is the highest measured concentration, Days 0 and 28|Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Estriol: Tmax, Tmax is the peak time at which the Cmax (maximum concentration) was measured, Days 0 and 28|Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Estriol: Area Under the Curve (AUC), Area under the curve from administration to the last measured concentration (AUC0-24), Days 0 and 28

The scale has values ranging from zero (the most acidic) to 14 (the most basic). Pure water has a pH value of 7. This value is considered neutral-neither acidic or basic., at all visits during 12 weeks|Baseline / Trough Serum Concentrations of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Days 0, 14, 28, 56 and 84|Baseline / Trough Serum Concentrations of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), Days 0, 14, 28, 56 and 84|Baseline / Trough Serum Concentrations of Follicule Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Days 0, 14, 28, 56 and 84
Two center phase I pharmacokinetic study assessed circulating estrogens in breast cancer patients on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) with vaginal atrophy using vaginal ultra-low-dose 0.03 mg estriol (E3) and Lactobacillus combination vaginal tablets (Gynoflor). 16 women on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor with severe vaginal atrophy applied a daily vaginal tablet of Gynoflor for 28 days followed by a maintenance therapy of 3 tablets weekly for 8 weeks.
