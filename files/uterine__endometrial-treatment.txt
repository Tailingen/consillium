Cancer of the endometrium is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States and
accounts for 7% of all cancers in women.  Most cases are diagnosed at an early stage and are amenable to treatment with surgery alone.[
1
]  However, patients with pathological features predictive of a high rate of relapse and patients with extrauterine spread at diagnosis have a high rate of relapse despite adjuvant therapy. The most common cause of death in patients with endometrial cancer is cardiovascular disease because of related metabolic risk factors.[
2
]
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from cancer of the uterine corpus, which includes the endometrium,  in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 69,120.
Deaths: 13,860.
Anatomy
The endometrium is the inner lining of the uterus and has both functional and basal layers.  The functional layer is hormonally sensitive and is shed in a cyclical pattern during menstruation in reproductive-age women.  Both estrogen and progesterone are necessary to maintain a normal endometrial lining.  However, factors that lead to an excess of estrogen, including obesity and anovulation, lead to an increase in the deposition of the endometrial lining.   These changes may lead to endometrial hyperplasia and, in some cases, endometrial cancer.  Whatever the cause, a thickened lining will lead to sloughing of the endometrial tissue through the endometrial canal and into the vagina.  As a result, heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding after menopause are often the initial signs of endometrial cancer.  This symptom tends to happen early in the disease course, allowing for identification of the disease at an early stage for most women.

Risk Factors
Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:
Hormone therapy.[

Endometrial hyperplasia.[

Endometrial Cancer Prevention
.
Prolonged,
unopposed estrogen exposure has been associated with an increased
risk of endometrial cancer.[
9
,
32
]  However, combined estrogen and
progesterone therapy prevents this increased risk.[
33
,
34
]
Tamoxifen, which is used to treat and prevent breast cancer (
NSABP-B-14
), is associated with an increased
risk of endometrial cancer  related to the estrogenic effect
of tamoxifen on the endometrium.[
15
,
35
]  It is important that patients who are receiving 
tamoxifen and experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding have follow-up examinations and biopsy of the endometrial lining. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a
black box warning
that includes data about the increase in uterine malignancies associated with tamoxifen use. For more information about risk factors for Lynch syndrome–associated endometrial cancer, see the
Lynch Syndrome
section in Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers.
Clinical Features
Irregular vaginal bleeding is the most common presenting sign of endometrial cancer.  It generally occurs early in the disease process and is the reason why most patients are diagnosed with highly curable stage I endometrial cancer.
Diagnostic Evaluation
The following procedures may be used to detect endometrial cancer:
Transvaginal ultrasonography.
Endometrial biopsy.
Pelvic examination.
Dilatation and curettage.
Hysteroscopy.
To
definitively diagnose endometrial cancer, a procedure that directly samples the endometrial
tissue is necessary.
The Pap smear is not a reliable screening procedure for the detection of
endometrial cancer, even though a retrospective study found a strong correlation
between positive cervical cytology and high-risk endometrial disease (i.e., high-grade
tumor and deep myometrial invasion).[
36
] A prospective study found a statistically significant association between malignant cytology and increased risk of nodal
disease.[
37
]
Prognostic Factors
Prognostic factors for endometrial cancer include:
Tumor stage and grade (including extrauterine nodal spread)
.
Hormone receptor status
.
Tumor stage and grade (including extrauterine nodal spread)
Table 1
highlights the risk of nodal metastasis based on findings at the time of staging surgery:[
38
]
Table 1.  Risk of Nodal Metastasis in Clinical Stage I Endometrial Cancer
Prognostic Group
Patient Characteristics
Risk of Nodal Involvement
A
Grade 1 tumors involving only endometrium
<5%
No evidence of intraperitoneal spread
B
Grade 2–3 tumors
5%–9%  pelvic nodes
Invasion of <50% of myometrium
No intraperitoneal spread
4% para-aortic nodes
C
Deep muscle invasion
20%–60% pelvic nodes
High-grade tumors
10%–30% para-aortic nodes
Intraperitoneal spread
A Gynecologic Oncology Group study related
surgical-pathological parameters and postoperative treatment to recurrence-free
interval and recurrence site.  Grade 3 histology and deep myometrial invasion in patients without extrauterine spread were the greatest determinants of recurrence. In this study, the presence of the following factors greatly increased the frequency of recurrence:[
39
,
40
]
Positive pelvic nodes.
Adnexal metastasis.
Positive peritoneal cytology.
Capillary space involvement.
Involvement of the isthmus or cervix.
Positive para-aortic nodes (includes all grades and depth of invasion). Of the cases with aortic node metastases, 98% were in patients with positive pelvic nodes, intra-abdominal metastases, or tumor invasion of the outer 33% of the myometrium.
When the only evidence of extrauterine spread is positive peritoneal cytology,
the influence on outcome is unclear.  The value of therapy directed at this
cytological finding is not well founded,[
41
-
46
] and some data are contradictory.[
47
]  Although the collection of cytology specimens  is still suggested, a positive result does not upstage the cancer.  Other extrauterine disease must be present before
additional postoperative therapy is considered.
Involvement of the capillary-lymphatic space on histopathological
examination correlates with extrauterine and nodal spread of tumor.[
48
]
Hormone receptor status
When possible, progesterone and estrogen
receptor statuses, assessed either by biochemical or immunohistochemical methods,
are included in the evaluation of patients with stage I and stage II
cancer.[
49
-
51
]
One report found progesterone receptor levels to be the single most important
prognostic indicator of 3-year survival in clinical stages I and II disease. 
Patients with progesterone receptor levels of 100 or greater had a 3-year
disease-free survival rate of 93%, compared with 36% for those with a level below 100.  After adjusting for progesterone receptor levels, only
cervical involvement and peritoneal cytology were significant prognostic
variables.[
52
]
Other reports
confirm the importance of hormone receptor status as an independent prognostic
factor.[
53
]  Additionally, immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded
tissue for both estrogen and progesterone receptors has been shown to correlate
with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO)  grade and survival.[
49
-
51
]
Other prognostic factors
Other factors predictive of poor prognosis include:[
51
,
54
,
55
]
A high S-phase fraction.
Aneuploidy.
PTEN
loss-of-function variant.
PIK3CA
variant.
TP53
variant.
Oncogene expression (e.g., overexpression of the
HER2/neu
oncogene has been
associated with a poor overall prognosis).
A general review of prognostic
factors has been published.[

Cellular Classification of Endometrial Cancer
In This Section
Molecular Subgroups
Endometrial cancers are classified as one of the following two types:
Type 1 may arise from complex atypical hyperplasia and is pathogenetically linked to unopposed estrogenic stimulation.
Type 2 develops from atrophic endometrium and is not linked to hormonally driven pathogenesis.
The most common type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Frequency of endometrial cancer cell types is as follows:
Endometrioid (75%) comprises malignant glandular epithelial elements; an admixture of
squamous metaplasia is not uncommon.
Ciliated adenocarcinoma.
Secretory adenocarcinoma.
Papillary and villoglandular adenocarcinomas are histologically similar
to those noted in the ovary and the fallopian tube. The prognosis is worse
for these tumors.[
1
]
Adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation.
Adenoacanthoma.
Adenosquamous cells contain malignant
 glandular and squamous epithelial elements.[
2
]
Mixed, defined as two carcinomatous cell types, with the smaller component making up at least 10% of the total  (10%).
Uterine papillary serous (<10%).
Clear cell (4%) is histologically similar
to those noted in the ovary and the fallopian tube. The prognosis for clear cell tumors is worse.[
1
]
Carcinosarcoma (3%), also known as malignant mixed mesodermal tumor, has both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements.  This tumor was historically categorized as a subtype of uterine sarcomas; however, recent evidence points to its origin as an adenocarcinoma that has undergone differentiation into the sarcomatous elements.
Mucinous (1%).
Squamous cell (<1%).
Undifferentiated (<1%).
Molecular Subgroups
PTEN
variants are more common in type 1 endometrial cancers;
TP53
and
HER2/neu
overexpression are more common in type 2 endometrial cancers, although some overlap exists.
The Cancer Genome Atlas's  full genetic display of hundreds of endometrial cancers identified four subtypes to further characterize endometrial cancers:[
3
]
POLE
ultramutated. This subtype has clinical significance, and adjuvant therapies are avoided.
Microsatellite instability hypermutated.
Copy number low.
Copy number high.
These categories can be used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk prognostic categories.  A modification of The Cancer Genome Atlas methods into more accessible tests was also successful in discriminating cancers into relevant prognostic categories.  However, a combination of previously known risk factors with the genetic data was the most effective at determining prognostic categories.[

Stage Information for Endometrial Cancer
In This Section
FIGO Staging
2023 FIGO staging for endometrial cancer
2021 FIGO staging for endometrial cancer
The pattern of endometrial cancer spread is partially dependent on the degree of cellular
differentiation.  Well-differentiated tumors tend to limit their spread to the
surface of the endometrium; myometrial invasion is less common. Myometrial invasion occurs much more
frequently in patients
with poorly differentiated tumors and is frequently a harbinger of lymph node
involvement and distant metastases.[
1
,
2
]
Metastatic spread occurs in a characteristic pattern. 
 Regional spread to the pelvic and para-aortic nodes is common.  Distant metastasis most commonly involves the following sites:
Lungs.
Inguinal and supraclavicular nodes.
Liver.
Bones.
Brain.
Vagina.
FIGO Staging
The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) have both designated staging systems for endometrial cancer. The FIGO system is the most commonly used staging system for endometrial cancer.[
3
-
5
] The 2023 FIGO staging update has not been widely adopted because it incorporates molecular-based results, and some physicians do not have access to those data for their patients. Additionally, given the significant changes in the 2023 FIGO staging system, especially in the definition of early stage disease, more outcome data are needed so it might be more prudent to use the 2021 system in a clinical setting while discussing prognosis and treatment with patients. Therefore, both the 2023 and the 2021 FIGO staging systems are presented in this section.
FIGO stages I to IV are further subdivided by the histological grade (G) of the tumor, for example, stage IB G2. Carcinosarcomas, which had previously been designated as sarcomas, are now considered poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas; as such, they are included in this system.[

Endometrial cancer is surgically staged and pathologically examined. In all stages, the grade of the lesion, the histological type and LVSI must be recorded. If available and feasible, molecular classification testing (
POLEmut
, MMRd, NSMP, p53abn) is encouraged in all patients with endometrial cancer for prognostic risk-group stratification and as factors that might influence adjuvant and systemic treatment decisions (see
Table 6
).
c
In early endometrial cancer, the standard surgery is a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy via a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach. Staging procedures include infracolic omentectomy in specific histological subtypes, such as serous and undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma, as well as carcinosarcoma, due to the high risk of microscopic omental metastases. Lymph node staging should be performed in patients with intermediate-high/high-risk disease. SLN biopsy is an adequate alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy for staging proposes. SLN biopsy can also be considered in patients with low−/low-intermediate-risk disease to rule out occult lymph node metastases and to identify disease truly confined to the uterus. Thus, the ESGO-ESTRO-ESP guidelines allow an approach of SLN in all patients with endometrial carcinoma, which is endorsed by FIGO. In assumed early endometrial cancer, an SLN biopsy in an adequate alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy in high-intermediate and high-risk cases for the purpose of lymph node staging and can also be considered in low–/intermediate-risk disease to rule out occult lymph node metastases. An SLN biopsy should be done in association with thorough (ultrastaging) staging as it will increase the detection of low-volume disease in lymph nodes.
d
Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas involving both the endometrium and the ovary are considered to have a good prognosis, and no adjuvant treatment is recommended if all the below criteria are met. Disease limited to low-grade endometrioid carcinomas involving the endometrium and ovaries (Stage IA3) must be distinguished from extensive spread of the endometrial carcinoma to the ovary (Stage IIIA1), by the following criteria: (1) no more than superficial myometrial invasion is present (<50%); (2) absence of extensive/substantial LVSI; (3) absence of additional metastases; and (4) the ovarian tumor is unilateral, limited to the ovary, without capsule invasion/rupture (equivalent to pT1a).
e
LVSI as defined in WHO 2021: extensive/substantial, ≥5 vessels involved.
f
Grade and histological type are as follows: (1) Serous adenocarcinomas, clear cell adenocarcinomas, mesonephric-like carcinomas, gastrointestinal-type mucinous endometrial carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinomas, and carcinosarcomas are considered high grade by definition. For endometrioid carcinomas, grade is based on the proportion of solid areas: low grade = grade 1 (≤5%) and grade 2 (6%–50%); and high grade = grade 3 (>50%). Nuclear atypia excessive for the grade raises the grade of a grade 1 or 2 tumor by one. The presence of unusual nuclear atypia in an architecturally low-grade tumor should prompt the evaluation of
TP53
and consideration of serous carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas with squamous differentiation are graded according to the microscopic features of the glandular component; (2) Nonaggressive histological types are composed of low-grade (grade 1 and 2) endometrioid carcinomas. Aggressive histological types are composed of high-grade endometrioid carcinomas (grade 3), serous, clear cell, undifferentiated, mixed, mesonephric-like, gastrointestinal mucinous type carcinomas, and carcinosarcomas; and (3) It should be noted that high-grade endometrioid carcinomas (grade 3) are a prognostically, clinically, and molecularly heterogenous disease, and the tumor type that benefits most from applying molecular classification for improved prognostication and for treatment decision-making. Without molecular classification, high-grade endometrioid carcinomas cannot appropriately be allocated to a risk group, and thus, molecular profiling is particularly recommended in these patients. For practical purposes and to avoid undertreatment of patients, if the molecular classification is unknown, high-grade endometrioid carcinomas were grouped together with the aggressive histological types in the actual FIGO classification.

Micrometastases are considered to be metastatic involvement (pN1 [mi]). The prognostic significance of ITCs is unclear. The presence of ITCs should be documented and is regarded as pN0(I+). According to the AJCC 8th edition staging, macrometastases are >2 mm in size, micrometastases are >0.2–2 mm and/or >200 cells, and ITCs are ≤0.2 mm and ≤200 cells. These definitions are based on staging established by FIGO and the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.

When feasible, the addition of molecular subtype to the staging criteria allows a better prediction of prognosis in a staging/prognosis scheme. The performance of complete molecular classification (
POLEmut
, MMRd, NSMP, p53abn) is encouraged in all cases of endometrial cancer for prognostic risk-group stratification and as potential influencing factors of adjuvant or systemic treatment decisions. Molecular subtype assignment can be done on a biopsy, in which case it need not be repeated on the hysterectomy specimen. When performed, these molecular classifications should be recorded in all stages.
A pathogenic
POLE
mutation (
POLEmut
) is associated with a good prognosis. MMRd or MSI and NSMP are associated with an intermediate prognosis. Abnormal
TP53
(p53abn) is associated with a poor prognosis.
When the molecular classification is known the staging is modified as follows:
(1) FIGO Stages I and II are based on surgical/anatomical and histological findings. In case the molecular classification reveals
POLEmut
or p53abn status, the FIGO stage is modified in the early stage of the disease. This is depicted in the FIGO stage by the addition of “m” for molecular classification, and a subscript is added to denote
POLEmut
or p53abn status, as shown in the table. MMRd or NSMP status do not modify early FIGO stages; however, these molecular classifications should be recorded for the purpose of data collection. When molecular classification reveals MMRd or NSMP, it should be recorded as Stage Im
MMRd
or Stage Im
NSMP
and Stage IIm
MMRd
or Stage IIm

; (2)
FIGO Stages III and IV are based on surgical/anatomical findings. The stage category is not modified by molecular classification; however, the molecular classification should be recorded if known. When the molecular classification is known, it should be recorded as Stage IIIm or Stage IVm with the appropriate subscript for the purpose of data collection. For example, when molecular classification reveals p53abn, it should be recorded as Stage IIIm
p53abn

Treatment Option Overview for Endometrial Cancer
The degree of tumor differentiation has an important effect on the
natural history of this disease and on treatment selection.
Patients with endometrial cancer who have localized disease  are usually cured.  Best results are obtained with one of two standard treatments:
Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy (when deep invasion of the myometrial muscle [more than 50% of the myometrium] or grade 3 tumor with myometrial invasion is present).
Patients with regional and distant metastases are rarely cured,
although they are occasionally responsive to standard hormone therapy.
Progestational agents have been evaluated as adjuvant therapy in several randomized trials. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane group confirms no clinical benefit to adjuvant progestogens in clinical stage I disease.[

Treatment Options for Stage I and Stage II Endometrial Cancer
Treatment of stage I and stage II endometrial cancer depends on the grade and histological type.
In the current Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) staging system, stage II describes tumor that invades the cervical stroma; this is equivalent to the prior stage IIB.  Almost all randomized trials for early-stage cancer excluded stage IIB patients.  As a result, there is a paucity of quality data on which to base clinical decisions for patients with stage II endometrial cancer.
Low-risk histology:
Grades 1 and 2 tumors are considered low-risk unless they have serous or clear cell histologies.
Treatment options for patients with low-risk histological subtypes of stage I endometrial cancer include:
Surgery
: Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and possible lymph node dissection.
Postoperative vaginal brachytherapy
.
Radiation therapy alone
.
Most patients do well with surgery alone. However, patients with stage I disease who have high-risk histologies are at a greater risk of recurrence and are eligible for adjuvant therapy.
High-risk histology:
Grade 3 tumors of any histology and any serous tumors, clear cell tumors, or carcinosarcomas are considered high-risk.
Treatment options for patients with stage I or stage II endometrial cancer who have high-risk histologies include:
Surgery
: Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.
Postoperative chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.
Patients with serous or clear cell histologies have higher rates of recurrence than do patients with other stage I or stage II endometrioid carcinomas. Management guidelines are based on the outcomes reported in institutional case series that used a regimen of adjuvant carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and occasionally, radiation therapy for patients with this histological subtype.[

]
Carcinosarcomas have been evaluated in clinical trials both separately and with other sarcomas because of their prior designation in this group.  In a nonrandomized Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of patients with stage I or II carcinosarcomas, patients who underwent pelvic radiation therapy had a significant reduction in recurrences within the radiation treatment field but no improvement in survival.[
10
] One nonrandomized study that predominantly included patients with carcinosarcomas appeared to show benefit for adjuvant therapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin.[
11
]
Surgery
If the uterine cervix is involved, patients may consider one or more of the following options:
Standard hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy.
Radical hysterectomy.
Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection.
Single-institution reviews suggest that radical hysterectomy is more beneficial than standard hysterectomy in cases of cervical involvement of the tumor.[

Surgery with or without lymph node sampling
Table 12
highlights the risk of nodal metastasis based on findings at the time of staging surgery:[
15

Table 12.  Risk of Nodal Metastasis in Clinical Stage I Endometrial Cancer
Prognostic Group
Patient Characteristics
Risk of Nodal Involvement
A
Grade 1 tumors involving only endometrium
<5%
No evidence of intraperitoneal spread
B
Grade 2–3 tumors
5%–9%  pelvic nodes
Invasion of <50% of myometrium
No intraperitoneal spread
4% para-aortic nodes
C
Deep muscle invasion
20%–60% pelvic nodes
High-grade tumors
10%–30% para-aortic nodes
Intraperitoneal spread
For patients in Group A, lymph node dissection has limited utility.  Conversely, full pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is important for patients in Group C, given the likelihood of positive findings. The difficulty lies in determining how to manage patients in Group B.
There are several accepted surgical approaches for patients with presumed stage I endometrial cancer, with intermediate risk for lymphatic spread.
Both retrospective and prospective data support stratifying patients with presumed stage I endometrial cancer into two groups based on the following characteristics:
Low risk: Well-differentiated or moderately differentiated tumor and/or depth of myometrial invasion is less than 50% and/or tumor is smaller than 2 cm.
High risk: Poorly differentiated tumor and/or depth of myometrial invasion is 50% or more and/or tumor  is 2 cm or larger.
Evidence (lymph node dissection):
In two studies, patients with low-risk cancer had a sufficiently low risk of lymph node metastasis such that lymph node sampling could be omitted.  For patients meeting high-risk criteria, a full pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection was suggested, given patterns of lymphatic spread.[
16
,
17
]
An alternative strategy is the use of sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with presumed stage I endometrial cancer.[
18
] Although this strategy has been widely adopted at various academic centers, a prospective multicenter trial to determine the false-negative rate for this protocol is lacking. For cases in which isolated tumor cells are identified using the sentinel lymph node approach, it is unclear whether treatment is necessary.
In patients with high-risk histology (serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, or undifferentiated tumors), hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is the standard approach.
Laparotomy has been the standard surgical approach. However, laparoscopy is now favored because of the improvement in patients' postoperative recovery without significant impact on outcomes.
Evidence (treatment or surgical staging using laparoscopy vs. laparotomy):
For patients with early-stage endometrial cancer, several randomized trials have compared total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with the standard open procedure, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH).  Feasibility of the laparoscopic approach has been confirmed, but this approach is associated with a longer operative time.[
15
,
19

20
] TLH has an improved [
15
,
19
] or similar [
20
] adverse event profile and a shorter hospital stay [
15
,
19
,
20
] than does TAH.
TLH is associated with less pain and a quicker resumption of daily activities,[
20
,
21
] although one study found that most of the gains in quality of life favoring laparoscopy at the 6-week postsurgical period were no longer significant at 6 months.[

A GOG trial (

Time to recurrence was the primary end point, with noninferiority defined as a difference in recurrence rate of less than 5.3% between the two groups at 3 years.
The recurrence rate at 3 years was 10.24% for patients in the laparotomy arm and 11.39% for patients in the laparoscopy arm, with an estimated difference between groups of 1.14% (90% lower bound, -1.278; 95% upper bound, 3.996).
Although this difference was lower than the prespecified limit, the statistical requirements for noninferiority were not met because of fewer-than-expected recurrences in both groups.
The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 89.8% in both groups.
A Cochrane review of the use of laparoscopic staging included four randomized controlled trials that reported OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Ninety percent of the patients were from the GOG-LAP2 trial.[

Overall, laparoscopy and laparotomy were associated with similar OS and PFS rates.
Future analyses may determine whether there are subgroups of patients for whom there is a clinically significant decrement when laparoscopic staging is used.[

Postoperative   vaginal brachytherapy
Adjuvant radiation therapy reduces the
incidence of local and regional recurrence. However, improved survival rates have not been confirmed, and radiation therapy increased toxicity.[
24
-
28
] Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is associated with less radiation-related morbidity than  is  external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)  and has been shown to be equivalent to EBRT in the short term for patients with stage I disease.[
29
] However, long-term follow up of a randomized trial comparing EBRT plus vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) to VBT alone found decreased OS and increased toxicity in the EBRT plus VBT arm.[
30
]
Evidence (VBT):
Results
of two randomized trials that used adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with
stage I disease did not show improved survival but did show reduced locoregional recurrence (3%–4% in the radiation therapy group vs. 12%–14% in the control group after median follow-up of 5–6 years;
P
< .001), with an increase in side effects.[

Results of a study by the Danish Endometrial Cancer Group suggest that the absence of radiation therapy does not improve the survival of patients with stage I intermediate-risk disease (grades 1 and 2 with >50% myometrial invasion or grade 3 with <50% myometrial invasion).[
33
]
The
PORTEC-2
trial (NCT00411138) randomly assigned patients with stage I endometrial cancer who did not undergo lymph node dissection to undergo VBT or EBRT, with prevention of vaginal recurrence as the primary outcome.[

At 5 years, there was no difference in the rates of vaginal recurrence, locoregional recurrence, PFS, or OS (84.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 79.3%–90.3%] for VBT vs. 79.6% [95% CI, 71.2%–88.0%] for EBRT;
P
= .57).
The VBT group had significantly fewer  gastrointestinal toxic effects and improved quality of life, making VBT the preferred option for adjuvant treatment of patients with stage I disease.
The Norwegian Radium Hospital trial included 568 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer between 1968 and 1974 (before FIGO surgical staging was initiated).[
30
][
Level of evidence A1
]  After hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, patients were randomly assigned to receive either EBRT and VBT or VBT alone.
An updated report presenting over 20 years of follow-up data showed no difference in OS between the treatment groups.  Median OS was 20.5 years in the EBRT/VBT group and 20.48 years in the VBT-alone group (
P
= .186).  In all women, there was an increased risk of secondary cancers after EBRT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.01–2.0).
A post hoc subset analysis of women  younger than 60 years at the time of trial registration showed increased mortality in the EBRT/VBT arm (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06–1.76).  Further, the risk of secondary cancers doubled in this group (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.3–3.15).
Postoperative radiation therapy
If the cervix is not clinically involved, but extension to the cervix is noted on postoperative pathology, radiation therapy is considered.[

Treatment of patients with stage IV endometrial cancer is dictated by the site of metastatic disease and symptoms related to disease sites.
Surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy
In general, patients with stage III or stage IV endometrial cancer are treated with surgery, followed by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both.
Observational studies support maximal cytoreductive surgery for patients with stage IV disease, although these conclusions need to be interpreted with care because of the small number of cases and likely selection bias.[

,

]
For many years, radiation therapy was the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.  However, several randomized trials have confirmed improved survival when adjuvant chemotherapy is used instead of radiation therapy.
Doxorubicin was historically the most active anticancer agent used,
with useful but temporary responses obtained in as many as 33% of patients
with recurrent disease.  Paclitaxel, when combined with platinum chemotherapy or when used as a single agent, also has significant anticancer activity.[
3
]
Evidence (surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy):
Several randomized trials by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) have used doxorubicin because of its known antitumor activity.[
4
]
Adding cisplatin to doxorubicin increased response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with doxorubicin alone. However, adding cisplatin did not affect overall survival (OS).
A  three-drug regimen of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel  with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly superior to cisplatin and doxorubicin, as shown by the following results:[
5
,
6
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Response rate was 57% with the three-drug regimen, compared with 34% with the cisplatin and doxorubicin regimen.
PFS  was 8.3 months with the three-drug regimen, compared with 5.3 months with the cisplatin and doxorubicin regimen.
OS was 15.3 months with the three-drug regimen, compared with 12.3 months with the cisplatin and doxorubicin regimen.
The 3-drug regimen was associated with grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in 12% of patients and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy in 27% of patients.
Given the toxicity and limited efficacy of these regimens, other treatment options have been widely sought.  Several observational  studies [
7
,
8
] and phase II studies [
9
-
12
] suggest clinical activity with the combination of platinum chemotherapy and paclitaxel in patients with endometrial cancer and measurable disease either after primary surgery or at recurrence.
The phase III, randomized, open-label, noninferiority
GOG-0209
trial (NCT000063999) compared the combination of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin (TAP), and G-CSF with carboplatin and paclitaxel (TC) in 1,381 women.[
13
]
The median OS was 37 months for patients in the TC group and 41 months for patients in the TAP group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.002; 90% confidence interval [CI], 0.9–1.12). The median PFS was 13 months for patients in the TC group and 14 months for patients in the TAP group (HR, 1.032; 90% CI, 0.93–1.15).[
13
]
These results led to the use of TC as the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with stages III and IV disease.
The use of  cisplatin and doxorubicin compared with whole-abdominal radiation therapy was studied in a trial of patients with stage III or IV disease with residual tumors smaller  than 2 cm and no parenchymal organ involvement.[
14
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Results suggest that cisplatin and doxorubicin improved OS, compared with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (5-year survival rate, 55% for cisplatin and doxorubicin vs. 42% for whole-abdominal radiation; adjusted HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52–0.89;
P
= .02).
Several trials support combination chemotherapy for patients with stage III, stage IV, and recurrent carcinosarcoma.
The GOG-108 trial of ifosfamide, with or without cisplatin, as first-line therapy in patients with measurable advanced or recurrent carcinosarcomas demonstrated a higher response rate (54% vs. 34%) and longer PFS in the combination arm (6 months vs. 4 months), but there was no significant improvement in survival (9 months vs. 8 months).[
15
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The follow-up
GOG-0161
study
(NCT00003128)
used 3-day ifosfamide regimens (instead of the more-toxic 5-day regimen in the preceding study) for the control and ifosfamide combined with paclitaxel (with G-CSF starting on day 4) for the study arm.[
16
]
The combination regimen produced superior response rates (45% vs. 29%), PFS (8.4 months vs. 5.8 months), and OS (13.5 months vs. 8.4 months). The HR for death also favored the combination regimen  (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.97).[
16
][
Level of evidence A1
]
In this study, 52% of 179 evaluable patients had recurrent disease, 18% had stage III disease, and 30% had stage IV disease.  In addition, there were imbalances between the treatment arms with respect to the sites of disease and the use of prior radiation therapy, and 30 patients were excluded for wrong pathology.
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy
Patients with inoperable disease caused by tumor that extends to the pelvic wall may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and  radiation therapy.  The usual
approach for radiation therapy is a combination of intracavitary and external-beam radiation
therapy (EBRT).[
17
,
18
]
For patients with localized recurrences (pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes) or distant
metastases in selected sites, radiation therapy may be an effective palliative
therapy.  Pelvic radiation therapy may be curative in patients with pure vaginal
recurrence when no previous radiation therapy has been used.
Hormone therapy
Progesterone and estrogen hormone receptors are commonly found in 
endometrial carcinoma tissues.  Response to hormone therapy is correlated with the
presence and level of hormone receptors and the degree of tumor
differentiation.[
19
] Patients with tumors that are positive for
estrogen and progesterone receptors respond best to progestin therapy.
When distant metastases, especially pulmonary metastases, are present, hormonal therapy is indicated. Patients who are not candidates for either surgery or radiation therapy may
be treated with progestational agents, the most common hormonal treatment.  Progestational agents
produce good antitumor responses in 15% to 30% of patients.   These
responses are associated with significant improvement in survival.[
19
]
Standard progestational agents include:[
19
]
Hydroxyprogesterone.
Medroxyprogesterone.
Megestrol.
Evidence (progestin therapy):
One study followed 115 patients with advanced endometrial cancer treated with progestins.[
20
]
Responses occurred in 75% of patients (42 of 56) with progesterone receptor–positive tumors.
Responses occurred in 7% of patients (4 of 59) without detectable progesterone
receptors.
A receptor-poor status may predict a poor
response to progestins and a better response to cytotoxic
chemotherapy.[
21
]
Other hormonal agents have shown benefit in treating endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen (20 mg
bid) yields a 20% response rate in patients who do not respond to
standard progesterone therapy.[
22
]
Aromatase inhibitors have also been evaluated for the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer, although they yield lower response rates than progestational agents.[
23
]
Biological therapy
Several biological agents have been evaluated for the treatment of endometrial cancer.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.
Endometrial cancers often show alterations in the AKT-PI3K pathway, making mTOR inhibitors an attractive choice for clinical study in patients with metastatic or recurrent disease.  Phase II studies of single-agent everolimus [
24
] and ridaforolimus [
25
,
26
] have predominantly shown disease stabilization.  A phase II study of the combination of everolimus and letrozole showed a 32% response rate.[
27
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Bevacizumab.
Bevacizumab was used as a single agent in a phase II trial. The overall response rate was 13.5%.[
28
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Bevacizumab combined with temsirolimus has been used.[
29
]
Immunotherapy
With the published results of The Cancer Genome Atlas, and as more is learned about the molecular drivers of endometrial cancer, the use of immunotherapy has been evaluated for the treatment of advanced and recurrent disease.
Evidence (immunotherapy):
Study 309/KEYNOTE-775
(NCT03517449) was a large, international, multicenter, randomized trial that compared the combination of pembrolizumab (200mg intravenously [IV] every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles) and lenvatinib (20mg orally daily) with physician's choice of chemotherapy. The study enrolled women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who had disease progression after a platinum-based regimen (measurable disease was required). All histologies except carcinosarcoma and sarcoma were permitted. Patients were stratified by mismatch repair (MMR) status. The two primary end points were PFS and OS.[
30
]
After a median follow-up of approximately 12 months in both groups,  survivals were statistically longer for patients in the pembrolizumab-lenvatinib group. The benefit persisted despite the patients' MMR statuses. Among all patients, the median PFS was 7.3 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 3.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.48–0.66;
P
< .001). The median OS was 18.7 months for patients who received pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 11.9 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55–0.77;
P
< .001).[
30
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The most frequent serious side effect in the experimental group was hypertension.
The double-blind placebo-controlled
KEYNOTE-868
study (NCT03914612) included 810 patients with advanced (stage III, stage IVA, or stage IVB) or recurrent endometrial cancer.[
31
] Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with either pembrolizumab or placebo. Afterwards, patients received up to 14 cycles of maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab or placebo. Patients were stratified according to MMR statuses (proficient [pMMR; n =588] or deficient [dMMR; n = 222]) to investigate if the checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, was  efficacious in patients with dMMR tumors.
After a median follow-up of 12.0 months, the 1-year PFS for patients with dMMR tumors was 74% in the pembrolizumab group and 38% in the  placebo group (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19–0.48;
P
< .001).[
31
][
Level of evidence B1
]
After a median follow-up of 7.9 months, the median PFS for patients with pMMR tumors was 13.1 months in the pembrolizumab group and 8.7 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71;
P
< .001).[
31
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Regardless of MMR status, pembrolizumab showed significant PFS improvement in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.
The phase III randomized
KEYNOTE-B21
trial (NCT04634877) included 1,095 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk stage I to stage IVA endometrial cancer (including carcinosarcoma) without evidence of disease postsurgery. All patients received either six cycles of chemotherapy with optional EBRT or four cycles of chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation therapy. Vaginal brachytherapy was allowed in both groups. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for six cycles, then every 6 weeks for six cycles. A total of 66% of patients had stage III or stage IVA disease, 26% had dMMR tumors, and 67% were treated with radiation therapy.[
32
,
33
]
After a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 75% in the pembrolizumab group and 76% in the placebo group (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79–1.32;
P
= .57).[
33
][
Level of evidence B1
]
In the dMMR cohort, the 2-year DFS rate was 92.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 80.2% in the placebo group (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14–0.69).
No other predetermined subgroup benefitted from adding pembrolizumab.
This study evaluated giving pembrolizumab to patients with positive lymph nodes after surgery who had no other visible evidence of disease. It also evaluated combining radiation therapy and pembrolizumab. Results were significant because they expanded the population of patients who can receive pembrolizumab.
The
RUBY
trial (NCT03981796) was a large multicenter trial in women with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique stage III, IV, or recurrent endometrial cancer of all histologies not amenable to curative therapy. Unlike the Study 309/KEYNOTE-775 trial, some patients without measurable disease qualified for inclusion. Women were randomly assigned to receive TC with or without dostarlimab (500 mg IV) every 3 weeks for six cycles followed by maintenance dostarlimab (1,000 mg IV every 6 weeks) for up to 3 years. Patients were stratified by MMR status. The primary end point was PFS.[
34
]
After a median follow-up of approximately 2 years, the dostarlimab group from the overall population had a 36% lower risk of progression or death (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51–0.80;
P
< .001). The dostarlimab group from the dMMR population had a 72% lower risk of progression or death (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16–0.50;
P
< .001). Similar benefit was seen in OS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.87,
P
= .0021 for the overall population; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.70 for the dMMR population).[
34

These three studies demonstrate the activity and benefit of immunotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced stage and recurrent endometrial cancer. These results may also facilitate the incorporation of such treatments into the up-front setting. More data are needed to help discern the role of immunotherapy in patients whose treatment plan would historically include radiation therapy.
Clinical trials
All patients with advanced disease should consider clinical trials
that evaluate single-agent or combination therapy for this disease.
Studies of treatment failure patterns have found a high rate of distant
metastases in the upper abdomen and  in extra-abdominal sites.[
35
] For this reason,
patients with stage III disease may be candidates for innovative clinical
trials.
Treatment options under clinical evaluation for stage IV endometrial cancer include the following  agents:
Paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without metformin in stages III, IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer (
GOG-0286B
[NCT02065687]).
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer (
15-079
[NCT02549989]).
Everolimus and letrozole or hormonal therapy in recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer  (
GOG-3007
[NCT02228681]).
Everolimus, letrozole, and metformin in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer   (
2012-0543
[NCT01797523]).

About This PDQ Summary
Purpose of This Summary

It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Endometrial Cancer Treatment are:
Olga T.  Filippova, MD (Lenox Hill Hospital)
Marina Stasenko, MD (New York University Medical Center)
