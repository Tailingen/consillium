WL276 CAR-T Cell Therapy for CD276 Positive Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Patients
Clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of WL276 CAR-T cell therapy in CD276 positive recurrent or progressive glioblastoma patients
Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: WL276 CAR-T cells
Evaluate the safety（Adverse event incidence rate、Incidence rate of abnormal laboratory test results） and tolerability（DLT incidence rate） of WL276 CAR-T cell therapy for CD276 positive recurrent or progressive glioblastoma, Adverse events related to CAR-T cell therapy within 28 days after infusion, abnormal laboratory test results with clinical significance, including dose limiting toxicity (DLTs)., Within 28 days after infusion
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) after infusion., 720 days after infusion|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) after infusion., 720 days after infusion
incidence of adverse events, Collect and compare the safety (incidence of adverse events) of different administration methods, 720 days after infusion|disease improvement rate, Collect and compare the efficacy (disease improvement rate) of different administration methods, 720 days after infusion|CAR-T cell counting, Collect and compare cell expansion data (CAR-T cell counts) after different administration methods, 720 days after infusion|CAR-T cell survival rate, Retention of WL276 CAR-T cells in peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or tumor tissue of patients, 720 days after infusion|CAR-T cell survival time, Duration of WL276 CAR-T cells in peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or tumor tissue of patients, 720 days after infusion|Cytokine levels, Changes in cytokines in peripheral blood of subjects before and after infusion of WL276 CAR-T cells, as well as the time to return to normal, 720 days after infusion
This study is an open label, single center early exploratory clinical trial of WL276001 CAR-T cell therapy for CD276 positive recurrent or progressive glioblastoma patients. This study used an improved "3+3" experimental design for dose escalation to explore the safety and efficacy of in-situ administration of WL276001 CAR-T cells.
