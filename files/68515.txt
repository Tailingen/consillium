The pain intensity index score was derived from Questions 2-5 with range from 0 to 10 (0: no pain; 1-4: mild pain; 5-6: moderate pain; 7-10: severe pain); higher scores indicate worse health status., Baseline (C1.D1), Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 16, and End of Treatment (EOT=following Cycle 16 or within 7 days of withdrawal from study)|Change From Baseline in Modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (mBPI-sf): Pain Interference (Questions 7A Through 7G), The questionnaire assesses pain intensity (worst, least, average, and right now), level of relief in the last 24 hours, and the impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life). The pain interference index score (to measure how much pain had interfered with daily activities) was derived from Questions 7A-7G with a range from 0 (no interference) to 10 (completely interferes); higher scores indicate more interference., Baseline (C1.D1), Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 16, and End of Treatment (EOT=following Cycle 16 or within 7 days of withdrawal from study)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Questionnaire (FACT-General and Prostate Cancer Subscale), Assesses health related quality of life and advanced prostate cancer specific symptoms. FACT-General (FACT-G) assesses 4 domains: physical, social and family, emotional, and functional well-being. The prostate cancer subscale assesses prostate cancer symptoms focusing on pain, urination problems, and sexual functions. Individual scores range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scores for some of the individual questions are reverse-coded in order for higher scores to correspond to better health status. FACT-P overall score range is 0 to 156; higher scores indicate better health status., Baseline (C1.D1), Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 16, and End of Treatment (EOT=following Cycle 16 or within 7 days of withdrawal from study)|Preliminary Assessment of PSA Modulation by SU011248, PSA modulation analyzed by the mean change in PSA response measured as ng/mL., Baseline to Day 28
