Single Dose of Cervarix Vaccine in Girls or Three Doses of Gardasil Vaccine in Women for the Prevention of Human Papillomavirus Infection, the PRIMAVERA-ESCUDDO Trial
This phase IIIb trial compares a single dose of the Cervarix vaccine in girls to 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccine in young women for the prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Cervarix is a vaccine used to prevent cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18. Gardasil is vaccine used to prevent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18 and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Giving only one dose of the Cervarix vaccine in girls may work the same as 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccine in young women in preventing HPV infection and ultimately, cervical and other HPV-related cancers. Currently, many women around the world cannot get HPV vaccines because they are too expensive. If this trial can show one dose given to young girls is enough to prevent cancer, more girls might be able to get the vaccine.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To demonstrate that the immunogenicity (as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay \[ELISA\]) of a single dose of recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) in 9-14 year old girls is non-inferior to the immunogenicity of three doses of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil), administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women 36 months after initial vaccination, with an interim analysis at 24 months after initial vaccination.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the distribution of HPV -16 and HPV-18 antibodies levels, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14 year old girls and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women.

II. To compare rates of seroconversion based on HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14 year old girls and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women.

III. To compare geometric mean titers (GMTs), distributions, and seroconversion rates for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-11 year old girls and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women; to perform a similar comparison restricting to 12-14 year old girls.

IV. To compare GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 1-month after vaccination and 1-year after vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-10 year old girls and a single dose of Cervarix in 11-14 year old girls.

V. To evaluate whether baseline variables (e.g. geographic district, initial antibody levels, date of vaccination) are associated with GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for HPV16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination.

OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Participants 9-14 years old receive Cervarix intramuscularly (IM) at baseline.

GROUP II: Participants 18-25 years old receive Gardasil IM at baseline and at 2 and 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of trial vaccine dose(s), participants are followed up at 1, 12, 24, and 36 months.
