Biomarkers in the Nose, Throat, and Lung Tissue of Smokers and Non-Smokers
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from smokers and non-smokers in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase II study is looking at biomarkers in the nose, throat, and lung tissue of smokers and non-smokers.
Lung Cancer|Precancerous Condition
Molecular and biochemical profiles, Evaluation of both Molecular and Biochemical profiles of normal non-smokers, smokers with no apparent disease (no airflow obstruction or cancer), and smokers with airflow obstruction and abnormal sputum cytology., Upon completion of trial
Occurrence of abnormalities, Stratify abnormalities as to whether they occur frequently in normal non-smokers, smokers without disease, smokers with various grades of dysplasia, or smokers with lung cancer., Upon completion of trial
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Define the molecular and biochemical profiles of airway epithelium of smokers with no disease, smokers with airflow obstruction and abnormal sputum cytology, and non-smokers.

Secondary

* Assess the occurrence of abnormalities in non-smokers, smokers with no disease, smokers with various grades of dysplasia, and smokers with lung cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker) and disease (no disease vs airflow obstruction and abnormal sputum cytology vs various grades of dysplasia vs lung cancer).

Biological samples are collected and analyzed for future research studies.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study.
