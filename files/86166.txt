Safety and Effectiveness of Adalimumab in Patients Diagnosed With Rheumatoid Arthritis
Adalimumab is one of the pharmacological treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of more recent marketing authorization, and as a result of this, there are only efficacy and safety data from clinical trials with controlled conditions.The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in the common clinical practice of RA treatment in Spain, with several types of patients showing concomitant treatments or diseases and compliance. Among the tumor necrosis factor antagonists safety studies, adalimumab safety has been the less investigated in the common clinical practice because of, as a result of its recent marketing, it was not included in the BIOBADASER (Data Base for Biological Products in Spain, Rheumatology Spanish Society), Biologic Products Database of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology ) in which was determined an association between infliximab therapy and the risk of developing active tuberculosis. To ensure the maintaining of the strict common physician practice (no prescription induction), and following the recommendations of the SER (Sociedad Española de Reumatología, Spanish Society of Rheumatology) consensus documents, it will be selected only those patients that were already in treatment with adalimumab (HUMIRA),(except patients involved in clinical studies with Adalimumab), and had shown good response, or those that fulfilled treatment indication in accordance with the SER recommendations and following the Summary of Products Characteristics of adalimumab (HUMIRA).

BIOLOGICAL: adalimumab (HUMIRA®)
Safety and Tolerability of Adalimumab Treatment. Adverse Events: Medical Occurrence in a Patient or Clinical Investigation Subject Administered a Pharmaceutical Product and Which Does Not Necessarily Have a Causal Relationship With the Treatment, The safety and tolerability of adalimumab was assessed at each study visit. The overall number of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs), non-serious adverse events (AEs) and AEs that led to discontinuation are presented. The number of participants presenting with any serious or non-serious event at each particular study visit is also reported. Note that for the incidence data participants were counted multiple times if they experienced an adverse event at more than 1 visit. For additional information see Reported Adverse Events., Baseline, 1, 4, 6, and 12 months
Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) Index Mean Change From Baseline. The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is a Combined Index That Has Been Developed to Measure the Disease Activity in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)., The DAS 28 index measures disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and is derived from the number swollen/tender joints, laboratory tests of inflammation, and participant assessment of global health (by marking a 10 cm line from "very good" to "very bad"). Ranges were used to classify participants, with a higher score indicating worse control of disease: Remission (\<= 2.6), Low Disease Activity (\>2.6 to \<=3.2), Moderate Disease Activity (\>3.2 to \<= 5.1) and High Disease Activity (\>5.1). The mean change in DAS 28 score from baseline to final is presented., Baseline and 12 months|Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) Index Percentage Change From Baseline. The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is a Combined Index That Has Been Developed to Measure the Disease Activity in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)., The DAS 28 index measures disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and is derived from the number swollen/tender joints, laboratory tests of inflammation, and participant assessment of global health (by marking a 10 cm line from "very good" to "very bad"). Ranges were used to classify participants, with a higher score indicating worse control of disease: Remission (\<= 2.6), Low Disease Activity (\>2.6 to \<=3.2), Moderate Disease Activity (\>3.2 to \<= 5.1) and High Disease Activity (\>5.1). The percentage reduction of baseline values is presented., Baseline and 12 months|Clinical Evaluation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Clinical Evaluation in the Inclusion Visit and in Each One of the Study Visits., The treating physician was to clinically assess each participant at each study visit and report the number of painful and swollen joints. The mean number of painful or swollen joints for participants evaluated at each time point are presented by subgroup. The number of participants evaluated in each subgroup at each time point are also reported., Baseline, 1, 4, 6, and 12 months|Life Quality Assessment Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ Questionnaire) Mean Change From Baseline., Quality of life was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The HAQ is a self-reported scale used in studies of rheumatoid arthritis to assess areas such as dressing/grooming arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, maintaining hygiene, and daily activities. The global HAQ questionnaire was scored as follows: \<1 = no/mild disability, 1 to 2 = moderate disability, and \>2 = severe disability. An increased score indicates a worsening of the disability. The mean change in global HAQ score from baseline to 12 months is reported (baseline value - final value)., Baseline and 12 months|Life Quality Assessment Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ Questionnaire) Percentage Change From Baseline., Quality of life was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The HAQ is a self-reported scale used in studies of rheumatoid arthritis to assess areas such as dressing/grooming arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, maintaining hygiene, and daily activities. The global HAQ questionnaire was scored as follows: \<1 = no/mild disability, 1 to 2 = moderate disability, and \>2 = severe disability. An increased score indicates a worsening of the disability. The percentage change from baseline to 12 months (12-month score minus baseline score divided by baseline score) is presented., Baseline and 12 Months|Radiological Evaluation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)., Treating physicians were asked to obtain a structural damage assessment by performing x-rays of the hands and feet approximately 1 year after the previous structural damage assessment that was done prior to the participant entering the study. The number of participants with radiological erosions evaluated at baseline and the 12-month visit are summarized by subgroup., Baseline and 12 months
