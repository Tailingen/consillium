Gemcitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Advanced Stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Oxaliplatin is a diaminocyclohexane platinum compound, with a mechanism of action similar to that of cisplatin. Oxaliplatin has a more manageable toxicity profile than cisplatin, with no renal toxicity and a lower incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin are both active in NSCLC with no overlapping toxicity. Preclinical studies show a synergistic effect of the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination. The combination of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin is attractive in NSCLC patients as it may improve the therapeutic index.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Response rate, every 12 weeks during until disease progression
To access the toxicity, the first day of the treatment to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|To estimate the time to progression and overall survival, the first day of treatment to the date that disease progression is reported|To evaluate the improvement quality of life, before the first treatment and every cycle d1 until diseas progression|To estimate the overall survival, the first day of the treatment to death date
The combination of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin is attractive in NSCLC patients as it may improve the therapeutic index. We are conducting a phase II study to evaluate the response rate and toxicity of the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination both given every 4 weeks in patients with advanced NSCLC.
