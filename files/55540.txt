A Study of Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Durvalumab for the Treatment of Patients With Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center international study assessing the activity of durvalumab and chemotherapy administered prior to surgery compared with placebo and chemotherapy administered prior to surgery in terms of pathological complete response.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|OTHER: Placebo|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, Defined as the lack of any viable tumour cells after complete evaluation in the resected lung cancer specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes., Up to approximately 15 weeks after randomization|Event-Free Survival (EFS) in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, An event is defined as documented RECIST 1.1 local or distant recurrence of lung cancer; death due to any cause; disease progression that precludes surgery or discovered upon attempting surgery that prevents completion of surgery., Up to 5.5 years after first patient randomized.
Disease-free survival (DFS) in modified resected population, From date of randomization to approximately 5.5 years after date of resection|Major Pathological Response (mPR) in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, Up to approximately 15 weeks after randomization|Overall Survival (OS) in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, From date of randomization to 5.5 years after randomization|Event-free survival (EFS) in PD-L1-TC ≥1% patients in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, From date of randomization to 5.5 years after randomization|pCR in PD-L1-TC ≥1% patients in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, Up to approximately 15 weeks after randomization|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in PD-L1-TC ≥1% patients in modified resected population, From date of randomization to 5.5 years after date of resection|Major Pathological Response (mPR) in PD-L1-TC ≥1% patients in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, Up to approximately 15 weeks after randomization|Overall Survival (OS) in PD-L1-TC ≥1% patients in modified intent to treat (mITT) population, From date of randomization to 5.5 years after randomization.|To assess disease-related symptoms and HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) in patients treated with durvalumab + chemotherapy prior to surgery followed by durvalumab post-surgery compared with placebo + chemotherapy prior to surgery followed by placebo post-surgery, To assess disease-related symptoms, functioning, and global health status/quality of life in patients., From date of screening to 6 months after last dose of IP|To assess disease-related symptoms and HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-LC13) in patients treated with durvalumab + chemotherapy prior to surgery followed by durvalumab post-surgery compared with placebo + chemotherapy prior to surgery followed by placebo post-surgery, To assess disease-related symptoms, functioning, and global health status/quality of life in patients., From date of screening to 6 months after last dose of IP|To assess the PK of durvalumab in blood, To assess concentration of durvalumab in bloodstream., From date of randomization to 2 months after resection|Presence of ADA for durvalumab, To evaluate the presence of antibodies following treatment with study medications., From date of randomization to 3 months after last dose of IP
Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From date of randomization to 3 months after last dose of IP
