Selective Lymph Node Dissection Using Fluorescent Dye in Node-positive Breast Cancer
In this study, navigation of lymphatic passage after sentinel lymph node with indocyanine green was performed during axillary lymph node dissection in breast surgery . By comparing the concordance between the passage of indocyanine green and actual lymph node metastasis, selective lymph node dissection can be developed.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Axillary lymph node dissection|DRUG: Indocyanine green|DEVICE: Imaging devices
Number of metastatic lymph nodes in fluorescent positive lymph nodes and fluorescent negative lymph nodes confirmed by pathologist, Concordance analysis is done by comparing lymph node metastasis between fluorescent positive lymph nodes and fluorescent negative lymph nodes., within 2 weeks (plus or minus 3 days) after surgery
Clinicopathological factors associated with lymph node metastasis in fluorescent negative lymph nodes, Risk factor analysis of fluorescent negative lymph node with positive lymph node metastasis, within 2 weeks (plus or minus 3 days) after surgery
Low dose of indocyanine green emits near-infrared fluorescence, which can penetrate thin tissues like breast or skin. The operator can track the lymphatic pathway without skin incision in real time. By these characteristics, indocyanine green is currently used for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer surgery. Indocyanine green can also stain lymph nodes beyond the sentinel lymph nodes. This is why we can identify the lymphatic metastasis pathway of breast cancer.
