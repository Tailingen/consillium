Continuous Versus Bolus Administration of G-CSF in Children With Cancer
The investigators hypothesized that in terms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration, the route of continuous infusion would lead to a faster neutrophil recovery compared to that of bolus administration
Pediatric Cancer|Neutropenia|Lenograstim|Filgrastim|G-CSF
DEVICE: G-CSF administration (bolus injection versus intravenous infusion)|DRUG: G-CSF administration (bolus injection versus intravenous infusion)
Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), ANC higher than 1500 cells/mm3 for three consecutive days, up to 30 days
Hospitalization duration, Hospitalization duration from admission to discharge, up to 30 days|Re-hospitalization event, 14 days re-hospitalization event, up to 5 times|Clinical sepsis, Events of severe bacterial infection during neutropenic period, up to 5 times
The investigators aimed to enroll 40 hospitalized patients in this phase 4 clinical trial. Patients with an ANC lower than 500 cells/mm3 will be randomly categorized into experimental and controlled arms. The experimental arm was designed to receive G-CSF intravenous infusion for 5 hours at a dose of 5 mcg/kg. The controlled arm was designed to receive a G-CSF bolus injection within one minute at a dose of 5 mcg/kg. Three days after treatment initiation, serum white blood cell and differential counts will be followed daily to determine the timing of steady neutrophil recovery. In the following time of another neutropenia event, the experimental arm would cross-switch to the controlled arm and receive corresponding G-CSF according to the study design
