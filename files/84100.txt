Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Advanced Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutant Disease.
The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab with platinum-pemetrexed in patients with metastatic NSCLC (T790+ve or T790M-ve) following progression on EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors..

Study population:

Individuals may be eligible to enrol in this trial if aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (T790+ve or T790M-ve) following progression on EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.

Study details:

All participants enrolled in this trial will begin with induction therapy which involves 4 cycles of durvalumab 1500mg and tremelimumab 75mg with cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5, and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks.

Participants will then move into a maintenance phase of durvalumab 1500mg and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 once every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.

All patients will be reviewed every three to four weeks by blood samples, CT scans and side effect assessments.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether treatment with durvalumab and tremelimumab with platinum-pemetrexed is feasible, safe and effective for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (T790+ve or T790M-ve).
