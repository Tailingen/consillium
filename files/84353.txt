Nutrition and Outcomes of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)
Retrospective case-note review to determine if nutrition via the enteral compared to the parenteral route results in better outcomes after haematopoietic cell transplantation.
Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant|Graft Versus Host Disease|Hematologic Malignancy|Stem Cell Transplant Complications
Number of Participants With Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) at Any Site (Grade II or Above) and Acute GvHD of the Gut of Any Grade, Occurrence of acute GvHD at any site (grade II or above) and acute GvHD of the gut of any grade (graded according to standard criteria). Standard criteria to grade the severity of acute GvHD are quantification of rash, serum bilirubin and diarrhoea. These standard criteria have been developed and used for \> 20 years by most transplant centres to improve comparability between publications., 100 days after the date of hematopoietic cell infusion|Non Relapse Mortality, Defined as death without previous relapse, 100 days after the date of hematopoietic cell infusion
Graft Versus Host Disease-free and Relapse-free Survival, GvHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS). Events in GRFS included grade 3-4 acute GvHD, systemic therapy-requiring chronic GvHD, relapse, or death, 5 years after the date of hematopoietic cell infusion|5 Year Survival, 5 years after the date of hematopoietic cell infusion
This is a retrospective case-note review of adults undergoing haematopoietic cell transplantation to treat a haematological malignancy who have been admitted to Hammersmith Hospital from 2000 to 2014. All patients receiving an allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant from a matched sibling or identically matched unrelated donor will be included. We will record the route and assess the broad adequacy of nutritional intakes to determine if nutrition via the enteral compared to the parenteral route results in better outcomes after haematopoietic cell transplantation. Our outcomes are graft versus host disease incidence and severity, transplant related (early) mortality and overall survival.
