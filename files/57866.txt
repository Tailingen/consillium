Gentamicin Versus Clindamycin Versus Normal Saline Lavage in Axilla
The patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection were randomized into 3 groups: patients undergoing lavages with normal saline (Group 1), patients undergoing lavage gentamicin solution (Group 2) and patients undergoing lavage with a clindamycin solution (Group 3). Drainage volume discharge is investigated

The patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection were randomized into 3 groups: patients undergoing 2 lavages with 500 ml normal saline (Group 1), patients first undergoing lavage with 500 ml normal saline followed by a second lavage with a 500 ml of a gentamicin (240 mg) solution (Group 2) and patients first undergoing lavage with 500 ml normal saline followed by a second lavage with 500ml of a clindamycin (600mg) solution (Group 3).
