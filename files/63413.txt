This is an open-label, multi-center, phase I/II study. The study includes two study drugs CN1 and CN401 and will be conducted in two parts: phase 1 and phase 2.

Phase I: Dose-finding study for the assessment of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at 3 or more dose levels in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies.

Phase II: Expansion study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CN1 in combination with CN401 at the RP2D in parallel patient cohorts grouped by non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) subtype.

There will 9-18 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study and 15- 60 patients will be enrolled in Phase 2 - dosing determined by Phase 1.
