A First-in-Human Open-label, Phase I/Ib Dose Escalation and Expansion Cohort Study of EOS006215 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab or Other Anticancer Treatments in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
TRM-010 is a first-in-human (FIH) clinical study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of EOS006215, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). The study includes EOS006215 monotherapy and combination therapy with other anticancer agents in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: EOS006215|DRUG: Anticancer agent
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) [Safety and Tolerability], DLTs - At the end of Cycle 1 AEs/SAES - Duration of intervention (up to 24 months) plus 30 days follow-up|Rate of treatment modifications (interruption or permanent discontinuation) [Safety and Tolerability], Duration of intervention (up to 24 months)|Changes in safety parameters (clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiogram [ECG] / QTcF) [Safety and Tolerability], Duration of intervention (up to 24 months) plus 30 days follow-up
Overall response rate (ORR) [Efficacy], Proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed at a minimum of 2 post-baseline radiological assessments, without an intervening response of progressive disease, From randomization to confirmed radiological improvement, if applicable, assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response (DoR), Time from the date of first confirmed CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the date of documented disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression., From first confirmed CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the date of documented disease progression or death in the absence of disease progression, assessed up to 24 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 [Efficacy], Time from starting treatment until disease progression or death for any reason.|Serum concentrations and PK parameters of EOS006215, Serum concentration-time data will be summarized by descriptive statistics by each treatment cohort and time point. PK parameters, such as Cmax, Cmin, AUC and CL will be derived by non-compartmental analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics., From start of treatment until end of treatment (EOT)|Incidence of antidrug antibody (ADA) against EOS006215, Individual ADA occurrence will be listed, and percentage of occurrence will be summarized by descriptive statistics., From start of treatment until end of treatment (EOT)|Dose-finding to determine recommended Phase 2 dose, The RP2D(s) will be identified from the available safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary efficacy data across the dose ranges evaluated in monotherapy and in combination with anticancer agents., Duration of intervention (up to 24 months) plus 30 days follow-up
The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

* Part 1 - Dose Escalation Phase I dose escalation cohorts for EOS006215 as monotherapy and in combination with anticancer treatments in participants with specific tumor types.
* Part 2 - Dose Expansion Phase Ib dose expansion cohort(s) may be included to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD of EOS006215 as monotherapy or in combination with anticancer treatments in participants with specific tumor types.
