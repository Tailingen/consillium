Investigation of the Effect of Nintedanib on the Pharmacokinetics of a Combination of Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Investigate the effect of multiple oral doses of nintedanib on the single dose kinetics of a combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel (Microgynon®)
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Microgynon|DRUG: Nintedanib
Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of the the Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel in Plasma Over the Time Interval From 0 to the Last Quantifiable Data Point (AUC0-tz), Area under the concentration-time curve in plasma over the time interval from 0 to the time of the last quantifiable data point (AUC 0-tz) for ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after a single dose of the combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In Period 1, blood samples were collected at pre-dose at 0.35 hour (h) and at 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after drug administration of Microgynon®. Nintedanib in Period 2 was started at least 7 days before Microgynon® administration.

In Period 2, blood samples were collected at pre-dose at 0.35 hour (h) and at 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 11.55h, 23.55h, 47.55h and 71.55h after drug administration of Microgynon®., Please refer to description section for the details about the actual sampling time points|Maximum Measured Concentration (Cmax) of Ethinylestradiol and Levonorgestrel, Maximum blood concentrations (Cmax) for ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after a single dose of the combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
