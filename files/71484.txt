European Trial on Enhanced DNA Repair Inhibition in Ovarian Cancer
This study will be performed in women with platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous, high-grade endometrioid, undifferentiated epithelial ovarian cancer, carcinosarcoma, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer (proven by central histo-pathological review).

A total of 120 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to three different treatment arms: (A) Standard arm (arm A): Carboplatin (AUC5 d1, q3w i.v.) in combination with Paclitaxel (175 mg/m² d1, q3w i.v.) or Carboplatin (AUC4 d1, q3w i.v.) in combination with Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1, d8, q3w i.v.) followed by maintenance therapy with Niraparib (200/ 300 mg oral daily, q4w) // (B) First experimental arm (arm B): Ganetespib (150 mg/m2, d1, q3w) in combination with Carboplatin (AUC5 d1, q3w i.v.) followed by maintenance treatment with Niraparib (200/ 300 mg oral daily, q4w) // (C) Second experimental arm (arm C): Ganetespib (150 mg/m² d1, q3w i.v.) plus Carboplatin (AUC5 d1, q3w i.v.) followed by Ganetespib (100 mg/m² d1, d8, d15, d22, q4w i.v.) and Niraparib (200 mg oral daily, q4w).

Chemotherapy treatment will be given for 6 cycles, maintenance treatment with Ganetespib will be given for a maximum of 9 months or until disease progression, maintenance treatment with Niraparib can continue until disease progression.
