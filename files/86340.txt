A Phase I Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-Tumor Activity of CUDC-101 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of CUDC-101 in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors. CUDC-101 is a multi-targeted agent designed to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor Type 2(Her2) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The study is designed to establish the safety, including the maximum tolerated dose, the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-tumor activity of CUDC-101.
Tumors
DRUG: CUDC-101
The highest dose level of CUDC-101 at which <33% of at least 6 or more subjects experiences a dose limiting toxicity., The maximum tolerated dose is the highest dose level at which \<33% of at least 6 or more subjects experiences a dose limiting toxicity., Study treatment period - approximately 12 months|The number of patients with adverse events., The number of patients with adverse events will be assessed to determine the safety and tolerability of CUDC-101., Study treatment period - approximately 12 months
Number of patients that show a response (complete response or partial response) based on RECIST criteria., To evaluate the efficacy of CUDC-101 in subjects with advanced and refractory solid tumors, responses based on RECIST criteria will be evaluated., Study treatment period - approximately 12 months|Plasma concentration of CUDC-101 over time from Day 1 through Day 6., To assess the pharmacokinetics of CUDC-101 in this patient population, plasma concentration of CUDC-101 will be measured over time from Day 1 through Day 6., Approximately 1 week|Measurement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in archival tumor tissue, skin biopsies and tumor biopsies., Measurement of EGFR to evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers of CUDC-101 activity., Pre-treatment through Day 5 of cycle 1 - approximately 1 week
