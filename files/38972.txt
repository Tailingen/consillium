Analysis of Predictive Factors for Urinary Leakage After Partial Nephrectomy for Renal Hilum Tumors
In this study, we plan to explore the risk factors closely related to the occurrence of urinary leakage after partial nephrectomy for renal hilum tumors through retrospective analysis of multicenter clinical data, thereby providing clinical guidance value for the prevention of postoperative urinary leakage.

Postoperative urinary leakage, Postoperative urinary leakage is defined as the postoperative perirenal drainage volume being greater than 50 ml for 7 consecutive days and the creatinine level of the drainage fluid being similar to that of urine(μmol/L), or postoperative urinary leakage being suspected by imaging examination., the postoperative perirenal drainage volume being greater than 50 ml for 7 consecutive days and the creatinine level of the drainage fluid being similar to that of urine(μmol/L), or postoperative urinary leakage being suspected by imaging examination.
