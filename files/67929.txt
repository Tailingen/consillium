COL Immunotherapy Before Radiochimio + Ipilimumab
This is a multicenter, single arm pilot study evaluating the biological impact of "Nivolumab + Ipilimumab" in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma requiring RT-CT as initial therapy
Cervix Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
CD8+/FOXP3+ relative change of lymphocytes from pre to post treatment biopsies, Baseline, before RT-CT
Adverse events, Assessed by CTCAE 4.03, Up to 100-days after end of treatment or until initiation of alternative cancer therapy|Objective Response Rate, 1week before RT-CT, 4 weeks after RT-CT|Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Overall Survival, 3 years
The aim of COLIBRI is to evaluate the evolution of the CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio of lymphocytes in pre- versus post-treatment biopsies in patients treated with a combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in a pilot study, just before starting standard RT-CT.

The study will also assess tolerability, Objective Response Rate, clinical activity and biological (dynamic) changes of the immune micro environment
