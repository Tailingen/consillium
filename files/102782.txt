Stereotactic Radiosurgery Dose Escalation for Brain Metastases
This is a Phase I dose escalation and expansion trial. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation received during stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with brain metastases who have never received radiation to the brain before.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Maximum Tolerated Dose of stereotactic radiosurgery, Patients will be evaluated for any grade 3 or greater toxicities attributed to the lesion treated with the escalated dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose of stereotactic radiosurgery will be evaluated throughout the treatment period which is expected to last 12 weeks per patient
