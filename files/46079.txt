A Study of TTI-101 as Monotherapy and in Combination in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic, and Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The primary objectives of Cohort A Phase 1b are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TTI-101 orally administered as a single agent to participants with locally advanced or metastatic, and unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TTI-101 as a single agent.

The primary objectives of Cohort A Phase 2 are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TTI-101 orally administered as a single agent at the RP2D to participants with locally advanced or metastatic, and unresectable HCC and to assess the preliminary efficacy of TTI-101 as a single agent in participants with locally advanced or metastatic, and unresectable HCC. The secondary objectives of Cohort A Phase 2 are to assess response, progression, survival, and pharmacokinetics.

The primary objectives of Cohorts B and C Phase 1b are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TTI-101 orally administered in combination with pembrolizumab therapy (Cohort B) and in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy (Cohort C) to participants with locally advanced or metastatic, or unresectable HCC and to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of TTI-101 when used in combination with pembrolizumab therapy (Cohort B) and in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy (Cohort C).

The primary objectives of Cohorts B and C Phase 2 are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TTI-101 orally administered in combination with pembrolizumab therapy (Cohort B) and in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy (Cohort C) at the RP2D to participants with locally advanced or metastatic, and unresectable HCC and to assess the preliminary efficacy of TTI-101 in combination with pembrolizumab therapy (Cohort B) and in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy (Cohort C) to participants with locally advanced or metastatic, and unresectable HCC. The secondary objectives of Cohorts B and C Phase 2 are to assess response, progression, survival, and pharmacokinetics.
