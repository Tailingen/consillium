Prognosis of Low-grade Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma
This study is to investigate the survival outcomes and fertility outcomes in patients with uterine low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS) treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. All primary and recurrent LGESS patients will be enrolled. The study will collect retrospectively data consisting of epidemiological characteristics, surgical, medical treatment and adjuvant therapy. Details about recurrence, mortality, pregnancy and obstetrical outcomes are also followed as primary endpoints. Fertility-sparing procedures, including uterine-sparing and ovary-sparing surgeries will be recorded specifically.
