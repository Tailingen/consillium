A Phase II Study of Sirolimus and Erlotinib in Recurrent/Refractory Germ Cell Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) with an EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib) is effective at treating relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors, and to find out what the side-effects of this regimen are.
