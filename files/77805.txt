Safety and Anti-Tumor Activity of TYRA-200 in Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma With Activating FGFR2 Gene Alterations
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200 in cancers with FGFR2 activating gene alterations, including unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other advanced solid tumors.
Locally Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma|Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma|Solid Tumor|Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Phase 1 Part A - dose escalation TYRA-200 taken once daily by mouth in 28-day cycles|DRUG: Phase 1 Part B - dose expansion TYRA-200 taken once daily by mouth in 28-day cycles
Phase 1 Part A: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TYRA-200., Initiation of study treatment through 28 Days|Phase 1 Part B: To determine the optimal dose of TYRA-200., Initiation of study treatment through 28 days (up to approximately 18 months
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability., From day 1 treatment through 28-days post treatment (up to 2 years)|Frequency in changes in laboratory parameters and physical signs of toxicity., From day 1 treatment through 28-days post treatment (up to 2 years)|Pharmacokinetics: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)., From Day 1 through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics: time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax)., From Day 1 through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics: area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)., From Day 1 through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics: half-life of Tyra-200 (t1/2)., From Day 1 through Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator using RECIST V1.1., From enrollment, every 8 or 12 weeks (up to 2 years)|Duration of response defined as the time from the initial CR or PR to the time of relapse or death, whichever occurs first among participant with an objective response., From enrollment, every 8 or 12 weeks (up to 5 years)|Disease control rate defined as the proportion of participants having a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for >12 weeks., From enrollment up to 5 years|Time to response defined as time to first CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 5 years|Progression-free survival defined as the time from the date of first study drug administration to the earliest date of documented disease progression or death., From the date of the first dose of study drug until disease progression or death as assessed up to the last efficacy assessment for disease progression (up to 5 years)
This is a single arm, multi-part, phase 1 clinical trial studying TYRA-200, a novel, potent fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1/2/3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other advanced solid tumors with activating alterations in FGFR2. Part A is a dose escalation study in participants with any advanced solid tumor with FGFR/FGF pathway alterations who have exhausted approved standard therapies. Part A will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TYRA-200 to determine the optimal and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part B will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-200 in participants with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who have previously received an FGFR inhibitor and have FGFR2 kinase-domain mutations resistant to other FGFR inhibitors.
