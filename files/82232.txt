Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of YPEG-rhG-CSF in Malignancies Receiving Chemotherapy
This phase 3 study is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of YPEG-rhG-CSF in reducing the infection manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancy who receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy which is likely to cause clinically significant febrile neutropenia.
Non-Myeloid Malignancy
DRUG: YPEG-rhG-CSF|DRUG: YPEG-rhG-CSF|DRUG: rhG-CSF/PEG-rhG-CSF
Mean Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN) During Cycle 1., Mean duration of severe neutropenia, defined as number of consecutive days with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<0.5 × 10\^9 cells/l (grade 4 neutropenia), At the end of Cycle 1 (21 days one cycle)
Incidence of Febrile neutropenia(FN)., FN defines as the ANC counts is less than \< 0.5 × 10\^9 cells/L or ANC counts between 0.5 × 10\^9 cells/L and 1.0 × 10\^9 cells/L but probably to decline to less than 0.5×10\^9 cells/L within 48hrs, and body temperature is higher than 38.3 degrees Celsius or higher than 38.0 degrees Celsius and lasting for more than 1hr., Cycle1 to Cycle 4(21 days one cycle)|Mean duration of DSN., Cycle2 to Cycle 4 (21 days one cycle)|Incidence of Grade 3 neutropenia., Grade 3 neutropenia defines as the ANC count is less than 1.0×10\^9 cells/L., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 ( 21 days one cycle)|Mean duration of grade 3 neutropenia., Cycle1 to Cycle 4(21 days one cycle)|Neutrophils dynamic changes from baseline., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 ( 21 days one cycle)|Time of neutrophils recovering to over 2.0×10^9 cells/L after nadir., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 (21 days one cycle)|Proportion of patients with antibiotic usage., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 ( 21 days one cycle)|Proportion of patients experienced infection., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 ( 21 days one cycle)|Proportion of patients fulfilling expected chemotherapy., Cycle1 to Cycle 4 (21 days one cycle)
