Online Nutrition Education to Decrease the Side Effects of Chemotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer
This trial tests an online nutrition education program focused on decreasing nutrition-related side effects of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Patients undergoing chemotherapy are at risk for complications such as diarrhea or constipation which can lead to poor nutritional intake and malabsorption of nutrients. This study is testing the effects of information delivered via the Cook for Your Life website in conjunction with standard clinical care to improve symptom management during chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, which could serve as a new model for supportive oncology care.
