Pembrolizumab + Poly-ICLC in MRP Colon Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to determine the dose of poly-ICLC that is safe and tolerable when it is combined with pembrolizumab in patients with colon cancer. This study will also evaluate how the combination of pembrolizumab and poly-ICLC activates the immune system in the patient's blood and inside the tumor; how it affects the size and number of tumor(s) in each patient; and how effective the combination is in patients with colon cancer that is unlikely to respond to pembrolizumab alone.

DRUG: pembrolizumab|DRUG: Poly-ICLC
Phase 1: Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Poly-ICLC That Can be Combined With Pembrolizumab, A minimum of 3 participants will be treated at dose level 1 (1mg).

* If 0 out of 3 participants experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT), then dose escalation will proceed to dose level 2 (2mg).
* If 1 out of 3 participants experience DLT, a cohort of additional 3 participants will be assigned to the same dose level (1mg).
* If 2 or more participants of 3 (or 6) experience DLT at dose level 1, then enrollment of participants will be stopped., 12 months|Phase 1 and 2: Determine the Response Rate of Metastatic MRP Colon Cancer (That Has Progressed Following Two Lines of Therapy in the Metastatic Setting) to the Combination of Pembrolizumab and Poly-ICLC, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From baseline to disease progression (Expected 12-24 months)|Determine the Overall Survival Rate for Recurrent Metastatic MRP Colon Cancer Response to the Combination of Pembrolizumab and Poly-ICLC, The overall survival rate of response to the combination of pembrolizumab and poly-ICLC administered at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be estimated along with the correspondent 95% confidence interval., From baseline to disease progression (up to 24 months)
Determine the Adverse Event Profile and Dose Limiting Toxicities of the Combination of Pembrolizumab and Poly-ICLC, The adverse event profile will be presented by dose level of the combination treatment for the phase I portion, 12 months|Determine the 20-week Progression Free Survival Rate of Recurrent Metastatic MRP Colon Cancer to the Combination of Pembrolizumab and Poly-ICLC, The 20-week progression free survival rate for the combination of pembrolizumab and poly-ICLC administered at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be estimated along with the correspondent 95% confidence interval., 20 weeks|Determine the Duration of Response of Recurrent Metastatic MRP Colon Cancer to the Combination of Pembrolizumab and Poly-ICLC, The duration of response to the combination of pembrolizumab and poly-ICLC administered at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) will be estimated along with the correspondent 95% confidence interval., From baseline to disease progression (up to 24 months)
Mismatch repair genes normally serve to fix the small glitches that occur when DNA is copied as cells divide. In 1993, researchers discovered that mutations in human mismatch repair genes play a key role in the development of certain forms of colorectal cancer; individuals who are deficient in these mismatch repair genes are at high risk for colorectal cancer. Accumulating evidence has shown that immunotherapy may be most effective against these cancers.

Programmed cell death protein 1, also known as PD-1, functions as an immune checkpoint, down-regulating the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells, which in turn reduces autoimmunity and promotes self-tolerance. A new class of immunotherapy drugs that block PD-1, the PD-1 inhibitors, activate the immune system to attack tumors and are therefore used with varying success to treat some types of cancer.

Current clinical trials are showing that patients whose tumors are mismatch repair deficient are more likely to respond to immune-boosting anti-PD-1 drugs-such as pembrolizumab-than those with tumors proficient in mismatch repair. The idea is that the greater the number of DNA glitches in a tumor cell, the more abnormal proteins it will produce-and the more abnormal proteins that are generated, the greater the odds that the body's immune cells will regard the tumor cells as "foreign" and target them for destruction. Thus far, PD-1 inhibitors have shown great promise for mismatch repair deficient cancer patients, but not for mismatch repair proficient (MRP) cancer patients.

In this clinical trial, the investigators hypothesize that treating MRP colon cancer patients with immunostimulating agent poly-ICLC will generate an inflammatory response, increasing epitope recognition and development of tumor reactive T-cells at the tumor site. However, interferon alpha and gamma produced by the poly-ICLC will increase PD-L1 expression and limit new T-cell development. Thus, PD1 blockade will increase the effectiveness of treatment with pembrolizumab.
