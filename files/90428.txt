To Investigate the Role of Gut Microbiome in ADT Related Metabolic Changes in Prostate Cancer Patients
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in male cancer globally and ranked third in Hong Kong. While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the backbone treatment for advanced prostate cancer, it could lead to obesity, metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular mortality. Previous studies showed that ADT patients have different gut microbiome compared to non-ADT patients and the gut microbiome might be related to the metabolic changes. However, the underlying mechanism of these metabolic complications is still not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the relationship and related mechanism between the changes in gut microbiomes and ADT-related metabolic change in prostate cancer patients.
Prostate Cancer
To assess the changes in gut microbiota in prostate cancer patients after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), Gut microbiome related metabolites will be measured by ELISA and mass spectrometry., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6
It is a prospective longitudinal observational human study. Fifty prostate cancer patients planned for ADT will be recruited. Fecal sample will be collected before initiation of ADT, and then at 3 and 6 months after initiation of ADT. Anthropometric, blood metabolic parameters, serum inflammation markers and panels of microbiome metabolites will be measured at these timepoints. Changes in gut microbiome from baseline to 6 months after initiation of ADT will be assessed. Correlation of changes in gut microbiome and metabolic changes, as well as inflammation and microbiome metabolites, will be assessed and possible mechanisms will be explored.
