A Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of iNK in the Treatment of Subjects for Preventing Recurrence of Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Allogeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: NCR300 injection
Dose-Limiting Toxicity(DLT), Number of participants with Dose-limiting toxicity in 28 days after first infusion, 4 weeks after initial infusion|Adverse Event(AE) or Serious Adverse Event(SAE), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From the date of initial infusion to a year after initial infusion
Maximum plasma concentration(Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration of NCR300 in peripheral blood, 2 hours before initial infusion;4 hours ,24 hous, 3 Days after initial infusion.2 hours before second infusion; 24 hous, 3 Days after second infusion.|Time after doing at which maximun plasma concentration is reached(Tmax), Time after doing at which maximun plasma concentration of NCR300 in peripheral blood is reached, 2 hours before initial infusion;4 hours ,24 hous, 3 Days after initial infusion.2 hours before second infusion; 24 hous, 3 Days after second infusion.|Cumulative Incidence of Relapse(CIR), The proportion of patients with hematological recurrence within 6 months after initial infusion to all patients, 6 Months After Initial Infusion|Minimal Residual Disease(MRD), Changes in MRD before and after treatment, From the date of screening to a year after initial infusion
This is an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of NCR300 injection.
