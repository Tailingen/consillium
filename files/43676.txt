Single-Incision Gasless Endoscopic Total Thyroidectomy Via Subclavian Approach Versus Open Surgery for PTC
Historically, performing a contralateral thyroid lobectomy and lymph node dissection via the subclavian approach was considered challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-incision gasless endoscopic total thyroidectomy and central compartment neck dissection via the subclavian approach (SCA) in comparison to conventional open surgery for the treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) retrospectively.
