Bone Toxicity Following Pelvic Radiotherapy
A randomised controlled clinical feasibility trial to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a "musculoskeletal health package (MHP)" intervention in women undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancies and inform power calculations for a definitive trial.
