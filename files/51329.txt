Mangafodipir as an Adjunct to FOLFOX6 Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer Stage Dukes' C
The present feasibility study is designed to find out whether pre-treatment with the compound mangafodipir lowers the frequency and severity of side effects during adjuvant chemotherapy according to the FOLFOX6 regimen in patients operated upon colon cancer in stage Dukes' C.
Chemotherapy|Colon Cancer
DRUG: Mangafodipir|DRUG: Placebo treatment (0.9% NaCl)
Neutropenia, Before and after completion of one, two and/or three FOLFOX6-cycles
Quality of Life, Before and after completion of one, two and/or three FOLFOX6-cycles
Mangafodipir, manganese (Mn) dipyridoxyl diphosphate, is a catalytic antioxidant and iron chelator recently (2006) suggested for cancer treatment in an Editorial in Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Preclinical research has shown that mangafodipir protects normal tissues without loss of anti-tumour activity during chemotherapy. Other advantages are that mangafodipir is already approved for use in patients as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of liver, and that the experience for more than a decade reveals high safety with mainly minor and tolerable side-effects.

The present study will include 14 patients who will be followed throughout 3 treatment cycles. Each cycle will be preceded by infusion of mangafodipir or placebo in two groups, each consisting of 7 patients. The primary endpoints will be the most frequent manifestation of FOLFOX6, namely neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity. The secondary endpoints will be the frequency and severity of other FOLFOX6-related adverse events and quality of life.
