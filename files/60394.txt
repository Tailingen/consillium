A Study of Atezolizumab With or Without Tiragolumab in Participants With Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Whose Cancers Have Not Progressed Following Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab compared with placebo in participants with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (or those who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery) and whose cancers have not progressed following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (Arm A), tiragolumab matching placebo plus atezolizumab (Arm B), or double placebo (Arm C).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab Matching Placebo|DRUG: Atezolizumab Matching Placebo
Arm A vs Arm C: Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS), From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|Arm A vs Arm C: Overall Survival (OS), From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 6 years)|Arm B vs Arm C: OS, From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 6 years)
Arm B vs Arm C: Investigator-Assessed PFS, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|Arm A vs Arm B: Investigator-Assessed PFS, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|Arm A vs Arm B: OS, From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 6 years)|Independent Review Facility (IRF)-Assessed PFS, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|Investigator-Assessed Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), From randomization up to approximately 6 years|IRF-Assessed Confirmed ORR, From randomization up to approximately 6 years|Investigator-Assessed Duration of Objective Response (DOR), From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|IRF-Assessed DOR, From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 6 years)|Percentage of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Changes in Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, Clinically meaningful changes in physical functioning, role functioning, global health status (GHS)/QoL as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported measure, consisting of 30 questions that assess 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), GHS and QoL, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) within the previous week. Functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much. GHS and QoL items are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7=Excellent. Scores will be linearly transformed to a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores (i.e. closer to 100) reflecting better functioning, better GHS/QoL, and worse symptoms., Up to approximately 6 years|Percentage of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Changes in Dysphagia as Measured by EORTC QLQ-OES18, Clinically meaningful changes in dysphagia as measured by the EORTC Quality of Life-Esophageal Cancer, Module 18 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-OES18). EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a modular supplement to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire for use in participants with esophageal cancer. EORTC QLQ-OES18 consists of 4 multiple-item scale (dysphagia, eating, reflux, and pain) and 6 single items (trouble swallowing saliva, choked when swallowing, dry mouth, trouble with taste, trouble with coughing, and trouble talking) with a recall period of the previous week. Each symptom item is scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much. Scores will be linearly transformed to a range of 0 to 100, with higher transformed scores (i.e. closer to 100) reflecting worse symptoms., Up to approximately 6 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Up to approximately 6 years|Serum Concentration of Tiragolumab, Predose and postdose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (each cycle=21 days) and predose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at treatment discontinuation (TD) visit (up to approximately 6 years)|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, Predose and postdose on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (each cycle=21 days) and predose on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at TD visit (up to approximately 6 years)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Tiragolumab, Predose on Day 1 of Cycles (each cycle=21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at TD visit (up to approximately 6 years)|Percentage of Participants With ADAs to Atezolizumab, Predose on Day 1 of Cycles (each cycle=21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at TD visit (up to approximately 6 years)
