Study of Momelotinib in Combination With Luspatercept in Participants With Transfusion Dependent Myelofibrosis
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of momelotinib (MMB) in combination with luspatercept (LUSPA) in participants with transfusion dependence (TD) primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or Post-polycythemia vera (PV)/ essential thrombocythemia (ET) myelofibrosis (MF) who are either janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (JAKi) naïve or experienced.
