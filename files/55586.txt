A Multi-center Retrospective Study With Secondary Use of Data of Tafinlar (Dabrafenib) Plus Mekinist (Trametinib) in Chinese Patients With BRAF V600 Mutation Positive Melanoma
This was a multi-center, observational, retrospective cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in Chinese patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma, for mucosal melanoma patients (Cohort A) and non-mucosal melanoma patients (Cohort B, cutaneous and acral melanoma), separately. Study population was identified as patients initiating dabrafenib plus trametinib from 01 May 2020 to 31 July 2022 who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The follow-up period ended at the earliest of the following: end of study observation period (i.e., 31 December 2022), death, upon withdrawal of consent or the last available record.
