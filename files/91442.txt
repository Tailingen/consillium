Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Meningioma
RATIONALE: Current therapies for adults with meningioma provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of adults with meningioma.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on adults with meningioma.
Meningioma
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response rate per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all disease sustained for at least four weeks; Partial Response (PR), \>=50% decrease in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, sustained for at least four weeks; Stable Disease (SD), \<50% decrease and \<25% increase in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, sustained for at least eight weeks; Progressive Disease (PD), \>=25% increase in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions., 12 months
Percentage of Participants Who Survived, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months overall survival, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with meningima as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response) or stable disease.
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in adults with meningima.

OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which adults with meningioma receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months, patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease may continue treatment.

To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study
