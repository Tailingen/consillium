Role of MRI in Breast Cancer Subtypes
efficacy of MRI in detection of breast cancer molecular subtypes instead of biopsy and immunohistochemistry
MRI in Breast Cancer
accuracy of MRI in breast cancer subtyping, To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of dynamic post contrast imaging MRI in evaluation of breast cancer molecular subtypes and DWI and ADC in detection of breast cancer molecular subtypes, 5 years
2.4.4 -Study tools (in detail, e.g., lab methods, instruments, steps, chemicals, ...): Patient with breast cancer (malignant breast mass) will do MRI breast and molecular subtypes will be assessed

MRI imaging studies will performed on a 1.5 T scanner , The patient is placed in the prone position with both breasts placed adequately in a double breast coil (four-channel phased array coil), MRI sequences are:

1. Axial T1WI. 2. Axial T2WI. 3. Axial STIR. 4. DCE-MRI with post-processing subtraction images 5- Axial DWI at b value( 0, 400, 800 and 1000 mm\^2 per second) and ADC map will performed 6. MRI spectroscopy MRI acquisition protocol MRI protocols includes

* Axial T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence: TR=3840 ms, TE=81 ms, slice thickness=3.5 mm, and matrix=448×448.
* Coronal T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence: TR=3840 ms, TE=81 ms, slice thickness=3.5 mm, and matrix=448×448.s
* Short tau inversion recovery - axial: TR=8540 ms, TE=59 ms, TI=170 ms, slice thickness=3.5 mm, and matrix=320×314.4.
* The standard dynamic protocol commenced with a coronal three-dimensional rapid Field echo (thrive) sense non-enhanced T1-weighted sequence.
* A gadolinium containing contrast was administered at a dose of 0.2 ml/ kg by power injection at a speed of 2.0 ml/s and flushed with 20 ml of saline solution at the same rate.
* Dynamic imaging was then done in five consecutive series at 90-s intervals. Standard subtraction images were obtained by subtracting precontract images from the early peak postcontrast image.
