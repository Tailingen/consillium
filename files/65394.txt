Efficacy and Safety of Deferasirox in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Transfusion-dependent Iron Overload
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of iron chelation using deferasirox in low and INT-1 risk (referring to the international prognostic scoring system, IPSS) MDS patients who show signs of iron overload due to repeated blood transfusions.

This trial is not recruiting patients in the United States.
