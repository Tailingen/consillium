Volumetric Analysis of Bone Following Jaw Cysts Enucleation With and Without Alb-PRF
Cyst is the main cause for longstanding swelling in the mandible or the maxilla, its enlargement usually results in resorption and weakening of bone. Thus the treatment of the cysts is essential to preserve the bone and the adjacent vital structures. Healing of the bone defect and its surrounding soft tissues is a critical issue that needs concerns. Although the Platelet rich fibrin has promising effects in wound healing, it can resorb during 10-14 days. Thus a new autologous platelet concentrate is introduced by Kawasi et al that can remain stable for 4-6 months called albumin PRF.
