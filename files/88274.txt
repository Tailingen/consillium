A Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Safety, and PK of XEMBIFY®+Standard Medical Treatment (SMT) Compared to Placebo+SMT to Prevent Infections in Participants With HGG and Recurrent or Severe Infections Associated With B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma, and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether biweekly administered XEMBIFY® plus Standard Medical Treatment (SMT) over a one-year period will reduce the rate of major bacterial infections per participant per year in B-cell CLL, MM, and NHL participants with hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) in comparison to the Placebo plus SMT group.
