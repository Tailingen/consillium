A Study of Unesbulin in Participants With Advanced Leiomyosarcoma (LMS)
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of unesbulin plus dacarbazine versus placebo plus dacarbazine in participants with unresectable or metastatic, relapsed or refractory LMS who have received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy.
