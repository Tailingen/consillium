A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of AZD1390 Given With Radiation Therapy in Patients With Brain Cancer
This study will test an investigational drug called AZD1390 in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. This is the first time AZD1390 is being given to patients. This study will test safety, tolerability and PK (how the drug is absorbed, distributed and eliminated) of ascending doses of AZD1390 in combination with distinct regimens of radiation therapy
Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme|Primary Glioblastoma Multiforme|Brain Neoplasms, Malignant|Leptomeningeal Disease (LMD)
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: AZD1390
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be used to calculate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD of AZD1390 is the maximum dose at which \<=25% patients experience a DLT., From the start of treatment until the end of the DLT period (approximately 6 weeks for Arm A, 3 weeks for Arm B and 10 weeks for Arm C)|Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), For each adverse event CTCAE grade and causality (related to AZD1390 or radiotherapy) will be collected., From the start of treatment until the patient is off study (approximately 1 year for all Arms)
Event free survival (EFS) for Arms A and C only, Defined as the time from the first dose of AZD1390 until the occurrence of any of the following events:

1. Tumor progression or recurrence based on RANO criteria
2. Secondary malignancy
3. Change in tumor treatment due to increase clinical symptoms
4. Death due to any cause, From the start of treatment until the patient is off study (approximately 1 year)|Objective response rate defined by RANO criteria for Arms A and C only, The proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial tumor response (CR or PR) according to RANO criteria., Every 8 weeks starting from 4 weeks after RT until the end of the study (approximately 1 year)|Objective response rate defined by RANO-BM criteria for Arm B only. **Arm B has now closed to recruitment**, The proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial tumor response (CR or PR) according to RANO-BM criteria., From screening until the patient is off study, approximately 8 weeks|Objective response rate defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria for Arm B only. **Arm B has now closed to recruitment**, The proportion of patients achieving a complete or partial tumor response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., From screening until the patient is off study, approximately 8 weeks|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of AZD1390, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD1390 at a series of timepoints to derive Cmax, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD1390 treatment period (approximately 5 weeks for Arm A, 2 weeks for Arm B and 9 weeks for Arm C)|Time to observed Cmax (Tmax) for AZD1390, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD1390 at a series of timepoints to derive Tmax, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD1390 treatment period (approximately 5 weeks for Arm A, 2 weeks for Arm B and 9 weeks for Arm C)|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for AZD1390, Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD1390 at a series of timepoints to derive AUC, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD1390 treatment period (approximately 5 weeks for Arm A, 2 weeks for Arm B and 9 weeks for Arm C)|Renal clearance (CLR) for AZD1390, Urine samples will be collected to assess urine concentrations of AZD1390 at a series of timepoints to derive renal clearance, At predefined intervals throughout the AZD1390 treatment period (approximately 5 weeks for Arm A and 9 weeks for Arm C)|Overall survival for Arms A and C only, Defined as the time from the first dose of AZD1390 until death from any cause, From start of treatment until the patient dies, withdraws or the end of study is reached (approximately 15 months after last patient has started treatment)|Assessment of the food effect of AZD1390 at the MTD for Arm A (if conducted), Blood samples will be collected to assess plasma concentrations of AZD1390 at a series of timepoints to derive Tmax, At two predefined intervals throughout cycle 0 (approximately 7 to 9 days)
This first time-in patients (FTIP), open-label, multicentre study of AZD1390 will be conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. It consists of three treatment arms: Arm A, B, C. The Japan dose confirmation part (Japan part) is a sub-study of Arm A. Sites from Japan will only participate in the Japan part. This Phase 1 study will assess safety and tolerability of AZD1390 in combination with radiation therapy (RT) in brain malignancies. The combination cohorts have been designed to assess escalating cumulative doses of AZD1390 in settings with 3 different radiation treatment regimens:

* Arm A and Japan Part: 35 Gy over 2 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
* Arms B: 30 Gy over two weeks with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/ partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) in patients with brain metastases. \*\*Arm B has now closed to recruitment\*\*
* Arm C: 60 Gy over 6 weeks (IMRT) in patients with primary GBM Each arm provides standard of care RT for the disease setting indicated with the experimental agent being administered in dose escalating cohorts.
