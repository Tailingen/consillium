Exploring the Difference Between Gastric Cardia Cancer and Non-cardia Gastric Cancer Based on Multiomics
This is an observational study with a case control design. This study included patients with gastric cancer confirmed by pathological diagnosis of gastric tissue, and matched the control population according to age, gender, etc. In this study, researchers collected clinical information and multiple biological samples such as saliva, serum, and feces from the study subjects. We combined 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics to explore the differences in microbial and metabolic characteristics between gastric cardia cancer and non-cardia gastric cancer for early screening of gastric cancer.

OTHER: Detection of biological samples based on multi-omics analysis
Early gastric cancer detection rate, This study combines 16SrRNA sequencing and metabolomics to explore the differences in microbiota and metabolites between tumor cohorts and healthy controls, and to assist in screening for early gastric cancer., 36 months
