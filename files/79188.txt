Targeted Natural Killer (NK) Cell Based Adoptive Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Radiochemotherapy (RCT)
Targeted Natural Killer (NK) cell based adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after radiochemotherapy (RCT)
NSCLC Stage IIIA/B
OTHER: Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2 activated, autologous NK cells
Progress free survival, follow up after randomization for at least 18 months
overall survival (OS), follow up after randomization for at least 18 months|toxicity (AE and SAE), follow up after randomization for at least 18 months|quality of life (QoLQ-30, LC-13), follow up after randomization for at least 18 months|biological parameters (NK cell activation), follow up after randomization for at least 18 months
Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in stage III A and III B showing at least stable disease after RCTx will be enrolled into the clinical trial. The aim of the study is to show the efficacy of an adjuvant treatment with Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2 activated, autologous NK cells following completion of standard radiochemotherapy (Cisplatin/Vinorelbine). Patients will be randomized 1:1 either to the interventional study group to receive 4 cycles of autologous immunotherapy with activated NK cells or to the control group (BSC).
