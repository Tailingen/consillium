The Efficacy of Induction and Adjuvant Camrelizumab Combined With Chemoradiation for LA-HNSCC
This is a phase 2, single-arm clinical trial, with the purpose to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of PD-1 Blockade camrelizumab combined with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as adjuvant monotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

All participants from 3 hospitals will receive induction camrelizumab therapy at least one cycle (every 3 weeks) followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. After 4\~6 weeks of the completion of radiotherapy, adjuvant camrelizumab therapy will begin every 3 weeks for 16 cycles (1 year) or continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
