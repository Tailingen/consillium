Anti-CD19-CAR-T Cells in Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Tumor Patients.
This study is a single-center, open-label, single-dose clinical trial of anti-CD19-CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed/refractory B-cell tumor patients after Qinglin pre-treatment.

In this study phase, a traditional "3+3" trial design is employed for dose escalation.
B Cell Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19-CAR-T cells
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity, The proportion of patients receiving CAR-T cells who encounter dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Safety evaluations are performed in accordance with the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 standards (Cytokine Release Syndrome and neurotoxicity will be graded based on ASTCT/ASBMT grading criteria)., Up to 28 days from CAR-T infusion
The study plans to include CD19-positive relapsed/refractory B-cell tumor patients. After the screening period, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection, and lymphocyte depletion pre-treatment period, subjects will receive a single infusion of anti-CD19-CAR-T cells. In addition to the baseline period, efficacy assessments will be conducted monthly for ALL subjects and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 post-treatment for NHL subjects, until disease progression (PD), relapse, change of treatment regimen, death, intolerable toxicity, at the discretion of the investigator, or voluntary withdrawal by the patient (whichever occurs first).

Toxicity will be evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). Safety of anti-CD19-CAR-T cell therapy will be evaluated through laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, physical examinations, etc. Blood samples will be collected from subjects to assess cellular pharmacokinetics and explore the effects of cellular drugs on ferritin, C-reactive protein, and related cytokines.
