Dose Escalation of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Cancer
Patients with metastatic cancer are generally treated with chemotherapy, which has improved median survival compared to best supportive care. Despite this, patients continue to have persistent disease at sites that were initially involved with cancer. Radiation therapy is an effective modality for treating localized cancer but generally has been only used for palliation of symptoms once a patient develops metastatic disease. Since patients often have persistent disease after chemotherapy, the goal of this trial is to use increasing doses of radiation therapy to all sites of involved disease in order to determine the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy.

The purpose of this study is to establish a maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and recommended phase 2 dose of hypofractionated radiation therapy.
