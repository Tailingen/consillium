Armodafinil in Treating Fatigue Caused By Radiation Therapy in Patients With Primary Brain Tumors
RATIONALE: Armodafinil may help relieve fatigue and improve quality of life in patients with cancer receiving radiation therapy to the brain.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well armodafinil works in treating fatigue caused by radiation therapy in patients with primary brain tumors.
Brain Tumors|Nervous System Tumors|Cognition Disorders|Fatigue
DRUG: Armodafinil|OTHER: placebo
Retention, Retention is defined as the percentage of participants who complete the 4 week post-RT questionnaires., 4 weeks post-RT (approximately 3 months post randomization)|Adherence, Adherence is the percentage of ideal number of pills taken while on study (based on returned diaries), 4 weeks post-RT (approximately 3 months post randomization)
Fatigue, Fatigue is measured by the fatigue subscale of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Questionnaire. It consists of 13 questions each answered on a 0 to 4 scale. The fatigue score is the sum of the responses with some questions reverse scored. The total Score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue., 4 weeks post-RT|Sleepiness, Sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleep Scale. It consists of 8 questions that measure daytime sleepiness in which the patient records their likelihood of dozing or sleeping during a number of routine daily activities. ESS scores range from 0 to 24. Higher scores denote greater sleepiness., 4 weeks post-RT|HVLT-IR, HVLT-IR is the Hopkins Verbal learning test - immediate recall. Participants are given 12 words to remember. They are then asked to recall those words. This is repeated 3 times. Minimum recalled words 0 maximum 36. The HVLT-IR score is the sum of correctly recalled words across the three trials. Higher scores indicate better recall., 4 weeks post-RT
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To estimate study accrual, adherence, retention, and participation of patients with primary brain tumors undergoing partial- or whole-brain radiotherapy who are randomized to receive armodafinil or placebo.
* To estimate the variability of fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive function in these patients.

Secondary

* To obtain a preliminary estimate of the effect of armodafinil on fatigue as measured by the fatigue subscale of the FACIT-F and the Brief Fatigue Inventory.
* To estimate the rates of toxicity and adverse events associated with armodafinil.
* To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of armodafinil on sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleep Scale; overall quality of life and brain-specific quality of life as measured by the FACT-G with the brain subscale; and cognitive function as measured by a comprehensive Wake Forest Cognitive Function Battery.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to therapy (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs 90-100%). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral armodafinil once daily beginning no later than the fifth fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily beginning no later than the fifth fraction of brain radiotherapy and continuing for 9-11 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients complete questionnaires assessing fatigue, quality of life, and neurocognitive function at baseline and periodically during study.
