Ruxolitinib and Chidamide for Acute T Cell Lymphoblast Leukemia/ Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Ruxolitinib and Chidamide intensified conditioning regimen in patients with Acute T cell Lymphoblast leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma Underwenting Haploidenticl Peripheral blood Stem Cell Transplantation.
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation

Haploidenticl Peripheral blood Stem Cell Transplantation should be offered to eligible patients with Acute T cell Lymphoblast leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma whenever feasible. To further improve the outcome of transplantation patients with Acute T cell Lymphoblast leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma, we developed a modified Bu/Cy conditioning regimen intensified by Ruxolitinib and Chidamide. In this study, we tested the efficacy and feasibility of the modified Bu/Cy conditioning regimen intensified by Ruxolitinib and Chidamide in patients with Acute T cell Lymphoblast leukemia/ lymphoblastic lymphoma undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
