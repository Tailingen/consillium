Exploratory Lapatinib (Positron Emission Tomography) PET Study in Subjects With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out how much lapatinib can enter both normal brains and brains in which tumours secondary to breast cancer have developed.

Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug taken by mouth which inhibits the HER2 protein, overexpressed in some breast tumours. It is not known whether lapatinib passes through the blood-brain barrier, and, therefore, whether it can target secondary tumours in the brain. This study will investigate whether lapatinib does indeed enter the brain.

Subjects with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, with and without brain metastases, will receive lapatinib tablets daily for 8 days. The subjects will also receive lapatinib with a small amount of radioactivity attached on the first and last days of dosing to investigate whether it is taken up by the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
