Enoxaparin Versus Aspirin in Patients With Cancer and Stroke
Patients with cancer who develop stroke are at high risk for future strokes or other clotting events. These patients are routinely treated with medicines that thin their blood, including enoxaparin or aspirin. However, it is unclear which medicine is best and whether these medicines can be adequately studied in a clinical trial.

The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to determine if a clinical trial of different blood thinners in patients with cancer and stroke is possible. In addition, the study aims to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of enoxaparin with those of aspirin on patients with cancer and recent stroke.
Cancer Patients First-ever Acute Ischemic Stroke
DRUG: Enoxaparin|DRUG: Aspirin
Safety Outcomes, Number of Participants with intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and death, 1 year|Feasibility Outcomes, The primary feasibility outcome is patient enrollment defined as the number of patients who enroll in the study divided by the number of patients who were eligible to enroll., 6 months
Number of Participants With or Without Recurrent Ischemic Stroke, Secondary efficacy outcomes will be assessed for and will include recurrent ischemic stroke, all strokes (ischemic or hemorrhagic), transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and systemic arterial thrombosis. Functional outcomes will also be evaluated, including the modified Rankin Scale score, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale., 6 months
