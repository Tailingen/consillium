AMG510 (sotorasib) Plus Lenvatinib As Second-line Treatment in Patients with KRASG12C Mutant, Metastatic NSCLC
AMBER is a multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. The protocol treatment consists of of sotorasib plus lenvatinib, as a second-line treatment. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sotorasib plus lenvatinib, in terms of objective response rate, for patients with KRASG12C-mutant, metastatic NSCLC.
Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|KRAS G12C
DRUG: Sotorasib|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the rate of patients, among all enrolled patients, achieving a best overall response \[complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)\] according to RECIST v1.1, investigator assessed, by 18 weeks post-enrolment., From date of enrolment until 18 weeks post-enrolment.
Progression-free survival per RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until the date of documented progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, if progression is not documented. Censoring (for patients without progression or death) will occur at the date of last tumour assessment. Patients without a post-baseline tumour assessment will be censored at the date of enrolment plus 1 day., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 22 months after the enrolment of the first patient)|Disease control rate per RECIST v1.1, DCR is defined as the rate of patients, among all enrolled patients, that achieve CR or PR or disease stabilisation (according to RECIST v1.1, investigator assessed) at 18 weeks., From date of enrolment until 18 weeks post-enrolment.|Overall survival, OS is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until the date of death from any cause. Censoring (for patients who are not reported as dead) will occur at the date last known to be alive. Data for patients who do not have post-baseline information will be censored at the date of enrolment plus 1 day., From the date of enrolment until death from any cause (up to 22 months after the enrolment of the first patient)|Duration of response, DoR is defined as the interval from the date of first documentation of objective response (CR or PR, according to RECIST v1.1) to the date of first documented progression/relapse or death from any cause., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment or death from any cause (approximately 22 months after the enrolment of the first patient)|Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0, All safety parameters will be summarised in tables in order to evaluate the toxicity and safety profile of the protocol treatment based on:

* Adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE v5.0 (any-cause as well as treatment-related) including AEs leading to dose delays and/or interruptions, withdrawal of protocol treatment, and death
* Severe, serious, and selected AEs
* Deaths
* Clinically significant laboratory parameters and abnormalities, and vital signs., [Time Frame: From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 22 months after enrolment of the first patient)]
