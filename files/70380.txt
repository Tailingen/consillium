Phase I Clinical Study of HWH340 Tablet in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion, phase I clinical trial study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of HWH340. In addition, the pharmacokinetic characteristics will also be investigated. Three parts are included in this study.
Advanced Solid Tumors|HRD|BRCA Mutation
DRUG: HWH340 tablet

Part one is a single-dose study on tolerance and pharmacokinetics, in which 21-42 patients with advanced solid tumors would be enrolled. Patients will receive escalating dose groups of HWH340 tablet.

Part two is a multiple-dose study on tolerance and pharmacokinetics. Based on the safety assessment, three or four groups would be chosen to conduct the study. 9-24 patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled.

Part three is a dose expansion stage on safety and efficacy. Two to four dose-groups would be chosen to conduct the study. 40-60 patients with advanced solid tumors with BRCA mutation OR homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) will be enrolled.
