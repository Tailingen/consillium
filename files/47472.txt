Combined PD1 Inhibitor and Decitabine in Elderly Patients With Relapse and Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of PD1 inhibitor Camrelizumab(SHR-1210) combined with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine in elderly patients with relapse and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
