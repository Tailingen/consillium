Study of Cryoablation and Nirogacestat for Desmoid Tumor
The primary purpose of this protocol is Systemic therapy with oral study agent, nirogacestat, followed by a single cryoablation procedure.
Desmoid Tumor
DRUG: Nirogacestat|PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Clinical Benefit per RECIST v1.1, Clinical benefit (CB) is defined as the number of participants assessed with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) within 1 year and with no evidence of loss of response nor progression within that year. Response \& progression will be assessed according to the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, as follows:

RECIST v1.1:

* CR=Disappearance of all lesions
* PR=≥30% decrease in diameter of target lesions
* Progressive disease (PD)=20% increase in diameter of target lesion; progression of non-target lesion; or ≥1 new lesion(s)

For the overall outcome:

* SD=Changes not meeting above criteria
* Overall Response (OR)=CR+PR
* CB=CR+PR+SD, 1 year
Clinical Benefit per mRECIST, Clinical benefit (CB) is defined as the number of participants assessed with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) within

1 year and with no evidence of loss of response nor progression within that year.

Response \& progression will be assessed according to the modified Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), as follows.

CR=Disappearance of intratumoral enhancement

* PR=≥ 30% decrease in the diameter of target lesion(s)
* PD=An increase of \>20% in the diameter of target lesion. The outcome is the number of participants alive after 1 year and without PD per mRECIST, a number without dispersion, 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progressive-free survival (PFS) is an assessment of the number of participants at a specific time who remain alive and without tumor progression. Progressive disease (PD) will be assessed according to Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, or, for tumors assessed with MRI enhancement, modified RECIST (mRECIST) defined as follows:

RECIST v1.1:

* PD=20% increase in diameter of target lesion; progression of non-target lesion; or ≥1 new lesion(s) mRECIST:
* PD=An increase of \>20% in the diameter of target lesion. The outcome is the number of participants alive after 1 year and without PD per RECIST or mRECIST, a number without dispersion., 1 year|Objective Response, Objective response (OR) is defined as the number of participants assessed with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) within 1 year and with no evidence of loss of response nor progression within that year. Response \& progression will be assessed according to the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, or, for assessed with MRI enhancement, modified RECIST (mRECIST)., 1 year|Time-to-Response (TTR), Time-to-response (TTR) is an assessment of the length of time from the start of treatment until clinical response (complete response, CR; or partial response, PR) is documented.in accordance with the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, or, for assessed with MRI enhancement, modified RECIST (mRECIST) defined as follows:'

RECIST v1.1:

* CR=Disappearance of all lesions
* PR=≥30% decrease in diameter of target lesions Progressive disease (PD)=20% increase in diameter of target lesion; progression of non-target lesion; or ≥1 new lesion(s) mRECIST:
* CR=Disappearance of intratumoral enhancement
* PR=≥ 30% decrease in the diameter of target lesion(s) PD=An increase of \>20% in the diameter of target lesion.

For either:

• SD=Changes not meeting above criteria The outcome is expressed as the median TTR (by RECIST or mRECIST), with standard deviation., 1 year|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of documented disease response (complete response, CR; or partial response, PR) to the date of the first documented disease progression. CR and PR will be assessed according to the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, or, for assessed with MRI enhancement, modified RECIST (mRECIST) as RECIST v1.1., 1 year|Related Adverse Events (AEs), Safety is assessed as the number of adverse events determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to nirogacestat treatment (ie, drug toxicities). All related events will be collected and reported. Adverse events of Grade 3 (severe) are considered notable and potentially actionable during treatment, while adverse events Grade 1 or 2 are considered routine, with typically little or no change in treatment needed. The outcome will be reported as the number of related adverse events Grade 3 or higher is a number without dispersion., 1 year
The primary purpose of this protocol is treatment. Systemic therapy with oral study agent, nirogacestat, will be given for 3 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) followed by a single cryoablation procedure between Cycles 3 and 4, and then continued nirogacestat for Cycles 4 through 26. Treatment with nirogacestat may continue via this study for up to 24 months (26 cycles of treatment), unless there is progression of disease, intolerance, subject withdraws their consent, start of a new anticancer therapy, or until Subject Study Completion or Termination occurs.
