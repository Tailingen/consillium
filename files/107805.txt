Study in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer Whose Cancer Has Gotten Worse After Anthracycline and Taxane Therapy
This international study will study how metastatic breast cancer responds to the investigational drug treatment, what are the side effects of the investigational drug when given to women with metastatic breast cancer and how often do these side effects occur. The study will also analyze how fast investigational drug and its breakdown products are cleared from the blood in these patients.
