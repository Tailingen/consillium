Optimised CD33 (FL-33) CAR T Therapy for Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
This study is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm phaseⅠclinical trial to explore the safety and efficacy of FL-33 CAR T therapy for refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia. The primary endpoints are incidence and type of dose limiting toxicity within 21 days of CAR T infusion; total number, incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) 30 days after CAR T infusion. The secondary endpoints are total number, incidence and severity of AEs 30 days to 2 years after CAR T infusion; objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR) and complete response with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) by dose group at 15, 30 and 90 Days after CAR T Infusion; duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS); pharmacokinetic characteristics. The trial will use BOIN12 design to explore the optimal biological dose (OBD) of FL-33 CAR T cells for refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia. FL-33 CAR T is set at two dose levels: 5\*10\^5 (±20%) CAR-T cells/kg for dose 1 (DL-1) and 1\*10\^6 (±20%) CAR-T cells/kg for dose 2 (DL-2), and after the optimal biological dose (OBD) is determined in the dose exploration phase, the dose expansion phase will expand the trial by 6-12 cases at the OBD, enrolling up to 21-27 cases. Enrolment of more than 21 cases can be reported for analysis and the trial will be stopped when enrolment reaches 27 cases.
