Number of Participants With Objective Response Rate Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review, Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate based on BICR by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Overall Survival, From the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 5 years
Number of Participants With Objective Response Rate Assessed by Investigator, Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the sum of the complete response (CR) rate and partial response (PR) rate based on investigator by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free Survival As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator, PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression as per BICR and investigator assessment or death due to any cause., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death. The DoR will be calculated for responding participants (PR or CR) only., From the date of first documentation of confirmed response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 5 years|Disease Control Rate As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD (or non-CR/non-PD) by BICR and investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1., Baseline up until documented progressive disease, death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal by the participant, up to approximately 5 years|Time to Response As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review and Investigator, TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed by BICR and investigator assessment .Time to response (TTR) will be calculated for confirmed responders only., From the start date of study drug to the date of the first documentation of response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed, up to approximately 5 years|Change from Baseline in The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30, This 30-item questionnaire assesses global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL), subject functioning, and general cancer symptoms and has a recall period of one week. All scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 metric, where a higher score on GHS/QoL and functioning scales indicates a better outcome and a higher score for the symptom scales indicates worse outcomes., Baseline up to 5 years|Change from Baseline in The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 29 (EORTC QLQ-LC29), The LC29 is a self-reported 29-item questionnaire that measures SCLC-related symptoms and the side effects of treatments and has a recall period of one week. All scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome., Baseline up to 5 years|Overall Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following I-DXd Monotherapy, TEAEs are assessed based on NCI CTCAE v5.0., Baseline up to 5 years|The Number of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive At Any Time and Who Have A Treatment-emergent Anti-Drug Antibody, The ADA prevalence, which is the percentage of participants who are ADA positive at any time point (baseline or post-baseline), as well as the ADA incidence, which is the proportion of participants having treatment-emergent ADA during the study period, will only be reported in participants receiving I-DXd., Baseline up to 5 years|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum Concentration for I-DXd, Total Anti-B7-H3 Antibody, and MAAA-1181a, Maximum concentration (Cmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods in participants randomized to the I-DXd group., Cycle 1 before infusion (BI), end of infusion EOI), and 3, 6, 24, 72, 168, 336, and 504 hours (hrs) post dose; Cycle 2 BI and EOI; Cycle 3 BI, EOI, and 6 hrs postdose; Cycles 4, 5, and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 5 years BI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Concentration for I-DXd, Total Anti-B7-H3 Antibody, and MAAA-1181a, Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods in participants randomized to the I-DXd group., Cycle 1 before infusion (BI), end of infusion EOI), and 3, 6, 24, 72, 168, 336, and 504 hours (hrs) post dose; Cycle 2 BI and EOI; Cycle 3 BI, EOI, and 6 hrs postdose; Cycles 4, 5, and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 5 years BI (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve for I-DXd, Total Anti-B7-H3 Antibody, and MAAA-1181a, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable time point (AUClast) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve dosing interval (AUCtau) will be assessed using non-compartmental methods in participants randomized to the I-DXd group., Cycle 1 before infusion (BI), end of infusion EOI), and 3, 6, 24, 72, 168, 336, and 504 hours (hrs) post dose; Cycle 2 BI and EOI; Cycle 3 BI, EOI, and 6 hrs postdose; Cycles 4, 5, and every 2 cycles thereafter up to 5 years BI (each cycle is 21 days)
The primary objective of this study is to assess whether treatment with I-DXd improves objective response rate (ORR) and prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with treatment of physician's choice among participants with relapsed SCLC.

The secondary objectives of the study are to further evaluate the efficacy/safety of I-DXd, health economics and outcome research measures (including patient reported outcomes), immunogenicity of I-DXd, B7-H3 protein expression, and characterize the pharmacokinetics of I-DXd.
