Sensitivity of PDL-1-analysis From Pleural Effusion in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a prospective diagnostic pilot study to create hypotheses regarding immunocytochemistry (ICC) PD-L1 analysis of pleural effusions in NSCLC patients as compared to the reference standard of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). This comparison will be done to assess sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 detection by ICC in pleural effusions.

PD-L1 Prevalence IHC, Number/prevalence of PD-L1-positive patients according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) of pleural biopsy., At baseline|PD-L1 Prevalence ICC, Number/prevalence of PD-L1-positive patients according to immunocytochemistry (ICC) of pleural aspirate, At baseline|PD-L1 Detection in Pleural Effusion Based on All Cases With Successful PD-L1 Analysis, Based on all cases where PD-L1 analysis was indicated and sucessful (i.e. giving definite results), the immunocytochemistry analysis of PE was compared with the immunohistochemistry analysis of pleural tissue.Two different alternatives were calculated:

* PD-L1 expression with a TPS ≥50% was defined as PD-L1-positive.
* PD-L1 expression with a TPS ≥1% was defined as PD-L1-positive., At baseline
PD-L1 Detection in Pleural Effusion Based on All Cases With Indication for PD-L1 Analysis, Based on all cases where PD-L1 analysis was indicated, the immunocytochemistry analysis of PE was compared with the immunohistochemistry analysis of pleural tissue.Two different alternatives were calculated:

* PD-L1 expression with a TPS ≥50% was defined as PD-L1-positive.
* PD-L1 expression with a TPS ≥1% was defined as PD-L1-positive. In both instances, cases where PD-L1 analysis could not be performed were defined as negative., At baseline|Tumor Cell Detection in Pleural Effusion, Comparing the immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis of pleural effusion concerning the detection of malignant tumor cells as compared to the immunohistochemistry analysis of pleural tissue. Seven cases of ICC analysis with inconclusive results were defined as negative., At baseline
