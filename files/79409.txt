Temsirolimus With or Without Cetuximab in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer Who Did Not Respond to Previous Therapy
This phase II trial studies how well giving temsirolimus together with cetuximab works compared to temsirolimus alone in treating patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer who did not respond to previous therapy. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving temsirolimus together with cetuximab is more effective than giving temsirolimus alone.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression determined using RECIST criteria: \>=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from nadir, occurrence of new lesions, or progression of non-target lesions., From start of treatment to time of progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), Time from randomization until death from any cause, Up to 5 years|Overall Response Rates (OR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Statistics reported are for Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 5 years|PFS vs. Historical Control Cohort, PFS at 4 months in Arm A and Arm B will each be compared with a 4-month historical control rate of 21.4%. The historical data appears in two publications, an ASCO abstract: Abidoye, ASCO Annual Meeting 2006: 5568 and de Souza, Davis, et al, Clin Cancer Res 2012; 18(8):2336-2343., From start of treatment to time of progression or death of any cause, assessed at 4 months|Grade 3 or Higher Hematological Toxicity, Incidence of hematological toxicities at least possibly related to study drug, graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4, Up to 5 years|Percentage of Responses After Crossover From Control Arm to the Combination Arm, Assessed According to RECIST, Percentage of responses (if any) after crossover from the control arm to the combination arm will be evaluated qualitatively. This is includes complete and partial responses, and is different from Outcome Measure 8 below, which includes complete and partial responses as well as stable disease., Up to 5 years|PFS of Myofibroblast (+) Cohort, From start of treatment to time of progression or death of any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Percentage of Responses/Disease Stabilization for Patients Crossing Over to the Combination Therapy After Progressing on Arm B., Assessed according to RECIST.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) of cetuximab/temsirolimus combination cohort (Arm A) compared to temsirolimus alone (Arm B).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Progression-free survival (PFS) of cetuximab/temsirolimus combination group (Arm A) and temsirolimus control group (Arm B) compared to a historic control cohort.

II. Subgroup analysis of myofibroblast (+) cohort (PFS). III. Overall survival (OS). IV. Toxicities. V. Response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\])/absolute tumor shrinkage (waterfall plot analysis).

VI. Activity of combination therapy (temsirolimus/cetuximab) after failure (progressive disease \[PD\]) of temsirolimus monotherapy.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM A: Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive temsirolimus as in Arm A. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with progressive disease may cross over to Arm A.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for a minimum of 8 weeks and then once a year for 5 years.
