Influences of Sugammadex on Postoperative Progress in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Undergoing Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Thymectomy: Retrospective Study
"Several case reports have described the use of rocuronium and sugammadex in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). However, reports regarding the effects of sugammadex compared with that of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) on perioperative outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)-thymectomy in patients with MG are still lacking. Thus, the investigators will investigate the effects of sugammadex compared to AChEIs on the postoperative recovery in patients with MG who underwent VATS-thymectomy.

This retrospective study include patients with MG, aged\> 18 years who received sugammadex or pyridostigmine-glycopyrrolate or neostigmine-glycopyrrolate after VATS-thymectomy between November 2007 and December 2020. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) adjustment will be performed to balance the baseline characteristics between the two groups. The primary outcome is the length of postoperative hospital stay, and the secondary outcomes are the incidence of postoperative mortality and postoperative complications, as well as postoperative extubation and reintubation rates in the operating room after VATS-thymectomy; the outcomes are compared between the two groups.
