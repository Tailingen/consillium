Temozolomide in Treating Young Patients With Refractory or Recurrent Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temozolomide in treating young patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: temozolomide
Maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose|Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE 3.0|Pharmacokinetics as assessed by CI, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life (T Â½)
Antitumor activity|Biologic activity and mechanisms of resistance
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of temozolomide in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia.
* Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the biologic activity and mechanism(s) of resistance to this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
