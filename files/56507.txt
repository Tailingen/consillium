Omission of Surgery in Clinically Low-risk HER2positive Breast Cancer With High HER2 Addiction and a Complete Response Following Standard Anti-HER2-based Neoadjuvant Therapy
This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, unicenter, exploratory study in women with primary operable HER2-positive, HER2-enriched/ERBB2-high breast cancer according to PAM50 intrinsic subtype and a ERBB2 pre-defined cutoff (high vs low ERBB2 expression), to evaluate the omission of surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with HER2-E and ERBB2 high breast cancer who achieving a complete response following standard anti-HER2-based neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab. The primary trial objective is to estimate the loco-regional invasive disease-free survival at 3-year of patients who achieve a complete response based on imaging (i.e. Magnetic resonance imaging) and a stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and omit loco-regional surgery.

BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab and pertuzumab Subcutaneous Fixed-Dose Combination
To evaluate the possibility of omission of surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection in clinically low-risk HER2-positive breast cancer with high HER2 addiction and a complete response following standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and dual HER2 blockade., To estimate the loco-regional invasive disease-free survival (LR-IDFS) at 3-year of patients who achieve a complete response based on imaging and a stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and omit loco-regional surgery., 3 years
