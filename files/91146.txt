QLQ-C30 contains 30 questions that include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive functioning); three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); six single-item symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties); and global health status/quality of life (QoL). Most questions used a 4-point scale (from 1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (from 1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. For the functional scales and the global health status/QoL, a higher score represents a better level of functioning (better health status); for the symptom scales/items, a higher score represents a higher level of symptomatology/problems (worse health status)., Baseline up to Day 1387|Phase 3 Open Label: Change From Baseline in Quality-of-life Questionnaire 30 Item (QLQ-C30), The QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of patients with cancer.

In the Phase 2 portion of the study, 57 patients were randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo at a 1:1 allocation ratio.

In the Phase 3 portion of the study, approximately 285 patients will be randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo with a 2:1 allocation ratio.

Patients who progress during the blinded portion of the study will be unblinded and if receiving:

* placebo, may cross over to open-label selinexor (60mg twice-weekly)
* selinexor, will be withdrawn from further treatment and followed for survival

Study treatment will be given twice-weekly on Day 1 and Day 3 during Weeks 1-6 of each six-week (42 day) cycle until disease progression or intolerability.

Treatment will continue until one or more of the following occurs:

* Disease progression, as defined by RECIST v1.1 Response Criteria
* Clinical progression, as determined by the treating physician
* Unacceptable adverse events (AEs) or failure to tolerate study treatment
* Patient withdrawal
* Patient discontinuation due to non-compliance
