Monitoring and Treatment of Relapsed Leukemia Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children
This study aims to monitor patients for relapse of the leukemia following allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in order to identify patients early in relapse, with a low burden of disease, when interventions may be more successful by monitoring of peripheral blood lineage specific chimerism. Once disease has been confirmed, patients will initiate a novel combination of bortezomib and pravastatin.
Leukemia
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Pravastatin
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Tolerability of bortezomib and pravastatin in pediatric relapsed leukemia patients following allogeneic transplantation, 3 years
Number of relapses that are detected by CD34+ chimerism before clinical symptoms, The sensitivity of detection of recurrent acute leukemia in pediatric patients by peripheral blood CD34+ chimerism in pediatric patients following allogeneic HSCT, 3 years
The number of patients who respond to bortezomib and pravastatin treatment for relapsed acute leukemia as defined by those that achieve complete response, partial response or stable disease, 3 years
Patients will be enrolled on this study at the time of transplantation. Following HSCT, CD34+ chimerism in peripheral blood will be monitored in real time at scheduled intervals. If chimerism of CD34+ cells diminishes post-HSCT or clinical signs or symptoms of relapsed leukemia, relapse in bone marrow will be confirmed, after which immunosuppression will be withdrawn and treatment initiated with bortezomib and pravastatin. Patients will be monitored for disease response until 1 year post-HSCT or post-study therapy. Patients with confirmed relapse post-HSCT will also be eligible to enroll and receive novel combination.
