A Study of HS269 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, first in human study of HS269 tablet, a small molecule highly-selective RET Inhibitor. The dose-escalation study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of HS269 and determine the dose and schedule to be used in Phase II. Seventeen to thirty-six patients with advanced solid tumor may be enrolled in this study.
