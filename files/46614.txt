Safety Study of SGN-CD70A in Cancer Patients
This study will examine the safety profile of SGN-CD70A. The study will test increasing doses of SGN-CD70A given every 3 weeks (or an alternate dosing schedule up to every 6 weeks) to small groups of patients. The goal is to find the highest dose of SGN-CD70A that can be given to patients without causing unacceptable side effects. The pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of SGN-CD70A will also be evaluated.
