Pancreatic Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine
Document progression free survival after treatment with ARQ 501 and gemcitabine
Document safety and efficacy of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine
This is a single-arm, non-randomized study of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine in adult patients with treatment-naïve, unresectable, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study objectives are:

Primary Objective:

* Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine.

Secondary Objectives:

* Determine time to tumor progression (TTP) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine
* Further characterize the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine
