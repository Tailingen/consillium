NADIM II: Neo-Adjuvant Immunotherapy
This is an open-label, randomised, two-arm, phase II, multi-centre clinical trial.

90 patients will be enrolled in this trial to examine the pathological Complete Response defined as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes comparing patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Nivolumab
Evaluation of the pathological complete response (pCR), The pathological complete response is defined as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes in patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy versus patients treated with chemotherapy alone., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 45 months.
This is an open-label, randomised, two-arm, phase II, multi-centre clinical trial.

Patients randomised to the experimental arm will receive Nivolumab 360mg + Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3 cycles every 21 days as neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery and 6 months of adjuvant treatment with Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive Paclitaxel 200mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3 cycles every 21 days followed by surgery.

The primary objective is pathological Complete Response (pCR) defined as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes comparing patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemotherapy alone.

Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 3 years excluding a run-in-period of 3 months. Treatment and follow-up are expected to extend the study duration to a total of 8.5 years. Patients will be followed 5 years after adjuvant treatment or surgery. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.
