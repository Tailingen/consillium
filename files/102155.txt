Clinical Study of CAR-T Cell Therapy Following ASCT for R/R B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation for relapsed/refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R B-NHL), with a complete response (CR) rate of about 50%. It is also considered to be a reasonable consolidation option in low or unmeasurable disease states recently. Unfortunately, 40%-70% of patients experienced relapse after CAR-T cell therapy in the long-term follow up. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with myeloablative chemotherapy can enhance the efficiency of CAR-T cells and alleviate tumor load, leading to a lower relapse rate. As a result, CAR-T cell therapy following ASCT may be a promising method for R/R LBCL patients.
