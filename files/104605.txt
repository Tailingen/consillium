Gemcitabine Plus Albumin-bound Paclitaxel In Patients With Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of Gemcitabine plus Albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABI-007) in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Albumin-bound paclitaxel
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities, A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one or more of the following toxicities related to study drug during Cycle 1, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3:

* Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>3 days in the absence of growth factor support;
* Grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever \>38.5Â°C;
* Any other Grade 4 hematological toxicity;
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage;
* Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despite prophylaxis or treatment with an optimal anti-emetic or anti-diarrhea regimen;
* Any other Grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity attributable to the study drug, excluding alopecia and fatigue., Cycle 1 (Days 1-28)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence, not necessarily having a causal relationship with the patient's treatment, that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose.

A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) include those assessed by the Investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment.

Severity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE based on the following: Grade 1- Mild; Grade 2 -Moderate; Grade 3 - Severe; Grade 4 - Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5 - Death related to AE., Up to 25 months|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Overall Response, Overall Response is defined as the percent of participants who achieve an objective confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR). Response was determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, assessed by an Independent Radiological Reviewer.

CR: The disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease-related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. All sites must be assessed, including non-measurable sites, such as effusions, or markers.

PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation and no new non-target lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. PR is also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (i.e., ascites) is still present but not progressing., Up to approximately 4 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease Control, Disease control is defined as participants with Stable Disease for at least 16 weeks, or confirmed complete or partial overall response, based on RECIST guidelines and assessed by an Independent Radiological Reviewer.

Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, and no new non-target lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Progressive Disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion., Up to approximately 4 years|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the start of disease progression or patient death, whichever occurs first, assessed by an Independent Radiological Reviewer. Participants who do not have disease progression or have not died were censored at the last known time that the participant was progression free. Progression-free survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Progressive Disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion., Up to approximately 4 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response was assessed by progression-free survival for participants who achieved a confirmed Complete Response or Partial Response, assessed by an Independent Radiological Reviewer., Up to approximately 4 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of patient death from all causes. Participants who did not die were censored at the last known time the patient was alive. Patient survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods., Up to approximately 4 years|Maximal Degree of Myelosuppression, The maximal degree of myelosuppression was assessed by the overall nadir of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), white blood cell count and platelet count based on clinical laboratory measurements., During the treatment phase, up to a maximum of 24 months.|Maximal Degree of Anemia, The maximal degree of anemia (and myelosuppression) was assessed by the overall (any time after first dose of study drug) nadir of hemoglobin levels based on clinical laboratory measurements., During the treatment phase, up to a maximum of 24 months.
Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a novel, solvent-free, albumin-bound, 130 nanometer particle form of paclitaxel designed to avoid the problems associated with solvents used in Taxol(Abraxane prescribing information 2005). Albumin has a number of properties that make it an attractive molecule to combine with paclitaxel. Albumin is a natural transporter of endogenous hydrophobic molecules such as water-insoluble vitamins and hormones (Vorum 1999)and albumin binding to the gp-60 receptor (albondin) initiates the caveolae-mediated endothelial transport of protein-bound and unbound plasma constituents (John et al 2003, Minshall et al 2003, Tiruppathi et al 1997).

This study consisted of a Phase 1 dose escalation phase, a Phase 2 treatment phase and a 24-month follow-up phase.
