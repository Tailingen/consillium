68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for the Diagnosis of Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer
This phase I trial studies the side effects of 68GA-PSMA-11 PET imaging in patients with prostate cancer that has come back (recurrent). Gallium (68Ga) is a radiotracer that binds to a molecule, PSMA, that is found in abundance on most prostate cancer cells. PSMA is short for 'prostate specific membrane antigen'. Diagnostic procedures, such as 68GA-PSMA-11 PET imaging, may help measure a patient's response to earlier treatment, and may help plan the best treatment for prostate cancer.
Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma
DRUG: Gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography
Incidence of adverse events, Will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To provide clinical access to and assess the safety of the investigational agent Gallium Ga 68-labeled prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET) at City of Hope National Medical Center for patients co-enrolled on Institutional Review Board (IRB) 18517 treatment trial.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) over less than 1 minute, and then undergo PET over 60 minutes.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1-3 days, and then at 3 weeks.
