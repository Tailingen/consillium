Prostate Health Index for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis
Prostate biopsies are the gold standard for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. They are performed according to the results of the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the serum of patients with PCa suspicion. More than half of the prostate biopsies reveal eventually negative because of the poor specificity of prostate-specific antigen assay. The Prostate Health Index (PHI) is a new diagnostic tool that has been described as a good predictor of prostate biopsy outcome. No large study has been performed so far in France. This study aim to evaluate Prostate Health Index diagnostic performances in a large multicentric French cohort of patients undergoing prostate biopsies because of clinical and/or biological suspicion of prostate cancer.

Prostate Health Index will be measured in patients directed to prostate biopsies according to usual practices. Inclusion of 400 patients within 6 months in 12 French centers is expected. The ability of Prostate Health Index to predict prostate cancer at biopsy will be evaluated in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic diagnostic performances including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, diagnostic accuracy, area under receiver operating curves and decision curve analyses.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Measurement of Prostate Health Index (PHI)
Intrinsic performances of Prostate Health Index in predicting prostate biopsy outcome, Area under receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis; the ROC curve will be constructed from the values of the sensitivity and specificity of Prostate Health Index by comparison to the gold standard, i.e. prostate biopsy outcome (cancer or not)., When the results of all prostate biopsies will be available (approximately at 7 months after the beginning of the study)
