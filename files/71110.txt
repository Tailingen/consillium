Study Of Weight-Based Versus Standard Dose Enoxaparin Thromboprophylaxis In High-Risk Hospitalized Cancer Patients
Hospitalized patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor malignancy, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma and who are at high risk for a venous thromboembolism will be randomized to standard dose versus intermediate dose enoxaparin.
Venous Thormboembolism
DRUG: Enoxaparin
Total Number of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in Standard Dose Enoxaparin Arm at 17 Days, To investigate the numbers of VTE in hospitalized cancer patients receiving standard dose, 17 days only measured in Arm A (Standard dose enoxaparin)|Number Participants With Major Hemorrhage, Number of major hemorrhage in weight-adjusted enoxaparin arm and standard-dose enoxaparin arm, 14 days
Number of Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE), Comparing number of symptomatic VTE (data collected prior to unblinding) for the standard dose (Arm A) versus intermediate dose enoxaparin (Arm B)., 14 days
In a phase II trial, high risk hospitalized cancer patients will be enrolled and randomized to standard dose enoxaparin versus intermediate dose (weight adjusted) enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis. Study subjects will be administered enoxaparin during hospitalization in a double-blinded manner. Following completion of 14 days, the study arms will be unblinded and lower extremity ultrasound performed on the standard dose enoxaparin arm in order to more accurately determine the overall cumulative incidence of thrombosis in this group.
