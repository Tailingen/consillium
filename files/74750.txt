Bone Marrow and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer
RATIONALE: Bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer.

BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cyclosporine|DRUG: methylprednisolone|DRUG: prednisone|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the toxicity of unmanipulated bone marrow augmented with CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cells in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic transplantation.
* Evaluate this treatment regimen in terms of kinetics of hematopoietic engraftment, infection, severity of graft-vs-host disease, relapse rate, and cost effectiveness in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo allogeneic transplantation comprising unmanipulated bone marrow with filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized, CD34+ enriched peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV over 24 hours on day -1 and methylprednisolone IV or oral prednisone daily on days 7-65. Patients also receive G-CSF subcutaneously daily until blood counts recover.

Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months and 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
