Assessment of Complete Pathologic Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
This is a feasibility study to gain preliminary information regarding whether breast imaging with or without a core needle biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) but before surgery can accurately predict complete pathologic response (pCR) in women with triple negative or HER2- positive breast cancer. pCR is defined as having no residual invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

Complete Pathologic Response (pCR), The primary aim of this feasibility study is to determine whether breast imaging with or without core needle biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can accurately predict complete pathologic response (pCR) in women with biopsyproven triple negative or HER2+ breast cancer., 6 Months Post Surgery
Complications and Side Effects of the Needle Biopsy Procedure after NAC, Incidence of Adverse Events, 6 Months Post Surgery
