Shanghai Ovarian Cancer and Family Care Project
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy, but its incidence in the general population is low. Due to the lack of effective prevention and successful screening approaches, most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, leading to poor prognosis. In order to address the research requirements pertaining to ovarian cancer, the Shanghai Ovarian Cancer and Family Care Project was established. This initiative offers hospital-based resources for investigating ovarian cancer and high-risk populations. The project comprises an on-going ovarian cancer cohort, a high-risk population cohort, and a healthy population cohort. By leveraging these comprehensive cohorts, the project provides a unique platform for in-depth studies on the detection, prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ovarian cancer.
