Oncolytic Adenovirus(H101) Combined With PD-1 Inhibitors in Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Oncolytic Adenovirus(H101) combined with PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma who have previously been resistant to advanced PD-1 inhibitors.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, Advanced
DRUG: Oncolytic Adenovirus H101|DRUG: Programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor
ORR(Objective Response Rate), The proportion of CR(complete response) and PR(partial response) in all patients., 36 months|DCR(Disease Control Rate), The proportion of CR(complete response), PR(partial response) and SD(stable disease) in all patients., 36 months
PFS(Progression Free Survival), Refers to the time from the first treatment day to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), and the end point event is determined by the investigator according to RECIST version1.1., 36 months|OS(Overall Survival), Time between the date of grouping and death from any cause or the end of the last follow-up visit., 36 months|AEs(Adverse Events), Toxicity were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. All serious and non-serious adverse events that occur after enrollment through 30 (+7) days after the last administration of H101 will be recorded., 36 months
By monitoring the clinical symptoms of patients with advanced immune resistant pleural mesothelioma treated with adenovirus injection combined with programmed death receptor (PD-1) inhibitors, we analyze and explore the effectiveness and safety of using oncolytic virus drugs. Exploring the influencing factors of using oncolytic adenovirus injection combined with PD-1 inhibitors to reverse immune resistance in MPM patients. Evaluate the safety of the drug, and finally evaluate the quality of life of patients using oncolytic adenovirus injection(H101) combined with PD-1 inhibitors.
