A Monoclonal Antibody, Nimotuzumab, as Treatment for Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
The following is an open label, non comparative, pilot study of palliative treatment as a second, third line or more of treatment in patients with recurrent, persistent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer; it has a limited sample of 15 patients with the primary goal of evaluating the response (defined as: Complete, partial or stable disease) to treatment with a Monoclonal Antibody, Nimotuzumab, on a weekly basis + CDDP 50mg/m2/BSA as a single agent every 3 weeks for patients with good renal function (Creatinine clearance =\> 60) or Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2/BSA in patients with renal failure (Creatinine clearance \<60).

Secondary objectives consist of evaluating disease-free survival, overall survival and assess patient tolerance to treatment with Nimotuzumab.
Uterine Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|PROCEDURE: CT Scan
Antitumoral Response, Treatment response will be evaluated according to the new International Criteria from Response Evaluation Committee in Solid Tumors (RESIST). Antitumoral response will be evaluated from patient´s inclusion after 4 weeks of induction therapy and then every 3 months until second year of follow up for each patient., After 4 weeks of induction therapy, and then every 3 months for a period of 2 years
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival will be defined as the time elapsed since the beginning of interventions until progressive disease is documented by growth of measurable lesions or new lesions on CT Scan or MRI according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (JNCI 92 (3): 205-216, 2000)., After patient´s inclusion every 3 months for a period 2 years|Overall Survival, Patient´s survival since inclusion until death, from patient´s inclusion until 24 months|Drug Toxicity, Drug toxicity will be assessed with hematologic, renal and hepatic laboratory measures as well as patient symptomatology and physical findings. Any abnormality in these parameters will be reported as an adverse event according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0(CTCAEV3.0, 2006), from patient´s inclusion every 2 weeks for a period of 2 years
