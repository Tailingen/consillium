Adjunctive GNX Treatment Compared With Placebo in Children and Adults With TSC-related Epilepsy
This is a Phase 3, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of adjunctive GNX treatment in children and adults with TSC-related epilepsy. The study consists of a 4-week prospective Baseline phase, defined as the first 28 days following screening, followed by a double-blind phase consisting of a 4-week titration period (Day 1 to Day 28) and a 12-week maintenance period (Day 29 to Week 16).
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
DRUG: Ganaxalone|DRUG: Placebo
Double-blind phase: Percent change from Baseline in 28-day seizure frequency during titration and maintenance period, Seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures divided by the number of days with seizure data, multiplied by 28., Baseline (Day 1) through Week 16
Double-blind phase: Percent change from Baseline in 28-day seizure frequency during maintenance period, Baseline (Day 1) and Day 29 to Week 16|Double-blind phase: Number of participants who will be considered as treatment responders during titration and maintenance phase, Treatment responders are defined as those participants with ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in seizure frequency, Up to 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Number of participants who will be considered as treatment responders during maintenance phase, Day 29 to Week 16|Double-blind phase: Number of Participants with Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) during titration and maintenance phase, The CGI-I is a 7-point Likert scale that the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legally authorized representative (LAR)(s) and clinician uses to rate the change in overall seizure control, behavior, safety, and tolerability after initiation of the Investigational product (IP) relative to Baseline (prior to treatment with the IP). It was rated as: 1- "very much improved", 2- "much improved', 3- "minimally improved", 4- "no change", 5- "minimally worse", 6- "much worse", and 7- "very much worse". Higher scores indicated worse condition., Up to 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS) during titration and maintenance phase, The ADAMS is a rating scale designed to screen for anxiety and depression in individuals with intellectual disability. The 28-question scale is filled out by the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) and is based on the participant's behavior. Each question will be rated on 4-point Likert scale as follows: 0- "behavior has not occurred or is not a problem"; 1- "behavior occurs occasionally or is a mild problem"; 2- "behavior occurs quite often or is a moderate problem"; and 3- "behavior occurs a lot or is a severe problem". Higher scores indicated worse condition., Baseline (Day 1) through Week 16|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) during titration and maintenance phase, The SF-36 is a multi-purpose survey designed to capture participant or parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) perceptions of own health and well-being. The SF-36 has 36 items grouped in 8 dimensions: physical functioning, physical and emotional limitations, social functioning, bodily pain, general, and mental health, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Higher scores represent better health-related quality-of-life., Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Family Impact Module (Peds-QL-FIM) during titration and maintenance phase, Peds-QL-FIM is designed to measure the impact of pediatric chronic health conditions on parents and the family. It composes of 6 scales measuring parent self-reported functioning: 1) Physical functioning (6 items), 2) Emotional functioning (5 items), 3) Social functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive functioning (5 items), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5 items), and in addition two scales measuring parent-reported family functioning: 7) Daily activities (3 items) and 8) Family relationships (5 items). Each of the items have five Likert response options: 0 = never a problem, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4= almost always. Items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0); higher scores indicate better functioning (less negative impact)., Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life (ELDQOL) Scale during titration and maintenance phase, The ELDQOL is a parent/caregiver/LAR-reported measure that examines seizure severity, seizure related injury, anti-seizure medication (ASM) side effects, behavior, mood, physical status, cognitive and social functioning, communication, overall health and quality of life, and family concerns. There are a total of 70 items, some of which are responded as 1=yes/2=no, some of which range 1-4 and others 1-5. For those items, higher is more severe. For mood-related items, however, the scoring is always/often/sometimes/never which are coded as 1-4 but may be good or bad, depending on the mood. Finally: there are qualitative questions with open-ended answers related to "were any questions difficult to answer" and "are there any other comments you would like to make". Each of the 70 items is characterized as its own measurement, and they are not aggregated or tabulated into an overall score., Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in the percentage of seizure-free day during titration and maintenance phase, Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in Caregiver Global Impression of Change in Seizure Intensity/Duration (CGI-CSID) during titration and maintenance phase, The CGI-CSID is a 7-point Likert scale in which the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/LAR(s) assesses change in seizure intensity and/or duration after initiation of investigational product relative to Baseline (prior to treatment with investigational product). The scale ranges from 1- very much improved, 2- much improved, 3- minimally improved, 4- no change, 5- minimally worse, 6- much worse, and 7- very much worse. Higher scores indicate worse condition, Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Number of participants with a ≥ 25% and ≥ 75% reduction from Baseline during titration and maintenance phase, Up to 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Number of participants with a ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75% reduction from Baseline during maintenance phase, Day 29 to Week 16|Double-blind phase: Number of participants with Responder Analysis using ≤ 0%, > 0% to < 25%, ≥ 25% to < 50%, ≥ 50% to < 75%, and ≥ 75% to 100% during titration and maintenance phase, Up to 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Percent change in 28-day frequency of all seizures during titration and maintenance phase, Up to 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in percentage of Seizure-Free Days during titration and maintenance phase, Baseline (Day 1) and through 16 weeks|Double-blind phase: Change from Baseline in longest Seizure-Free Interval during titration and maintenance phase, Baseline (Day 1) through 16 weeks
