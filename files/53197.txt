confirm the recommended phase two dose (RP2D, DLTs will be assess within the first 6 weeks of the treatment combination . DLT definitions are described in section 15.4, and will be defined using NCI CTCAE v 5.0. If ≤ 1 patient out of 6 has a dose-limiting toxicity, the dosing used in the safety lead-in phase will be declared the recommended phase 2 dose. If ≥ 2 of 6 patients in the safety lead-in experience a DLT, study treatment will be halted and no further patients will be enrolled. If the study is resumed with an alternative dosing schema, a new safety lead-in phase will be completed with the new dosing regimen, within 6 weeks of treatment|best overall response rate (Phase II), defined by RECIST 1.1, by 48 weeks
Safety, Safety will be assessed using CTCAE v 5.0 to define that adverse event profile of the treatment combination and safety events will be tabulated., 2 years|overall response rate, as defined by irRECIST, 48 weeks
