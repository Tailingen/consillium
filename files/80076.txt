Open-label Study of Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Auriхim
This is an open-label study of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Auriхim multiple doses in patients with recurrent/ refractory В-cell, CD20-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma of low tumor grade or with follicular lymphoma, as well as in patients non-treated before for В-cell, CD20-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma of low tumor grade.

The study will be carried out in 4-6 Russian and Belarussian sites. The study will be consisted of screening period, induction (obligatory) phase and supporting (non-obligatory) phase of the investigational therapy and post-treatment follow-up period.
