Phase 2 Study of SBRT Plus Tislelizumab and Regorafenib in Unresectable or Oligometastatic HCC
The goal of this phase 2 prospective clinical trial is to learn about the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plus immunotherapy and targeted therapy in patients with unresectable or oligometastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The main question to answer is: Whether combing SBRT with immunotherapy and targeted therapy could prolong PFS. Participants will receive SBRT to all visible lesions and concurrent systemic immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
