A Study of Creatine Combined With Curcumin in the Intervention of Early Cachexia in Upper Gastrointestinal Tumors
Cachexia is a common complication of various advanced malignant tumors, which seriously affects the quality of life and survival time of patients. In view of the clinical problem of non-nutritional response in patients with cachexia, the investigators plan to carry out a clinical case-control study on the intervention of creatine combined with curcumin in participants with cachexia. On the whole, the investigators limited the study subjects to upper digestive tract tumors and diagnosed participants with early cachexia. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of the two can play a positive and stable role in inhibiting the inflammation of cachexia and improving metabolic status, so that basic nutrition can play a role, in order to reduce the level of skeletal muscle consumption, maintain weight, improve quality of life, save medical costs and extend survival time.

This is a prospective open controlled study. The intervention is targeted at participants with early cachexia in upper gastrointestinal tumors.Both control group and intervention group receive basic nutritional support. On the basis of this, the intervention group will be given creatine and curcumin orally.The purpose is to investigate whether creatine combined with curcumin can improve the inflammatory and the nutritional state, correct the disorder of nutrient metabolism and improve the prognosis of participants.
