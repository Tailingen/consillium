A Small-molecule Carbonic Anhydrase IX Targeting PET Tracer in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to see the potential application of a CAIX targeted PET. tracer in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* The biodistribution of the PET tracer
* Whether RCC lesions can be identified by the PET tracer Participants will undergo 68Ga-NY104 PET/CT scan and images will be reviewed by nuclear medicine specialists.
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-NY104
Biodistribution of 68Ga-NY104 in normal organs, Uptake measured by SUVmax and SUVmean in normal organs using a region-of-interest technique, From study completion to 2 hour after completion|Tumor uptake of 68Ga-NY104, Uptake measured by SUVmax and SUVmean in suspected tumor lesions, From study completion to 2 hour after completion
PET/CT imaging of three patients using 68Ga-NY104 for medical reasons will be performed. Patients received an intravenous injection of 68Ga-NY104. Images will be obtained at 0.5 h, 1 h, and 2 h after injection. A comparative 18F-FDG PET/CT scan will also be performed if necessary. The study will be carried out on a time-of-flight PET/CT scanner. SUVmax and SUVmean of normal organs and lesions, as well as tumor-to-background ratios, will be quantitatively assessed using a region-of-interest technique.
