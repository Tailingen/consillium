Safety and Efficacy of BL-8040 for the Mobilization of Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Allogeneic Transplantation in Patients With Advanced Hematological Malignancies
Current protocols use G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling and volunteer unrelated donors. Unfortunately, this process requires four to six days of G-CSF injection and can be associated with side effects, most notably bone pain and rarely splenic rupture. BL-8040 is given as a single SC injection, and collection of cells occurs on the same day as BL-8040 administration. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel agent for hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation based on the following hypotheses:

* Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one injection of BL-8040 will mobilize sufficient CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight) following no more than two leukapheresis collections to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.
* The hematopoietic cells mobilized by SC BL-8040 will be functional and will result in prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD prophylaxis.
* If these hypotheses 1 and 2 are confirmed after an interim safety analysis of the data, then the study will continue and include recruitment of haploidentical donors.
