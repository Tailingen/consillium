Sorafenib, Cisplatin, and Etoposide in Treating Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with cisplatin and etoposide works in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: sorafenib tosylate
Progression-free Survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever comes first., 1-year
Median Overall Survival, Overall survival is measured from the date of chemotherapy treatment (date of cycle 1 of induction chemotherapy) until death and censored at the date of last follow-up for survivors., 1-year|Response Rate, The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were used to assess response to the treatment.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started, reevaluated for response every 8 weeks|Safety, Number of patients that experienced grade 3-4-5 treatment related toxicities. Toxicity was graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0., Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treated with sorafenib tosylate in combination with cisplatin and etoposide.
* To evaluate the 1-year overall survival and response rate in these patients.
* To evaluate the safety of these drugs in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily beginning on day 1 of course 1 and continuing for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
