Randomized Phase III Adjuvant Study for Stage III Colorectal Cancer
A randomized controlled study is conducted on patients with histological stage III colorectal cancer assigned to postoperative adjuvant therapy of uracil-tegafur plus leucovorin (UFT+LV), UFT+LV / UFT, or UFT+LV+PSK / UFT+PSK. The usefulness of the three regimens was evaluated by comparing the disease-free survival rate, overall survival rate, incidence and severity of adverse event, and quality of life.

A multicenter randomized open-label controlled study is conducted on patients with histological stage III and curability A or B colorectal cancer \[according to General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and Anus, 6th edition (Japanese Classification of Colorectal Cancer, English edition), also according to pTNM classification to facilitate overseas publication\] given postoperative oral therapy of tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin (UFT+LV) (5 courses), UFT+LV (5 courses) / UFT (1 year), or UFT+LV+PSK (5 courses) / UFT+PSK (1 year). The usefulness of the three regimens as postoperative adjuvant therapy was evaluated by comparing the disease-free survival rate (DFR), overall survival rate (OS), incidence and severity of adverse event, and quality of life (QOL).
