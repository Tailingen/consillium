A Study of 2nd-line FOLFIRI ± Bevacizumab vs. Irinotecan ± Bevacizumab in mCRC
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the non-inferiority of overall survival FOLFIRI with or without Bevacizumab compared with Irinotecan (CPT-11) with or without Bevacizumab as Second-line therapy in Patient with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

Overall survival, Time from the date of enrollment to death from any cause, Assessed until 1.5 years after the last patient enrolment
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of enrollment to the earlier of the date of confirmed progression or death from any cause., Assessed until 1.5 years after the last patient enrolment|Time to treatment failure (TTF), Time from the date of enrollment to the earlier of the date of confirmed progression, death from any cause, or discontinuation of protocol treatment., Assessed until 1.5 years after the last patient enrolment|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of eligible patients with measurable lesions with a best overall response of CR or PR assessed by the attending physician., Assessed at 6, 12 week and thereafter every 8 weeks, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of best overall response of CR, PR, or SD assessed by the attending physician., Assessed at 6, 12 week and thereafter every 8 weeks, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 weeks|Incidence of Adverse Events (Adverse Reactions), The incidence of worst-grade adverse events (toxicities) on study as graded by NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 will be determined by treatment arm in all treated patients for the following events., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 weeks
Primary endpoint: Overall survival (OS), Secondary endpoints: Progression-free survival (PFS), Time to treatment failure (TTF), Overall response rate (ORR),Disease Control Rate (DCR), Safety.
