Study of Isatuximab Combined With Bortezomib + Cyclophosphamide + Dexamethasone (VCD) and Bortezomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (VRD) in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) Non Eligible for Transplant or No Intent for Immediate Transplantation
Primary Objectives:

* VCDI cohort:

  * To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of SAR650984 isatuximab when administered in combination with bortezomib (VelcadeÂ®) , cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCDI) based on the dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLTs) observed in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma non-eligible for transplantation
  * To evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy (overall response rate and complete response rate) of isatuximab administered at the selected dose in combination with bortezomib based regimin VCDI according to IMWG criteria.
* VRDI Part A cohort and Part B cohort:

  * To evaluate the preliminary efficacy (complete response \[CR\] rate) of isatuximab administered at the selected dose in combination with bortezomib based regimen: VRDI, (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) according to IMWG criteria in adult patients with newly diagnosed MM non eligible for transplantation or no intent for immediate transplantation.

Secondary Objectives:

* VCDI cohort:

  * To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR650984 in combination with VCD regimen, including cumulative toxicities.
  * To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR650984/isatuximab and each combination drug in VCDI regimen.
  * To evaluate the immunogenicity of SAR650984 in combination treatments.
  * To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of VCDI regimen in terms of duration of response and progression-free survival.
  * To assess the relationship between clinical effects (adverse event \[AE\] and/or tumor response) and CD38 receptor density.
* VRDI Part A cohort and Part B cohort:

  * To characterize the overall safety profile of isatuximab in combination with VRD regimen.
  * To evaluate the infusion duration (only applicable for VRDI Part B cohort)
  * To characterize the PK profile of isatuximab and each combination drug in VRDI regimen.
  * To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab in combination treatments.
  * To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of VRDI regimen in terms of ORR, DOR, and PFS.
  * To evaluate the impact of M protein measurement without isatuximab interference (via the SEBIA HYDRASHIFT 2/4 isatuximab IFE test) on CR and BOR assessment.
  * To assess the relationship between clinical effects (AE and/or tumor response) and CD38 receptor density (only applicable for VRDI Part A cohort).
  * To assess MRD negativity rate in patients achieving a CR or VGPR and explore correlation with clinical outcome.

The duration of the study for an individual patient will include:

* A period to assess eligibility (screening or baseline period) of up to 3 weeks for VCDI cohort, up to 28 days for VRDI cohort;
* for patients in the VCDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 12 induction treatment cycles (50-week duration).
* for patients in the VRDI cohort: a treatment period including up to 4 induction cycles (24 week duration).
* Following induction, both cohorts have maintenance periods consisting of 4 week cycles until progression, unacceptable AE, or patient willingness to discontinue and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of treatment.
* Patients that discontinue therapy for reasons other than progression will have follow-up visits until progression or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
