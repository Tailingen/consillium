Role of Dutasteride in Patients Undergoing 3D Mapping Biopsy in Early Stage Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of short-term intake of daily Dutasteride in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Dutasteride|OTHER: Placebo
To Determine the Effect of Short-term Intake of Daily Dutasteride Prostate Cancer Volume, Distribution Within the Gland and Gleason Score Sum in Patients in Comparison to Placebo After Adjusting for Changes in Prostate Gland Volume., The effect of Dutasteride intake on the following parameters as detected by mapping biopsy vs. initial trans-rectal biopsy in the treatment arm and the control group: change in prostate gland volume, change in distribution within the gland, and change in Gleason score sum., 24 Months
This is a study of men who have undergone a standard 10 or more core biopsy for detection of prostate cancer and determined to have prostate cancer by having a Gleason score ≤ 7 (low to moderate risk 2-7). Of these men, one arm of a two arm randomized group will be administered a treatment regime of Dutasteride versus the control group who receive standard of care, prior to mapping biopsy. This proposal aims at studying the apparent effect of the use of Dutasteride (3 months) on initial tumor volume (at diagnosis) in men with low volume cancer before undergoing 3D mapping biopsy.
