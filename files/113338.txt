Randomized Study of the Effect of Decreased Hyperinsulinemia on the Ovulatory Response to Clomiphene Citrate in Obese Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine whether reduction of serum insulin levels by metformin increases ovulatory response to clomiphene or spontaneous ovulation in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Hyperinsulinism|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: clomiphene citrate|DRUG: metformin
PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
