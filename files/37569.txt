Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 177Lu-Dotatate in the First-line Treatment of Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic, Somatostatin Receptor-positive G2 or G3 Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
his was a single-center, single-arm phase II study evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lutetium\[177Lu\] Oxodotreotide Injection in the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, G2 or G3, somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 in all participants, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. For this analysis, ORR will be assessed in all participants, Up to 2 years
Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who experienced ≥1 AE will be presented., Until 30 days after the last treatment|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 in all participants, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the first documented disease, Up to 2 years|Disease control rate(DCR), Up to 2 years
After the screening period, participants who signed the ICF and were eligible for the study in accordance with the entry criteria were assigned to treatment with Lutetium\[177Lu\] Oxodotreotide Injection. Objective tumor assessment in both groups was performed every 12+/-1 weeks from the first treatment date according to RECIST 1.1 Criteria until progression.
