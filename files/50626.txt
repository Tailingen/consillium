Study BT8009-230 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer (Duravelo-2)
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label study, with an adaptive design. The main objective of the study is to measure the efficacy and safety of BT8009 (zelenectide pevedotin) as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC). The study includes a dose selection phase followed by an adaptive design continuation. The study is comprised of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will include participants who have not received any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic UC and are eligible to receive platinum-based chemotherapy, whereas Cohort 2 will include participants who have received ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic UC.
