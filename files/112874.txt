A Study of KX2-391 With Paclitaxel in Patients With Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of KX2-391 in Combination with paclitaxel in Phase I, and to evaluate the efficacy of KX2-391 in combination with paclitaxel in patients who are diagnosed as gastric and breast cancer, respectively in Phase II.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific|Gastric Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: KX2-391 and Paclitaxel
Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Phase I Portion, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of KX2-391 in combination with weekly paclitaxel as determined by number of participants With DLTs related to KX2-391 in combination with weekly paclitaxel, From start of the treatment to end of cycle 1, which are 4 weeks|Tumor Overall Response Rates (ORRs) in Phase II Portion, The efficacy (overall response rate; ORR; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) of KX2-391 in combination with weekly paclitaxel at the MTD established during the phase I portion of this trial based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) 1.1, In every 2 cycles up to end of the treatment, an expected average of 16 weeks
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluation in Phase I Portion, PK parameters, including but not limited to, plasma concentration, AUC (Area Under Curve) 0-t, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2 of KX2-391 alone and in combination with weekly paclitaxel, Time points at day 0, 1 and 8 in cycle 1|The Preliminary Efficacy Data in Phase I Portion, The preliminary efficacy of KX2-391 in combination with weekly paclitaxel as determined by ORRs based on RECIST 1.1, In every 2 cycles up to end of the treatment, an expected average of 8 weeks|Safety in Phase II Portion, Adverse events and their frequency, duration and severity, physical examination, laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG change monitoring as determined based on CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) 4.03, From start of the treatment to end of the treatment, an expected average of 16 weeks|The Efficacy Data in Phase II Portion, Overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP) and duration of response, Up to die, an expected average of 24 weeks|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluation in Phase II Portion, PK parameters, including but not limited to, plasma concentration, AUC0-t, Cmax, Tmax, and T1/2 of KX2-391 alone and in combination with weekly paclitaxel, Time points at day 1 and 8 in cycle 1
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Evaluation in Phase I Portion, Pre-dose and post-dose tubulin inhibition in peripheral blood monocytes extracted from blood samples, as measured by immunofluorescence staining, Time points at day 0 and 1 in cycle 1|Exploratory Biomarker Evaluation in Phase II Portion, Pre-dose and post-dose Src signaling inhibition (p-Src and Ki-67) in archival tumor tissue and new biopsy sample, as measured by immunohistochemistry, Time points at day -6 and day 0
