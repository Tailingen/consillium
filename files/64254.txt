Phase I Study of Hemay102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial was a single-center, open-label, dose-increasing Phase I clinical study with subjects enrolled in patients with advanced solid tumors who failed standard treatment or who were unable to receive effective treatment. The trial is divided into two stages: dose escalation and dose extension.
Patients With Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
DRUG: Hemay102
Number of participants with adverse events, Number of participants with adverse events, from baseline until 4 weeks after the study day
Objective response rate, Objective response rate (complete response rate + partial response rate) according to RECIST v1.1, At screening, every 6 weeks of treatment up to 18 months|Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate defined as percentage of patients with stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 6 months/partial response (PR)/complete response (CR). according to RECIST v1.1, At screening, every 6 weeks of treatment up to 18 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival defined as the proportion of patients alive and without progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria), 18 months after treatment initiation|AUC, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve of Hemay102, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dose
Dose escalation:

A total of 7 dosage groups were set at this stage, which were 5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2, 60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2, and 120 mg/m2, respectively. Accelerated dosage titration was performed in the first 3 dose groups, 1 subject was enrolled in each group; the last 4 dose groups were perfromed into dosage groups by the principle of "3+3" dose increment rule, and the number of subjects enrolled in each group is 3 to 6 cases.

Dose extension:

According to the test results of the dose escalation phase, two extensions of MTD (tentative 60 mg/m2, 90 mg/m2) were selected for the expansion trial. Each dose level was planned to enroll 6 subjects (12 in total), subjects were administered once every 3 weeks (1 treatment cycle every 3 weeks), and received 4 treatment cycles in a row for Hemay102. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and initial anti-tumor efficacy were evaluated.
