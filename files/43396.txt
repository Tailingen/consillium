Prospective Study Determining the Pain Response, Functional Interference and Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Radiofrequency Ablation Assisted Vertebroplasty/ Cementoplasty
Bone metastases are a cause of significant morbidity in cancer patients. In patients who die from breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up to 85% have evidence of bone metastases at the time of death (1). These metastases frequently give rise to complications that reduce patients' quality of life. These include: pain, fractures, and decreased mobility, ultimately reducing performance status.

Radiofrequency ablation therapy with cementoplasty/vertebroplasty for painful bone metastases has been shown to be feasible, efficacious, and safe. However, patient reported outcomes have yet to be determined.

PROCEDURE: RFA Vertebroplasty
Pain response, To determine the complete and partial pain response rates in patients who undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and/or cementoplasty/vertebroplasty for spinal/pelvic metastases., Baseline to 6 weeks post treatment
Functional Interference, To investigate how functional interference of pain changes, Baseline - 6 weeks post treatment|Quality of Life, To investigate quality of life changes, Baseline - 6 weeks post treatment|Side-effects, To investigate acute side effects of treatment, Baseline-6 weeks post treatment
