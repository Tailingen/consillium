Effect of Treatment on Work Experience in Patients With Stage I-III Prostate Cancer
The objective of this study is to examine how adenocarcinoma of the prostate treatment differentially affects African American men's ability to work and to describe and compare changes in work ability (as measured through self-reported global work ability item) reported by African American and white adenocarcinoma of the prostate survivors before treatment and 6 months after treatment completion.

Change in work ability measured by Global Work Ability, Calculate 95% confidence intervals around the work ability score and the change in the work ability score. A two group t-test will be used to compare changes in the work ability score by race (white, African American), followed by a general linear model to compare changes in work ability with adjustment for demographic, work environment, and other baseline characteristics., Baseline up to 6 months after treatment completion
Trajectory of change in work ability at 3 months measured by Global Work Ability, Measured by Global Work Ability. Quantify this change using means and 95% confidence intervals. In mixed models to account for the repeated measures over time, will model this change by race, income, and the interaction between race and income. Will also test for race by time and income by time interactions to compare the trajectories of change over time., Baseline up to 3 months after treatment completion|Trajectory of change in work ability at 6 months measured by Global Work Ability, In mixed models to account for the repeated measures over time, will model this change by race, income, and the interaction between race and income. Will also test for race by time and income by time interactions to compare the trajectories of change over time., Baseline up to 6 months after treatment completion|Trajectory of change in work ability at 3 months measured by Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), Quantify this change using means and 95% confidence intervals. In mixed models to account for the repeated measures over time, will model this change by race, income, and the interaction between race and income. Will also test for race by time and income by time interactions to compare the trajectories of change over time., From baseline to 3 months after treatment completion|Trajectory of change in work ability at 6 months measured by Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), Quantify this change using means and 95% confidence intervals. In mixed models to account for the repeated measures over time, will model this change by race, income, and the interaction between race and income. Will also test for race by time and income by time interactions to compare the trajectories of change over time., Baseline up to 6 months after treatment completion|Trajectory of change in work ability at 3 months measured by employment status, A random effects logistic regression model (if binary) or multinomial model (if more than 2 categories) for modeling employment status. Backwards model selection and Akaike information criterion (AIC) criteria will be utilized to identify the best model fit., Baseline up to 3 months after treatment completion|Trajectory of change in work ability at 6 months measured by employment status, A random effects logistic regression model (if binary) or multinomial model (if more than 2 categories) for modeling employment status. Backwards model selection and AIC criteria will be utilized to identify the best model fit., Baseline up to 6 months after treatment completion|Difference between preferred and actual length of leave, Examine whether demographics, treatment, psychosocial and physical effects of treatment, and work environment factors impact (a) desired and (b) actual length of leave following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Factors that are significant at an alpha level of 0.25 or less or have significant interactions will be entered into a general linear model., Up to 3 months after treatment completion|Difference between preferred and actual length of leave, Examine whether demographics, treatment, psychosocial and physical effects of treatment, and work environment factors impact (a) desired and (b) actual length of leave following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Factors that are significant at an alpha level of 0.25 or less or have significant interactions will be entered into a general linear model., Up to 6 months after treatment completion
Effect of race and income on treatment-related function, work environment, and type of treatment, Will use interactions to test moderation effects of race and income on the relationship between adenocarcinoma of the prostate treatment-related function (bladder, bowel, and hormonal function), work environment (e.g., work demands, workplace control, and social support), and type of treatment (surgery or radiation therapy, hormonal treatment) regarding outcomes of work limitations (as measured by the Work Limitations Questionnaire), Global Work Ability item, employment status, and preferred and actual length. Work ability, as measured through the WLQ and the Global Work Ability measures, and preferred versus actual length of time off work will be modeled as continuous variables in general linear models; employment status will be modeled as dichotomous (logistic regression) or in a multinomial model depending on the distribution of responses., Up to 6 months after treatment completion
This observational, longitudinal study will recruit approximately 255 patients through the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (WF NCORP RB). The recruitment goal will be to have 160 participants who complete the interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaire at all three time points. All participants will be administered the first Structured Questionnaire prior to a prostatectomy or initiation of radiation therapy to treat adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Participants will also be administered Structured Questionnaires at three and six months after the prostatectomy or completion of radiation therapy. For most patients, the time between study enrollment and completion of participation will be approximately 6 - 10 months. Interviewer-administered Structured Questionnaires will address work ability, job characteristics, presence of symptoms associated with adenocarcinoma of the prostate treatment, and general background information.
