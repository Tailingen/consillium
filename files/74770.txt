Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of BKM120 Plus MEK162 in Selected Advanced Solid Tumor Patients
This is an open label, dose finding, phase Ib clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the orally administered phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 in combination with the MEK1/2 inhibitor MEK162. This combination will be explored in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which has progressed on EGFR inhibitors and triple negative breast cancer, as well as pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, NSCLC, and other advanced solid tumors with KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutations. Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. At MTD or RP2D, two expansion arms will be opened in order to further assess safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of BKM120 and MEK162.

Study drugs will be administered once daily orally on a continuous schedule. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days.
