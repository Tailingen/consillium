A Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of GIGA-564 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GIGA-564 and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) level(s) of GIGA-564 in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor malignancies.
