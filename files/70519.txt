SERum-bank for PANcreatic Cancer
This study is about pancreatic cancer. If the diagnostic cancer is done at an early stage (\<2cm), the chances of recovery are very good.

But the main problem is there is not any detections means for this cancer. Sadly, when there is a cancer diagnostic , it's already too late in the majority of cases, because the cancer is in an advanced case.

Today, there is no any effective means of detection... Blood markers can be a simple means of early detection
Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Blood sample
Serum adiponectin concentration, Measure by blood sample result Serum adiponectin concentration threshold for which the specificity will be 100% for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer with a sensitivity of 80%., Months : 0
Serum CA19.9 concentration, Measure by blood sample result Threshold for Comparison of diagnostic performance compared to serum adiponectin concentration, Months : 0, 3, 6, 9, 12|Tumor response and progression rates according to RECIST v1.1, Tumor response and progression rates defined according to RECIST v1.1 criteria according to a serum threshold of the prognostic biomarker to be identified by logistic regression analyzes., Month 12|Progression-free survival, Months : 24|Overall survival, Months : 24|Serum adiponectin concentration, Measure by blood sample result Serum adiponectin concentration to correlate with cancer progression or not., Months : 3, 6, 9, 12
The purpose of this study is to establish a sero-library in a case-control cohort to assess several potentially useful serum biomarkers, such as adiponectin in the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
