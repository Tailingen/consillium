Genome-wide Analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations and Cerebral Aneurysm
Test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in ruptured and unruptured aneurysm tissue to identify a genetic difference between the two types of aneurysms; and to test SNP's in arteriovenous malformation tissue to identify a genetic link.
Arteriovenous Malformations|Intracranial Aneurysm|Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Risk gene expression, The samples will be frozen after collection and then analyzed., Within one week of sample collection.
