Prophylactic EVOZAC® Calming Skin Spray for EGFR-TKIs Associated Rash Eruption in NSCLC
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become an important target for cancer therapy, and the small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have played an important role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). What accompanies with the encouraging efficacy in NSCLC is the common side effects, of which the most common one is the specific papular and pustular acne-like rash which affects mainly the face, scalp, and upper torso. But till now, no medicament has been proved effective enough to treat or prevent the EGFR-TKIs associated rash. The EVOZAC® Calming Skin Spray has shown acceptable activity at the rash prevention in our preliminary study, so the investigators conduct the randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EVOZAC® Calming Skin Spray in prevention of EGFR-TKIs associated rash in NSCLC.
