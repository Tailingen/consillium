A Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) Study to Monitor the Safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine in Female Chinese Subjects
The purpose of this prospective, multi-centre, PMS cohort study was to monitor the safety of Cervarix, which is the first HPV vaccine licensed for use in China, to help prevent cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18. The vaccine was approved by National Drug Administration of China (CNDA), in July 2016.

As per the CNDA commitment, this study collected data regarding the safety of the vaccine, related information on potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs); which are diseases that could affect the immune system, and the effect on pregnancy outcomes (POs) including birth defects in the newborn.

Cervarix was approved for use in females between 9-25 years of age, for the prevention of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, grade 3 (CIN 2/3) and adenocarcinoma in situ caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18.

In May 2018, Cervarix was also approved for use in women of age up to 45 years.

The exposed set (ES) comprised 3013 subjects, who were vaccinated with Cervarix, on a voluntary basis, as per standard practice. The study collected information on any adverse event following immunisation, pIMDs, POs and congenital anomalies.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
OTHER: Safety data collection (following routine vaccination)
Number of Participants With Any (Following Each Dose and Across Doses), Grade 3 (Across Doses) and Vaccine Related (Across Doses) Medically Attended Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFIs), An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a vaccine. Medically attended AEFIs are defined as events leading to an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits. Any Medically attended AEFIS are presented for each dose and across doses. Grade 3 Medically attended AEFI = an AEFI which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related Medically Attended AEFI = AEFI assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination., During the 30-day period following each immunisation with Cervarix (administered on Day 1, Month 1 and Month 6)
Number of Participants With Any, Fatal and Vaccine Related Serious AEFIs (Across Doses), Serious AEFIs assessed included medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant. Any serious AEFI = If a medically attended AEFI led to hospitalisation (or met any other serious AEFI criteria). Fatal Serious AEFIs are those events that resulted in death. Related Serious AEFIs= AEFIs assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination., Throughout the study period (From Day 1 to either 12 months following the third immunisation (Month 18) or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (Month 24) whichever occured first))|Number of Participants With Any, Grade 3 and Vaccine Related Potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs) (Across Doses), pIMDs are a subset of AEFIs that included autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which might or might not have an autoimmune aetiology. Any was defined as the occurrence of any pIMD regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 pIMDs = pIMDs which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related pIMDs = pIMDs assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination., Throughout the study period (from Day 1 up to either 12 months following the third immunisation (Month 18) or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (Month 24), whichever occured first))|Number of Participants Reporting Pregnancies and Outcomes of Reported Pregnancies, The number of participants reporting pregnancies and outcomes of reported pregnancies (elective abortion for medical reasons, spontaneous abortion or congenital anomaly) when Cervarix was administered to the participant, inadvertently within 60 days before pregnancy onset, or any time during pregnancy, was reported., Throughout the study period (from Day 1 up to either 12 months following the third immunisation (Month 18) or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (Month 24), whichever occured first))
