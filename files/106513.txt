Trial of Combined Radiotherapy and Vertebroplasty for Patients With Painful Metastatic Spinal Lesions
Since patients with spinal metastases are living longer, durable palliation with long-term tumor control are becoming increasingly important.

EBRT results in durable local control of bone metastasis. However, about 25 % of patients with spinal metastases only achieved complete pain relief following EBRT for a median duration of less than 4 months. This could be partly due to spinal instability. In addition, almost half of the patients who receive EBRT will subsequently develop VCFs . Hence, RT does not stabilize the spine secondary to VCFs and is not effective in preventing imminent VCFs. Vertebroplasty has rapidly reduced pain and improved function in patients with VCFs. However, vertebroplasty does not provide local tumor control similar to EBRT.

It is theorized that combining vertebroplasty with EBRT will stabilize the spine, relieve the pain, prevent imminent VCFs and minimize or avoid the need for opioids. It is hypothesized that combining a spine stabilization procedure such as vertebroplasty with RT will be the most effective management for patients with spinal metastases than RT alone for patients with spinal metastases. Combined vertebroplasty and radiotherapy is not a standard treatment option at present. This study is designed to quantify the advantage of adding vertebroplasty to radiotherapy for patients with spinal metastases. If the study is proven to be significant, it could become the standard of care for patients with spinal metastases.
Spinal Metastases
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Vertebropladty
Improvement in Pain Score based on the Visual Analog Scale, The primary end point is the improvement in pain score of at least 2 points (a decrease of 2 points) on the visual analogue Scale (VAS) without concurrent increase in opioids., 1,3,6 and 12 months post treatment|Improvement in Pain Score based on the Brief Pain Inventory, The primary end point is the improvement in pain score of at least 2 points (a decrease of 2 points) on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) without concurrent increase in opioids., 1,3,6 and 12 months post treatment
Changes in back-specific physical functioning, The improvement in back-specific physical functioning is evaluated by the change in Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) score., 1,3,6 and 12 months post treatment|Incidence of vertebral compression fractures post treatment., The incidence of vertebral compression fractures will be evaluated by standing lateral spine radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae., Baseline, 6 months and 12 months|Prospectively quantify pain response using the Visual Analog Scale, Pain response will be assessed by VAS and evaluated using a patient diary based on the International Bone Metastases Working Party Criteria. Based on intake of analgesics, the daily oral morphine equivalent dose (OMED) will be calculated., 1,3,6 and 12 months post treatment|Prospectively quantify pain response using the Brief Pain Inventory., Pain response will be assessed by BPI and evaluated using a patient diary based on the International Bone Metastases Working Party Criteria.
