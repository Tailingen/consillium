A Study in Cancer Patients to Evaluate the Effect of Lapatinib on the QTc Interval
This study will estimate the effect of lapatinib on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval duration) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study treatment period will occur over five days and an End of Study visit will be conducted on Day 8 (or no later than 3 days beyond Day 8). Subjects will receive placebo that mimics lapatinib for 2 days as three separate doses given 12 hours apart (8 tablets/dose) and lapatinib (2000mg) for 2 days as three separate doses given 12 hours apart (8 tablets/dose). Subjects will not know when they are receiving placebo vs. lapatinib. Digital 12-lead ECG recordings will be extracted from continuous ECG recordings obtained via a Holter monitor to measure QTc interval duration. Triplicate ECG measurements of QTc interval will be taken at pre-specified times at Day 1 (Baseline) and pre-dose and up to 24 hours after the third dose of placebo or lapatinib on Study Days 2 and 4. Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur immediately following each pre-specified QTc measurement in subjects dosed with placebo or lapatinib. Subjects who complete participation in this study, if they are eligible, will be offered the option to continue treatment with lapatinib, either alone or in combination with other oncology drugs in pre-selected anticancer regimens, in a continuation protocol, EGF111767.

Treatment Difference in Duration of Cardiac Ventricular Depolarization and Repolarization Interval (QT) in Fridericia-corrected QT Interval (QTcF) Values Between Placebo and Lapatinib 2000mg, A Holter monitor is an ambulatory portable device used for continuously monitoring the cardiovascular system. Three replicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected at 30, 15, and 0 minutes prior to the administration of study treatment (trt) on Days 1 and 3 and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hr post-dose on Days 2 and 4. The 3 readings at each time point (TP) were averaged prior to any analysis. BL is the average of the pre-dose QTcF values (triplicate) taken on Day 1 for PBO and on Day 3 for LAP. Mean change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from individual QTcF for each TP. BL adjusted mean difference in absolute QTcF between LAB and PBO (trt difference) with the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) was estimated for each TP (pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hr post-dose). Trt difference analysis was performed by a repeated measures analysis of variance adjusted for trt group, TP, and trt group\*TP interaction., Baseline (BL) (Day1) and pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24-hours (hr) post-dose on Day 2 for placebo (PBO).

For each participant, the time prior to the first quantifiable (non-zero) concentration (tlag) was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. Since all participants received 2 doses of study medication prior to the collection of the first (pre-dose) blood sample on Day 4, tlag was expected to be zero. For PK analysis, one blood sample was collected on Day 1 for placebo Baseline. The 24 hour blood sample on Day 2 also served for lapatinib Baseline.
