BEHAVIORAL: telephone interviews
Primary outcome of the study is stage of intention to undergo prophylactic surgery. Outcome variable consists of 6 rank-ordered, qualitatively distinct stages (see Measures) ranging from Precontemplation (no intention) to Action (intention carried out)., 1 year
To determine the relative contributions of sociodemographic, medical, and psychosocial factors to stage of intention regarding prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy., conclusion of the study
For women with a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer, few options exist for primary prevention of these cancers other than prophylactic surgery, or surgical removal of noncancerous organs in order to prevent occurrence of the disease. The primary aim of the study is to describe the stages of intention to undergo prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy among women seeking genetic testing for inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and to identify factors that influence stages of intention regarding prophylactic surgery. To achieve these aims, 626 women undergoing genetic counseling and testing for inherited breast ovarian cancer risk will be assessed before their first genetic counseling session and three times (1 week, 6 months and 12 months) in the year following notification of their genetic test results.
