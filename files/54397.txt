Ondansetron (ODF) Versus Ondansetron Intravenously for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting Compare in Children
The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron oral soluble film plus dexamethasone in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with MEC/HEC chemotherapy in children with solid tumor.
Pediatric Solid Tumor, Unspecified, Protocol Specific
DRUG: Ondansetron (Oral soluble film OR injections) ,Dexamethasone
Complete Response Rate (CR rate), The proportion of patients with complete response (CRR, defined as no vomiting and no rescue therapy administered) within the acute phase (0-24h) after starting chemotherapy., between 0 and 24 hours after the start of chemotherapy
CR rate in delayed phase, Complete response rate in delayed phase, >24ï½ž120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy|CR rate in overall phase, Complete response rate in overall phase, 0~120 Hours Post Initiation of Chemotherapy|Complete control rate in the acute, delayed, overall phases, Complete control rate defined as no vomiting, no rescue therapy, and no slight nausea \< grade 1, between 0 and 120 hours after the start of chemotherapy
Complete randomization was used to assign subjects to the experimental group (ondansetron oral soluble film plus dexamethasone) and the control group (ondansetron intravenously plus dexamethasone) in a ratio of 1 to 1. And a specialized software was used to generate random numbers to make a random assignment table.

Experimental:

Participants received the first dose of ondansetron oral soluble film (age-based adjustment) 30 minutes before chemotherapy and equal doses were given 4 hours and 8 hours after the first dose for whom younger than 12 years old while the others should be given 8h hours after the first dose. Ondansetron oral soluble film was administered continuously for two days after chemotherapy according to the administration regimen on the day of chemotherapy. Dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po twice daily and discontinued until 72 hours after chemotherapy.

Placebo Comparator:

Participants received the first dose of ondansetron intravenously (weight-based adjustment) 30 minutes before chemotherapy and equal doses were given 4 hours and 8 hours after the first dose. Ondansetron (po) was given for next continuously two days in the same dose and frequency of administration. Dexamethasone (weight based) iv/po twice daily and discontinued until 72 hours after chemotherapy.
