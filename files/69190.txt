Safety and Tolerability Study for T-1201 Injection 100 mg Kit in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of T-1201 injection in subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T-1201 on different dosing schedules.
* The Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of T-1201 on different dosing schedules.

Researchers will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of T-1201.

Participants will:

Received T-1201 either once every 4 (Part A)/2 (Part B)/3 (Part C) weeks, depend on they participate in which parts of study.

Visit the clinic once every 2/3 weeks for checkups and tests
