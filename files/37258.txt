SL-401 as Consolidation Therapy in Patients With Adverse Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia in First Complete Remission
This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SL-401 in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and to evaluate the safety profile of SL-401 at the MTD.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Tagraxofusp-erzs
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which 2 or more patients experienced a DLT during treatment Cycle 1., 24 weeks
Eradication of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) From Baseline, The rate of MRD eradication (conversion) is defined as the proportion of patients with evidence of MRD prior to initial therapy with investigational SL-401 for whom MRD cannot be detected upon subsequent (post treatment) assessments., 24 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of SL-401 to the date of death from any cause. Participants still alive or lost to follow-up at the time of analysis were censored on the last date known to be alive prior to the analysis cutoff date, as determined by in-person visit or telephone contact., Day 1 (enrollment) through Month 44|Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the proportion of patients who remain free of acute myeloid leukemia recurrence (hematologic) and alive., 24 weeks
Patients who were in their first or second complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) after induction therapy were treated with SL-401, which was administered as a brief intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days for 6 or more cycles. Stage 1 consisted of a period in which patients were treated with SL-401 at 3 dose levels. During Stage 2, patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) in their bone marrow were treated at a MTD or maximum tested dose in which multiple dose-limiting toxicities were not observed (identified in Stage 1).
