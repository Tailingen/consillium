Laboratory-Treated T Cells After Second-Line Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With HER2/Neu-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Treating a patient's T cells in the laboratory may help the T cells kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Giving laboratory-treated T cells after chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving laboratory-treated T cells after second-line chemotherapy works in treating patients with HER2/neu-negative metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER2Bi-armed activated T cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|OTHER: Laboratory biomarker analysis
Number of Participant Who Were Alive Without Progression at 4 Months, 26 evaluable patients will be accrued in this study. A single-arm, single-stage phase II design will be used. If ≥9 out of 26 patients have not progressed by the 4-month follow-up, we will declare that the treatment is effective on TTP., At the 4-month follow-up
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time duration from the first infusion until death or last observation., Followed until death or last observation (assessed up to 5 years), whichever occurs first|Overall Response Rate, Complete and partial responses; Responses will be evaluated using standard RECIST 1.1 criteria., Following chemotherapy, up to 4 months
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine in a phase II trial whether Her2Bi armed ATC infused after ChemoT for patients with HER2 0-2+ MBC or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer would improve median PFS by 2 months beyond the median PFS of 2 months estimated from published trials in a one stage design.
* To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients with HER2 0-2+ MBC and locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer who receive aATC infusion after ChemoT.
* To confirm the toxicity profile for Her2Bi armed ATC given after ChemoT for patients with HER2 0-2+ MBC.
* To measure functional and phenotypic changes in immune cell populations (blood and tumor sites, if accessible) as a consequence of armed ATC (tumor biopsies done at KCI only). Cytokine responses, phenotypic markers of differentiation, and anti-tumor cytotoxicity will be examined.
* OUTLINE: Patients receive second-line chemotherapy for 4 courses or 4 months. Beginning as early as 1.5 weeks and as late as 4 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients will receive the first infusion of anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed activated T-cells (ATC) IV over 30-60 minutes once a week for 3 weeks. Low dose granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (250 µg/m2/twice per week) will start 3 days before the first aATC infusion and end with the last dose of aATC. Patients who are already on the protocol will be given a choice to add GM-CSF to their treatment regimen (after reconsenting) or continue to their treatment without GM-CSF. Patients then receive a boost of anti-CD3 x anti-HER2/neu bispecific antibody-armed ATC at 12 weeks after the 3rd ATC infusion.

Blood and tumor tissue samples may be collected periodically for biomarker and other analyses.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for ≥ 2 years.
