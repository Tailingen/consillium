A Study of Toca 511 & Toca FC in Patients With Recurrent High Grade Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (Toca 8)
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of intravesical Toca 511 followed by oral Toca FC in patients with high grade (HG) non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with cohort expansion at the recommended Phase 2 dose. Patients with recurrent HG NMIBC who are undergoing planned transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) will be enrolled into the study, subject to meeting all entry criteria.
Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Toca 511|DRUG: Toca FC (extended-release formulation of flucytosine)
Dose-limiting toxicities, * Any treatment-related Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, excluding nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that are controllable with appropriate medical measures (eg, antiemetics, antimotility drugs)
* Any treatment-related Grade 4 or higher hematologic toxicity, 5 weeks
Differences in viral transduction of Toca 511 at each dose level, based on quantitation of viral RNA and DNA in tumor, 3 weeks (+/- 1 week)|Clearance of viral RNA in plasma and urine, based on real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and of viral DNA in whole blood and urine, based on quantitative PCR (qPCR), 1 week for plasma, 4 weeks for urine
Changes from baseline in immune activity in tumor, peripheral blood, and urine, 21 weeks|Complete response rate at 6 and 12 months in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), Proportion of patients with CIS with complete response at 6 and 12 months|High-grade recurrence-free survival, Event free survival overall and at 6 and 12 months|Incidence of cystectomy, The proportion of patients who undergo cystectomy|Incidence of disease progression at 6 and 12 months, The proportion of patients with disease progression at 6 and 12 months
