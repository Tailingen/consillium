A Randomized Phase II Trial of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Compared With Chemoradiotherapy in Gastric Adenocarcinoma
This prospective, randomized phase II study is designed to evaluate weather neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is superior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with both followed by surgery and postoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.

R0 resection rate, The surgical procedure was total or subtotal gastrectomy with recommended D2 lymphadenectomy 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy., 2-3 months
Pathological response rate, Pathological response were classiﬁed into three grades.Grade I signiﬁes that there is little shrinkage in the tumor; only mild regression in the tumor cells is observed under themicroscope. Grade II shows gross reduction in size of the tumor and marked regression in the cancer cells microscopically, yet viable nests of cancer tissue are still visible. Grade III implies complete or almost total resolution of the tumor on exploration, and disappearance of the tumor tissue microscopically; only remnants of degenerated cancer cells can be seen (so-called ghost cancer cells)., 2-3 months|Tumor down-staging, Down-staging was considered as any stage reduction between clinical and pathologic stage., 2-3 months|Postoperative complications, During hospital stay and within the first 30 days after completion of surgery., 2-3 months|Acute chemotherapy/Chemoradiotherapy toxicities, chemotherapy toxicities are evaluated by NCI-CTC version 4.0 and radiotherapy toxicities are graded using the RTOG/EORTC Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema., 6-8 months|Distant metastasis free survival, 3 years|Locoregional recurrence free survival, 3 years|Overall survival, 3 years
Comparison of dosimetric differences between radiation techniques, To compare the dosimetric differences between the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), Tomotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques in treatment planning., 1 year
