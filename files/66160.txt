A Prospective Study Comparing Two Radiotherapy Dose/Fraction and Omitting CTVs of the Primary Tumor in Limited SCLC
For most of the patients with limited-stage SCLC, thoracic radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the standard treatment at present. However, the optimal dose / fraction of thoracic radiotherapy for limited-stage SCLC is still in controversial.This study is designed as a prospecitive randomized non-inferiority trial.
