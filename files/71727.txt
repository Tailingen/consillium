Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm, single center clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CAR-T treatment for multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
BIOLOGICAL: BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T
Evaluation of Safety, Count the Incidence of adverse events, Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Changes in cytokine level, Calculate the change of cytokine level in peripheral blood by flow cytometry after CLL1 CAR-T infusion. Cytokines include IL-2、IL-6、IL-10、IFN-γ, Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion
Complete response rate(CRR), Proportion of subjects whose serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis are negative, and there is no soft tissue plasma cell tumor, with bone marrow plasma cells\<5%., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Strict complete response rate(SCRR), Proportion of subjects who achieved complete response with normal FLC ratio and confirmed absence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Very good partial response rate(VGPRR), Proportion of subjects who detected serum and urine M protein in immunofixation, but did not detect it from electrophoresis; Or M protein decrease ≥ 90% and urine M protein\<100 mg/24h., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Partial response rate(PRR), Proportion of subjects who met the following requirements:

1. A decrease of ≥ 50% in serum M protein and ≥ 90% or\<200 mg/24h in urine M protein;
2. If M protein in serum and urine cannot be detected, it is required to reduce the difference between affected and unaffected serum FLC by ≥ 50%;
3. If M protein and serum FLC in serum and urine cannot be measured, and the baseline bone marrow plasma cell ratio is ≥ 30%, a reduction of ≥ 50% in the number of bone marrow plasma cells is required;
4. In addition to the above criteria, if there is a baseline presence of soft tissue plasmocytoma, it is required that the sum of the maximum vertical diameter product (SPD) of the measurable lesion be reduced by ≥ 50%., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Minimal response rate(MRR), Proportion of subjects whose serum M protein decreased by 25%\~49% and 24-hour urine M protein decreased by 50%\~89%; In addition to the above criteria, if there is a baseline presence of soft tissue plasmocytoma, a measurable reduction in lesion SPD of ≥ 50% is required., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion|Overall response rate(ORR), Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR., Up to 2 years after BCMA/GPRC5D double CAR-T infusion
This study is a single arm, single center study targeting patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (r/rMM). The study plans to enroll 40 subjects, with a sample size based on actual occurrence and a dosage of 3×106/kg±20%\~1×107/kg ±20% CAR positive T cells.
