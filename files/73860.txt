Scalp Cooling to Prevent Hair Loss in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma
This pilot study of scalp cooling with Penguin cold caps will examine the effectiveness of scalp cooling to reduce the development of hair loss in 30 participants with multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The investigators will also assess the potential impact of hair loss versus the discomfort and inconvenience of the scalp cooling procedure.
Multiple Myeloma
DEVICE: Penguin Cold Cap
Change in development of hair loss, Change in development of hair loss will be defined as \< 50% hair loss (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAEs) Version 5, Grade 0 or 1) in 75% of patients treated., From the start of study treatment (Day -2) until Day 30.
Patient determined decision of scalp cooling benefit, Patient determined decision of scalp cooling benefit will be measured by Scalp Cooling Questionnaire, a homegrown scale ranging from no benefit to substantial benefit, with higher scores representing a better outcome., At Day 0 and Day 90.
