A Study of Pembrolizumab With Lenvatinib in Women With Advanced Uterine Carcinosarcoma
The purpose of this study to find out whether the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab is an effective treatment for advanced uterine carcinosarcoma. The researchers will also do tests to find out whether biomarkers in the blood can predict the cancer's response to the study treatment. A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition
