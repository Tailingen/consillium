Rechallenge of Cetuximab Combined With Irinotecan as Third-line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer - Phase II Study
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate at two months (complete disappearance of the disease and partial disappearance of the disease) obtained after administration of combination therapy with cetuximab and irinotecan in the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Secondaries objectives will be assessed progression-free survival, overall survival, toxicity, quality of life.
