A Phase 1 Study of ADA-011 for Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study consists of dose escalation evaluation to determine the safety and tolerability of ADA-011 as a monotherapy. Following dose escalation, one or more dose expansion cohorts in selected indications will be explored to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ADA-011.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: ADA-011|DRUG: PD(L)-1 inhibitor
Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be presented., 36 months|Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 and are generally defined as grade 3 or higher toxicities which are deemed to be medically significant., 21 days (cycle 1)
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of Participants Treated with ADA-011 (AUC), Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ADA-011 including area under the curve (AUC) will be evaluated for all participants in the dose escalation cohorts., 36 months|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of Participants Treated with ADA-011 (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ADA-011 including maximum concentration (Cmax) will be evaluated for all participants in the dose escalation cohorts., 36 months
Number of Participants Positive for Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) After Treatment with ADA-011, Serum samples from participants treated with ADA-011 will be analyzed for ADA using a neutralizing antibody assay. The number of participants with neutralizing ADA will be reported., 36 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, The percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 criteria will be reported., 36 months
