A Study of Ramucirumab in Treating Japanese Participants With Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival in participants with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who have had disease progression following first-line therapy who undergo treatment with ramucirumab.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Ramucirumab
Percentage of Participants Who Are Progression-Free at 12 Weeks (Progression-Free Survival [PFS] Rate at 12 Weeks), The 12-week PFS rate is the probability of participants who survived during the first 12 weeks in the study without disease progression. It was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for the main analysis of the 12-week PFS rate., 12 Weeks
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from baseline to measured Progressive Disease (PD) as defined by RECIST v.1.1 \[defined as \> 20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started (best response)\], or death due to any cause, whichever is first., Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 30.3 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Objective Response Rate (ORR)], Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of CR or PR. According to RECIST v1.1, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter; CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels \[if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal (ULN)\]. The percentage of participants who achieved an objective response = (number of participants with CR or PR)/(number of participants assessed)\*100., Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 38.0 Weeks)|Percentage of Participants Achieving Stable Disease (SD) or a Confirmed CR or PR [Disease Control Rate (DCR)], Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the ULN); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started. The percentage of participants who achieved disease control = (number of participants with CR, PR, or SD)/(number of participants assessed)\*100., Baseline to Measured PD or Death from Any Cause (Up to 12 Months)|Overall Survival (OS), The OS time is defined as the time from baseline to the date of death from any cause. If a participant is not known to have died on or before the date of data cut-off, OS data will be censored on the last date (on or before the cut-off date) the participant was known to be alive., Baseline to Death from Any Cause (Up to 13 Months)|Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, A sample will be considered positive for circulating anti-ramucirumab antibodies if it exhibits a post-baseline antibody level that exceeds the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean determined from the normal anti-ramucirumab level seen in healthy untreated individuals. A participant will be considered to have an anti-ramucirumab response if there are 2 consecutive positive samples or if the final sample tested is positive., Cycle 1: Pre-infusion, Cycle 2: Pre-infusion, Cycle 3: Pre-infusion, Follow Up|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab, Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-Dose, End of Infusion. 1, 4, 23, 47, 95, 167, 263, and 335 Hours Post-Dose|PK: Area Under the Curve Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-âˆž]) of Ramucirumab, Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-Dose, End of Infusion: 1, 4, 23, 47, 95, 167, 263, and 335 Hours Post-Dose
