A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of the Intravenous Fixed-Dose Combination (IV FDC) of Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of tiragolumab and atezolizumab intravenous fixed-dose combination (IV FDC) in participants with histologically confirmed PD-L1-selected solid tumors whose disease is locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic and for whom an investigational agent in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody is considered an acceptable treatment option.
