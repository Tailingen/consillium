Oral Azacitidine (CC-486) Epigenetic Priming and Maintenance for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients
To investigate the feasibility of delivering oral azacitidine (CC-486) as a consolidation regimen from the time of first complete remission (CR1), in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) eligible for curative intent Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: oral azacitidine (CC-486)
Number of patients receiving oral azacitidine (CC 486) as post-remission consolidation therapy that are able to proceed to reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT), To identify the number of participants able to receive a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 cycles of CC-486 consolidation therapy as a bridge to Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) ASCT while maintaining first complete remission- CR1., With each cycle (1 cycle is equivalent to 28 days) of CC-486 pre-transplant, up to 3 months|Total number of participants that experience any adverse events with oral azacitidine (CC 486) use prior to RIC ASCT for patients with (AML) in first complete remission (CR1)., Adverse events (AEs) occurring in the participants will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v 5.0 with each cycle of CC_486 administered pre-transplant., For a maximum of 3 cycles (1 cycle is equivalent to 28 days) and or up to 3 months from the start of CC-486
Disease status and response to each cycle of pre-transplant CC-486 administration as per European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML 2017 guidelines, With CC-486 consolidation prior to transplant best response to treatment and disease status will be measured. Response criteria or loss of response (including frank morphologic relapse) will be assessed by using peripheral blood or bone marrow samples as per European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML 2017 guidelines., With each cycle (1 cycle is equivalent to 28 days) of CC-486 pre-transplant|Number of participants retaining remission post-transplant, Bone marrow biopsies will be performed longitudinally post-transplant. Prior to initiating first cycle of CC-486 maintenance post-transplant, disease status confirmation with a bone marrow biopsy in the prior 14 days would be needed. Response criteria or loss of response will be defined as per European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML 2017 guideline. Based on best response observed duration of remission, cumulative incidence of relapse, patterns of relapse will be described. Participants will be assessed at days 30, 60, 120, 180, 365 and 720 for disease relapse., Up to 720 days|Total number of maintenance cycles administered post-transplant to assess compliance, As assessed by the number of cycles administered and the periods of interruptions., Up to 2 years post transplant|Overall Survival, As assessed by the length of survival in months from the time of 1st cycle of CC-486 pretransplant, from the time of transplant and from the time of starting maintenance post-transplant., Up to 2 years from the time of starting CC-486|Incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD), As assessed by cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) within 2 years from the date of transplant., up to 2 years post-transplant|Hematopoiesis origins assessed in peripheral blood and bone marrow., As assessed by kinetics of chimerism changes for those receiving CC-486. Based on institutional practices peripheral blood and or bone marrow samples would be used for chimerism testing. Donor/recipient hematopoiesis fraction will be reported across cellular subset per institutional standards., Up to 2 years post transplant|Change in quality of life assessed by Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) version 4., Quality of life questionnaire administered pre- and post-transplant with CC-486 maintenance use. The Likert scale from zero to four \[0-4\] is used to measure the responses for each question after taking into account reverse scores for questions constructed in a negative form. The final score for FACT-BMT ranges from zero to 196. Higher scores for the scales and subscales indicate better quality of life., Prior to transplant (at screening and immediately prior to transplant) and in post-transplant at days + 100, +180 & +365|Total number of participants that experience any adverse events with oral azacitidine (CC 486) use in post-transplant period., Adverse events (AEs) occurring in the participants will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0 with each cycle of CC_486 administered post-transplant., up to 2 years post transplant
A significant proportion of patients with Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are fit to receive intensive chemotherapy and reach first complete remission (CR), relapse despite further high or low intensity therapies. Relapse/refractory (R/R) AML generally portends poor outcomes and available agents to treat this condition have modest efficacy. Until the recent approval of CC-486 as a maintenance therapy, no other drug had shown overall survival (OS) advantage for patients with AML in first complete remission (CR1). In the CC-486 registration trial (QUAZAR AML-01), remission induction was achieved by intensive chemotherapy, but patients were ineligible to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) at the time of screening. Post CR1, CC-486 apart from prolonging remission was also successful in deepening the quality of remission by eradicating measurable residual disease (MRD). It is therefore logical to investigate the feasibility of CC-486 as a consolidation regimen from the time of CR1, in patients eligible for curative intent ASCT. It is anticipated that continued epigenetic priming peri-ASCT with CC-486 can favorably alter disease biology for AML patients in CR1, modulate immune surveillance to decrease relapse risk, mitigate adverse graft versus host disease (GVHD) biology without significant compromise on the quality of life. This pilot study will assess the suitability of CC-486 as a bridge to transplant, will help optimize the timing between CC-486 administration and the start of transplant preparative regimen, and will assess the utility of continued CC-486 maintenance post-transplant.
