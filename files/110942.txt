Study of Initial Treatment With Elotuzumab, Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma
This study will be a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study where newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy will be eligible for enrollment. A total of 55 subjects will be enrolled. Time to progression or death will be calculated from the date of first treatment on protocol until the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients can expect to participate between 12-24 cycles. The primary endpoint will be the rate of response by next generation gene sequencing at the end of 8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer transplant.

Number of participants with adverse events of elotuzumab in combination with KRd, Adverse events will be monitored in real time and discussed at a weekly data and safety monitoring conference., Through study completion an average of one year, adverse events will be monitored in real time|Rate of MRD, At the end of four, eight, and twelve months for certain subjects.|Duration of response, These events will be analyzed at differing points of time based on the individual subjects disease progression., Through study completion an average of one year|Progression free survival, These events will be analyzed at differing points of time based on the individual subjects disease progression., Through study completion an average of one year|Time to progression, These events will be analyzed at differing points of time based on the individual subjects disease progression., Through study completion an average of one year|Overall survival, These events will be analyzed at differing points of time based on the individual subjects disease progression., Through study completion an average of one year
Logisitc Regression for analyzing exploratory biomarkers, Subjects will have the option to participate in additional genetic components of this trial if they provide their consent. Once a subject has completed participation in the trial, if they agree to participate in the optional components their disease will be analyzed in relation to people with similar genetic make up., After study completion an average of one year
Primary Objective

• The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of sCR and/or the rate of negative MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) at the end of 8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer transplant

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of elotuzumab in combination with KRd, when administered to subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
* To determine the rate of MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) and by multi-color flow cytometry (MFC) at the end of Cycle 4, 8,and 12 for all subjects, and end of C18 (for subjects who are MRD+ at the end of C8 but MRD- at the end of C12 only), 24 months after C1D1, and yearly after that.
* To estimate time to event, including duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

Exploratory Objectives

* GEP, proteomics, and gene sequencing to evaluate the correlation between treatment outcome and pre-treatment subject profile.
* Immunologic correlative studies including FcγRIIIa V genotype.
