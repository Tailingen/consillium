A Phase I Study of Henatinib in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
Henatinib is a novel oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and antiangiogenic activities. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Henatinib in patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies
Advanced Solid Cancer
DRUG: henatinib
The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) regimen of henatinib will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of six experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) after completing one treatment cycle., 4 weeks
Number of participants with adverse events, 8 weeks|Henatinib pharmacokinetic parameters may include AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and t1/2., 4 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), 8 weeks
1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Henatinib, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Henatinib and its metabolites .
3. To assess preliminary antitumor activity .
4. To determine preliminary regimen for phase II study .
