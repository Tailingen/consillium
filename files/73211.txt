Detection of Either the EML4-ALK Gene Rearrangements or the T790M EGFR Mutation in the Plasma of Advanced NSCLC Patients
Demonstrate feasibility of detection of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts and T790M EGFR mutation from exosomes in the circulation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLS) patients.

ALK mutation by tissue assay., Patients found to be positive for ALK mutation by tissue assay. ALK fusions in samples will be considered binary - positive or negative/ not assessable. 2x2 table will be constructed to determine concordance with tissue testing., Two years|T790M EGFR mutation by tissue assay, Patients found to be positive for T790M EGFR mutation by tissue assay.

The goal of this study is two-fold: 1) Demonstrate feasibility of detection of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in the circulation of NSCLC patients positive for ALK on tissue analysis, using an institutionally accepted assay; 2) Demonstrate feasibility of detection of T790M EGFR mutation in the circulation of NSCLC patients positive for T790M on tissue analysis, using an institutionally accepted assay.
