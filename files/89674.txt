Accuracy of FDG-PET Scanning to Diagnose Malignant Thyroid Nodules
The main purpose of this study is to see how well FDG-PET scans can determine the malignancy of thyroid nodules that have already been tested (and come back positive) by fine needle aspiration.

Evaluate the sensitivity of the FDG-PET/CT imaging in localizing foci of metastatic disease within the neck in patients with thyroid malignancy identified as having follicular or equivocal histology by FNA, Approximately 6 weeks after surgery
While FNA is a sensitive test for diagnosing thyroid tumors, it cannot differentiate benign from malignant follicular nodules and sometimes yields equivocal results due to inadequate sampling or indeterminate cytology. The standard of care for patients with equivocal or follicular histology is surgical removal of these nodules, most of which are benign in nature. FDG-PET, as evidenced by our prior experience and studies from other groups, may have application in discriminating benign from malignant disease in these patients with equivocal or follicular FNA results using standardized uptake value determination. We have demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary clinical utility of using limited neck FDG-PET exams in patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules in a pilot study. The purpose of this trial is to prospectively evaluate a larger series of patients with equivocal or follicular histology on FNA to more accurately define the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for diagnostic imaging of these nodules. In addition, the utility of this modality in identifying metastatic foci in patients with thyroid cancer having follicular or equivocal histology on FNA will be assessed. If the sensitivity and specificity of this modality are determined to be high (â‰¥95%) for diagnosing malignant nodules in these patients, many patients with benign disease may potentially benefit by avoiding unnecessary operations.
