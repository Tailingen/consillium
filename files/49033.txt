Clinical Evaluation of 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 Positron Emission Tomography in the Detection of Insulinoma
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a kind of G protein coupled receptor which regulate the insulin secretion and serves as potential target in the diagnosis of functional pancreas neuroendocrine tumor. The aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of a potential GLP-1R targeted tracer 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 for the detection of insulinoma.
Insulinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4
Standardized uptake value, Calculation of the standardized uptake value 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 in Diagnosis of Insulinoma, 1 year
GLP-1 receptor expression by histology compared to tracer uptake, Pathological detection of GLP-1 receptor expression in patients' lesions and compared to tracer uptake by PET/CT, 1 year|Incidence of Adverse Events, This study will utilize the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 4.0 for toxicity and Serious Adverse Event reporting, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients will be followed and assessed
Since GLP-1R is expressed in human β-cells and highly overexpressed in insulinomas，multiple GLP-1R-targeted radiopharmaceuticals were devoted to insulinoma localization imaging.68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 is an optimal probe targeting GLP-1R. A single dose of 111-185 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.The investigators will determine the use of 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 PET/CT in the detection of insulinomas, and to compare its diagnostic value with conventional imaging.
