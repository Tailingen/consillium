Minor Histocompatibility Vaccination After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
This is a clinical research study designed to evaluate whether the administration of a vaccine to patients after transplant consisting of a minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag peptide) mixed with G-CSF (a drug intended to stimulate the immune system) can stimulate increased graft versus leukemia (GVL) responses without causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

To determine in HLA A2 positive patients with hematological malignancies undergoing transplantation from HLA-identical donors, if HA1/2-peptide vaccinations can induce or enhance short- and long-term allogeneic HA1/2-specific T cell immunity., 5 years
To evaluate if HA1/2 peptide vaccination induces toxicity, especially acute GVHD after HLA-identical transplantation., 5 years
