Pazopanib in Previously Treated Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm study in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have received one prior targeted therapy with either sunitinib or bevacizumab. The planned enrollment for this study is 60 patients.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pazopanib
Overall Response Rate, Proportion of patients with complete and partial response (CR and PR). CR defined as disappearance of target lesions; PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diamater of target lesions., 18 months
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death on study. Progression is defined in RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 8 weeks until progressive disease, expected average of 18 months
All eligible patients will receive 800 mg of pazopanib orally each day continuously. Patients will be re-evaluated for treatment response after 8 weeks of daily oral pazopanib therapy. Response to therapy will be assigned using RECIST criteria (Section 6.0) Patients who have objective response or stable disease will continue treatment with evaluations every 8 weeks, until the time of tumor progression or intolerable treatment-related side effects.
