Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer
RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gefitinib works in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: gefitinib
1-year overall survival rate, Up to 12 months
Survival time, Up to 5 years|Disease-free survival, Up to 5 years|Time to disease recurrence, Up to 5 years|Time to treatment failure, Up to 5 years|Quality of life, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the 1-year overall survival rate in patients with previously treated locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with gefitinib as maintenance therapy.

Secondary

* Determine disease-free survival and time to disease recurrence in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, every 12 weeks during study treatment, and then at the end of study treatment.

Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.
