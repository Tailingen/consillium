Study on Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy After Resection of Pancreascarcinoma
In patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer could be a radical removal of all tumor foci a significantly improved survival compared to a sole systemic chemotherapy are additionally achieved by a hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC).
Adenocarcinomas of the Pancreas

Despite medical progress in recent years in pancreatic reach the 5-year survival rates even after radical surgical resection only 20%, which is due to high rates of local recurrence and distant metastases in the postoperative course. Due to the anatomical position of the pancreas resections are having a "wide margin" technically almost impossible, so that the tumor on postoperative preparation is often marginal forming. A further possible explanation for the high number of local recurrences, intraoperative tumor cell displacement in question.

In patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer could be a radical removal of all tumor foci a significantly improved survival compared to a sole systemic chemotherapy are additionally achieved by a hyperthermic intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC). Purpose of HIPEC it is to kill any remaining microscopic residual tumor or residual tumor cells free. The aim of the present phase I / II study is therefore to examine the importance of HIPEC in addition to radical resection of ductal pancreatic cancer in terms of mortality and morbidity.
