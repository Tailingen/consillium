Camrelizumab Combined With Apatinib Versus Apatinib Alone in the Third-line Treatment of Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This is a study of Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib versus Apatinib alone in the third-line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. Paticipants will be radomized to receive treatment of Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib or Apatinib alone. The primary study hypothesis is that the adding Camrelizumab to Apatinib can prolong the progressive-free survival of the paticipants.
