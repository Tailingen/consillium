ACTengineÂ® IMA203 Combined With mRNA-4203
This purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of IMA203 in combination with different doses of mRNA-4203. The trial includes participants with previously treated unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) or synovial sarcoma (SS).

Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of DLTs will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for extension (RDE) after treatment with IMA203 product in combination with mRNA-4203, one year post infusion of IMA203|Number of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), AEs of special interest, serious AEs (SAEs), changes in laboratory parameters and vital signs, and frequency of dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations, Used to evaluate safety and tolerability of treatment with IMA203 in combination with mRNA-4203, one year post infusion of IMA203
Objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on best overall response (BOR), locally assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, one year post infusion of IMA203|Duration of response (DOR), CR and PR, locally assessed using RECIST v1.1, one year post infusion of IMA203|Disease control rate (DCR), CR, PR and stable disease (SD) lasting 6 or more weeks following the infusion of IMA203, locally assessed using RECIST v1.1, one year post infusion of IMA203|Progression-free survival (PFS), locally assessed using RECIST v1.1, one year post infusion of IMA203|Concentration of IMA203 transgene in peripheral blood, Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of T-cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells in combination with mRNA-4203, one year post infusion of IMA203
This clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label, non-comparative Phase 1 a/b trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the combination of IMA203 and mRNA-4203 in HLA-A\*02:01 positive patients with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) and synovial sarcoma (SS).
