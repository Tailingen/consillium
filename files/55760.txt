Blood Cell RNA-Based Cancer Detection
Early diagnosis of cancer may provide patients with more treatment options and hopefully prolong survival. The purpose of this multi-center study is to collect peripheral blood from newly diagnosed cancer patients and healthy donors to establish a blood cell RNA-based model for the differentiation of cancer patients and healthy donors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity and specificity of the test in the early detection of multiple cancers will be measured.
