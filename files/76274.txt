Study to Evaluate Adverse Events, Change in Disease Activity, and How Intravenously Infused ABBV-291 Moves Through the Body in Adult Participants With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer that arises from the transformation of normal B and T lymphocytes (white blood cells). The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-291 in adult participants in relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL, including but not limited to diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). Adverse events will be assessed.

ABBV-291 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NHL. This study will include a dose escalation phase to determine the maximum administered dose (MAD)/Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABBV-291 and a dose expansion/optimization phase to determine the change in disease activity in participants with R/R NHL. Approximately 165 adult participants with multiple NHL subtypes will be enrolled in the study in sites world wide

In the dose escalation phase of the study participants will receive escalating Intravenously (IV) infused doses of ABBV-291, until the MAD/MTD is determined. In the dose expansion/optimization phase of the study participants receive IV infused ABBV-291, as part of the approximately 74 month study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, and side effects.

DRUG: ABBV-291
Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AE)s, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to 74 Months|Percentage of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)s, DLT events are defined as clinically significant adverse events or abnormal laboratory values assessed as unrelated to disease progression, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications., Up to 74 Months|Percentage of Participants with Clinically Significant Laboratory Values (Chemistry, and Hematology), Percentage of participants with clinically significant laboratory values (chemistry, and hematology)., Up to 74 Months|Percentage of Participants with Clinically Significant Vital Sign Measurements, Vital sign are defined as determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature., Up to 74 Months|Percentage of Participants with Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings, Percentage of participants with clinically significant ECG findings., Up to 74 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of partial response (PR) or better per disease-specific response criteria (e.g., Lugano classification)., Up to 74 Months
Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Investigator, DOR is defined for participants achieving a confirmed PR or better as the time from the initial response of PR (or better) per investigator review according to disease-specific response criteria to disease progression or death of any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Up to 74 Months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as time from first study treatment to a documented disease progression according to disease-specific response criteria, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Up to 74 Months|Time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as time from first study treatment to the initial response of PR (or better) per investigator review according to disease-specific response criteria., Up to 74 Months|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ABBV-291, AUC is defined as the area under the plasma/serum concentration-time curve of ABBV-291., Up to 12 Months|Maximum Observed Plasma/Serum Concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-291, Cmax is defined as maximum observed plasma/serum concentration of ABBV-291., Up to 12 Months|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of ABBV-291, Tmax is defined as time to Cmax of ABBV-291., Up to 12 Months|Half-Life (t1/2) of ABBV-291, t1/2 is defined as the half-life of ABBV-291., Up to 12 Months
