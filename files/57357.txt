First-line Maintenance Treatment With Fluzoparib Plus Bevacizumab in Advanced BRCA Wild Type Ovarian Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II study of fluzoparib combined with bevacizumab for maintenance therapy after first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients with BRCA wild-type advanced ovarian cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate median progression free survival of fluzoparib plus bevacizumab.
