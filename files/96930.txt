Induction Chemotherapy Combined With Immunotherapy for Locally Advanced Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a single-center, multidisciplinary, open-label, single-arm prospective clinical study.
Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma|Immunotherapy|Chemotherapy
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Camrelizumab
Overall Response Rate, The proportion of patients with partial and complete response as defined by RECIST 1.1 after induction therapy, 9 weeks
LPR, Larynx preservation rate, 3 years|PFS, Progression free survival, 3 years|MFS, Metastasis free survival, 3 years|OS, Overall survival, 3 years
In this study, 51 patients with hypohparyngeal carcinoma will be enrolled, These patients who have locally advanced-stage disease, including TNM stage cT3-4aN0-2M0 (AJCC 7th) and require a total laryngectomy as an initial therapy. Patients who achieved a CR or PR at the primary site after three cycles of TPF-regimen chemotherapy combined with immuotherapy will be referred for definitive RT and immuotherapy, while patients who received an evaluation of PD or SD at the primary site were referred for surgery followed by adjuvant RT/CRT.
