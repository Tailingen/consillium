Study of Volrustomig in Women With High Risk Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (eVOLVE-Cervical)
This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global study to explore the efficacy and safety of volrustomig in women with high-risk LACC (FIGO 2018 stage IIIA to IVA cervical cancer) who have not progressed following platinum-based CCRT.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Volrustomig|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS) based on the investigator assessment in all randomized participants (FAS), PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization until RECIST 1.1- defined radiological progression or histopathologically confirmed progression as assessed by the Investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.
Overall Survival (OS) in all randomized participants., OS defined as time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Regarding the demonstration OS in participants, the study duration will be approximately 6 years.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in all randomized participants., ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a CR or PR, as determined by Investigator per RECIST 1.1, The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Duration of Response (DoR) in all randomized participants., DoR in participants with a CR or PR: Time from date of first detection of CR or PR until the date of RECIST 1.1-defined radiological progression or histopathologically confirmed progression., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Time to First Subsequent Therapy or death (TFST) in all randomized participants., TFST: The time from randomization until the start date of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy after discontinuation of randomized treatment, or death due to any cause., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Time to second progression or death (PFS2) in all randomized participants., PFS2: The time from randomization to the earliest of the progression event (following the initial Investigator-assessed progression), after first subsequent therapy, or death. The date of second progression will be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF and defined according to local standard clinical practice., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|PFS by BICR in all randomized participants., Endpoints based on the PFS by BICR assessment according to RECIST 1.1., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|The incidence of local progression, and distant disease progression as the first documented progression event in all randomized participants., Incidence of Local Progression, and Distant Disease Progression: Number and percentage of participants who develop local progression, distant disease recurrence., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|PK of Volrustomig, Concentration of Volrustomig in serum and PK parameters as data allow., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|The immunogenicity of volrustomig, Incidence of ADAs against volrustomig in serum., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Incidence of adverse events of Volrustomig compared to placebo., An AE is defined as the development of any untoward medical occurrence (other than progression of the malignancy under evaluation) in a patient or clinical study participant administered a medicinal product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Participant-reported disease-related symptoms, Change from baseline as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer IL318 (EORTC IL318, Symptom Experience subscale of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Symptom Specific Scale for Cervical Cancer (EORTC QLQ-CX24)). The score of scale for EORTC IL318 is from 1-4., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Participant-reported physical functioning, Change from baseline of physical functioning as measured by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Short Form - Physical Functioning 8c (PROMIS SF-PF 8c). The score of scale for PROMIS SF-PF 8c is from 1-5., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.|Participant-reported global health status/Quality of Life., Change from baseline of Global Health Status/ Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer IL172 (EORTC IL172). The score of scale for EORTC IL172 is from 1-7., The study duration will be approximately 40 months.
Women with locally advanced cervical cancer will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with Volrustomig or Placebo.
