GEMINI-NSCLC: NSCLC Biomarker Study
GEMINI NSCLC Study is a non-interventional study that will be collecting clinical and molecular health information from patients with NSCLC who will receive longitudinal blood collection in addition to their standard of care therapy and disease surveillance with the goals of identifying the molecular evolution of lung cancer with standard of care therapy, and determining the utility of ctDNA dynamics to predict risk of recurrence and therapeutic outcomes.
