A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3474 Injection
This is a study to evaluate the tolerance, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), phase II recommended dose (RP2D), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single and multiple oral doses of TQB3474 in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TQB3474 injection
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Subjects appear the following toxic reaction relate to the drug after treatment within 28 days ：III °or above of non-hematological toxicity, IV° hematological toxicity , III ° neutropenia associated with fever, III ° thrombocytopenia with bleeding., Baseline up to 28 days
