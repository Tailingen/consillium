Cancer Immune Therapy for the Treatment of Refractory Solid Tumours of Childhood
This is an un-blinded Phase 1 study in which 21 patients suffering from solid advanced paediatric malignancies (14 sarcoma and 7 non-sarcoma patients) are treated with AV0113, an anti-tumour immune therapy with autologous Dendritic Cells (DCs) loaded with tumour cell lysates, in order to investigate its safety and feasibility.

For obtaining a clearer picture of AV0113's utility in the treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcoma, a long-term (LT) follow-up investigation of the 14 sarcoma patients, which will be treated using the AV0113 Dendritic Cell Cancer Immune Therapy (DC-CIT) technology is planned, in order to gather first evidence for a potential LT effect of DC-CIT with AV0113.

Furthermore, a comparison of the 14 sarcoma patients treated with AV0113 DC-CIT with a cohort of matched historic control patients that were treated using standard of care will be conducted. It is planned to analyse 42 historic control sarcoma patients that will be matched for disease, recurrences, relapses etc.

Determination of the long-term effect of AV0113 by counting the total survival time in days measured from inclusion time point to death., Total survival time of sarcoma patients, that underwent DC-CIT, measured from the "inclusion time point" (ITP) until death, independent of subsequent surgeries after DC-CIT.

In the treatment group the inclusion time point (ITP) is defined as the day of surgery of the surgically treated relapse immediately before DC-CIT., 15 years|Comparison of total survival times in days of sarcoma patients treated with AV0113 with total survival times of a cohort of matched historic control patients., Total survival time of sarcoma patients, that underwent DC-CIT, measured from the "inclusion time point" (ITP) until death, independent of subsequent surgeries after DC-CIT; in comparison with the survival time of matched historical control patients measured from the ITP until death independent of subsequent surgeries.

In the treatment group the ITP is defined as the day of surgery of the surgically treated relapse immediately before DC-CIT. In the control group the ITP is defined as the time of the surgery performed for the treatment of the xth relapse after which the matching patient of the treatment group received DC-CIT., 15 Years|Comparison of the percentage of treatment patients still alive after 2 years with the percentage of matched historic control patients still alive after 2 years., Percentage of sarcoma patients that underwent DC-CIT with AV0113, still alive after 2 years measured from the ITP independent of subsequent surgeries after DC-CIT; in comparison with the percentage of matched historical control patients still alive after 2 years measured from the ITP, independent of subsequent surgeries.

In the treatment group the ITP is defined as the day of surgery of the surgically treated relapse immediately before DC-CIT. In the control group the ITP is defined as the time of the surgery performed for the treatment of the xth relapse after which the matching patient of the treatment group received DC-CIT., 2 years|Comparison of the percentage of treatment patients still alive after 5 years with the percentage of matched historic control patients still alive after 5 years., Percentage of sarcoma patients that underwent DC-CIT with AV0113, still alive after 5 years measured from the ITP independent of subsequent surgeries after DC-CIT; in comparison with the percentage of matched historical control patients still alive after 5 years measured from the ITP, independent of subsequent surgeries.

In the treatment group the ITP is defined as the day of surgery of the surgically treated relapse immediately before DC-CIT. In the control group the ITP is defined as the time of the surgery performed for the treatment of the xth relapse after which the matching patient of the treatment group received DC-CIT., 5 years|Comparison of the percentage of treatment patients still alive after 10 years with the percentage of matched historic control patients still alive after 10 years., Percentage of sarcoma patients that underwent DC-CIT with AV0113, still alive after 10 years measured from the ITP independent of subsequent surgeries after DC-CIT; in comparison with the percentage of matched historical control patients still alive after 10 years measured from the ITP, independent of subsequent surgeries.

In the treatment group the ITP is defined as the day of surgery of the surgically treated relapse immediately before DC-CIT. In the control group the ITP is defined as the time of the surgery performed for the treatment of the xth relapse after which the matching patient of the treatment group received DC-CIT., 10 years

In this phase I trial 21 paediatric patients with solid tumours of childhood (14 sarcoma and 7 non-sarcoma patients) that have exhausted all conventional treatment options are recruited for the treatment with AV0113.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be obtained from patients by leukocyte apheresis. Monocytes enriched by density gradient centrifugation from MNCs will be used to generate immature DCs by cultivation in recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF). These immature DCs will be loaded with autologous tumour cell lysates obtained by needle biopsy or surgery prior to tumour vaccination.The antigen loaded immature DCs will then receive a final maturation stimulus transmitted by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Maturation enables DCs to present antigen with high efficiency to T-lymphocytes. Subsequently, mature loaded DCs will be injected subcutaneously close to tumour free lymph nodes or intra-nodally into tumour free lymph nodes at weekly intervals for at least 6 weeks.

It is anticipated to establish the feasibility and safety of tumour vaccination in the described clinical setting and to find some clinical and/or experimental evidence for the induction of an anti-tumour immune response.

For obtaining a clearer picture of AV0113's utility in the treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcoma, a long-term (LT) follow-up investigation of the 14 Sarcoma patients, which will be treated using the AV0113 DC-CIT technology is planned, in order to gather first evidence for a potential LT effect of DC-CIT with AV0113.
