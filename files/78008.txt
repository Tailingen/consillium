Study objectives are to enrich the data on the prognostic role of clinical and epidemiological factors associated with clinical and epidemiological data of patients;

* to identify the factors that affect the evolution of the disease, such as lifestyle and occupational factors, as well as the type of treatment;
* to provide a platform for future research projects;
* Description of the various therapies that have occurred over time, duration of treatment, causes of interruption of treatment, responses;
* Description of the adverse events / safety of the various therapies for lymphoma and lymphoproliferative syndromes;
* Patient survival. Descriptive analyses will be conducted by tabulating frequency distributions and percentages and mean and median values, standard deviations, quartiles and extreme values for continuous variables. Progression-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival will be examined using Kaplan-Meier point estimates
