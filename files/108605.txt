Lenalidomide, Rituximab, Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and Dexamethasone in Relapse and Refractory DLBCL
Previous study showed that Lenalidomide or R-GDP could achieve response in Relapse and Refractory DLBCL.The investigators therefore design this phase I study to investigate the safety and efficacy of R2-GOD in relapsed diffuse large-cell lymphoma.
