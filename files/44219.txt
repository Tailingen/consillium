Paclitaxel Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Cancer Patients
The goals of this prospective, observational cohort study are to determine the feasibility of implementing paclitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring for cancer patients and explore the relationship between paclitaxel drug exposure and the development of neuropathic symptoms.

This trial studies if paclitaxel can be consistently measured in the blood of patients with solid tumors undergoing paclitaxel treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Nerve damage is one of the most common and severe side effects of paclitaxel. The ability to consistently measure paclitaxel in the blood may allow doctors to control the dose of paclitaxel, so that enough chemotherapy is given to kill the cancer, but the side effect of nerve damage is reduced.

OTHER: Blood draws|OTHER: QLQ-CIPN20 Survey|OTHER: PR-CTCAE Survey
Proportion of Participants Completing Paclitaxel Infusions, Feasibility will be assessed based on the proportion of patients who complete study blood draws at \>90% of completed Paclitaxel infusions. A completed Paclitaxel infusion is defined as each dose of Paclitaxel that is completed in its entirety. The a priori success rate will be defined as 90% of patients receiving 100% of study blood draws and the null rate will be set at 50%, One day after last infusion dose
Differences in Maximum Plasma Concentration of Paclitaxel from Baseline to Completion, Differences in descriptive characteristics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of the Paclitaxel maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) among patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy according to the physician reported neuropathy CTCAE (Grade II or greater) at baseline and at the end of Paclitaxel treatment., 30 days after completion of chemotherapy treatment|Differences in Time Above Threshold from Baseline to Completion, Differences in descriptive characteristics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of time above threshold (Tc\>0.05) among patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy according to the physician reported neuropathy CTCAE (Grade II or greater) at baseline and at the end of Paclitaxel treatment., 30 days after completion of chemotherapy treatment|Differences in Inflammasome Activation from Baseline to Completion, Differences in inflammasome activation following pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation between patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy according to the physician reported neuropathy CTCAE at baseline and at the end of Paclitaxel treatment., 30 days after completion of chemotherapy treatment|Differences in Inflammatory Cytokine Production from Baseline to Completion, Differences in inflammatory cytokine production following pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation between patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy according to the physician reported neuropathy CTCAE at baseline and at the end of Paclitaxel treatment., 30 days after completion of chemotherapy treatment
Primary Objective:

â€¢ Determine the feasibility of monitoring paclitaxel serum drug levels in patients with a solid tumor (e.g. lung, breast, and gynecologic cancers) for which Paclitaxel is the standard of care.

Secondary Objectives:

* Compare Paclitaxel serum drug levels among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.
* Compare mitochondrial function within circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.
* Compare the ability of pulsed electromagnetic field to modulate immune cells of individuals experiencing differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.
