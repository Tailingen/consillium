Intra- and Inter-fraction Changes in Radiation Therapy
Analysis to quantify intra-fraction, inter-fraction and post-treatment changes in tumor target volumes and surrounding normal organs in radiation therapy.

RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Changes of volumes from baseline of organs at risk during and after radiation therapy., Changes of organs at risk volumes (cm\^3) during and after radiation therapy., 2 years
Changes of volumes from baseline or tumors during and after radiation therapy., Changes of tumor volumes (cm\^3) during and after radiation therapy., 2 years
The accurate and detailed knowledge of the changes (e.g., anatomically/biologically intra- and inter-fraction changes) to be obtained from this study would allow the research team to determine how Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) should be performed for a given tumor site/type. Radiation oncologists then can choose a proper ART strategy for a given tumor type to account for the anatomic/biological intra- and inter-fraction changes, improving accuracy of radiation therapy delivery, and in turn reducing treatment related toxicities and/or improving tumor local control.
