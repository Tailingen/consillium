A Study of CD19 Targeted CAR T Cell Therapy in Pediatric Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B ALL) and Aggressive Mature B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B NHL)
This is a Phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting cluster of differentiation (CD)19 in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B ALL) and r/r B cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B NHL)

This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase Ib study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of obe-cel administered intravenously in pediatric patients with r/r B ALL and with r/r aggressive mature B NHL. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of obe-cel.

The safety and tolerability of obe-cel in pediatric patients will be continually monitored by the Sponsor. Additionally, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review the rolling safety data generated after 6 and 12 treated patients have been monitored for at least 28 days and every 6 months thereafter, and in the event any protocol defined safety stopping criteria are met. If no pre-defined safety events related to obe-cel are met, and the safety data are consistent with what has previously been observed with obe-cel, the IDMC can recommend continuing the study without or with modifications. Based on emerging data, the study may be stopped early due to excessive toxicity, i.e., certain pre-defined obe-cel-related safety events or deaths.

The study will involve consented patients going through the following sequential study periods: screening, leukapheresis, bridging as necessary, lymphodepletion, treatment evaluation, and follow-up.
