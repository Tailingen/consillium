A Biospecimen Collection Study of Leukapheresis-Derived Circulating Tumor Cells, Immune Cells, and Progenitor Cells.
Primary Objective:

This is a study to investigate the feasibility of harvesting, expanding, and selecting T lymphocytes from cancer patients and healthy volunteers. The preliminary objective of this study is aimed at selecting PD-1+ and CTLA4+ T cells and other cellular fractions from peripheral blood of cancer patients and healthy volunteers by using specific conjugated antibodies, evaluating their functional ex vivo anti-tumor cytotoxicity against targeted autologous tumor cells.
