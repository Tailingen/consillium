A Study of GC022F CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for Relapsed or Refractory B- ALL
The study is an early, open, single-centered trial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of GC022F CAR-T cell immunotherapy in relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will include 18 subjects to receive GC022F therapy.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: GC022F
Incidence and severity of treatment related Adverse Events, CRS and Neurotoxicity (Safety and tolerability), Adverse events(AEs) will be collected and graded according to ASTCT consensus(for Cytokine Release Syndrome, CRS and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome, ICANS) and CTCAE v5.0(for AE except CRS/ICANS ), 2 years
CAR copies and concentration of GC022F in peripheral blood, bone marrow and CSF (amplification and persistence), GC022F CAR copies and cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow and CSF will be measured by qPCR and FCM in 2 years, 2 years|Overall response rate of patients who received GC022F infusion (efficacy), Overall response rate will be estimated as the percents of patients who achieved CR or CRi., 2 years|Concentraiton of anti-GC022F antibody after infusion (humoral immune response), After GC022F infusion, GC022F antibody in peripheral blood will be measured in 2 years, 2 years
