Immune System Modulation and Outcome in High-risk cSCC Treated With Surgery and Radiotherapy
Treatment with adjuvant radiotherapy modulates immune system in many diseases as witnessed by dynamic changes of humoral and cellular immunity. Moreover, the persistent lymphopenia after radiation therapy is a negative prognostic factor. This study is aimed to explore the changes in immune-cell populations during radiotherapy given as adjuvant treatment for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and to correlate them with patient's outcome.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
OTHER: Peripheral blood sampling in order to evaluate changes in the circulating immune population
Disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with ALC < 500 cells/mL 28 days after the end of radiotherapy treatment, Disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with ALC \< 500 cells/mL 28 days after the end of radiotherapy treatment, 28 days after the end of radiotherapy treatment
Evaluation of changes (Δ) in the circulating immune-cells population before the start of radiotherapy and 28 days after the end of radiotherapy, Evaluation of changes (Δ) in the circulating immune-cells population before the start of radiotherapy and 28 days after the end of radiotherapy.
