Concurrent Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Trastuzumab in the Treatment of Siewert II ，III of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2(HER-2) Positive Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma： A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Study
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of patients who receive concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for Siewert II ，III of locally advanced HER-2 Positive adenocarcinoma at gastroesophageal junction
Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
The pathological complete response rate(pCR), The lesion disappeared completely by pathology, within 3 weeks after surgery
Overall survival (OS), Baseline to measured date of death from any cause, 3 years|Disease-free survival(DFS), Baseline to measured date of recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of CR or PR or Stable Disease (SD)., 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(mRECIST) v1.1, Objective response referred to participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: greater than or equal to (\>=) 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions taking as reference the screening sum LD. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat assessments that should have been performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol were also appropriate. Cumulative data (up to primary analysis cut-off date of 30-June-2015) are provided for both phase 2 and phase 3 within the results of this measure., within 3 weeks after surgery|Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Improvement in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Module 30 (EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated, cancer-specific 30-item patient-reported measure, and contains 14 domains to assess the impact of cancer treatment on 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 aspects of disease/treatment-related symptoms (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea) and a global QoL/overall health status scale. Questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; with the exception of the QoL/health status scale which uses a 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Each scale is transformed on a scale of 0-100; a higher score equals (=) a better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms. Change of greater than or equal to (\>=) 10-points has been found to be clinically significant. Cumulative data (up to primary analysis cut-off date of 30-June-2015) are provided for both phase 2 and phase 3 within the results of this measure., Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at the study drug completion visit, and thereafter at follow-up|Adverse events, Toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.The number of Participants with adverse events will be recorded at each treatment visit., 3 years
