An Open Label Phase II Trial of BIBW 2992 in Patients With HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992, a dual, irreversible EGFR- and HER2-inhibitor, in two cohorts of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer after failure of no more than three regimen of prior chemotherapy.

DRUG: BIBW 2992
Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0 (RECIST). OR was primary endpoint only for Cohort B., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Clinical Benefit (CB), CB was defined as CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 4 months (modified CB) and was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. CB was primary endpoint only for Cohort A., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Benefit (CB), CB was defined as CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 4 months (modified CB) and was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. CB was secondary endpoint only for Cohort B as it was primary endpoint for Cohort A., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Time to OR, The time to OR was the duration from the first treatment to the time when the measurement criteria for CR and/or PR were met according to RECIST 1.0 criteria., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Duration of OR, Duration of OR was measured from the time the criteria for CR or PR (whichever was documented first) were first met until the first date that progressive disease or death was objectively documented., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first treatment to the occurrence of tumour progression or death, whichever came first. It was assessed according to RECIST 1.0 criteria as well as by the investigators assessment. Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates., Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomisation to death., From randomisation to end of follow-up.|Significant Change in Cardiac Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), LVEF as measured by echocardiography or Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan. MUGA scan is an useful noninvasive tool for assessing the function of the heart. Significant change in LVEF values was defined as \>=20 percent decrease from baseline or to below lower limit of normal, which was defined as 50 percent., Baseline and last assessment|Best Change From Baseline in ECOG Performance Status, Best change from baseline in ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status. ECOG is measured as score between 0 (fully active) and 5 (dead)., baseline till end of treatment|Pre-dose Concentration of Afatinib in Plasma at Steady State on Day 29 (Cpre,ss,29), Cpre,ss,29 represents the pre-dose concentration of afatinib in plasma at steady state on day 29., day 29
