Intra-tumor Injection of Drug-eluting Microspheres With Multiple Drugs
To study the safety and clinical effect of injection of drug-eluting microspheres with multiple chemodrug and/or protein drugs into advanced solid tumors.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: Injection of drug-eluting microspheres with multiple drugs into solid tumors
Assessing safety and treatment efficacy on intra-tumor injection of DEB for advanced tumors, Assessing incidence of side effects and primary clinical response of the intra-tumor injection of DEB in advanced solid cancers, including CR, PR, SD, and PD., up to 36 months
Drug-eluting microspheres such as DC-beads will be loaded with IL2, PD1/PDL1/CTLA4 antibody, or /and VEGF/VEGFR antibody with or without doxorubicin/idarubicin for various time and injected into tumors under CT guidance. Side effects and treatment efficacy after injection of drug-eluting microspheres into malignant tumors will be assessed according to RICEST1.1 standard.
