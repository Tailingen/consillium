Alemtuzumab-Ofatumumab in Previously Untreated Symptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving alemtuzumab and ofatumumab together works in treating patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and ofatumumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Giving alemtuzumab together with ofatumumab may kill more cancer cells
Stage I Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage III Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: alemtuzumab|BIOLOGICAL: ofatumumab|PROCEDURE: biopsy
Best Response as Defined by the iwCLL2008 (International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008), CR= Absence of clonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, significant lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms. Blood counts: Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/μL; Platelets \>100,000μL; Hemoglobin \> 11.0g/dL. Bone marrow normocellular for age, less than 30% of nucleated cells = lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules absent. CRi= Fulfills CR but anemia or thrombocytopenia or neutropenia related to drug toxicity. PR= 2 criteria from group A and 1 from Group B. Group A: Decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes of 50% or more. Reduction in lymphadenopathy. No increase in any lymph node, and no new enlarged lymph node. A decrease in liver by at least 50% from baseline. Decrease in the size of the spleen by 50% or more. Reduction in marrow infiltrate or B-lymphoid nodules. Group B: Platelet counts \> than 100,000/μL or 50% better. Hemoglobin \> than 11.0g/dL or 50% better. Neutrophils\>1500/μL or 50% better. Criteria is continued in Analysis Population Description below..., Range of responses between 8 weeks from initiation of treatment to 2 months post-treatment.
Survival Rates, Survival rates will be calculated for progression-free survival (PFS), therapy-free survival (TFS), and overall survival (OS)., Up to 5 years|Treatment Toxicity as Measured by Adverse Events Experienced While on Treatment, Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17|Correlation of Disease Characteristics With Disease Outcomes, Clinical outcomes (such as response, PFS and TFS) will be correlated with pre-treatment clinical and biological characteristics(such as Rai staging, presence of bulky lymph nodes, cytogenetics by FISH, CD38, ZAP70 and IgVH mutation status)., At baseline and over 18 weeks|Compare Efficacy Between This Study and Historical Control Study of Alemtuzumab-rituximab, Response and survival rates will be compared between the two studies., At baseline and over 18 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab-ofatumumab combination treatment in previously untreated CLL.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously (SC) three times a week in weeks 1-18 and ofatumumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on day 1 of weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
