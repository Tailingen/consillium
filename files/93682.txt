A Retrospective Study of Early Postoperative Mobilization in the Recovery of Patients With Oral Head and Neck Tumors Who Underwent Flap Reconstruction
All patients with head and neck cancers and osteomyelitis who underwent vascularized flap reconstruction at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital (North Campus), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, from February 2020 to July 2021 were the object of a retrospective data collection.Depending on whether they had postoperative early mobilization, all patients were split into experimental and control groups.In the experimental group, patients were split into two groups based on the postoperative day(POD): the POD 0-1 group and the POD \>1 group.Comparison and analysis were done on the difference in hospital days and post-operative complication rates between the two groups.
Length of Hospital Stay
BEHAVIORAL: Early Mobilization
Length of hospital stay after surgery, The time span between the end of surgery and hospital discharge is defined as the length of hospital stay after surgery., February 2020 to July 2021
pulmonary infection rate, The pulmonary infection rate is calculated as the proportion of hospitalized patients who had pulmonary infections over all patients., February 2020 to July 2021|deep vein thrombosis rate, The deep vein thrombosis rate is calculated as the proportion of hospitalized patients who had deep vein thrombosis over all patients., February 2020 to July 2021|flap crisis rate, The flap crisis rate is calculated as the proportion of hospitalized patients who had flap crisis over all patients., February 2020 to July 2021
