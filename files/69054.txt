Multi Peptide Vaccination with XS15 in Addition to Standard Postoperative Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide Chemotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
Newly diagnosed HLA-A2-positive MGMT-methylated glioblastoma patients will be vaccinated with a Multi peptide vaccination with Pam3Cys-GDPKHPKSF (XS15) as an immunomodulator in addition to standard postoperative radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy to assess immunogenicity, efficacy, safety of the combination of multipeptide vaccination and the immune modulator XS15 emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG
Glioblastoma Multiforme of Brain
DRUG: Multipeptide plus XS15
Adevrse Events, The assessment of safety of the IMP will be accomplished by documentation of adverse events and grading according to CTCAE from first vaccination throughout the end of treatment, until 30 days after last vaccination., at 12 months after last vaccination|Change of immunogenicity parameter from baselien, The assessment of immunogenicity is the central biological efficacy endpoint of the clinical trial. Measurements of the induction of T-cell response after vaccination at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days from first vaccination and at 12 months after last vaccinationcompared to baseline as determined by ELISpot, at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days from first vaccination and at 12 months after last vaccination
