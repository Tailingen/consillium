Trial of Using SIB-IMRT in Preoperative Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Rectum Cancer
Pathological complete response, (pCR) correlates with a favorable overall prognosis in locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent preoperative chemoradiation, so obtaining a pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of preoperative SIB-IMRT(56Gy) combine with capecitabine. primary endpoint is pathological complete remission rate.
Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: conventional fraction|RADIATION: SIB
• Pathological complete remission rate (pCR), after pathological examination of surgical speciments (6-8 weeks after chemoradiation)
Number of participants with adverse events (according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), Acute toxicities will be assessed every week during chemoradiation period , one week before surgery(6 weeks after chemoradiation) and every 3 months after surgery for 2 years.Late toxicities will be assessed every 6 months from the 3rd year for 3 years.Adverse eventswill be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), during preoperative treatment and after surgery for 5 years
• Disease-free survival, Followup will be done every 3 months in first 2 years, and every 6 months after 2 years., 3 year afte concurrent chemoradiation
