Pathogenesis of Postoperative Infections and Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of it
Infections remain a prevalent complication after major abdominal surgery. The common belief that most surgical site infections (SSIs) following elective surgery with modern antiseptic techniques are due to intraoperative contamination is still not confirmed. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for SSI development, such as the Trojan Horse theory-which suggests that pathogens from distant sites like the gastrointestinal tract may cause postoperative infections-should be explored. This study aims to analyze the preoperative microbiome of surgical patients' gut and oral cavities and assess whether microorganisms found there are present at the infection site. Additionally, this study will investigate a panel of biomarkers for predicting postoperative infections.

Infections remain a significant concern following major abdominal surgery. The prevailing notion that most surgical site infections (SSIs) after elective surgery with modern antiseptic techniques are solely caused by intraoperative contamination remains unconfirmed. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for SSI development, such as the Trojan Horse theory-which suggests that pathogens from distant sites like the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to postoperative infections-require thorough investigation. This longitudinal observational study aims to either support or challenge the Trojan Horse theory.

This study will enroll patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for confirmed or suspected cancer. Biological samples from stool, the oral cavity, and infection sites will be collected for sequencing and microbiome analysis to evaluate the presence of pathogens potentially responsible for postoperative infections originating from the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, blood samples will be collected to identify predictive biomarkers associated with the development of postoperative infections.
