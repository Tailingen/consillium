This is a phase I/II open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib in patients with advanced solid tumors, selected based on a rationale for response to olaparib.

Patients will be poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor and immunotherapy (IMT)-naïve (defined as no prior exposure to PARP inhibitors or IMT, including, but not limited to, other anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \[CTLA-4\], anti-programmed cell death 1 \[PD-1\], anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] monoclonal antibodies, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).

The 4 initial stage cohorts (Modules 1 to 4) include patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer. The data cut-off occurred once all 4 Modules had reached last patient first visit (LPFV) + 2 years and all 4 cohorts had observed a median value for PFS.

Second stage cohorts (Modules 5 to 7) include patients with relapsed gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer and non gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. The final data cut-off will be once Modules 6 and 7 have observed a median value for overall survival. At this timepoint, the clinical study database will close to new data.
