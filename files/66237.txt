Frequency and nature of ADRs on the Naranjo Scale, Patients will be referred to the Texas A\&M Interprofessional Pharmacogenomics Clinic (IPGx) by their primary care physicians. A physician or ambulatory pharmacist in the IPGx clinic or Family Care Clinic will obtain a complete medical history, physical examination, and validate the patient's current concomitant medication list at the IPGx during the office visit. Patient medical information would be input into the CSN, which functions as a computable EHR medical record analysis, evaluation of polypharmacy status, and monitoring of Adverse Drug Reactions using the Naranjo Scale questionnaire will be conducted for the duration of the study., 5 years
Serum/plasma drug concentrations, Patients will be referred to the Texas A\&M Interprofessional Pharmacogenomics Clinic (IPGx) by their primary care physicians for an evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) assessments. For drug level measurement, urine samples will be collected using provided kits and shipped to the contracted laboratory via FedEx in biosafety shipping containers., 5 years
Pharmacogenomic genotype with corresponding ADR phenotype, Patients will be referred to the Texas A\&M Interprofessional Pharmacogenomics Clinic (IPGx) by their primary care physicians to evaluate genotyping and ADR. Clinical staff will obtain a buccal swab to collect DNA for a pharmacogenomic evaluation pursuant to the sample collection kits from the CLIA lab, which will occur at the start of the study period., 5 years|Drug-drug interactions, drug gene interactions, drug-drug-gene interactions, An assessment at the IPGx begins with a consultation by a pharmacist or physician. They will evaluate the medications and other drugs the patient is currently using, identifying any potential issues related to toxicity, drug interactions, or side effects that may be relevant to the patient's clinical presentation., 5 years
This study wants to understand how genes can affect how the body responds to medicines. This information will help us determine whether changing your medicine can make you healthier and improve your life. We will study your medical history for the last year and the next five years after you join the study.

study goals include:

* Enrolling patients who take multiple medications or have harmful side effects from their medications.
* Keeping all medical information and genetic samples from patients in one place.
* Helping doctors make better decisions about which medicines to prescribe.
* Influencing insurance companies and the government to help pay for this kind of medical care for people who need to change their medicine to stay healthy.
