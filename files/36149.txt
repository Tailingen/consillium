Nimotuzumab Combined With Nab-paclitaxel/Gemcitabine in the Perioperative Treatment of High-risk Resectable/Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Nimotuzumab combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) in the perioperative treatment of high-risk resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer, Adult
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: AG regimen|DRUG: Placebo
disease-free survival (DFS), The time from the date of surgery to the disease recurrence or death, whichever is earlier., Up to 24 months
overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause., Up to 24 months|R0 resection rate, Pathologic review will determine if an R0 resection has been performed. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed., within 30 days after surgery|Surgical Resection rate, Patients who undergo surgical resection will be documented., within 30 days after surgery|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Up to 9 weeks during the neoadjuvant treatment]|adverse events, Frequency and severity of adverse events., Up to 30 days after last administration
This clinical study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Nimotuzumab combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) in the perioperative treatment of high-risk resectable/borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. About 156 patients will be enrolled in this study and randomly divided into experimental group (nimotuzumab plus AG) and control group (placebo plus AG) at a ratio of 1:1. The main endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Additional end points include overall survival (OS), R0 resection rate, preoperative objective response rate (ORR), postoperative complications and safety, etc.
