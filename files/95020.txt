An Adaptive Open-label Multicentre Phase 1/2 Trial, to Determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose of CCTx-001, and to Assess Safety, Tolerability, and Clinical Activity in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
The purpose of this adaptive Phase 1/2 study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antileukemic activity of CCTx-001 in adult patients with r/r Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). CCTx-001 targets IL-1RAP, which is specifically expressed in leukemic cells. In preclinical studies, IL-1RAP-targeted Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have demonstrated encouraging activity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments in AML models. Based on these promising preclinical results, it is expected that CCTx-001 could potentially alter the natural course of r/r AML and provide a potential novel treatment option.
