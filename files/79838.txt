Icaritin Soft Capsule Combined With Lenvatinib and TACE for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The investigators design a phase II clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) + Lenvatinib + Icaritin soft capsules in patients with Unresectable, non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: TACE（transcatheter arterial chemoembolization）|DRUG: lenvatinib|DRUG: Icaritin soft capsules
Objective Response Rate, It was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in all patients, and the treatment response was based on the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist1.1), 48 weeks
progression-free survival, It was defined as the time from successful hepatectomy to recurrence. Patients who withdraw or lose follow-up will be treated as deletion, 96 weeks|Overall Survival, It was defined as the time from the beginning of treatment to death from any cause throughout the trial. Patients who dropped out or lost follow-up will be treated as deletion, and the known last survival date will be regarded as the last survival time. Patients who survived at the end of the study will also be treated as deletions, and the last known date of survival will be taken as the final survival time, 96 weeks|Disease Control Rate, It was defined as the Proportion of all subjects receiving study therapy who rated complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) as best overall response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., 48 weeks|Duration of Response, It was defined as the period from the date when tumor response was first recorded (as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria) to the date when objective tumor progression was first recorded (as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria) or the date of death from any cause., up to 48 weeks|adverse event, The incidence, severity, and serious adverse events associated with medication use were determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0 standards, 96 weekes
This is a single-center, open-label, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial. We adopted the prospective cohort study to explore the safety and efficacy of Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) + Lenvatinib + Icaritin soft capsules in the patients with Unresectable, non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

It is estimated that 20 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data monthly to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall survival and time to progression. Multi-omics data analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.
