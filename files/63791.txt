The Value Of Circulating Tumor Cells In Patient With NSCLC In Postoperative Recurrence Monitoring
The purpose of this study is to assess the value of circulating tumor cells (CTC)for non-small cell lung cancer in the postoperative recurrence monitoring by comparing the CTCs, CT and tumor markers at different time points.The time of CTC and carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) detection is baseline, 2\~7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months after the surgery. And the time of CT detection is 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months after the surgery.
Non-small-cell Lung Carcinoma
Circulating tumor cells will be detected by Immunomagnetic negative screening and targeted PCR method., 3 years
carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) concentration will be detected by electrochemical luminescence., 3 years|Liconography using conventional CT examination results., 3 years
