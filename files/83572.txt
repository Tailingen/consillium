Oral Cancer With Wide Excision and Free Flap Reconstruction
A proactive speech-language pathologist program can be successfully established as part of the multidisciplinary care of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and improve patient quality of life.
Head and Neck Cancer
PROCEDURE: swallow fuction and swallow training
nasogastric tube dependence rate, nasogastric tube dependence rate, 2 years
Head and neck cancer treatment has developed over the last decade, with improved mortality and survival rates, but the treatments often result in dysphagia (a difficulty in swallowing) as a side effect. Swallowing function is affected by the tumor itself, surgical resection of the lesion and neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. It is well accepted that pre-treatment swallow function is indicative of post-treatment status and is helpful in identifying patients with high risk of aspiration and dysphagia. In recent years, the concept of "use it, or lose it" has been widely advocated by specialists. Preventive swallowing rehabilitation including evaluation patient's swallowing function and propose rehabilitation and adaptive maneuver or change in food texture. The aim is to ensure safe swallowing and prevent deglutitive muscles from deconditioning. Moreover, aspiration can be prevented and adequate nutrition was maintained through the cancer treatment course. Investigators include patients with advanced oral cavity cancer who were treated by radical operation and free flap reconstruction, and provided them with preventive swallowing rehabilitation. Investigators then analyze the swallowing function, oral intake status, and nasogastric tube dependence rate and tracheostomy tube dependence rate.The participants received interventions as part of our routine medical care, and Investigators studied the effect of the intervention.
