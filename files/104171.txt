CD45RA Depleted Peripheral Stem Cell Addback for Viral or Fungal Infections Post TCRαβ/CD19 Depleted HSCT
The major morbidities of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched siblings are graft vs host disease (GVHD) and life threatening infections. T depletion of the donor hematopoietic stem cell graft is effective in preventing GVHD, but immune reconstitution is slow, increasing the risk of infections. An addback of donor CD45RA (naive T cells) depleted cells may improve immune reconstitution and help decrease the risk of infections.

The risk of severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) is increased with the use of unrelated and partially matched related donors. T cell depletion reduces the risk of severe GVHD, but immune reconstitution is delayed. Important memory T cells that may protect patients from fungal and viral infections are also removed in the T depletion process. CD45RA depletion has been studied both as a single step to reduce the risk of GVHD, and also, in conjunction with αβTCR depleted hematopoietic stem cell grafts to accelerate immune reconstitution. This is a single institutional pilot trial of this T cell depletion technique. Patients with acute leukemias at high risk for relapse are eligible to participate. Patients will be given CD45RA depleted donor peripheral stem cells (PSCs) following T depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). A short course of GVHD prophylaxis will be used after CD45RA depletion.
