Endoscopic Resection of Gastrointestinal Neoplasms
The study aims to retrospectively investigate the endoscopic resection procedures of cancerous and precancerous lesions of the upper and lower digestive tract in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes and to compare different resection techniques. In particular, the resection techniques investigated will be mucosectomy, en bloc and piecemeal, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and its variants, full-thickness resection. The anatomical districts involved will be the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon and rectum.

PROCEDURE: Endoscopic resection
en bloc resection rate, the en bloc resection is the ability to remove the neoplasia in a single piece, one month|complete resection rate, the complete resection is the ability to remove the neoplasia with clear margins (R0), one month|recurrence rate, recurrence is the recurrence of the neoplasm at the resection site during follow-up, one year
adverse events rate, complication rate, early or late, related to the procedure used for endoscopic resection, one month|costs, evaluation of the costs incurred to perform the endoscopic resection, one month
