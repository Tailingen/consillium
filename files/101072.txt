Adipocytokines in Endometrial Cancer
Endometrial cancer incidence rates were increasing in the past two decades with a continuous rising trend in Taiwan. Uterine cancer was attributable to obesity based on their association with excess body weight in most epidemiological cohort studies. However, the prevalence of obesity was lower in Taiwan.Therefore, we will study if adipose tissues depots in different locations of body could reflect or correlate the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Excise adipose tissue
Adipocytokines profile, Adipocytokines including leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, resistin, omentin, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFNγ, During operation
Besides lipid metabolism, adipose tissue plays import roles in regulation of hormones, adipokines, cytokines and immunocytes. Adipose tissue is now known as endocrine organ which to express and secrete a variety of bioactive peptides, known as adipokines. We will evaluate the difference various adipocytokines between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues between women with benign lesions and endometrial cancer. We will study the inter-individual differences in adipocytokines between two types of adipose tissues and their correlation with image quantification.
