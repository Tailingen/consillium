Study Comparing Piperacillin-tazobactam Versus Piperacillin-tazobactam Plus Glycopeptide in Neutropenic Patients
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerance of piperacillin-tazobactam versus piperacillin-tazobactam plus glycopeptide as initial empiric antibiotic treatment for fever in neutropenic patients. Study of consecutive cohorts(2). First the patients will be included in the monotherapy branch until completing the predicted number of cases. When this happens, the Coordinating Center will communicate it to the participant centers and from then the patients will be included in the combined therapy.
