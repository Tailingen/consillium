Study of GO-203-2C Given Intravenously in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Including Lymphomas
This clinical trial is about testing GO-203-2c, which is a newly discovered compound that binds to an oncoprotein (a cancer causing protein) called MUC1 (which is over-expressed in many cancers). By binding to MUC1, GO-203-2c eventually causes tumor cell death in laboratory studies.

This study is being done to:

* Test the safety of GO-203-2c and see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer
* Find the highest dose of GO-203-2c that can be given without causing bad side effects
* Examine how much GO-203-2c is in the blood at certain times after it is given and how quickly the body gets rid of it
* Observe whether there is any effect of GO-203-2c on the size and activity of cancer in your body
