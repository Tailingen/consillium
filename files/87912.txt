A Study of Pralsetinib Versus Standard of Care (SOC) for Treatment of RET-Mutated Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC).
A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pralsetinib compared with SOC treatment (cabozantinib or vandetanib) for participants with RET (rearranged during transfection)-mutant MTC who have not previously received a SOC MultiKinase Inhibitor (MKI) therapy. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment arms: Arm A (pralsetinib) or Arm B (investigator's choice of either cabozantinib or vandetanib for adults and vandetanib for adolescents). Participants whose disease progresses during SOC treatment will be offered the option to cross over to receive pralsetinib after confirmation of progressive disease by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Medullary Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Pralsetinib|DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Vandetanib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization date to the first documented PD (Progression of Disease), as assessed by BICR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years
