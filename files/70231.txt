Characterizing Breast Cancer With 18F-FES PET/CT
18F-fluoroestradiol (FES) is radioactive labeled estradiol, developed for in vivo visualization of estrogen receptor (ER) using positron emission tomography (PET). In this prospective study, 18F-FES PET/CT will be used to evaluate ER activity of metastatic disease and their potential sensitivity to endocrine therapy in ER-positive breast cancer.
