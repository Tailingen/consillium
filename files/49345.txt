Cancer Survivor Cardiomyopathy Detection
The purpose of this study is to improve the cardiovascular care of adult cancer survivors. The goal is to obtain the data necessary to plan and develop a nation-wide network of a screening program that can help provide cost-effective and long-term monitoring.

The primary objective of this study is to define the diagnostic performance and optimal cutoffs of AI-ECG and NT-pro-BNP for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction \[LVD, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \<50%\] in cancer patients at 1 year after completion of anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
