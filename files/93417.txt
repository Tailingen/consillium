Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus
Current therapies for Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus.
Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease or Not Evaluable, Objective response rate per The International Working Group response criteria (1999): Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all disease sustained for at least four weeks; Partial Response (PR), \>=50% decrease in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, sustained for at least four weeks. Stable Disease (SD), \< 50% change in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, sustained for at least twelve weeks., 59 months
Esophageal cancer patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with esophageal cancer, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Esophageal Cancer.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination, and radiologic studies performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
