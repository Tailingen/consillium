Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Vemurafenib in Combination With Cobimetinib (Continuous and Intermittent) in BRAFV600-mutation Positive Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different schedules of administration of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib (continuous and intermittent) in previously untreated BRAFV600- mutation positive patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.
