Phase 1b Trial of BGJ398/BYL719 in Solid Tumors
To study the safety and efficacy of the combination of BGJ398 with BYL719 in patients whose tumors express mutations to PIK3CA with or without alterations to FGFR 1-3.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: BGJ398|DRUG: BYL719
Incidence rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of BGJ398 with BYL719, The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a well-established statistical method/model to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(s) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Safety(incidence and nature of DLTs), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data will guide dose escalation decisioins., Approximately 8 months
Safety and tolerability of BGJ398/BYL719 combination at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE), This will be assessed by looking at the number of Adverse Events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), dose interruptions and reductions, Every 28 days from baseline visit until end of study visit|Overall response rate, Assessment of preliminary antitumor activity of the combination of BGJ398 with BYL719; Overall response rate = complete response + partial response, Every two months from the date of baseline CT scan|Progression free survival, Assessment of preliminary antitumor activity of the combination of BGJ398 with BYL719, Every two months from the date of baseline CT scan|Time vs. concentration profile of BGJ398 and BYL719, Plasma concentration versus time profiles. Plasma PK parameters will be used to characterize the PK profiles of the combination of BGJ398 with BYL719, Every 28 days for up to 10 cycles
This dose escalation/dose expansion study will evaluate the combination of orally administered BGJ398 in combination with orally administered BYL719. During the dose escalation part, the MTD of the combination will be determined in patients whose advanced or metastatic tumors express mutations to PIK3CA. Once the MTD has been determined, the expansion part will begin. Patients will be addd to one of three arms based on the disease type and genetic changes. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are not eligible for participation in the expansion part.
