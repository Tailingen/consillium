Predictors and Outcomes of Dysglycemia in Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
The investigators will retrospectively analyze the clinical data of consecutive patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas admitted between January 2018 and June 2020. The clinical characteristics of patients with and without dysglycemia will be compared, and whether surgery could improve the patients'dysglycemia will be also investigated.

Change from baseline OGTT（oral glucose tolerance test）results to 6-12 months after surgery, OGTT results （including fasting blood glucose in the text, blood glucose results at 2 hours after oral administration of 75g glucose）at baseline and 6-12 months after surgery will be recorded to assess the effect of surgery on dysglycemia, Baseline, 6-12 months after surgery

This retrospective cohort study will include all consecutive adult patients who underwent surgery for PHEOs and catecholamine-secreting PGLs from January 2018 to June 2020. Patients with recurrent PPGLs, those who required steroids after adrenalectomy, and those with inadequate clinical records were excluded. The patients' electronic medical files were reviewed. Patients with dysglycemia included those with diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance. Clinical history data such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the presence of preoperative symptoms, biochemical test results, and tumor characteristics, such as tumor diameters and locations were extracted and analyzed.
