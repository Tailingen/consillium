A Phase I/II Dose Escalation Study Using Extracranial Stereotactic Radiosurgery to Control Pain
This study will evaluate pain control and quality of life in patients with paraspinal metastases, who have receive previous radiation therapy to these lesions, using single dose stereotactic radiotherapy.
Metastases
RADIATION: Stereotactic radiotherapy
Optimal Dose of Stereotactic Spinal Irradiation Needed to Obtain Durable Pain Control at 4 Weeks in a Previously Irradiated Spine Field, Optimal dose

1. the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that will result in a 10% ESRT-induced neurological complications
2. the minimal dose level that can achieve an 80% or more pain control rate, whichever occurs first, 4 weeks
Duration of Pain Control for Each Dose Level., A reduction in pain, referable to the site of the spine lesion, by \>=30% according to the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), or a smaller decrease in pain accompanied by a reduction of pain medications., 4 years|Determine the Rate of Radiation-induced Myelopathy From Stereotactic Re-irradiation of the Spinal Metastases., 4 weeks|Determine the Pattern of Failure After Stereotactic Irradiation of Spinal Metastases., 4 years|Quality of Life, As measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Central Nervous System (FACT-CNS)

Participant can chose on a scale of 0-4 with 0=not at all and 4=very much., 4 years
The goal of the study is to determine the lowest dose of radiation that can be given to effectively control the tumor and provide effective pain relief.
