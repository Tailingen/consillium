A Study to Evaluate Treatment With Nivolumab Alone and Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab in Children With Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to describe real-world safety outcomes in children with melanoma who are treated with nivolumab alone or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, or treated with adjuvant nivolumab after resection of stage IIB-IV melanoma. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns, will also be described in this population.
