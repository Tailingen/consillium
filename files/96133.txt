To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TheraSphereTM yttrium \[90Y\] glass microsphere in the Chinese patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.
Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: TheraSphereâ„¢ Yttrium-90 Glass Microspheres|PROCEDURE: conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization(cTACE)
Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) Definition of progression: Progressive Disease (PD) assessment occurs according to mRECIST occurs according to mRECIST, through study completion, an average of 18 months|Safety assessed within 60 days post treatment using NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Safety assessed within 60 days post treatment using NCI-CTCAE v5.0, within 60 days post treatment
Hepatic time to progression (hTTP) determined by localized mRECIST (within the treated area), through study completion, an average of 18 months|Objective response rate (ORR) of the index lesion according to localized mRECIST (within the treatment area), through study completion, an average of 18 months|Confirmed ORR according to mRECIST, through study completion, an average of 18 months|OS (Overall Survival), through study completion, an average of 18 months|Safety assessed using NCI-CTCAE v 5.0, Safety assess: to standardize reporting, the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTCAE), version 5, was used to grade AEs and SAEs. Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 represented mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening toxicity, respectively. Grade 5 represented toxicity resulting in death. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess the safety in each grade and summarized as the number of events and rate per subject., through study completion, an average of 18 months|Procedure technical success, Procedure technical success is determined successfully if all three items are satisfied at the same time during the operation as follow:

* Device connected successfully or not;
* Microspheres or anti-neoplastic agent(s) (i.e. cisplatin), lipiodol and embolic agent(s). deliver to target area well, or not by device parts;
* There was no unplanned release of radiation or leakage of neoplastic agent(s) (i.e. cisplatin), lipiodol and embolic agent(s), or not by device parts., immediately after the procedure
