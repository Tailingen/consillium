Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors With TP53 Mutations Register Study
The efficacy and safety of the PARP inhibitor in combination with the VEGFR inhibitor will be investigated in advanced refractory solid tumors patients with TP53 mutation .
Solid Tumor, Adult
OTHER: Data Collection
ORR(Objective Response Rate), ORR is the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR). Response categories: CR, PR, SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease) Criteria on which physicians determined therapy response also will be captured by using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 to evaluate., Up to three months
PFS (Progression Free Survival), calculated from various time points, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as progression free survival of all the evaluable participants who receive targeted drug therapy. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1)., Up to two years|OS (Overall Survival), calculated from various time points, OS is defined as time from initiation to death of any cause., Duration of time from the start of treatment to date of death, assessed up to two years|ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction), Adverse events determined according to CTCAE (version 4.03)., 30 days after last dose
TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. Multiple studies have demonstrated that TP53 mutations are poor prognostic factor in advanced solid tumor, the TP53 gene is frequently inactivated by mutation in a majority of human tumors. However, no effective TP53 -based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment. So, investigators intend to review and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PARP inhibitor in combination with the VEGFR inhibitor for TP53 mutation in advanced refractory solid tumors patients from a real-world population.
