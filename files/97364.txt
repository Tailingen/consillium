Cognition in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplanted Patients and Sports
Studies suggest that patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for cognitive decline and long-term cognitive dysfunction. To address this issue, a randomized controlled intervention trial on the effect of physical exercise on cognition is conducted. In addition, the impact on psychological and physical health outcomes is evaluated. Results may benefit patients who suffer from disease- or treatment-associated cognitive change.

Studies suggest that patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at risk for cognitive decline and long-term cognitive dysfunction. To address this issue, a randomized controlled intervention trial on the effect of physical exercise on cognition is conducted. In addition, the impact on psychological and physical health outcomes such as depression, fatigue, health-related quality of life and physical fitness is evaluated. A healthy control group matched to the patients on age, gender, and education will be included to both control for practice effects on neuropsychological measures and allow additional comparisons on self-report measures. The healthy control group will undergo neuropsychological testing and questionnaire survey at baseline and 4 months. Demographic data will be collected from all study participants at baseline. Medical data will be collected from patients at all time points. Results may benefit patients who suffer from disease- or treatment-associated cognitive change.
