Anti-CD7 CAR-T Cell Therapy for Relapse and Refractory CD7 Positive T Cell Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell treatment targeting CD7 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD7 positive T-cell hematological maliganacies
T Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma|T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma|Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: anti-CD7 CAR-T cells
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The occurence of study related adverse effects defined by NCI CTCAE5.0, 28 days post infusion
CAR-T cell expansion, Using flow cytometry to reveal cell surface expression of the CAR protein on T cells;and using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect DNA copies of the transgene irrespective of gene expression(per ug DNA) to evaluate anti-CD7 CAR-T cell expansion after infusion, 2 years post infusion|CAR-T cell persistence, Using flow cytometry to reveal cell surface expression of the CAR protein on T cells;and using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect DNA copies of the transgene irrespective of gene expression(per ug DNA) to evaluate anti-CD7 CAR-T cell persistence after infusion, 2 years post infusion|Number of CD7+ lymphocytes of peripheral blood, To evaluate CD7 positive cells of peripheral blood after infusion, 2 years post infusion|Total response rate (ORR) after administration, CR+CRi for T-ALL ;CR+PR for T cell lyphoma and T lymphoblastic lymphoma, 3 months post infusion|Duration of remission (DOR) after administration, Duration of remission (DOR) after administration, 2 years post infusion|Overall survival(OS) after administration, Overall Survival (OS)after administration, 2 years post infusion|Progression Free Survival (PFS) after administration, Progression Free Survival (PFS) after administration, 2 years post infusion
Immunogenicity of CAR-T cells, Using flow cytometry to detect whether anti-car antibodies are contained in serum of patients receiving CAR-T cells infusion,and to evaluate the number of participants with antibodies, 2 years post infusion
This study is single-armed，open lable，dose escalation clinical trial.The main purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD7 CAR-T cells in relapsed/refractory patients with CD7 positive T cell malignancies,including T lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia ,T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma(peripheral T cell lymphoma,NOS,angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma).There will be three CAR T cell dose groups:0.25\*10\^6 cells per kilogram of body weight;0.5\*10\^6 cells per kilogram of body weight，1 \*10\^6 ells per kilogram of body weight.
