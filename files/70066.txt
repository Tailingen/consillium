Phase I Clinical Trial of Autologous CD7-CAR T Cell Therapy for High-risk Acute T-cell Leukemia/lymphoma
This is a phase 1 clinical trial of autologous CD7-CAR T cells in the treatment of high-risk acute T-cell leukemia / lymphoma. Twenty subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be pretreated with chemotherapy prior to infusion of CAR T cells: about 3 days before cells transfusion, the patients who planned to reinfuse CAR T cells were treated with fluorodarabine 30 mg/m2( body surface area) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2( body surface area) for 3 days. Then this study will be using a 3+3 dose escalation approach from dose 1 (DL-1): 5×105 (±20%) to dose 2 (dl-2): 1×106 (±20%). Below the lowest dose was reinfused at the PI's discretion.
