Clinical Evaluation of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 in Various Solid Tumors With Integrin αvβ3 Positive Expression
This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to assess the therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 in patients with various solid tumors who will undergo radioligand therapy using 177Lu-AB-3PRGD.
Refractory Solid Tumor
DRUG: 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 radioligand therapy
Objective response rate (ORR), 68Ga-RGD will be performed for efficacy evaluation by RECIST 1.1. Particularly, 68Ga-RGD will be performed at baseline, and 6 weeks after two treatment cycles., At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 42 days)
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (safety and tolerability), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2-related AE ≥ grade 3 (G3). For Hemoglobin \< 8.0 g/dL; \< 4.9 mmol/L; \< 80 g/L; Need blood transfusion heal. Severe hypocytosis or with this age group The total number of normal cells was reduced \>50% and ≤75%., At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 42 days)
Integrin αvβ3 is highly expressed in some tumor cells and neovascularization, which is an ideal target for diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors. 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2, is a kind of new drug based on independent research and development in China, providing an effective target for the treatment of tumors. All patients underwent whole-body 68Ga-RGD PET/CT for selection and accepted intravenous injection with a fixed dose of 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 within one week. Treatment is planned for up to 4 cycles, and the time interval between cycles is 6 weeks. The primary endpoint assessed the preliminary treatment efficacy of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2 used for radioligand therapy in patients with various advanced tumors. The secondary endpoint evaluates the safety of 177Lu-AB-3PRGD2.
