Clinical Trial Evaluating the Combination of Vandetanib and Dasatinib During and After Radiation Therapy (RT) in Children With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)
This is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the combination of vandetanib and dasatinib during and after radiation therapy (RT) in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
DRUG: vandetanib and dasatinib
To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of vandetanib and dasatinib administered concurrently with RT in pediatric research participants with newly diagnosed DIPG, April 2012
To determine the toxicities associated with the chronic use of vandetanib and dasatinib, July 2012|To characterize the pharmacokinetics of vandetanib and dasatinib in pediatric research participants, July 2012|To evaluate the influence of specific polymorphisms (e.g., CYP3A4/5) on the pharmacokinetics of vandetanib and dasatinib administered in combination, July 2012|To explore the association between plasma angiogenic factors and response to current therapy, July 2012|To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of dasatinib in target receptors and pathways in peripheral mononuclear cells, July 2012|To describe the research participants' and parents' perspective of the quality of life of children with newly diagnosed DIPG enrolled on this phase I trial, July 2012|To describe the quality of life of parents of pediatric research participants with newly diagnosed DIPG enrolled on this phase I trial, July 2012
This trial will estimate the maximum safe dose of vandetanib and dasatinib which can be administered during the 6 weeks of local RT in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.
