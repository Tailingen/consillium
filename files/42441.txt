Dose Escalation, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of AVE8062 Combined With Cisplatin in Patients With Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity and the maximum administered dose of ombrabulin in combination with cisplatin administered every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the overall safety profile of the combination therapy.
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ombrabulin, its active metabolite RPR 258063, and cisplatin in combination.
* To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy.

The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 4-week screening phase, 21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit and a follow-up period 30 days after the last infusion of ombrabulin. The patient will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal of further treatment.
