An Exploratory Study of Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Oral Formulation (D07001-F4) in Subjects With Malignant Tumors
Open-label, Phase 0, dose-escalation study of 3 successive cohorts (3 subjects per cohort), to determine and characterize the plasma PK of gemcitabine HCl oral formulation (D07001-F4) administered once on Day 1 with 7 Days of study follow-up. In addition, oral tolerability and safety will also be assessed during this 1-week period.
