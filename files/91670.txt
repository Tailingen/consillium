Effects of Dexamethasone on Common Bile Duct Cannulation Time
The main aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on common bile duct cannulation time during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with biliary pathologies. The study will also study the effects of dexamethasone on total procedure time and total fluoroscopy time during ERCP.

Participants will be divided into two groups, treatment group and placebo group. Patients in treatment group will receive dexamethasone and those in placebo group will be given normal saline before undergoing ERCP. The results in both groups will be compared to determine the effects of dexamethasone.

Shortening of CBD cannulation time, To determine the effects of dexamethasone on shortening of CBD cannulation time, CBD cannulation time will be calculated from the start of the procedure (0 minutes) till complete CBD cannulation has been achieved through catheter and confirmed by fluoroscopy or procedure abandoned if unsuccessful cannulation by 30 minutes.
