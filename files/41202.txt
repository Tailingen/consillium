PCI and Brain MRI Follow-up vs Brain MRI Follow-up Alone in Limited-stage SCLC Patients
At present, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is part of standard care for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have achieved good response after definitive thoracic radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the value of PCI is being challenged in the era when MRI examination of brain has been popularized.

The goal of this clinical study is to compare PCI and regular brain MRI follow-up (control arm) and regular brain MRI follow-up alone (study arm) in patients with limited-stage SCLC who have received definitive radiotherapy and chemotherapy and acheived complete remission (CR) of tumor.

The main questions to answer are:

1. Whether the 2-year brain metastasis-free survival rate of the study group is not inferior to that of the control group.
2. The difference of 2-year overall survival rate between the control group and the study group.
3. Whether the patients in the study group have better overall quality of life than those in the control group.

Participants will randomly receive either PCI and regular brain MRI follow-up or regular brain MRI follow-up alone.

2-year brain metastasis-free survival estimated with kaplan-Meier method, To test with a one-sided significance of 5% whether for the treatment of limited-stage SCLC patients, brain MRI follow-up alone is non-inferior in terms of 2-year brain metastasis-free survival compared to PCI and brain MRI follow-up. Participants were monitored for up to 2 years. The brain metastasis-free survival time is defined as the time between the date of the first treatment until the date of first documented diagnosis of brain metastasis or the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years
2-year overall survival estimated with kaplan-Meier method, To compare 2-year overall survival between patients who receive brain MRI follow-up alone and those who receive both PCI and brain MRI follow-up, with kaplan-Meier estimates. Participants were monitored for up to 2 years. The overall survival time is defined as the time between the date of the first treatment until the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Intra-cranial progressive patterns, To compare the intra-cranial progressive patterns between patients who receive brain MRI follow-up alone and those who receive both PCI and brain MRI follow-up within 2 years. Intra-cranial progression is evaluated via the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. In this study, Intra-cranial progressive disease is defined as the new lesions developed in the brain., Up to 2 years
