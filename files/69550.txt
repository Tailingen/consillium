Change in cancer therapy functional assessment, Cancer therapy functional assessment scores will be assessed with Cancer Therapy Functional Assessment-Breast cancer, version 4.The minimum value is 0 , and the maximum value is 185. The higher scores mean a worse outcome., Baseline, 8,24 weeks later|Change in acupuncture efficacy expectation assessment, Acupuncture efficacy expectation assessment scores will be assessed with acupuncture efficacy expectation assessment. The minimum value is 0 , and the maximum value is 20. The higher scores mean a better outcome., Baseline, 8,24 weeks later|Change of functional connectivity of whole brain, Functional connectivity will be measured with magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygen level dependence., Baseline, 8,24 weeks later|Change of metabolism of glucose in the brain, Accumulation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose(18F-FDG) will be analyzed by time-related Positron emission tomography., Baseline, 8,24 weeks later|Change of hot flash severity, Hot flash severity will be assessed with hot flash scores each week. There are four levels of severityï¼š Mild: Duration: Less than five minutes. Symptoms: warmth, discomfort, flushing. Moderate: Duration: Up to fifteen minutes. Symptoms: warmth in head, neck, ears, or body; tense, tight muscles; clammy skin; change in heart rate or rhythm; light sweating; dry mouth.

This topic combines the theory of "unblocking the governor and warming the yang" with the important findings of modern research, that is, the important mechanism of the spine in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and innovatively proposes the technique of unblocking the governor and treating the spine. Prospective clinical intervention research in rehabilitation, objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy, advantages and disadvantages of this technology, so as to effectively break through the current application dilemma of acupuncture and bone-setting manipulation in tumor diseases.
