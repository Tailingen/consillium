Local Non-salvage Radiotherapy for Synchronous Oligometastatic Non-small-cell Lung Cancer.
Aggressive therapy may improve survival in synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC and the goal of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of local definitive radiotherapy in this subset of patients.
Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Local Definitive Radiotherapy|DRUG: No Local Definitive Radiotherapy
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Refers to the time from randomization to disease progression or death., 5 years
Local tumor control, From time of randomization to time of progression or death（according to RECIST v1.1 \[）, up to 5 years|Oligometastatic foci control, From time of first chemotherapy or targeted therapy to time of progression or death（according to RECIST v1.1）, up to 5 years|Thoracic Progression Free Survival, From time of first chemotherapy or targeted therapy to time of progression or death, up to 5 years|Overall Survival, From time of first chemotherapy or targeted therapy to date of death, up to 5 years
For NSCLC patients with synchronous oligometastases, first line chemotherapy or targeted therapy concurrent with non-salvage radiotherapy on metastatic or primary thoracic tumor contributed a longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy or targeted therapy alone.
