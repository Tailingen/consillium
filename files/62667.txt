Use of Human Dehydrated Amnion/Chorion (DHACM) Allograft in Partial Nephrectomy
After partial nephrectomy, kidney function decreases by about 10% overall and by about 20% in the operated kidney. This is primarily due to the loss of healthy parenchymal volume during resection of the tumor. In an effort to preserve and regenerate healthy parenchyma during the procedure and ultimately renal function after partial nephrectomy, the single center double arm single-blinded randomized screening clinical trial will evaluate the ability of human amnion/chorion allograft to facilitate the recovery of renal function following robotic partial nephrectomy.
