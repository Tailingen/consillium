Roniciclib Mass Balance Study
The purpose of this trial is to investigate the fate of the roniciclib (study drug) in the body in a so called mass-balance study. This means to investigate how the study drug is absorbed, distributed, broken down (metabolized) and removed (excreted or eliminated) from the body.
