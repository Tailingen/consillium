KeyScope Study in Uganda
KeyScope and KeyLoop (collectively called KeySuite) are laparoscopic prototypes that the investigators have designed for the resources, needs and challenges of low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). KeyScope is a laparoscope that plugs into a laptop computer to display images during surgery. It links to a telementoring application so that experienced surgeons can mentor surgeons in capacity-building partnerships. KeyLoop is a laparoscopic retractor that lifts the abdominal wall during surgery, obviating the need for a constant power supply and medical-grade carbon dioxide.

The investigators will perform a clinical First-in-Human study at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Ugandan surgeons will use the KeySuite devices to perform biopsies of intra-abdominal tumors.
