A Study of PRT2527 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation and confirmation study of PRT2527, a Cyclin-dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor, in participants with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to define the dosing schedule, and maximally tolerated dose to be used in subsequent development of PRT2527.
Sarcoma|Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer|Hormone Receptor Positive HER2 Negative Breast Cancer|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Solid Tumors With Known MYC Amplification
DRUG: PRT2527
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PRT2527, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated over the 21-day observation period, Baseline through Day 21|Maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of PRT2527, The MTD will be established for further investigation in participants with advanced solid tumors, Baseline through approximately 1 year|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of PRT2527, The RP2D will be established for further investigation in participants with advanced solid tumors, Baseline through approximately 1 year
Safety and tolerability of PRT2527: AEs, SAEs, CTCAE assessments, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Baseline through approximately 2 years|Pharmacokinetic profile of PRT2527: maximum observed plasma concentration, PRT2527 pharmacokinetics will be calculated including the maximum observed plasma concentration, Baseline through approximately 1 year|Anti-tumor activity of PRT2527: measurement of objective responses, Anti-tumor activity of PRT2527 based on the measurement of objective responses to PRT2527 according to the disease-specific response criteria for patients with advanced solid tumors, Baseline through approximately 2 years|Duration of response to PRT2527: Objective responses, Duration of response will be calculated for all patients eligible for response determination from the time that a response is first observed until progression or death, whichever occurs first, Baseline through approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and confirmation Phase 1 study of PRT2527, a CDK9 inhibitor, evaluating participants with selected advanced/metastatic sarcomas displaying a documented gene fusion, castrate resistant prostate cancer, hormone receptor positive HER2-negative breast cancer, advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and solid tumors displaying MYC amplification. The study plan expects to evaluate approximately six dose levels of approximately 1-6 participants per dose level; however additional and/or intermediate dose levels may be explored. Taking into account pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the preceding dose levels, the dose may be escalated until a dose limiting toxicity is identified. The total sample size will be approximately 30 patients for MTD and RP2D determination.
