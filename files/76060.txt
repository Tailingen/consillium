Collection of familial data and biospecimens in a data and tissue repository for familial pancreas research, baseline
OBJECTIVES:

* To collect clinical history, family history, and blood and/or tissue samples from family members of patients diagnosed with pancreatic diseases, pancreatic cancer, or melanoma.
* To learn whether inherited factors increase the risk of pancreatic diseases, pancreatic cancer, or other cancers.

OUTLINE: Study participants undergo collection of blood and/or tissue samples as well as survey data for inclusion in a familial data and tissue registry. Participants complete two baseline surveys regarding their personal, family, health, and environmental exposure histories and regarding their opinions on cancer and cancer screening.
