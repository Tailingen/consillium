Radiofrequency and Exercise-based Rehabilitation on Symptoms Associated With Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions in Breast Cancer
Breast cancer has a high impact, affecting 2.3 million women worldwide in 2022. In Spain, there were 40,203 new cases in 2023. In addition to the economic and social costs, patients suffer genitourinary dysfunctions due to cancer treatments. Genitourinary Menopausal Syndrome (GUS) affects 50% of menopausal women, with a higher prevalence in women with breast cancer.

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) and pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFMT) in the treatment of pelvic dysfunction associated with GUS in breast cancer patients. A randomised, double-blind clinical trial will be conducted in collaboration with the Association of Women Affected by Breast Cancer of Elche and Region) and the CEU Cardenal Herrera University. Women diagnosed with breast cancer and pelvic dysfunction will participate, divided into three groups: one will receive PFMT, one will receive RF and one will receive PFMT+RF therapy.

Both techniques are expected to improve the quality of life of patients, where RF could offer additional benefits due to its proven effectiveness in the treatment of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The expected results will contribute to more effective and less invasive treatment protocols. The project presented has the potential to positively impact the health and well-being of women with breast cancer, reducing the symptoms associated with the disease and its treatment, and improving their quality of life.

DEVICE: manometry through the PHENIX series device (model: PHENIX LIBERTY; manufacturer: ELECTRONIC CONCEPT LIGNON INNOVATION, Montpelier, France).|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PFIQ-20 questionnaire (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire Short Form)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ICIQ-SF (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Sandvik's test|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: vaginal health index (VHI)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Visual analogue scale (VAS)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Body Image Scale (S-BIS)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Likert's scale questionnaire|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Oxford's Scale|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Sexual function and self-esteem
PFDI-20 questionnaire (300 points), This questionnaire assesses the impact over the last 3 months of urinary symptoms (Urinary Impact Questionnaire; UIQ-7), colorectal-anal symptoms (Colorectal-Anal Impact questionnaire, CRAIQ-7) and genital prolapse symptoms (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, POPIQ-7). The maximum possible score is 300 points, with a maximum value of 100 points for each subscale. The higher the score, the greater the negative impact on quality of life., Pre-intervention / a year post-intervention
Age (years), Subject's age (years), Pre-intervention|Sex (female or male), Subject's sex (female or male), Pre-intervention|Body mass index (Kg /m2), It is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women, Pre-intervention|Pelvic floor muscle strength assessment (oxford scale 0-5 points), If there is no contraction it is rated 0, if the contraction is very weak it is rated 1, if the contraction is weak it is 2, if the contraction is moderate/with tension/and maintained it is 3, if the contraction is good and maintains tension with resistance it is 4, and if the contraction is strong and maintains tension against a resistant force it is 5. In addition, this assessment allows the determination of static muscular endurance, fatiguability or dynamic endurance and maximum muscular strength., pre-intervention / 15 days post-intervention / 6 months post-intervention / 12 months post-intervention|neuromuscular stimulation device and PHENIX LIBERTY manometry (mmHg), pre-intervention / 15 days post-intervention / 6 months post-intervention / 12 months post-intervention|pH (0-14), The pH will be quantified using a pH indicator strip between 0 and 14 to be placed directly on the right lateral vaginal wall for one minute, giving 1 point for pH 6.1, 2 for pH 5.6-6.0, 3 for pH 5.1-5.5, 4 for pH 4.7-5.0 and 5 for pH â‰¤ 4.6. The sum of all items represents the vaginal health score, where 25 represents the best vaginal health., pre-intervention / 15 days post-intervention / 6 months post-intervention / 12 months post-intervention
