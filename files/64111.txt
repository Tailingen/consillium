A Study of Efficacy and Safety of AND017 in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-lable, dose ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AND017 for the treatment of anemia due to lower risk Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients subjects who are Red blood cell (RBC) non-transfusion dependent (NTD) and low transfusion burden (LTB).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: AND017
Percentage of HI-E/RBC-TI responding subjects, * NTD cohort: non-transfused Hb levels ≥1.5 g/dL relative to baseline\* during any 8-week period from baseline to 24 weeks post-dose.
* LTB-1 cohort: No transfusion during any 8-week period from baseline to 24 weeks post-dose.
* LTB-2 cohort: No transfusions during any 8-week period from baseline to 24 weeks post-dose and untransfused Hb levels ≥1.5 g/dL.

  * Hb baseline is the average of the two lowest Hb over the 16 weeks prior to the first dose, From baseline to up to Week 25
