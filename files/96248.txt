YH32367, a novel HER2/4-1BB bispecific antibody (BsAb), simultaneously targets HER2 and h4-1BB and binds to both targets. YH32367 exhibits a strong 4-1BB signal activation as well as blocking of HER2 signaling in HER2-expressing tumor cells. YH32367 stimulates IFN-Î³ secretion from T cells and thereby induces tumor cells lysis.

This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study of YH32367. This 2-part study will include both a Dose Escalation part, to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or two dose levels for RP2D selection, and a Dose Expansion part, to determine RP2D and to confirm the safety, tolerability and efficacy of YH32367 at the RP2D.
