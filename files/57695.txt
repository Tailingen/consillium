A Study of Brentuximab Vedotin With Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and CD30-expressing Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)
This trial will study brentuximab vedotin to find out whether it is an effective treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Participants in this study will be older or will have other conditions that make them unable to have standard chemotherapy treatment. The study will look at brentuximab vedotin alone and combined with other drugs.
Hodgkin Disease|Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: bendamustine|DRUG: dacarbazine|DRUG: nivolumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Parts A, B, and C), Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) through the end of study or prior to the start of new anti-cancer treatment (including stem cell transplant, and excluding consolidative radiotherapy) other than the study treatment. For Parts A, B, and C the response was assessed using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007)., Up to 81 months|ORR According to the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for Nodal Non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin Lymphomas (Lugano Criteria) and the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) (Part D), Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR through the end of study or prior to the start of new anti-cancer treatment (including stem cell transplant, and excluding consolidative radiotherapy) other than the study treatment. For Part D, the response was assessed using the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for nodal non-Hodgkin and cHL (Lugano criteria) and the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC)., Up to 60 months|ORR According to Modified Lugano Criteria Per Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) (Parts E and F), Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR through the end of study or prior to the start of new anti-cancer treatment (including stem cell transplant, and excluding consolidative radiotherapy) other than the study treatment. For Parts E and F, the response was assessed per blinded independent central review (BICR) using the modified Lugano criteria., Up to 31 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as a newly occurring or worsening AE after the first dose of any study drug component. Treatment-related AEs are defined as treatment-emergent AEs that are determined by the investigator to be related to the treatment on study. TEAEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5, where Grade 1: Mild, Grade 2: Moderate, Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, Grade 5: Death related to AE., Up to 122 months|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Laboratory values were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5, where Grade 1: Mild, Grade 2: Moderate, Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, Grade 5: Death related to AE., Up to 30 months|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with CR, Up to 81 months|Duration of Complete Response, Duration of CR per investigator was defined as the time from start of the first documentation of CR to the first documentation of tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever came first. For Parts E and F, the assessment was per BICR., Up to 81 months|Duration of Objective Response, Duration of response per investigator was defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression (PD) based on radiographic evidence of progression or to death due to any cause, whichever came first. For Parts E and F, the assessment was per BICR., Up to 81 months|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) per investigator was defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever came first. For Parts E and F, the assessment was per BICR., Up to 83 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate (DCR) per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, per investigator assessment of best clinical response per Cheson 2007. For Parts E and F, the assessment was per BICR., Up to 81 months|ORR According to Lugano Criteria Per BICR (Parts E and F), Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR through the end of study or prior to the start of new anti-cancer treatment (including stem cell transplant, and excluding consolidative radiotherapy) other than the study treatment., Up to 31 months|B Symptom Resolution Rate, B symptom resolution rate per investigator was defined as the percentage of subjects with lymphoma-related B symptoms at baseline who achieved resolution of all B symptoms at any time during the treatment period., Up to 42 weeks|Number of Participants With Brentuximab Vedotin Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA), Up to 30 months|Number of Participants With Nivolumab Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATA) (Part D Only), Up to 30 months|Overall Survival (Parts E and F Only), Overall survival (OS) per investigator was defined as the time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause., Up to 44 months
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy and in combination with other agents as frontline therapy. There are 6 parts of the study. The population to be studied includes treatment-naïve patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or treatment-naïve patients with CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).
