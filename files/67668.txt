A Pharmacokinetic Study Comparing PF-05280014 And Trastuzumab In Healthy Male Volunteers (REFLECTIONS B327-01)
In this study, healthy male volunteers will receive a single intravenous administration of either PF-05280014 or trastuzumab (United States) or trastuzumab (European Union). During the course of the study, the pharmacokinetics will be assessed by sampling the levels of drug in the blood, and by comparing these levels among the different administration arms of PF-05280014 and the US-licensed and EU-approved trastuzumab products. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic response also will be evaluated throughout.
