Liposomal Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Injection,Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone in the Treatment of PTCL
This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase Ib clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride in combination with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone in the frontline treatment of patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL).

The study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride in combination with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone in the frontline treatment of patients with PTCL by conducting in two stages, Dose-finding stage and Dose-expansion stage.In Dose-finding stage, patients with treatment-naïve PTCL will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride ranging from 12 to 18 mg/m2 plus Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone (28 days per cycle). The dose escalation will follow the classic 3+3 design. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be determined according to the Dose-finding results. In Dose-expansion stage, additional patients will be recruited into two groups, the Q4W group（28 days per cycle）and the Q3W group（21 days per cycle）, to receive liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride at the RP2D combined with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine and Prednisone. All patients will receive the treatment for the planned 6 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events.
