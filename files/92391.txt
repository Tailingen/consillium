Safety evaluation index, According to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, the safety and tolerability of PCSK9 inhibitor combination therapy, During the study
The purpose of this study is to preliminarily observe the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors in combination with standard advanced first-line regimens in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with pMMR/MSS. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) after PCSK9 inhibitor combination, overall survival (OS) after PCSK9 inhibitor combination, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PCSK9 inhibitor combination therapy based on NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, and to further explore efficacy predictive biomarkers based on changes in the expression of specific immune markers in blood and tissue specimens at baseline and after treatment.
