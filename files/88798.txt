An Open-Label Phase lB/II Study of Glofitamab and Atezolizumab or Polatuzumab Vedotin in Adult Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose finding, Phase Ib study in order to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for this combination treatment and to evaluate the general safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of this combination treatment in adult patients.

This study includes an additional open-label imaging feasibility sub-study using a tracer in adult participants with relpased/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to image CD8+T-cells at baseline and after treatment with glofitamab, including pre-treatment with obinutuzumab.
