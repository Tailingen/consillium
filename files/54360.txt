A Study of Trastuzumab DeRuxtecan for Patients With Advanced HER2-pOsitive GaStric or GastroesoPhageal Junction AdEnocarcinoma Who Have Received a PrIor Trastuzumab-based Regimen Accompanied by a Disease RegistrY of Patients Treated With Conventional Therapies (PROSPERITY)
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXD) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen.

This study will assess the effectiveness of T-DXd, patient demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in patients with advanced HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
HER2-positive Advanced Gastric Cancer|HER2-positive Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan
Real-World Time to Next Treatment (rwTTNT1) in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, Baseline up to approximately 2 years
Number of Physician Visits and Treatment Changes in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Number of Physician-reported Safety Events of Interest in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (T-DXd only), Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants Receiving Prophylactic and Reactive Treatment Management for Physician-reported Safety Events of Interest in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma (T-DXd only), Baseline up to approximately 2 years|Real-World Time to Permanent Treatment Discontinuation (rwTTD1) in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, Baseline up to approximately 2 years|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Scores in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a cancer-specific quality of life instrument applicable to a broad range of cancer patients. The EORTC QLQ-C30 scales and single-item scales range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denotes a better level of functioning (i.e. a better state of the patient), while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the patient)., Baseline up to approximately 2 years|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Stomach (EORTC QLQ-STO22) Score in Participants With HER2-positive Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma, The EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer-specific module which has been developed to measure the quality of life in patients with gastric cancer. The gastric cancer specific questions on the EORTC QLQ-STO22 include four single-item subscales (dry mouth, body image, hair loss and problems with taste) and five multi-item subscales (dysphagia, dietary restriction, pain, upper gastroesophageal symptoms and emotional problems). The EORTC QLQ single-item and multi-item scales range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms (i.e. a worse state of the patient), Baseline up to approximately 2 years
This non-interventional study will investigate the effectiveness of T-DXd, the patients demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns including prophylactic medications and interventions for reduction of serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and safety event of interest (SEIs), tolerability, and patient survey of T-DXd, in cases with advanced HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma receiving T-DXd as second line of treatment and beyond treatment option. Patients will be treated according to the proposed indication statement in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). No investigational drug will be administered in this study.

Data on conventional therapy (including platinum-fluoropyrimidine doublet chemotherapy, nivolumab, ramucirumab-paclitaxel, ramucirumab monotherapy, taxane or irinotecan, and pembrolizumab monotherapy) will also be collected in a disease registry part of the study.
