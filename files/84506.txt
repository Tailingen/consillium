This is a Phase I study of therapeutic vaccine, BPX-201, plus activating agent, AP1903, in patients with mCRPC. Patients will be screened within 8 weeks prior to first vaccine administration (4 weeks prior to leukapheresis). The trial design consists of 3 cohorts of 6 patients each, receiving escalating doses of BPX-201 of 10 million (M), 20M and 40M cells, respectively. Dose escalation will occur according to a 3+3 design. Patients will receive administration of BPX-201 every other week for 6 cycles (1 cycle equals 2 weeks). Approximately 1.6 mL of BPX-201 will be administered as 8 intradermal injections (200Î¼L each) at each treatment visit. On the day following each vaccination, a single 40 mg dose of the activating agent, AP1903, will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours.
