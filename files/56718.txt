A Study of Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) and Paclitaxel in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic effects of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) on paclitaxel by investigating the pharmacokinetics (PK) of each in participants with advanced malignant solid tumors.

Part A of this study will investigate the potential of concomitant ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) to affect the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Part B of this study will investigate the pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) as monotherapy.
Malignant Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)|DRUG: paclitaxel
Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Paclitaxel From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] in Cycle 1, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose. Data presented are Geometric Least Squares (Geo LS) means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 1: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours post paclitaxel infusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Paclitaxel From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] in Cycle 2, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose. Data presented are Geometric Least Squares (Geo LS) means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 2: -1, 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 264 and 336 hours post paclitaxel infusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Paclitaxel in Cycle 1, Dose-normalized Cmax was calculated from Cmax divided by the dose. Data presented are Geometric Least Squares (Geo LS) means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 1: 0,1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours post paclitaxel infusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Paclitaxel in Cycle 2, Dose-normalized Cmax was calculated from Cmax divided by the dose. Data presented are Geometric Least Squares (Geo LS) means. Geo LS means were adjusted for cycle, participant and random error., Cycle 2: -1, 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 264 and 336 hours post paclitaxel infusion|Part B: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Ramucirumab From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] as Monotherapy, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose., Cycle 1: 0,1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72,168, 264, 336, 408, and 504 hours post ramucirumab infusion
Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Ramucirumab From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)] in the Presence of Paclitaxel, Dose-normalized AUC(0-∞) was calculated from AUC(0-∞) divided by the dose., Cycle 2: 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 6, 8, 25, 49, 73, 97, 169, 265 and 337 hours post ramucirumab infusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Dose-Normalized Maximum Observed Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab in the Presence of Paclitaxel, Dose-normalized Cmax was calculated from Cmax divided by the dose., Cycle 2: 0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 6, 8, 25, 49, 73, 97, 169, 265 and 337 hours post ramucirumab infusion|Part A: Immunogenicity of Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel - Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Number of participants with positive treatment emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies was summarized by treatment group. A treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TEADA) sample was defined as: a post treatment sample with at least a 4-fold increase in titer from pre treatment sample; or 1:20 post treatment titer for participants that had no detectable ADA titer at baseline., -1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and 30 days after last dose of study drug|Part B: Immunogenicity of Ramucirumab as Monotherapy - Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Number of participants with positive treatment emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies was summarized by treatment group. A treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TEADA) sample was defined as: a post treatment sample with at least a 4-fold increase in titer from pre treatment sample; or 1:20 post treatment titer for participants that had no detectable ADA titer at baseline., 0 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and 30 days after last dose of study drug
