Genotype-Driven Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer: A Real-World Cohort Study
This multicenter registry tests whether genomically matched neoadjuvant therapy (1-4 cycles tailored to BRAF V600E, RET fusion/mutation, isolated TERT mutation, triple-negative BRAF/RET/TERT, or ICI ± TKI) can render locally advanced, initially unresectable-or high-morbidity-thyroid cancers operable. The primary endpoint is conversion-to-surgery; key secondaries are R0/1 margin rate and 12-month event-free survival, with propensity-score weighting correcting cohort imbalances. Findings aim to define a precision-guided neoadjuvant standard for down-staging advanced thyroid tumors.

This multicenter, prospective-retrospective registry will determine whether genotype-matched neoadjuvant systemic therapy can convert locally advanced, initially unresectable or high-morbidity thyroid cancers to successful surgery. Patients receive one to four 28-day cycles of treatment chosen according to actionable genomic alterations-BRAF V600E, RET fusion, RET point mutation, isolated TERT promoter mutation, "BRT triple-negative" (wild-type for BRAF/RET/TERT), or immune-checkpoint blockade ± TKI-before reassessment by a multidisciplinary team.

Primary outcome is the conversion-to-surgery rate. Key secondary outcomes include R0/1 (margin-negative) resection rate and 12-month event-free survival, defined as absence of progression, unresectability at planned surgery, recurrence, or death. Propensity-score weighting will balance baseline differences among cohorts and permit adjusted comparisons. Results will clarify the role of targeted and immunologic agents in down-staging advanced thyroid tumors and may establish a precision-guided neoadjuvant standard of care.
