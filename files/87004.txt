Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, PK, Preliminary Clinical Activity of OB318 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The objectives of this Phase I study are to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), safety/ tolerability and preliminary efficacy of OB318 in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
Advanced Solid Malignancies
DRUG: OB318 capsule
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of OB318, NOTE: DLT is defined as any grade 3 or above toxicity by NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, as determined by the investigator and sponsor, to be at least possibly related in causality to the administered investigational product OB318 and will be observed during the 4 weeks of treatment for patients in the dose escalation phase., 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OB318, NOTE:- MTD is defined as the prior dose level below the dose level at which 2/3 or 2/6 subjects suffer dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation phase, 28 days
