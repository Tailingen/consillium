Study of a Reduced-toxicity "Submyeloablative" Conditioning Regimen Prior to Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Hematological Malignancies
The goal of this prospective study is to assess the overall mortality (whether related to relapse/progression or toxicity - TRM-) at one year after allogeneic stem cell transplantation prepared by a so-called reduced-toxicity "submyeloablative" conditioning regimen in patients with hematological malignancies.
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: Fludarabine, Busulfan, Thymoglobuline
Evaluation of the overall mortality rate at 12 months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 12 months after transplantation
To assess the "classical" criteria (clinical and biological) associated with outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. To evaluate the impact of the modified Charlson comorbidity score (Sorror Score) on TRM and 1-year overall survival, 12 months after transplantation
