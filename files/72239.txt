Phase 3 Study of Carfilzomib, Melphalan, Prednisone vs Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The primary objective was to compare the progression-free survival of transplant ineligible patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who were treated with carfilzomib, melphalan and prednisone (CMP) or with Velcade® (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone (VMP).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Prednisone
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of documented disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The duration of PFS was censored for participants with no baseline and/or post-baseline disease assessments, who started a new anti-cancer therapy before documentation of disease progression or death, death or disease progression after missed disease assessment of 100 consecutive days or longer, or who were alive without documentation of disease progression before the data cutoff date, including lost to follow-up prior to disease progression.

Participants were evaluated for disease response and progression according to the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC), determined centrally using a validated computer algorithm in a blinded manner., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median follow-up time for PFS was 21.6.and 22.2 months in the bortezomib and carfilzomib arms respectively.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (whatever the cause). Participants who were alive or lost to follow-up as of the data analysis cut-off date were censored on the date the patient was last known to be alive.

Median overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median follow-up time for OS was 22.2 and 22.5 months in the bortezomib and carfilzomib arms respectively.|Overall Response Rate, Disease response was evaluated according to the IMWG-URC using a validated computer algorithm. Overall response was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR).

sCR: As for CR, normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow (BM).

CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in BM biopsy; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not electrophoresis or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein with urine M-protein \<100 mg/24 hours. A ≥ 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas if present at baseline.

PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in urine M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg/24 hours. A ≥ 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas if present at baseline., Disease response was assessed every 3 weeks during the first 54 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter until PD or the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median follow-up time was 21.6.and 22.2 months in the bortezomib and carfilzomib arms respectively.|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate was defined as the percentage of participants in each treatment group who achieved a sCR or CR per the IMWG-URC as their best response.

sCR: As for CR, normal serum free light chain (SFLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow (BM).

CR: No immunofixation on serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in BM biopsy., Disease response was assessed every 3 weeks during the first 54 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter until PD or the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median follow-up time was 21.6.and 22.2 months in the bortezomib and carfilzomib arms respectively.|Percentage of Participants With ≥ Grade 2 Peripheral Neuropathy, Neuropathy events were defined as Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy as specified by peripheral neuropathy Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query, narrow (scope) (SMQN) terms.

Peripheral neuropathy was assessed by neurologic exam and graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03:

Grade 1: Asymptomatic; Grade 2: Moderate symptoms, limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) Grade 3: Severe symptoms; limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: Death., From the first dose of any study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of any study drug as of the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median duration of treatment was 52 weeks in both treatment groups.|European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Module (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QOL) Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated self-rating questionnaire including 30 items used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients.

It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact).

The EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/QOL scale was scored between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating better Global Health Status/QOL., Baseline, weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events (AEs)were graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03, where GRADE 1 = Mild; GRADE 2 = Moderate; GRADE 3 = Severe; GRADE 4 = Life-threatening; GRADE 5 = Fatal.

A serious adverse event is an adverse event that met 1 or more of the following criteria:

* Death
* Life-threatening
* Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
* Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
* Congenital anomaly/birth defect
* Important medical event that jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.

Treatment-related adverse events are adverse events considered related to at least 1 investigational product by the investigator, including those with unknown relationship., From the first dose of any study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of any study drug as of the data cut-off date of 15 July 2016; median duration of treatment was 52 weeks in both treatment groups.
The primary objective was to compare the progression-free survival of transplant ineligible patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma who were treated with carfilzomib, melphalan and prednisone (CMP) or with Velcade® (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone (VMP).
