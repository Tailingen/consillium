Impact of Automatic Polyp Detection System on Adenoma Detection Rate
In recent years, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence, automatic polyp detection systems have shown its potential in increasing the colorectal lesions. Yet, whether this system can increase polyp and adenoma detection rates in the real clinical setting is still need to be proved. The primary objective of this study is to examine whether a combination of colonoscopy and a deep learning-based automatic polyp detection system is a feasible way to increase adenoma detection rate compared to standard colonoscopy.

DEVICE: Automatic polyp detection system
adenoma detection rate(ADR), the number of patients with at least one adenoma divided by the total number of patients., 30 minutes
polyp detection rate(PDR), the number of patients with at least one polyp divided by the total number of patients., 30 minutes|adenoma per colonoscopy, the number of adenomas detected during colonoscopy withdraw divided by the number of colonoscopies., 30 minutes|polyp per colonoscopy, the number of polyps detected during colonoscopy withdraw divided by the number of colonoscopies., 30 minutes
