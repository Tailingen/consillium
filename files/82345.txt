Chemotherapy Combined With CIK Treating Colon Cancer
Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) is an auxiliary antitumor treatment. The investigators aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy combined with CIK in the treatment of postoperative colorectal cancer patients. And to provide useful reference for the clinical application of CIK in colorectal cancer patients.

Over the past decade, advances in combination chemotherapy regimens for colorectal cancer have led to significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival. Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) is an auxiliary antitumor treatment. Research has demonstrated the median overall survival (OS) in patients received CIK combined with chemotherapy (5-Fluorouridine, leucovorin and oxaliplatin \[FOLFOX4\] plan) was significantly increased compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, there was a trend toward superior progression-free survival time (PFS) in patients received CIK combined with chemotherapy compared with that in patients received chemotherapy alone. The investigators aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) combined with CIK in the treatment of postoperative colorectal cancer patients. And to provide useful reference for the clinical application of CIK in colorectal cancer patients.
