This study is a single-center, open-label, single dose study of anti CD30 CAR-T cells injection in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+ lymphoma.

This study intends to include CD30-positive patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+ lymphoma, and subjects will receive a single injection of anti CD30 CAR-T cells after screening, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) collection, and lymphodepletion chemotherapy pretreatment. Response assessments for lymphoma subjects will base on 2018 Lugano Classification.
