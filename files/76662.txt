Efficacy and Safety of P1101 in Polycythemia Vera Patients for Whom the Standard of Treatment is Difficult to Apply
This is a Phase 2 single arm study to investigate efficacy and safety of P1101 for adult Japanese patients with PV.
Polycythemia Vera (PV)
DRUG: P1101|DRUG: Low-dose aspirin|PROCEDURE: Phlebotomy
Proportion of subjects achieving durable phlebotomy-free complete hematological response (CHR) at Month 12, The primary efficacy outcome measure is the proportion of subjects achieving durable phlebotomy-free complete hematologic response (CHR) at Month 12.

Durable phlebotomy-free CHR is defined as any subject achieving phlebotomy-free CHR at Month 9 and maintaining the response up to Month 12.

A responder in sense of a primary outcome measure is a subject who has met all the following criteria at the time points:

* Hematocrit \<45% phlebotomy-free (absence of phlebotomy during the previous 3 months)
* Platelet count ≤400 x 10\^9/L,
* WBC count ≤10 x 10\^9/L, 12 months
Changes in Hct from baseline, Hct will be recorded every 3 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months|Changes in WBC count from baseline, WBC count will be recorded every 3 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months|Changes in Plt count from baseline, Plt count will be recorded every 3 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months|Changes in spleen size from baseline, Spleen size will be recorded every 3 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months|Time to requiring no phlebotomy, Time to requiring no phlebotomy is recorded., Up to 12 months|Time required to first response, Time required to first response is defined as time to achieve complete hematological response (CHR) without phlebotomy., Up to 12 months|Duration of response maintenance, Duration of maintained complete hematologic response (CHR) since first achievement of CHR after administration of the study drug will be calculated., Up to 12 months|Proportion of subjects without thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, Thrombotic or hemorrhagic events will be recorded any time during the study. The proportion of subjects without thrombotic or hemorrhagic events is defined as the proportion of subjects experienced no thrombotic and hemorrhagic events during the study period (12 months)., Up to 12 months|Change of JAK2 mutant allelic burden over time vs. baseline, Quantitative JAK2 measurements at screening, Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (central laboratory) for subjects who signed consent form. Change of JAK2 allelic burden over time will be assessed., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months|PK of P1101, Trough concentration is the measured concentration of a drug at the end of a dosing interval at steady state every 2 weeks.

Additionally, serum concentration is measured at hours 0, 24, 48, 96 and 168 after administration at Week 0 and Week 28., Up to 12 months
Status of bone marrow histological remission (optional), Status of bone marrow histological remission defined as the disappearance of hypercellularity (age-adjusted), trilineage growth (panmyelosis) and absence of \>grade 1 reticulin fibrosis, 0 month, 12 months
Eligible patients will be treated with P1101, starting at 100 μg (or 50 μg in patients under another cytoreductive therapy). The dose should be gradually increased by 50 μg every two weeks (in parallel, other cytoreductive therapy should be decreased gradually, as appropriate) until stabilization of the hematological parameters is achieved (hematocrit \<45%, platelets \<400 x 10\^9/L and leukocytes \<10 x 10\^9/L). The maximum recommended single dose is 500 μg injected every two weeks.

At week 36 (month 9) and week 52 (month 12), the primary study endpoint, phlebotomy-free CHR, will be analyzed. After completion of the 52-week study duration, provision and administration of P1101, collection of the long-term follow up information (blood parameters, molecular and cytogenetic data, safety parameters and as also the optional bone marrow data) will be continued until the drug becomes commercially available for all study subjects..
