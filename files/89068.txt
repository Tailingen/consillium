Determine the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Brivanib in Chinese Subjects With Advanced Primary Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma: HCC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of Brivanib in Chinese subjects with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Brivanib
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Trough observed plasma concentration (Cmin) of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval [AUC(TAU)] of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Average steady state concentration calculated as AUC(TAU)/24 (Css_av) of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Degree of fluctuation calculated as ((Cmax- Cmin)/Css_av) [Degree of fluctuation] of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Terminal half-life (T-HALF) of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15|Accumulation index calculated as the ratio: AUC(TAU) at steady-state (Day 8) divided by AUC(TAU) after the first dose (Day 1) [AI] of Brivanib, Days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15
Safety assessments based on adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), 2-D Echocardiograms, physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests, Part A: Day 1-Week 1, Day 8-Week 2, Day 15-Week 3 and Day 29-Week 5, Part B: End of treatment (approximately 24 months)|Preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in Chinese subjects with advanced HCC treated with Brivanib, Screening, Week 7 and every 6 weeks up to End of treatment (approximately 24 months)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of Brivanib in Chinese subjects with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
