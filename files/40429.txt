Combination Anticancer Therapy of Paclitaxel and Everolimus for Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
The objective of this phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy of paclitaxel and everolimus in small cell lung cancer patient with previous treatment history.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: taxol plus everolimus
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus when combined with fixed dose of paclitaxel in small cell lung cancer patients, 18 months
To evaluate the safety when paclitaxel plus everolimus are given to patients with small cell lung cancer, 18 months|To evaluate the objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 18 months
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer, and more than half of these patients are diagnosed with extensive-stage disease (ED). SCLC is a particularly aggressive form of lung cancer with a tendency for rapid tumor growth, early dissemination and high frequency of the metastasis In this study, we evaluate the MTD of everolimus combined with paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in SCLC.
