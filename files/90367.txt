A Dose Escalation Study of Adavosertib(MK1775) in Combination With 5-FU or 5-FU/CDDP in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor (1775-005
The study evaluates safety of adavosertib in monotherapy, and in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) alone or with 5-FU/cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) in Japanese participants with solid tumor. The primary hypothesis is that adavosertib is safe and tolerable in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: adavosertib 20 mg|DRUG: 5-FU 1000 mg/m^2/day|DRUG: CDDP|DRUG: adavosertib 65 mg
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 and included: any drug-related hematologic toxicity ≥Grade 4 with the exception of Grade 4 neutropenia \<7 days duration; Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever \>38.5 degrees Celsius and/or infection or neutropenia requiring colony-stimulating factor OR non-hematologic DLTs that were any Grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity with the following exceptions: Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration occurring in a setting of inadequate treatment; inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions; Grade 3 elevated transaminases or urine electrolyte abnormality ≤1 week in duration; Grade 3 serum electrolyte abnormality ≤72 hours in duration. DLTs also included: drug-related adverse experience that lead to a dose modification; unresolved drug-related toxicity preventing treatment for ≥3 weeks or preventing administration of ≥8 of 10 doses in Parts 1 or 2A1 or 4 of 5 doses in Part 2A2., Cycle 1 (21 days)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MK1775 in Combination With 5-FU/CDDP Determined by Number of DLTs Per Dose Level: Locally Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal, Head and Neck, or Gastric Cancer, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-1775 in combination with 5-FU/CDDP for participants with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal, head and neck, or gastric cancer was determined based on DLTs that occurred during Cycle 1 of Parts 2B and 3. The MTD for MK-1775 in combination with 5-FU/CDDP was defined as the dose level at which approximately 30% of the participants were expected to experience a DLT for the combination therapy. The study was terminated early and Parts 2B and 3 were not performed. No participants received the 5-FU/CDDP regimen therefore the MTD for MK-1775 in combination with 5-FU/CDDP was not established., Cycle 1 (21 days)
