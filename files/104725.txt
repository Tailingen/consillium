Trial of RNActive®-Derived Cancer Vaccine and Local Radiation in in Stage IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new RNActive derived lung cancer vaccine CV9202 in combination with local radiation therapy is safe, tolerable and immunogenic for the consolidation and maintenance treatment of stage IV non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after first-line chemotherapy or therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CV9202|RADIATION: local radiation
Number of participants with treatment related >= grade 3 adverse events (AEs)., Events are graded by the investigator using the NCI CTCAE Scale (version 4.0) which provides a grading scale for each AE term. Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling

Interim safety evaluations will be performed:

* After treatment and observation of the first 6 patients until Day 43 in a given stratum.

  - If \>= 2 out of 6 patients experience treatment-related \>= grade 3 AEs, enrollment in that stratum will be suspended.
* After the first 6 patients (enrolled in stratum 1 or 2) have received radiation of thoracic lesions and have been monitored for toxicity until Day 57:

  * If \>= 2 out of 6 patients experience \>= grade 3 radiation pneumonitis, radiation of thoracic lesions will be suspended for further patients.
  * For strata 1 and 2, CV9202 administration and radiation of thoracic lesions will be considered safe for further evaluation if ≤ 20% of patients experience a \>= grade 3 radiation pneumonitis and no patients experience grade 4 radiation pneumonitis., up to 40 months

The Phase Ib study is the first clinical study with the new lung cancer vaccine CV9202. The vaccine is composed of 6 RNActive compounts, each encoding for a different antigen which is overexpressed in NSCLC compared to healthy tissue.

In order to enhance the immunogenic effect of the cancer vaccine, the study treatment will include local radiation (4 x 5 Gy), which is a well-established palliative radiation regimen that can be safely applied to metastatic lesions in the lung, bone, and soft tissue, and is well tolerated.

Patients will be enrolled into 3 strata based on histologic and molecular subtypes as follows:

Stratum 1: Patients with metastatic stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, without activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, who have achieved partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after at least 4 cycles of platinum- and pemetrexed-based first-line chemotherapy, and an indication for maintenance therapy with pemetrexed.

Stratum 2: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and squamous cell histology, who achieved PR or SD after at least 4 cycles of platinum-based and non-platinum compound first-line chemotherapy.

Stratum 3: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, harboring an activating EGFR mutation, who have achieved PR after up to 6 months or SD after 3 - 6 months of treatment with an EGFR TKI.

In each patient, the vaccine will be administered until progression and the need to start a subsequent systemic second-line treatment, or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity requiring treatment discontinuation, whichever comes first.
