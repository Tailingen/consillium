Study of NKTR 255 in Combination With Cetuximab in Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label multicenter study evaluating NKTR-255 as a monotherapy and together with cetuximab in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC).
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: NKTR-255|DRUG: Cetuximab
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) of NKTR-255 in Combination With Cetuximab in R/R HNSCC or CRC for Phase 1b Dose Escalation, Safety and tolerability of NKTR-255 in combination with cetuximab as evaluated by dose limiting toxicities, incidence of drug-related Adverse Events (AEs), SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths, and clinical laboratory abnormalities per CTCAE 5.0, 60 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to an average of 6 months.|The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NKTR-255 in Combination With Cetuximab in R/R HNSCC or CRC for Phase 1b Dose Escalation, To define the MTD and/or RP2D of NKTR-255 in combination with cetuximab in R/R HNSCC or CRC for Phase 1b Dose Escalation, Up to 21 days
NKTR-255 is a cytokine that is designed to regulate T and natural killer cell activation, proliferation and promote their anti-tumor effects.

In the dose escalation (Phase 1/b) phase patients with HNSCC or CRC will be treated with ascending doses of NKTR-255 in combination with cetuximab, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is reached.
