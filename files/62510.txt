Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy With Concomitant Boost in Treating Women After Breast Conserving Surgery
This phase II study is to evaluate the safety of hypofractionated whole breast radiation (HFRT) with simultaneous tumor bed boost(SIB) in women with early breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery.
Breast Cancer Female
RADIATION: Radiation therapy
acute radiation induced dermatitis by CTCAE within 3 months, radiation induced skin toxicity, including rash, dry skin, ulceration etc., occurring immediately after radiation., 3 months
late radiation toxicity by CTCAE every 3 months to 1 years after 3 months of completion of radiation, any radiation induced toxicity occurring after the radiation, 3 months to 1 year|breast cosmetic result as measured by Harvard scale of breast cosmesis (excellent, good, fair, poor) every 3 months for 1year, breast cosmetic evaluation after breast conserving surgery and radiation, using Harvard scale., every 3 months for 1year|quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Scale (FACT-B) every 3 months for 1 year, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Scale (FACT-B) is used to evaluated the quality of life: all scale range: 0-144; sub-scale range: physical well being: 0-28; social well being: 0-28; emotional well being 0-24; functional well being 0-28; additional consideration: 0-36; the higher the better, every 3 months for 1 year|quality of life as measured by Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale(BCTOS) every 3 months for 1 year, Functional Assessment of Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale(BCTOS) is used to evaluated the quality of life. the range of BCTOS is 22-88, the smaller the better, every 3 months for 1 year|in-breast recurrence rate at 1 year of radiation completion, recurrence occurred in the treated breast., 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary:

To determine the toxicity with adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast radiation with simultaneous tumor bed boost (SIB) in women with early breast cancer after breast conserving surgery.

Secondary:

To determine the short term cosmetic and quality of life of the participants treated with this regimen.

To determine the local control of the participants treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast radiation with simultaneous tumor bed boost once daily a week for 3 weeks. Toxicity, quality of life and cosmetic result is assessed before radiation, at the end of the radiation, within 2, 4, 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, and then every 3 months for 1 ear.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 participants will be accrued for this study.
