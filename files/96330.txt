A Combination Therapy Strategy to Prevent Anti-PD-1 Therapy Resistance in Metastatic Ovarian Cancer Patients
This is an open label, non-randomized, 2-stage phase II, single arm study to determine the efficacy of New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) peptide vaccine as a priming mechanism to prevent anti-PD1 resistance in patients with platinum-refractory stage III/IV ovarian cancer (OC).
