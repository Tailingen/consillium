An Observational Clinical Study of Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Stable Disease After PD-1 Inhibitor Treatment
After the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, if the treatment response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) can be achieved in the early stage, the patients are expected to obtain a better long-term survival rate. Radiotherapy can synergistically improve the effect of immunotherapy. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis: in patients with advanced lung cancer, if only stable disease (SD) is achieved after PD-1 antibody immunotherapy in the early stage, by increasing the stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary or metastatic lesions, in order to improve the mechanism of tumor antigen release, promote the activation and activation of effector T cells, and increase the sensitivity of immunotherapy, so as to achieve the goal of early improvement of objective remission rate (ORR). It is expected to improve the long-term survival rate of patients.
