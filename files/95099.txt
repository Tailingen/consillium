Study of Carboplatin Plus Etoposide With or Without SHR-1316 in Participants With Untreated Extensive-Stage (ES) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1316 in combination with carboplatin plus (+) etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC.
Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1316|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Placebo
Duration of Overall Survival (OS), Baseline until death from any cause, up to approximately 31 months
Duration of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed Using RECIST v1.1, up to approximately 6 months|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, Baseline until partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), whichever occurs first, up to approximately 31 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, First occurrence of PR or CR until PD or death, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 31 months|Percentage of Participants Alive and Without PD, as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, at 6 Months and 1 Year, 6 months, 1 year|Percentage of Participants Alive at 1 Year and 2 Years, 1 year, 2 years|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events Or Serious Adverse Events., up to approximately 31 months
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SHR-1316 + carboplatin + etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide for 4-6 cycles in the induction phase followed by maintenance with SHR-1316 or placebo until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or or unacceptable toxicity.
