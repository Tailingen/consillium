CD19-targeted CAR T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, single-arm study to treat the adult R/R Large B-cell Lymphoma subjects with Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) in China.

This is an open-label, single-arm study conducted in adult subjects with R/R LBCL in China to evaluate efficacy，safety and pharmacokinetics(PK) of relma-cel.

Relma-cel was approved by the China National Medical Products Administration(NMPA)in September 2021(Acceptance No:CXSS2000036)for the treatment of adult patients with R/R LBCL after second-line or more systemic therapy.The recommended dose is 1×10\^8 CAR+T cells.The indication for this application is R/R LBCL and the recommended dose is 1×10\^8 CAR+T cells.
