Calypso-based Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH) Radiation Treatments of Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the use of Calypso beacon implants as a way to determine where the lung tumor is located during radiation treatment. The Calypso beacons are small devices that are implanted in the lungs, near the tumor. They are able to send a signal to a tracking system to show where they are, and where the tumor is, as the patient holds their breath for the radiation treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, that this has on the patient and the way they treat the cancer in your lungs.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DEVICE: Calypso Beacon Implantation
feasibility of Calypso transponders, Feasibility is defined as completion of all treatments using the DIBH treatment plan and Calypso transponders., 2 years
reproducibility, We will compare the visual vs no visual biofeedback treatments (done for each patient) by the number of treatment interruptions., 2 years|measure the residual intrafraction tumor motion, will be measured in all 3 dimensions and the euclidean distance will be calculated, which will then be correlated with the normal tissue dosimetry by regression analysis., 2 years
