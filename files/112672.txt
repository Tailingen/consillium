Everolimus in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as everolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Everolimus may also stop the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with stage IV melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: everolimus
Proportion of patients with progression-free disease at 16 weeks, at 16 weeks
Median overall survival, Up to 5 years|Tumor response rate for 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart, Up to 5 years|Toxicity as measured by CTCAE v. 3.0, Up to 5 years|disease progression, at 16 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the median time to disease progression in patients with stage IV malignant melanoma treated with everolimus.

Secondary

* Determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the clinical benefit rates (i.e., stable disease, partial remission, and complete response rates) in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.
* Determine changes in serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral everolimus once daily for 8 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2 months until disease progression and then every 4 months for up to 5 years after registration.
