A Study on the Safety and Efficacy of BST08 in Treating Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is an exploratory clinical trial initiated by an open, single arm researcher to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of BST08 in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer in subjects. This study plans to set up two experimental groups: monotherapy group A: 9x10 \^ 10 BST08 (3 cases) and combination therapy group B: 9x10 \^ 10 BST08+Pabolizhu 200mg Q3W (6 cases).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Single drug group A|BIOLOGICAL: Combined treatment group B
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as the following adverse events related to the investigational drug (definitely related, likely related, possibly related) that occur within 28 days after administration of BST08 (using CTCAE 5.0 or CRS grading criteria): (1) hematological toxicity; (2) Grade 3 non hematological toxicity lasting for more than 7 days, or ≥ Grade 4 non hematological toxicity, regardless of duration, but excluding the following situations; (3)Cytokine Release Syndrome(CRS), From the infusion (Day 0) to Day 28|Maximum ToleratedDose（MTD）, The highest dose of DLT observed in subjects with less than 2/6 (at least 6 subjects in this experimental group received BST08 administration and completed DLT observation), From the infusion (Day 0) to Day 28
Main purpose:

Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BST08 treatment in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Secondary purpose:

1. Evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of BST08 in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer subjects;
2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BST08.
