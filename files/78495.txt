A Combined Cell Therapy Approach to the Treatment of Neuroblastoma
This study adds an experimental treatment with another type of cells, called dendritic cells. It is hoped that these cells may stimulate the immune system to react against neuroblastoma in much the same way that vaccines cause the immune system to react to certain viruses and bacteria. The physicians conducting this study have observed from previous research that neuroblastoma cells can be recognized by the immune system, and that they can be destroyed by immune cells.The main goal of this study is to see if giving participants this additional anti-Neuroblastoma vaccine reduces the risk of relapse following the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.
Neuroblastoma|Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue
PROCEDURE: Autologous Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Transplant|BIOLOGICAL: KLH and Tumor Lysate Pulsed DC Vaccine
Occurrence of Sufficient Tumor Cell Lysate and Dendritic Cells, The feasibility of manufacturing both a hematopoietic progenitor cell graft and multiple tumor lysate pulsed dendritic cell vaccine treatments from the same starting apheresis product, culminating in delivery of the vaccines in the immediate period following myeloablative therapy and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant period (autoHPCT). For what fraction of eligible patients can sufficient tumor cell lysate and dendritic cells, necessary for the production of the dendritic cell vaccines, be obtained? From what fraction would it be possible to make additional vaccines?, Up to 1 year
Occurrence of Dendritic Cell Related Adverse Events, Toxicities resulting from the administration of dendritic cell vaccines in the immediate post hematopoietic cell graft period., Up to 1 year
Rate of Anti-tumor Effect, Whether a discernable anti-tumor effect resulting from autoHPCT therapy combined with dendritic cell vaccine therapy can be detected, either through monitoring of the patient's immune system for evidence of tumor specific immunity, or by monitoring for measureable clinical responses., Up to 1 year
All patients who are enrolled in this study will receive all treatment at All Children's Hospital which is located at 501 6th Ave South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. This includes autologous cell donation by apheresis, high dose cytotoxic therapy conditioning for autologous HPC transplant, post-transplant follow-up care, and all administration of dendritic cell vaccines and blood draws for post therapy immunological monitoring.

All preparation of cellular products, including hematopoietic progenitor cell products for autologous transplantation, and dendritic cell vaccine products, will be carried out in the Cell Therapy Facility located within the Moffitt Cancer Center, which is located at 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612.
