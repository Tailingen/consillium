Benefits of Exercise Training in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Organ-Preserving Definitive Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefit of an individualized resistance exercise-training program during radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Resistance Exercise Training (RET)
The effect of resistance exercise training (RET) versus usual care (UC) on the preservation of lean body mass., Lean body mass will be analyzed at baseline, 3, 5, and 7-weeks (representing the last week of cancer treatment and end of on-site RET), 11-weeks (first clinic follow-up) and 14-weeks (second clinic follow-up and end of home-based RET program) for patients on both arms of the study., 14 weeks
The effect of resistance exercise training (RET) versus usual care (UC) on the preservation of muscle strength., Upper and lower body strength will be analyzed at baseline, 3, 5, and 7-weeks (representing the last week of cancer treatment and end of on-site RET), 11-weeks (first clinic follow-up) and 14-weeks (second clinic follow-up and end of home-based RET program) for patients on both arms of the study., 14 weeks|The effect of resistance exercise training (RET) versus usual care (UC) on six minute walk distance, The distance walked in six minutes at baseline will be compared to the distance walked at 14 weeks for both groups. These finding will then be compared between the groups., 14 weeks
Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are treated with radiation therapy (with/without chemotherapy) to avoid large surgical procedures. However, definitive radiation treatments can cause side effects (like mouth sores, difficulty swallowing) that often cause weight loss. It has been shown that a significant percentage of the weight loss is due to loss of muscle mass. Resistance exercise training works to increase muscle strength and endurance by doing repetitive exercises with weights, weight machines, or resistance bands.
