Safety and Efficacy of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Placebo as Adjuvant Therapy in Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and Complete Radiological Response After Surgical Resection or Local Ablation (MK-3475-937 / KEYNOTE-937)
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and complete radiological response after surgical resection or local ablation. The primary hypotheses of this study are that adjuvant pembrolizumab is superior to placebo with respect to: 1) recurrence-free survival (RFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR); and 2) overall survival (OS).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of disease recurrence (local, regional, or distant) as assessed by BICR or by pathology consistent with HCC if required per the site's standard of care, or death due to any cause (both cancer and non-cancer causes of death), whichever occurs first., Up to ~6 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~8 years
Percentage of Participants who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy can be determined., Up to ~8 years|Percentage of Participants who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy can be determined., Up to ~1 year|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Combined Global Health Status (GHS) / Quality of Life (QoL) Scale Score, The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients, including a combined GHS/QoL (Items 29 and 30) scale. Per protocol, the change from baseline in the combined GHS/QoL score (range: 0-100) will be reported. Higher overall GHS/QoL scores indicate higher GHS/QoL., Baseline and time of last patient reported outcome (PRO) assessment (up to ~5 years)|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ-Hepatocellular Carcinoma Module (EORTC QLQ-HCC18) Scale Score, The EORTC QLQ-HCC18 is an HCC-specific questionnaire, administered in addition to the EORTC QLQ-C30, with scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms/problems. Change from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-HCC18 scale score will be reported., Baseline and time of last PRO assessment (up to ~5 years)|Change from Baseline in European Quality of Life (EuroQoL)-5 Dimensions, 5-level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Health Utility Score, The EQ-5D-5L measured health-related outcomes, assessing 5 health state dimensions (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) on a 5-point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the participant rates their general state of health., Baseline and time of last PRO assessment (up to ~5 years)
