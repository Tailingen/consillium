Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma ≤ 5 cm
The standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery, such as, by hepatic resection or liver transplantation, but less than 20% of HCC patients are suitable for surgery. In the remaining patients with inoperable and advanced HCC, trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) has been widely used but TACE alone rarely produces complete response and commonly develops recurrence. Recently several small studies reported high tumor response and local control rate after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) alone or with TACE for inoperable HCC. This study will evaluate SABR effect with 60 Gy in 3 fractionations for HCC with size of ≤ 5 cm and 3 cm apart from gastrointestinal tract.
