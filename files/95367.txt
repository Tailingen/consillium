CompARE: Escalating Treatment of Intermediate and High-risk Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC)
CompARE is a multicentre, phase III open-label randomised controlled trial using an adaptive, Multi-Arm, Multi-Stage (MAMS) design.
Oropharyngeal Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Durvalumab|PROCEDURE: Radiotherapy
Patient Overall survival (OS), defined as the interval in whole days between date of randomisation and date of death from any cause, from randomisation until date of death from any cause (follow-up until 8 years post-treatment)|Patient Event Free Survival (EFS), defined as the interval in whole days between date of randomisation until date of progression/persistence/recurrence/death, From randomisation until date of progression/persistence/recurrence/death (follow-up until 8 years post-treatment)

Adverse events will be collected post-treatment and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Number of late (up to 2 years post-treatment) toxicity events experienced using CTCAE, Severe (grade 3-5) adverse events will be collected up to 2 years post randomisation, these events will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and version 3.0 for scoring mucositis., From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Number of late (up to 2 years post-treatment) toxicity events experienced using RTOG, Late and severe toxicity events at 2 years post randomisation,will be collected and graded using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Head and neck specific quality of life at 2 years post-randomisation using EORTC C30, Patients will complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C30 questionnaire at baseline, at the end of treatment, and during the follow-up period until 2 years post-treatment, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Head and neck specific Quality of Life at 2 years post-randomisation, Patients will complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) H\&N35 questionnaire at baseline, at the end of treatment, and during the follow-up period until 2 years post-treatment, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Swallowing outcomes assessed using MDADI Questionnaire at 24 months post-chemoradiotherapy, Patients will complete the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) Questionnaire at baseline, at the end of treatment, and during the follow-up period until 2 years post-treatment, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Levels of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) use, PEG use will be assessed at baseline, throughout treatment and during 2 year follow-up period, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Cost effectiveness of treatment as assessed using EuroQol Group (EQ-5D) questionnaire, Patients will complete the EuroQol Group (EQ-5D) questionnaire at baseline, at the end of treatment, and during the follow-up period until 2 years post-treatment, From date of randomisation until 2 year follow-up|Surgical complication rates in each arm for patients who require a neck dissection at 4 months following the 3 month post-chemoradiotherapy assessment scan., Surgical complication rates will be assessed at trial visits if a neck dissection is required at 4 months post-chemotherapy, At 4 months following the 3 month post-chemoradiotherapy scan
The CompARE Trial examines alternative regimens for escalating treatment of intermediate and high-risk oropharyngeal cancer in an adult patient population. The aim is to assess whether escalated radiotherapy, adding surgery or immunotherapy will improve overall survival and quality of life in these patients.
