A Multicenter, Phase 3 Study of IBI343 Monotherapy Versus Treatment of Investigator's Choice in Subjects With Previously Treated, Claudin (CLDN) 18.2-positive, HER2-negative, Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
This is a Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of IBI343 Monotherapy Versus Treatment of Investigator's Choice in Subjects with Previously Treated Claudin (CLDN) 18.2-positive, HER2-negative, Locally Advanced, Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma to compare the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: irinotecan|DRUG: IBI343|DRUG: paclitaxel
progression free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from random assignment in the trial to disease progression or death from any cause., within approximately 20 months|overall survival(OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., within approximately 26 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects in the analysis population who achieve confirmed objective response (CR or PR) as assessed by the IRRC per RECIST v1.1., within approximately 20 months|disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects in the analysis population who achieve disease control (CR, PR, or SD) as determined by the IRRC per RECIST v1.1 criteria., within approximately 20 months|duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first CR or PR to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first for subjects with ORR as assessed by IRRC per RECIST v1.1 criteria., within approximately 20 months|time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from randomization to the first CR or PR for subjects with ORR as assessed by IRRC per RECIST v1.1 criteria., within approximately 20 months|area under the curve (AUC), Area under the curve (AUC) is defined as the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve., within approximately 20 months|maximum concentration (Cmax), Cmax is the highest concentration of a drug in the blood after the drug has been administered and before the administration of a second dose., within approximately 20 months|time to maximum concentration(Tmax), The time it takes for a drug to reach the maximum concentration (Cmax) after administration of the drug, within approximately 20 months|trough concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough is the lowest concentration of a drug in the blood after the drug has been administered and before the administration of a second dose., within approximately 20 months|clearance (CL), The clearance is defined as the plasma volume in the vascular compartment that is cleared of drug per unit of time., within approximately 20 months|volume of distribution (V), Volume of distribution (Vd) is defined as the arrangement or rate of incidence of a drug in the body in relation to the measured plasma concentration., within approximately 20 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) is defined as the sum of both treatment-induced (post-baseline ADA-positive only) and treatment-boosted ADA., within approximately 20 months|neutralizing antibody (NAb), Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) are a subset of binding ADA that bind to the drug and inhibit its pharmacological function by preventing target binding., within approximately 20 months
