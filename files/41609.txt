Artificial Intelligence Analysis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Screening and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer
Use Convolutional Neural Networks Analysis for Classification of Contrast-enhancing Lesions at Multiparametric Breast MRI. Build an abbreviated protocal, and investigate whether an abbreviated protocol was suitable for breast magnetic resonance imaging screening for breast mass in Chinese women, which can shorten the examination time and avoid enhanced imaging while ensuring the accuracy of the diagnosis.
