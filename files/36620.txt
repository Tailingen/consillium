Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of a New Additional Treatment With Tislelizumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare major pathological response(MPR) rate and event-free survival (EFS) in participants receiving tislelizumab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as the new additional treatment followed by tislelizumab as adjuvant treatment versus participants receiving placebo plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment followed by placebo as adjuvant treatment.
