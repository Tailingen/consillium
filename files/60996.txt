A First-in-human Study of SCTB35 in Patients With Relapse/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a Phase I clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of SCTB35 monotherapy, an bispecific antibody, in patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

This is the first-in-human study of SCTB35, containing the dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts. The escalation cohorts will be enrolled to explore the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the accumulated safety data and other available data, and make a recommendation to each dose level of SCTB35 in the escalation cohorts. The expansion cohorts will be initiated after the RP2D is confirmed, and to further compare the preliminary efficacy and safety of SCTB35 at two dose levels that appropriately recommended by SMC.
