Stereotactic Margins in Localized Bronchial Cancer (T1/T2a, N0)
Bronchopulmonary cancer is the first cause of mortality in the world. We want to update the margins used in stereotactic radiotherapy, in the context of localized lung cancer, of non-surgical management.

The investigators wish to redefine the stereotactic radiotherapy margins according to the histological type in localized non-small cell lung cancer.

Indeed, these criteria were previously defined on a smaller cohort, in the context of 3D radiotherapy (mainly T3, T4 tumors). In addition, the incidence of radiation pneumonitis is highly dependent on the irradiated lung volume, which in turn depends on the CTV margins used.
Bronchial Cancer
Retrospective histological study of tumor cell dissemination around the tumor, Files analysed retrospectively from January 01, 2009 to December 31, 2019 will be examined
