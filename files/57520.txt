A Study of LUT014 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With EGFR Inhibitor Induced Acneiform Lesions
The purpose of this phase 1, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LUT014 in adult metastatic colorectal cancer patients with EGFR Inhibitor induced acneiform lesions
EGFR Inhibitor Induced Acneiform Lesions
DRUG: LUT014
Safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose, MTD) of LUT014 topically applied qd for 4 weeks in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) induced acneiform lesions., From Day 0 (following administration of the first dose of study drug) through the Day 55
Maximum concentration (Cmax) in plasma after a single administration and after qd administrations for 8 days, Pre-dose through Day 8|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) in plasma after a single administration and after qd administrations for 8 days, Pre-dose through Day 8|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration (AUC0-T), Pre-dose through Day 8|Area under the concentration-time cure from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-âˆž), Pre-dose through Day 8|Plasma elimination half-life (t1/2), Pre-dose through Day 8|Plasma clearance (CL), Pre-dose through Day 8|Volume of distribution (Vd), Pre-dose through Day 8|NCI, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders grading scale performed locally by the Investigator, The scale contains 5 grades from 1 which demonstrates the mild form of the disease up to 5, defined as death., Pre-dose through Day 55|MASCC Study Group EGFRI-dermatologic AE grading by central reader based on photographs, Pre-dose through Day 55|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-EGFRI 18 (FACT-EGFRI-18) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, FACT-EGFRI-18 is a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire developed to assess the effect of EGFRI on health-related quality of life The questionnaire includes 18 questions, each should be graded from 0, not suffering from this side effect at all, up to 4, suffering greatly from this side effect, Pre-dose through Day 55
The purpose of this phase 1, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LUT014 in adult metastatic colorectal cancer patients with EGFR Inhibitor induced acneiform lesions
