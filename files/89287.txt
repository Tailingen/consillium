CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for EphA2 Positive Malignant Glioma Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with EphA2 positive malignant glioma patients.
EphA2 Positive Malignant Glioma|CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T cell immunotherapy
The effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy, After CAR-T cell infusion,we will detect the persistence of CAR-T cells by flow-cytometric analysis.And we will observe if this CAR T cells can significantly inhibite the tumor growth by discovering the change of tumor volume., 24 weeks
The safety of CAR-T cell immunotherapy (adverse events), After CAR-T cell infusion,we will observe the potential adverse events related to the T-cell infusion such as high fever,jaundice, kidney failure and so on., 6 weeks
Clinical response, Clinical response to T-cell infusion, especially change of tumor volume will be evaluated by comparing disease identified by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or positron emission tomography images., 24 weeks|Progress free disease (PFS), 1 year
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen receptor aiming at EphA2 antigen.After CAR-T cell infusion,At periodic intervals, the investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through this study,the investigators will evaluate the safty and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with EphA2 positive malignant glioma patients.
