Kinetics of Perioperative Circulating DNA in Cancer Surgery
The aim of this study was to determine the kinetics of perioperative circulating DNA in three types of cancer. This first step will enable further studies comparing the potential impact of certain techniques or anesthetic products on cancer surgery.
