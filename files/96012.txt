Overall response rate, The number of patients achieving partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR) after 8 cycles in phase II.

sCR = CR as defined in Primary Outcome measure 2 plus normal free light chain ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.

CR- Negative immunofixation on serum and urine and disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

VGPR = Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or \> 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24 h.

PR- \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and urine M-protein by \>90% or to \< 200 mg/24 h In addition, if present at baseline, a \> 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., At the end of Cycle 8 in Phase II (each cycle is 28 days)
Complete response(CR) and stringent complete response(sCR) rate, The CR and sCR rate after 8 cycles in phase II.

CR- Negative immunofixation on serum and urine and disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow.

sCR = CR as defined in Primary Outcome measure 2 plus normal free light chain ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence., At the end of Cycle 8 in Phase II (each cycle is 28 days)|Progression free survival(PFS), The time relapsed for patients between initiation of study therapy and either disease progression or death, Through study completion, up to 2 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events during the study period as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Through study completion, up to 2 years
The trial has two parts: firstly, to explore the maximum tolerated dosage(MTD) of bendamustine in the combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; secondly, to find out efficacy and safety of pomalidomide and bendamustine with dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in an expanded cohort.
