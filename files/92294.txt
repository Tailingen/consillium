Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against programmed death ligand 1 (PD L1). Avelumab selectively binds to PD L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with programmed death receptor 1 (PD 1), thereby interfering with this key immune checkpoint inhibition pathway. Avelumab is currently being investigated as single agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and various hematological malignancies.

Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable poly (adenosine diphosphate \[ADP\] ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which is cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines harboring gene mutations that compromise deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, an effect referred to as synthetic lethality, and by trapping PARP protein on DNA thereby preventing DNA repair, replication, and transcription.

Avelumab in combination with talazoparib will be investigated in patients with locally advanced (primary or recurrent) or metastatic solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer, recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer (UC), and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
