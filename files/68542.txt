Feasibility Study of a Diary for Allogenic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Patients and Families
Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a specific time during hematological disease management for the patients, theirs relatives and the healthcare team. This heavy treatment is most of the time the last possible curative therapy and could cause many side effects such as infectious diseases and graft versus host reaction. The protective isolation is also a source of physical and psychological isolation. Published studies reported depressive syndrome, anxiety symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorders for patients and their families. Since 10 years ago, diaries are used in intensive care unit to limit these symptoms after a coma. In analogy, the diary for the patients with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be a mean to reduce the psychological adverse impact and long terms consequences. The investigators want to evaluate the psychological impact of a diary on the patients hospitalized for allogenic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation and on their relatives.
