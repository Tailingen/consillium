Drug Concentration Monitoring of Pembrolizumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This observational study explores associations between drug trough-levels and clinical outcomes in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Through-levels of pembrolizumab will be examined in blood samples collected during the first-line treatment period. In addition T-cell responses in peripheral blood and anti-drug antibodies will be monitored. Results of drug trough-levels and T-cell responses will be linked to clinical outcome. 250 patients with NSCLC will be enrolled in this trial.
