Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of a Bra Prototype to Detect Breast Cancer
Phi-Bra is a prospective and monocentric pilot study to assess the diagnostic capability of an innovative bra prototype to detect breast cancer, compared to the current standard of care: the mammography.

The Phi-Bra prototype is designed with sensors measuring different parameters simultaneously such as impedance and temperature.

The bra will be tested on patients without breast lump (American College of Radiology (ACR) 1 et 2 Birads classification) and with breast lump (ACR 4b, c ou ACR 5 Birads classification).

The aim of this pilot study is to compare the results obtained by Phi-Bra to the ones obtained by mammography.

The Phi-Bra study is classified as clinical investigation category 4.4 based on the European Union (EU) regulation (DM 2017/745).
