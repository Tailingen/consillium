A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of GDC-0973 in Combination With GDC-0068 When Administered in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of GDC-0973 and GDC-0068 administered in combination in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Cohorts of patients will receive multiple ascending doses of GDC-0973 and GDC-0068. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
Neoplasms
DRUG: Ipatasertib|DRUG: Cobimetinib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT is defined as 1 of the following toxicities considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drugs: a) Grade (G) ≥3 febrile neutropenia, b) G ≥4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<500/ microliter \[μL\]) lasting \>5 days , c) G ≥4 thrombocytopenia lasting \>2 days, d) G ≥4 anemia, e) G ≥3 elevation of total bilirubin or hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lasting \>3 days, f) Hepatic transaminases \>3 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and an increase in total bilirubin \>2 × ULN without any findings of cholestasis and in the absence of other contributory factors, g) G ≥2 visual changes that do not resolve to baseline within 14 days, h) 1 episode of fasting G 4 hyperglycemia or 3 episodes of fasting, i) G 3 hyperglycemia on separate days within 7 days, j) G ≥4 fasting hypercholesterolemia or triglyceridemia for ≥2 weeks, k) G ≥3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite maximal supportive medications lasting for ≥3 days., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Number of DLTs Categorized as Per the Nature, DLT is defined as 1 of the following toxicities considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drugs: a) G ≥3 febrile neutropenia, b) G ≥4 neutropenia (ANC \<500/μL) lasting \>5 days , c) G ≥4 thrombocytopenia lasting \>2 days, d) G ≥4 anemia, e) G ≥3 elevation of total bilirubin or hepatic transaminase or ALP lasting \>3 days, f) Hepatic transaminases \>3 × ULN and an increase in total bilirubin \>2 × ULN without any findings of cholestasis and in the absence of other contributory factors, g) G ≥2 visual changes that do not resolve to baseline within 14 days, h) 1 episode of fasting G 4 hyperglycemia or 3 episodes of fasting, i) G 3 hyperglycemia on separate days within 7 days, j) G ≥4 fasting hypercholesterolemia or triglyceridemia for ≥2 weeks, k) G ≥3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite maximal supportive medications lasting for ≥3 days. Hematologic, Hepatic and non-hematologic and non-hepatic DLT categories were to be reported., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) in Combination of Cobimetinib and Ipatasertib During Dose-Escalation Stage 1, An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. On the basis of AEs that did not meet protocol-defined DLT criteria (defined in Outcome measure 1) but indicated intolerability of a given dose combination, the combination MTDs were determined (as per investigator) during Stage 1 of the study., Cycle 1 (28 Days)|Number of Participants With At Least One AE Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version (V) 4.0, AE was defined in Outcome Measure 3. AEs were graded as per NCI CTCAE V 4.0 as follows: G 1: asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; G 2: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money and others); G 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self care ADL (refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); G 4: Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; G 5: Death related to AE. If a participant had multiple events of different grades, the highest grade that occurred in that participant was counted., From Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of another anticancer treatment whichever occurred first (Up to 33 months)

Responses were confirmed by repeat assessments ≥4 weeks after initial documentation., Screening, Days 21-28 of Cycle 2, Day 25 (± 3 days) of Cycle 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter till study completion (Up to 33 months)|Duration of Objective Response for Participants With Measurable Disease According to RECIST v1.1, Duration of response, defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented objective response until the time of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause during the study (i.e., within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment)., Screening, Days 21-28 of Cycle 2, Day 25 (± 3 days) of Cycle 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter till study completion (Up to 33 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time for Participants With Measurable Disease According to RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause during the study (i.e., within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment)., Screening, Days 21-28 of Cycle 2, Day 25 (± 3 days) of Cycle 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter till study completion (Up to 33 months)
