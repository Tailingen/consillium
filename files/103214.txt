The Incidence of Hepatitis B Reactivations in Patients Affected by Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia With Ibrutinib
This observational retrospective study will enroll at least 158 patients affected by Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL) with previous HBV exposure (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive with or without anti-HBs) treated with Ibrutinib single agent according to the IWCLL criteria 2008. Patients will be divided into two cohorts, one encompassing patients who received lamivudine and the second one including patients who received no prophylaxis. Each patient will be observed for one year from the first administration of Ibrutinib.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Lamivudine|OTHER: No prophylaxis
Number of patients with hepatitis B reactivation, The primary objective of the Study is to evaluate the incidence of HBV reactivation cases in patients affected by CLL treated with Ibrutinib., After 12 months from the first administration of Ibrutinib
Rate of patients managed by prophylaxis, number of patients managed by lamivudine prophylaxis, After 12 months from the first administration of Ibrutinib|Rate of patients undergoing strict follow-up only, number of patients who did not receive any prophylaxis, After 12 months from the first administration of Ibrutinib|Rate of HBV reactivation according to patient status and prophylaxis, Incidence of HBV reactivation related to patient clinical, biological and therapeutic characteristics, especially in connection with the different incidence of reactivation in patients who received lamivudine prophylaxis versus patients observed with a strict follow-up., After 12 months from the first administration of Ibrutinib|Rate of adverse events during ibrutinib treatment, Safety profile in patients who received lamivudine prophylaxis versus patients observed with a strict follow-up, After 12 months from the first administration of Ibrutinib
This observational retrospective study will enroll at least 158 patients affected by CLL with previous HBV exposure (HBsAg negative, anti HBc positive with or without anti-HBs) treated with Ibrutinib single agent according to the IWCLL criteria 2008. Patients will be divided in two cohorts one encompassing patients receiving lamivudine and the second one including patients who will not be given any prophylaxis. Each patient will be observed for one year from the first administration of Ibrutinib.

The aim of the Study is to evaluate the incidence of HBV reactivation cases in patients affected by CLL treated with Ibrutinib.
