Colorectal Pulmonary Metastases: Pulmonary Metastasectomy Versus Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy
COPPER is an international, multicenter, parallel-arm, phase III randomized controlled trial comparing two local treatment strategies (SABR or metastasectomy) for patients with an indication for local treatment for limited (max. three) colorectal pulmonary metastases

The study is formally endorsed by the Dutch Society of Lung Surgery (NVvL), the Dutch Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery (NVT), the Dutch Society of Radiation Oncology (NVRO). The main objective of the proposed randomized trial is to compare efficacy of SABR to the efficacy of metastasectomy with regards to the primary endpoint (local recurrence free survival at 5 years) in patients with limited colorectal pulmonary metastases. This will determine the most effective local treatment modality. The investigators hypothesize that patients with limited colorectal pulmonary metastases will have non-inferior overall survival after pulmonary metastasectomy compared to SABR, however metastasectomy will result in superior local recurrence free survival at five years when compared to SABR. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that SABR is associated with lower morbidity, comparable quality of life and comparable health care costs compared to metastasectomy. Recurrent metastases are preferably treated by the index treatment to which the patient was randomized, local recurrent metastases are preferably treated by means of cross-over between both arms. Comparing metastasectomy to SABR for patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases will present the international community the evidence needed to better select patients for local radical treatment, while diminishing uncertainty for patients and care givers.
