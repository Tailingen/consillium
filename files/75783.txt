This study is to validate the clinical performance for the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test in an average risk population aged ≥45 years of age.

Stool samples will be collected from subjects ≥45 years of age, of average risk for colon cancer, and scheduled to have a screening colonoscopy. The samples will be collected prior to colonoscopy and will be tested with the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test. The results will be compared with colonoscopy results to determine test performance.
