Camrelizumab in Combination With Apatinib Plus NK Cell for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab in combination with apatinib plus NK cell in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: NK cell
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years)
The disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, stable disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years)|The median progression free survival time (mPFS), The progression free survival time (mPFS) defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression (up to approximately 3 years)|The median overall survival time (mOS), OS is measured from the start date of the Treatment Phase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and the participants who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the participant was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes earlier., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Progression free survival rate at 12 months, The progression free survival time defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall survival rate at 12 months, OS is measured from the start date of the Treatment Phase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and the participants who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the participant was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes earlier., From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)
The IMbrave150 study has demonstrated a new regimen to be superior to sorafenib by reducing 42% of death risk, making "T+A" strategy to be the first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC. Meanwhile, the RESCUE research showed that combined camrelizumab with apatinib has promising objective response rate (ORR=34.3%) and disease control rate (DCR=77.1%) in advanced HCC patients as first-line treatment. Nevertheless, the above researches both show only a fraction of patients benefits from the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with antiangiogenic therapy. Therefore, it's urgently needed to explore better combinational strategies with other treatments to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in combination with antiangiogenic therapy. Recently, Pembrolizumab plus allogeneic NK cells have been proved to be effective in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, there is no study available now analyzing the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab in combination with apatinib plus NK cell in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
