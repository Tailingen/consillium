Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause in Breast Cancer
This randomized, single-blind clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy (PPT) and fractional CO2 vaginal laser therapy in reducing genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) symptoms among breast cancer (BC) survivors. GSM, induced by cancer treatments, is common in BC survivors due to hormonal deprivation, and effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. The study will enroll 210 women diagnosed with GSM following BC treatment, who will be randomly assigned to either three sessions of CO2 vaginal laser therapy or eight sessions of multimodal PPT, which includes pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal non-ablative radiofrequency, education, and moisturizers. Primary outcomes will include perineal pain, sexual function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The hypothesis is that multimodal PPT will lead to greater improvements in pelvic pain, muscle function, and sexual health, with sustained benefits over time. This trial aims to provide evidence for non-invasive, non-hormonal treatments to manage GSM in BC survivors, filling a significant therapeutic gap.

Female Sexual Function (FSFI), The FSFI is a 19-item questionnaire that evaluates sexual function across six domains: de-sire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Each domain is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better sexual function. The total FSFI score ranges from 2 to 36, with higher scores reflecting improved sexual function., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Subjective Pelvic Perineal Pain Intensity, Measured using a 100-mm horizontal Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with "no pain" on the left and "worst imaginable pain" on the right., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), This 40-item questionnaire evaluates HRQoL across four general domains (physical, emo-tional, social, and functional well-being), along with two specific subscales: breast cancer (9 items) and arm symptoms (4 items). The scores for the BC subscale (BCS) and arm subscale range from 0 to 56. The Trial Outcome Index (TOI), a key measure, is the sum of the BCS and the physical and functional well-being subscales, with scores ranging from 0 to 92. The total FACT-B score ranges from 0 to 144, where higher scores indicate better HRQoL., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.
Vaginal Health Index (VHI), This index evaluates five key aspects of vaginal health: elasticity, epithelial integrity, pH, hydration, and fluid volume. Each component is scored from 1 to 5, with lower scores in-dicating poorer vaginal health. A VHI score of ≤15 indicates vaginal atrophy., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Impact of Vaginal Symptoms, The Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging (DIVA) questionnaire assesses the impact of vulvovaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women across four domains: activities of daily living, emotional well-being, sexual functioning, and self-concept/body image. The ques-tionnaire consists of 22 items, each scored on a scale from 0 to 4. The score for each domain is calculated by averaging the scores of its items, with higher scores indicating a greater impact of vaginal symptoms., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Pelvic Floor Dysfunction Symptoms, Assessed using the Spanish version of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-Short Form (PFDI-20), which consists of 20 questions across three subscales: prolapse, anal, and uri-nary symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating greater distress., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Treatment Satisfaction, Satisfaction with the treatment will be assessed using a numerical verbal scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no satisfaction and 10 indicates excellent satisfaction. This evaluation will begin with assessment A1., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Pelvic Floor Muscle Tone, Measured using vaginal dynamometry with the Pelvimetre™ (Phenix Vivaltis, Montpel-lier, France). For the assessment, the participant will be in lithotomy position, and the tone of the pelvic floor muscles will be considered when the vaginal device is inserted, and the participant perceives that her muscles are relaxed., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Pelvic Floor Muscle Strength, Measured using vaginal dynamometry with the Pelvimetre™ (Phenix Vivaltis, Montpel-lier, France). The participant, in the lithotomy position, will perform three maximum contractions of the pelvic floor muscles. The average value of the three contractions will be considered., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Pelvic Floor Muscle Contraction, Three maximum pelvic floor muscle contractions will be requested in lithotomy position, and the distance of the urogenital hiatus will be assessed using transperineal ultrasound (Mindray M7, Shenzhen, China)., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.|Pelvic Floor Elasticity, In the lithotomy position, an inspiratory apnea Valsalva maneuver will be requested, and the distance of the urogenital hiatus will be assessed using transperineal ultrasound (Mindray M7, Shenzhen, China)., Baseline (before intervention) (A0); immediately after completing the intervention (A1), and at 3 months (A2), 6 months (A3), and 12 months (A4) following A1.
Background: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) induced by breast cancer (BC) treatments is highly prevalent among BC survivors due to the abrupt hor-monal deprivation caused by oncological therapies. Given the contraindication of hor-monal treatments in this population, there is a critical need for effective non-hormonal alternatives to alleviate GSM symptoms.

Objectives: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of multimodal pelvic floor physiotherapy (PPT)-comprising pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal non-ablative radiofrequency, pelvic health education, and vaginal moisturizers-against fractional CO2 vaginal laser therapy in reducing GSM symptoms among BC survivors.

Methods: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial will be conducted with 210 women diagnosed with GSM after undergoing BC treatment. Participants will be ran-domly assigned (1:1) to receive either three sessions of CO2 vaginal laser therapy or eight face-to-face sessions of multimodal PPT. Assessments will be performed at base-line, immediately after the intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12- months post-intervention. Primary outcomes will include perineal pain, sexual function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to evaluate the costs of each intervention relative to the changes in clinical outcomes, and any ad-verse effects will be monitored throughout the study.

Results: It is hypothesized that women undergoing multimodal PPT will show greater reductions in pelvic pain and improvements in pelvic floor muscle strength, endurance, and relaxation compared to those receiving CO2 laser therapy, alongside enhanced sexual function and HRQoL. These improvements are expected to be sus-tained in the short and medium term through continued adherence to home exercises and educational strategies.

Conclusions: This study aims to provide evidence for novel, non-invasive, and non-hormonal treatment strategies to manage GSM in BC survivors, addressing an important gap in the therapeutic landscape for this population.
