Prophylactic Cholecystectomy is Not Mandatory in Patients Candidate to the Resection for Small Intestine Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: a Propensity Score-matched and Cost-minimization Analysis
To evaluate two competitive strategies in patients undergoing resection of Small-intestine Neuroendocrine neoplasms (Si-NEN): Prophylactic Cholecystectomy (PC) versus On-demand delayed cholecystectomy

This is a retrospective study based on 230 Si-NENs candidates to the primary tumor resection. Patients were divided into two arms: PC and OC. Propensity score matching was performed, reporting the d value. The primary outcome was the re-hospitalization rate for any cause. The secondary endpoints were the re-hospitalization rate for biliary stone disease (BSD), the mean number of re-hospitalization (any cause and BSD), the complication rate (all and severe), and the total costs. A P-value \< 0.05 was considered significant, and NNT\< 10 was considered clinically relevant.
