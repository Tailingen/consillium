Comparing NUC-1031 Plus Cisplatin to Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
NuTide:121 compares NUC-1031 with gemcitabine, both in combination with cisplatin, in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer.

The primary hypotheses are:

* The combination of NUC-1031 plus cisplatin prolongs overall survival compared to the gemcitabine plus cisplatin standard of care
* The combination of NUC-1031 plus cisplatin increases overall response rate compared to the gemcitabine plus cisplatin standard of care
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: NUC-1031|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of patients achieving a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment as assessed by blinded independent review according to RECIST v1.1 criteria. ORR = patients with CR + patients with PR, where" CR = disappearance of all target lesions PR = at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters This outcome was assessed in the population of patients with measurable disease at baseline who were also randomized â‰¥28 weeks before the data cut-off (ITTMD28). Patients were to receive a confirmatory scan 28-42 days after response is first observed., Evaluated at Screening (baseline) then every 9 weeks from treatment start (C1D1), or every 12 weeks if treatment is stopped with no evidence of progression, until disease progression or death from any cause up to the end of study, an average of 6 months.|Overall Survival (OS), The median time, in months, from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For patients who were alive at the time of a data cut-off or were permanently lost to follow up, duration of OS was censored at the date at which they were last known to be alive., From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months on average
