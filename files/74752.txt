Preoperative 5-Day Radiotherapy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this research study is to preserve healthy tissue around the cancer on the arm(s) and/or leg(s) using Hypofractionated radiotherapy, while treating the cancer and preventing it from spreading to other areas of the body.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy
HFRT Safety, Evaluate the safety of 5-day HFRT as measured by the rates of major wound complications occurring within 120 days of surgery., 6 months
Treatment Response, Evaluate treatment response to 5-day HFRT as measured by pathologic response. Pathologic response is defined as percent necrosis and percent viable tumor., 6 months|Safety Profile, Evaluate the safety profile of 5-day HFRT, specifically the proportion of patients experiencing acute toxicities and late toxicities, 6 months
Control Rate, Estimate 3-year local control rate of 5-day HFRT, 3 years|Relapse-free Survival, Estimate 3-year relapse-free survival. Relapse-free survival is defined as the time from surgery to disease recurrence or death from any cause. 3-year overall survival of 5-day HFRT, 3 years|Overall Survival, 3-year overall survival of 5-day HFRT. Overall survival is defined as the time from RT initiation to death from any cause., 3 years
This study is for subjects that have been diagnosed with cancer in their arm, leg, or trunk (the part of the body that involves the chest, abdomen, and pelvis). The purpose of this research study is to preserve healthy tissue around the cancer on the arm(s) and/or leg(s) using Hypofractionated radiotherapy, while treating the cancer and preventing it from spreading to other areas of the body. This study will look at early side effects and effectiveness of preoperative 5-day Hypofractionated radiotherapy. Active participation in the study will take about 12 visits and are completed once the participant has a 6-month post-operation visit.
