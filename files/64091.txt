Robotic Versus Abdominal Surgery for Endometrial Cancer
This study is intended to explore differences in oncologic and surgical safety between robotic assisted laparoscopy and conventional abdominal surgery for high risk endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Robotic surgery|PROCEDURE: Abdominal surgery
Number of harvested lymph nodes, Extracted lymphatic tissue from 3 stations (above inferior mesenteric artery, below inferior mesenteric artery, pelvic) is analysed by a pathologist and the number of nodes for each station recorded and compared between the two groups, 2 years
Recurrence of cancer, Cancer recurrences will be recorded up to 3 years after surgery and categorized according to anatomical site, 3 years|Lymphatic side-effects, Lymphatic side-effects will be monitored by repeated computed tomography (CT) 3 months and 12 months after surgery. Enrolled women will be asked specific, validated questions at follow-up, 2 years|Quality of life, All included participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire (EORTC) to assess quality of life before and 1 year after surgery, 2 years|Healthcare cost, All costs related to each procedure including complications, re-admissions, rehabilitation, medication, radiology will be compared after 1 year., 2 years
Hypothesis: Robotic assisted laparoscopy (RAL)is equal in terms of oncologic and surgical safety as conventional abdominal surgery (AS) for high risk endometrial cancer (EC).

Methods: Women with high risk EC (defined as high grade endometrial, clear cell or serous) are randomized to either RAL or AS. Both groups will undergo complete surgical staging (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortal lymphadenectomy)

Primary endpoint: Number of harvested lymph nodes per station Secondary endpoints: Recurrences up to 3 year after surgery. Lymphatic side-effects, quality of life, cost, surgical morbidity.
