Neoadjuvant Chemo-hypoRT Plus PD-1 Antibody (Tislelizumab) in Resectable LA-G/GEJ
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Although the consensus on the surgical treatment has resulted in the improvement of curative effect during the past decades, controversies remained for the perioperative therapy of gastric cancer, especially in the selection of the optimal neoadjuvant regimens. Immunotherapy with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody has demonstrated moderate efficacy in selected patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HypoRT) may act synergistically with immunotherapy to enhance antitumor responses. This phase II trial study want to exploit the efficacy and safety to give PD-1 antibody (Tislelizumab) with combination chemotherapy and HypoRT before surgery in treating adult patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

1. This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage needs 9 participants, if â‰¥1 participants acquire remission, then the study will move on to the second stage and enroll the rest 10 participants. Taking into account a drop-out rate of about 5%, we planned to enroll 21 patients.
2. Target population: patients with resectable locally advanced resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (cT1-2N+M0/T3-T4aNanyM0).
3. Trial design: This is a monocenter, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemo-hypofractionated radiotherapy plus PD-1 antibody (Tislelizumab) in patients with locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.
