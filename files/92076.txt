Study on the Value of Three DWI Scanning Sequences in Staging of Gastric Cancer
Accurate staging is critical for effective gastric cancer treatment planning. Conventional DWI (C-DWI) has limitations in image quality due to magnetic field inhomogeneity, which hampers precise T staging.

This study aims to compare the image quality and T staging accuracy of C-DWI, TSE-DWI, and ZOOMit-DWI (Z-DWI) sequences in MRI examinations of gastric cancer patients.

A prospective study plan to enroll 72 gastric cancer patients undergoing preoperative MRI with C-DWI, TSE-DWI, and Z-DWI sequences using a 3.0 T scanner. Quantitative metrics (ADC, SNR, CNR) and image quality were evaluated. T staging accuracy was assessed by comparing MRI results with postoperative pathological staging using ROC analysis.
