ctDNA-Directed Post-Hepatectomy Chemotherapy for Patients With Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastases
To determine if the detection of ctDNA after surgical resection of CLM can stratify patients into high and low-risk cohorts for early disease recurrence in order to inform post-operative adjuvant therapy.
Liver Metastases
DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-FLUOROURACIL|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab
To establish the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate following liver resection of CLM with curative intent among ctDNA-negative patients who receive risk-stratified postoperative chemotherapy, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

• To assess 1-year recurrence-free survival rate following liver resection of CLM with curative intent among ctDNA-negative patients who receive risk-stratified postoperative chemotherapy

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess recurrence-free survival following liver resection of CLM with curative intent among ctDNA-positive patients
* To assess overall survival following liver resection among ctDNA-negative and ctDNA-positive patients
* To evaluate the proportion of ctDNA-negative at 1-year post-resection
* To compare survival of ctDNA-negative patients undergoing ctDNA-guided postoperative chemotherapy to historical controls
* To evaluate proportion of patients in each arm who change chemotherapy in response to ctDNA measurement
* To delineate the pattern of disease recurrence
* To assess ctDNA sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease recurrence
* To evaluate MDASI-GI during the course of postoperative therapy
* To evaluate and correlate patient molecular subtypes and characterization of tumor biologic factors that are associated with ctDNA detection
* To evaluate surgery-related adverse events occurring up to 90 days after surgery, and chemo-related adverse events occurring up to 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy

Outcome Measures:

Primary:

• Recurrence-free survival at 1-year post-hepatectomy among ctDNA-negative patients

Secondary:

* Recurrence-free survival at 1-year post-hepatectomy among ctDNA-positive patients
* Overall survival (OS) among ctDNA-negative and ctDNA-positive patients
* ctDNA-negativity at 1-year post-resection
* Proportion of patients in each group with chemotherapy regimen change in response to ctDNA dynamics
* Pattern of disease recurrence (i.e., liver, systemic, salvageable vs. unsalvageable)
* ctDNA sensitivity/specificity for recurrent disease overall by timepoint
* MDASI-GI at clinic visits during course of postoperative therapy
* Tumor radiologic, histologic, and molecular profiling and correlative characterization based upon ctDNA detection
* Adverse events
