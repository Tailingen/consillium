Hepatocellular Carcinoma 3 Gene Methylation Combination Detection Kit (PCR Fluorescent Probe Method) Multicenter Clinical Trial
The purpose of this clinical trial was to systematically study the clinical performance and accuracy of the human DAB2IP, CHFR and GRASP gene methylation combined test kit (PCR-fluorescent probe method) produced by Jiangsu Kunyuan Biotechnology Co., LTD. The test reagent was compared with the clinical reference standard (pathological diagnosis and/or imaging diagnosis) to verify the clinical performance of the product. At the same time, for each gene that can be detected by the assessment reagent, the digital PCR method is used as a comparison method to verify the accuracy of the assessment reagent detection. The validity of the assessment reagent can meet the requirements of its intended use from the above two aspects, and provide sufficient clinical evaluation data for the registration and application of the product in China.
