Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) Versus Lugol Chromoendoscopy in the Detection of Oesophagus Squamous Cell Carcinoma in High Risk Population
Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) is as sensitive as Lugol chromoendoscopy to detect oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and appears more specific than Lugol chromoendoscopy in expert centres but its specificity in current practice is not known. This study aimed to prove the superiority of NBI specificity over Lugol chromoendoscopy to detect oesophageal SCC and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in current practice (including tertiary care centres, local hospitals and private clinics).
