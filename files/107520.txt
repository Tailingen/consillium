Lung Dose in Patients Treated With Yttrium-90 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To Calculate the amount radiation the lung receives in patients receiving Yttrium-90 for Liver Cancer.
Liver Neoplasms
Lung dose measured with actual lung mass vs Lung dose measured with conventional method., Lung dose measured with actual lung mass vs Lung dose measured with conventional method which assumes 1 kg for all patients.

Patient will be receiving this treatment even if not enrolled on this study.

The study is NOT about the intervention given to the patient. The study is to determine the best way to measure the radiation dose normal tissue (the lung specifically) receives during this standard treatment., 1 month after treatment.
To calculate the delivered lung dose using quantitative volumetric analysis in a cohort of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who undergo selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphereÂ®)-and compare this analysis to the lung dose estimated by established criteria. In addition, this study, will summarize the pre and post-treatment clinical data to describe the URMC Y-90 experience.
