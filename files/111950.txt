Personalized DC Vaccine for Lung Cancer
The study is aimed to the test the efficacy and safety of neoantigen-primed dendritic cell (DC) cell vaccine therapy for refractory non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
BIOLOGICAL: DC vaccine
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 3 months after the last administration of cells
objective response rate, Number of participants with objective responses as assayed by RECIST 1.1, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Patients with pathological confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with no standard treatment are enrolled. The patients fails in previous at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and 1 line of targeted therapy where applicable. This is a prospective exploratory trial. Patients' rebiopsy tumor tissues are subsequent to whole exosome sequencing and possible neoantigens are identified. DC is in vitro primed with synthesized peptides. Both adverse events and responses are recorded.
