Study of Telisotuzumab Vedotin (ABBV-399) in Participants With Previously Treated c-Met+ Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is designed to identify the target Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) population(s) that overexpress c-Met (c-Met+) best suited for telisotuzumab vedotin therapy in the second line or third line setting (Stage 1) and then to expand the group(s) to further evaluate efficacy in the selected population(s) (Stage 2). After the Stage 2 global enrollment is completed, an additional cohort at an alternate dose level will evaluate the safety and efficacy of telisotuzumab vedotin (Stage 3).
