Endostar Combination With Chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI in Lung Cancer Rechallenging Treatment After Acquired Resistance.
Here we are going to find a method by using available multiple drugs including angiogenesis medicine - Endostar to treat lung cancer patients who acquired resistence from EGFR-TKI but have responsed to it before.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Recombinant human endostatin|DRUG: Placebo
Objective Responese Rate, in two months
Progression Free Survival, up to six months|Overall Survial, follow up every two months, about two years|Number of Serious Adverse Events, within two months
Lung cancer patients who received epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors(EGFR-TKI) will acquiring resistance to the drug. This is a study of using Endostar, an angiogentic medicine, combination with chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI in lung cancer rechallenging treatment after resistance of EGFR-TKI and progression disease.
