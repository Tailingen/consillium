Fruquintinib With PD-1 Inhibitors Versus TAS-102 With Bevacizumab in Late-Line mCRC
Fruquintinib with PD-1 inhibitors (FP) and TAS-102 with bevacizumab (TB) are two common therapies for patients with previous-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, it's still not clear that which therapy can bring better prognosis. Our study sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib with PD-1 Inhibitors versus TAS-102 with bevacizumab in Late-Line mCRC between July 2019 to October 2022July 2019 and June 2021 at the Hunan Cancer Hospital.

DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: PD-1 inhibitors|DRUG: Trifluridine/Tipiracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival defined as the observed time elapsed between the date of commencement of treatment and the date of death due to any cause, Approximately 12 months
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival defined as the time elapsed between the date of commencement of treatment and the date of radiologic tumour progression according to RECIST version 1.1 by investigator's judgement or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Approximately 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) was regarded as the proportion of complete responses (CRs) and partial responses (PRs) according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria and using investigator's tumor assessment, Approximately 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate has been defined as the addition of (CR + PR) rate and also stable disease (SD) rate, Approximately 12 months|Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAE), Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAE) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, including serious adverse events (SAEs), Approximately 12 months
This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in Hunan Cancer Hospital. Patients (pts) with mCRC who had received at least the 2nd line treatment were eligible. Propensity score (PS) would be calculated to balance the baseline characteristics of two arms. Overall survival (OS) was set as the primary endpoint. From July 2019 to October 2022, 106 eligible pts in total were enrolled. According to the treatment received, 72 and 34 pts were respectively allocated into FP cohort and TB cohort.
