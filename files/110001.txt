High or Standard Intensity Radiation Therapy After Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Nab-paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery
This randomized phase II trial studies how well high or standard intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) work compared with gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel alone in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as capecitabine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation therapy in different ways and adding chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether high intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel is more effective than standard intensity radiochemotherapy after gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel alone in treating pancreatic cancer.

Overall Survival, Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and was to be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Given the limited follow-up due to early closure and termination of data collection, only the number of patients last reported to be alive at time of study termination is reported., From randomization until last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after a total of 140 deaths were reported within the pairing of each radiation arm with the chemotherapy alone arm. Maximum follow-up at time of study termination was 8.3 months.
Overall Survival Within SMAD4 Subsets, Survival time is defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause and was to be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Given the limited follow-up due to early closure and termination of data collection, only the number of patients last reported to be alive at time of study termination is reported. Patients are categorized by SMAD4 status of "intact" (positive nuclear labeling is observed of the neoplastic cells ), "loss" (no labeling observed of the neoplastic cells) , or "undetermined" (insufficient material for immunostaining or results are equivocal). This study terminated early with only 20 registered (346 planned) and 13 randomized (288 planned). There are no proven results as to which category has better incomes, but this study hypothesizes that "intact" is highly correlated with local failures and "loss" is highly correlated with widespread metastasis, in which case "intact" would correspond with positive results relative to "loss"., From randomization until last follow-up. Analysis was to occur after a total of 140 deaths were reported within the pairing of each radiation arm with the chemotherapy alone arm. Maximum follow-up at time of study termination was 8.3 months.|Patterns of Failure (Local and Metastatic Failure), Local progression is defined as least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the primary, taking as reference the baseline sum. Given the inherent inaccuracy in determining size of a primary pancreatic carcinoma, in addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and progression must be demonstrated on at least two sequential scans. Metastatic failure is defined as metastatic disease. Local and distant failure were to be estimated by the cumulative incidence method. Given the limited follow-up due to early closure and termination of data collection, only the number of patients with failure is reported., From randomization until last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at time of study termination was 8.3 months.|Correlation Between SMAD4 Status Determined by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Genetic SMAD4 Status, Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* I. To determine if intensified radiochemotherapy following gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year overall survival (OS) from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone.
* II. To determine if standard radiochemotherapy, following gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year OS from 10% to 22.5% as compared to chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* I. To evaluate patterns of failure (local and systemic progression) by SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) status and intensity of radiation therapy.
* II. To evaluate the impact of radiochemotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 intact patients.
* III. To evaluate adverse events associated with the treatments.
* IV. To evaluate correlation between SMAD4 status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and genetic SMAD4 status.

Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months.
