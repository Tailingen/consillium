Neoadjuvant Therapy vs Standard Therapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Phase II, Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Study evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer with standard chemoradiation Defined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Neoadjuvant Therapy in Rectal Cancer, Radiotherapy, FOLFOX
RADIATION: Radiotherapy 50 Gy|DRUG: Fluorouracil/folic acid|DRUG: Chemotherapy in regimen with Oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, folinic acid (FOLFOX4)|RADIATION: Radiotherapy 50 Gy
disease-free survival, To compare the 3-year disease-free survival between the investigational arm and the control arm., 3 year
Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from randomisation to the time of occurrence of the first death regardless to its cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow up., 7 year
This is a biomedical research, phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized study, comparing neoadjuvant CT with FOLFOX4, versus immediate preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Randomization in a 1: 1 ratio, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and comparability of new standard preoperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer compared to routine chemoradiation.
