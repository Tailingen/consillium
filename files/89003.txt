Study of TRC105 and Bevacizumab in Patients With Refractory Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)
The purpose of the study is to determine the overall response rate of single agent TRC105 and the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab in patients with refractory GTN (including choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)). Up to 30 patients will be treated.

Overall Response Rate on TRC105 Alone and on the Combination of TRC105 and Bevacizumab, Antitumor Activity of Single Agent TRC105 and the Combination of TRC105 and Bevacizumab will be assessed via RECIST 1.1 and by measuring circulating bHCG. Disease progression is defined as \>20% increase (the absolute increase must be ≥10 IU/L) above the nadir on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Partial response is defined as a hCG decrease of 50% or more from starting value on consecutive measurements; Complete response will be defined as normalization of hCG on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Stable disease will be defined as the absence of response or progression on 3 consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks., 8 weeks
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) via Serum hCG levels and response evaluation according to RECIST version 1.1 as a preliminary measure of the antitumor activity of TRC105. Disease progression is defined as \>20% increase (the absolute increase must be ≥10 IU/L) above the nadir on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Partial response is defined as a hCG decrease of 50% or more from starting value on consecutive measurements; Complete response will be defined as normalization of hCG on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Stable disease will be defined as the absence of response or progression on 3 consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks. Patients must have screening (baseline) and at least one on study CT scan to be considered evaluable., 8 weeks|Overall Response Rate on Bevacizumab Alone, Overall Response Rate on bevacizumab alone according to RECIST 1.1 in combination with serum hCG levels. Disease progression is defined as \>20% increase (the absolute increase must be ≥10 IU/L) above the nadir on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Partial response is defined as a hCG decrease of 50% or more from starting value on consecutive measurements; Complete response will be defined as normalization of hCG on consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks; Stable disease will be defined as the absence of response or progression on 3 consecutive measurements separated by at least two weeks., 8 weeks|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of TRC105., Mean serum TRC105 concentrations were assessed at cycle 1 and cycle 2 on day 1, 8, 15, and 22 and on day 1 of every subsequent cycle using validated methods in order to determine the Cmax of TRC105, cycle 2 day 1 (28 days after initiation of dosing)|TRC105 Immunogenicity as Assessed by Anti-Product Antibody (APA)., Anti-Product Antibody (APA) concentrations will be measured using validated ELISA methods at the time points specified in the protocol. APA concentrations will be evaluated in the context of pharmacokinetic parameters and AE profiles. Number of patients with positive APA titers on study will be reported., 8 weeks|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, Determine frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03), 20 months
TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to endoglin, an angiogenic target highly expressed on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types. TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab. These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular and has been shown to densely express endoglin.
