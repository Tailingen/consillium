Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Isoflavone
Assess the effect of soy protein/isoflavones serum PSA levels in patients previously treated with radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation therapy., Baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
Assess the effect of soy protein/isoflavones on serum testosterone, isoflavone metabolites, and cholesterol. Assess the effect of soy protein/isoflavones on quality of life of these patients., Baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
* Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history, physical examination (including digital rectal examination), serum PSA, free/total testosterone, lipids, serum isoflavone levels (genistein, daidzein, and equol), and assessment of quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Prostate, FACT-P questionnaire).
* Whole blood will be obtained prior to initiation of the study to assess for DNA polymorphism.
* Follow-up serum PSA levels to assess efficacy were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initiation of treatment.
* Medical history, physical examination, serum testosterone, lipids, isoflavone, and quality of life were assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment.
