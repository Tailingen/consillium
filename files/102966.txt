The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version was utilized for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 where Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: Life-threatening, urgent intervention required; Grade 5: Death related to AE., From screening (Day -28 to -1) until Safety follow-up (30 days after last dose of Ceralasertib monotherapy or 90 days after last dose of Ceralasertib+Durvalumab combination) or data cut-off (2 years), whichever occurred first|Biopsy Study: Number of Participants With Presence of PD-L1 Overtime, Pre-treatment presence and/or on-treatment and/or off-treatment changes in PD-L1 was assessed to collect tumour tissue samples, or utilise residual samples, for the analysis of tumoural biomarkers that change following treatment with ceralasertib was assessed.

Biopsy sub-study: This is an open-label, non-randomised, sub-study planned in participants suitable for 3 mandatory biopsies. Serial tumour biopsies are mandated in participants recruited into the sub-study and will be taken at baseline during the screening period, during treatment with ceralasertib monotherapy and during the off-treatment period of ceralasertib monotherapy.
