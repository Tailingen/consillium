Phase I/II Study of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-R2 in PSMA-positive Prostate Cancer, With/Without Prior 177Lu-PSMA RLT
This is an open label, phase I/II, multi-center study in adult participants with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) and with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have received prior anti-cancer treatment and have a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan. The purpose of this study is to learn if the study drug, \[225Ac\]Ac-PSMA-R2, is safe and tolerable, and has anti-tumor activity in treated patients.

Dose Escalation: Incidence and severity of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), Analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs) and Deaths due to AEs, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., Up to 6 months after the last 225Ac-PSMA-R2 dose administration|Dose Expansion: Incidence and severity of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), Analysis of frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Event (TESAEs) and Deaths due to AEs, through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Frequency of dose interruptions, reductions, discontinuations, and dose intensity by treatment., Tolerability of study drug will be assessed by summarizing the number of and the reasons for dose delays and dose reductions. Dose intensity will also be tabulated by treatment group., At day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle = up to 6 weeks)|Dose Escalation: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in soft tissue., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Best Overall Response (BOR), Best Overall Response (BOR) is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of the first administration of 225Ac-PSMA-R2 to the date of radiographic progression as outlined in PCWG3 modified RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of the first administration of 225Ac-PSMA-R2 to the date of death due to any cause., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Time to first Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), Time to a first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) is defined as the time (in months) from the first administration of 225Ac-PSMA-R2 to the date of SSE or death due to any cause., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation & Dose Expansion: Percentage of Participants with Biochemical Response by ALP and LDH, Biochemical responses by Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) will be measured as best percentage change from baseline, Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion: Percentage of Participants with Biochemical Response by PSA, Biochemical responses as measured by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA): PSA50 response is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved â‰¥50% decrease from baseline at any time., Assessed up to approximately 15 months.|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion: Pharmacokinetics characterization of 225Ac-PSMA-R2, Venous whole blood samples will be collected for activity-based pharmacokinetics characterization., At Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 at different measurement times, and one timepoint at C1 D2, C1 D3 and C1 D4|Dose escalation and dose expansion: To assess the impact of 225Ac-PSMA-R2 on participant reported outcomes, Change in heath related quality of life., From baseline until 24 months after the end of treatment
The study contains three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3). Each group has a dose escalation part at a specific dosing schedule followed by a dose expansion part. The dose escalation parts in each group within each dosing schedule will establish the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose for expansion (MTDs/RDEs) of the 225Ac-PSMA-R2. Dose escalation decisions will be made by the Investigators and Novartis during dose escalation meetings (DEMs) based on safety and tolerability information. The dose expansion parts in each group group/dosing schedule will assess the anti-tumor activity in the mHSPC and mCRPC populations.
