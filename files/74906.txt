Lenalidomide, Ixazomib, and Rituximab as Front-Line Therapy for High Risk Indolent B-Cell Lymphoma
A Phase IB/II Trial of Lenalidomide (Revlimid®), Ixazomib and Rituximab (RIXAR) as Front-line Therapy for High Risk Indolent B cell Lymphoma
B Cell Lymphoma|Lymphoma
DRUG: Ixazomib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Oral Ixazomib, To determine the MTD of the combination of oral ixazomib and lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma having high tumor burden by GELF criteria or FLIPI 3-5.

MTD will be determined using the first 12 participants 15 months after beginning treatment, 15 months after beginning treatment
Overall Response Rate, These criteria are based on the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and include the following categories: Complete Response (CR)(Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease, and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy), Partial Response (PR) (A ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or extranodal masses), Stable Disease (SD) (Failing to attain the criteria needed for a PR or CR, but not fulfilling those for progressive disease), Relapse and Progression (PD) (For determination of relapsed and progressive disease, lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm, regardless of the short axis)., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment|Duration of Response, Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment|Time to Progression, Duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment|Progression Free Survival, A number of participants who survived without disease progression

PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure (event-free survival) is defined as the time from study entry to first event of disease progression, discontinuation of treatment for any reason, initiation of new treatment, or death., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the date of study entry to the date of death., Up to 15 months after beginning treatment
Primary:

To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of the combination of oral ixazomib and lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma having high tumor burden by GELF criteria or FLIPI 3-5

Secondary:

* To determine overall response rate in an expanded cohort at the MTD for follicular lymphoma and for non-follicular low-grade B cell lymphoma
* Duration of response, time to progression, progression free survival, time to treatment failure and overall survival
* Create tissue microarray from paraffin embedded tissue for future studies.
* Assessment of baseline lymphocyte subsets as prognostic markers.

Overview of Study Design:

This study combines three classes of agents that have non-overlapping mechanisms of action and toxicity profiles, with each pair having demonstrated clinical evidence of benefit without unexpected toxicity. We use the lenalidomide-rituximab backbone, feasible and active in lymphoma, and add a novel oral proteasome inhibitor to potentially enhance efficacy, minimize toxicity and limit patient visits for treatment.

Patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma having high tumor burden by GELF criteria or FLIPI 3-5 will be treated with the combination of oral ixazomib + lenalidomide + rituximab.

The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of this regimen. The study will use a standard 3 + 3 design for determination of MTD during cycle 1. There will be three dose levels for escalation, followed by two expansion cohorts of 12 patients each at the MTD, one cohort with follicular lymphoma and one cohort with non-follicular low-grade lymphoma (SLL, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic).
