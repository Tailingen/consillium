A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of CN1
This study is the first-in-human clinical trial of CN1 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and preliminary efficacy of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumors or B-cell lymphoma. This study will provide a basis for further clinical development of CN1.
Advanced Solid Tumor|B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: CN1
To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of CN1 administered to patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma., DLT is measured in the observation period of 21 days after the first dose i.e. starting dose level 0.03 mg/kg. if the enrolled subject does not experience a study drug related Grade 2 or higher adverse event (AE) per NCI-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, the subject will start to receive the next designated dose level of 0.3 mg/kg in the second 21 days dosing cycle., 21 Days after the first dose i.e. starting dose level 0.03 mg/kg
To assess the safety and tolerability of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Physical Exam, Measured by incidence of abnormal physical examination findings., From baseline(Week 1) to 90 days after the last dose|To assess the safety and tolerability of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events, Measured by incidence of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events. All AEs will be summarized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) v23.0 or higher and the severity will be categorized by CTCAE v5.0. The summary of all AEs will be focused on the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A TEAE is defined as any AE that starts after the first dose of study drug till 90 +/- 7 days after the last dose of study drug., From baseline(Week 1) to 90 days after the last dose|To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Area under the plasma concentration-time curve, The following parameter is used for evaluation during PK assessments: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t, AUC0- ∞, AUC0-τ), Measurement is through treatment completion starting from Week 1 up to End of Treatment, assessed up to an average of 10 weeks.|To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Tmax, The following parameter is used for evaluation during PK assessments: Time to maximum (Tmax), Measurement is through treatment completion starting from Week 1 up to End of Treatment, assessed up to an average of 10 weeks.|To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Apparent volume of distribution at steady state, The following parameter is used for evaluation during PK assessments: Apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), Measurement is through treatment completion starting from Week 1 up to End of Treatment, assessed up to an average of 10 weeks.|To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through Accumulation factor based on AUC 0-τ, The following parameter is used for evaluation during PK assessments: Accumulation factor based on AUC 0-τ (R AUC0-τ), Measurement is through treatment completion starting from Week 1 up to End of Treatment, assessed up to an average of 10 weeks.|To assess the immunogenicity to CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through ADA testing, A validated analysis method will be used for detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA)., Measurement is through treatment completion starting from Week 1 up to End of Treatment, assessed up to an average of 10 weeks.|To explore the anti-tumor efficacy of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through ORR analysis, Assessed by the number of participants with objective response (ORR), Measurement is from Week 1, until the 90 days after the last dose, date of first documented progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, subject being lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.|To explore the anti-tumor efficacy of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through DCR analysis., Assessed by the number of participants with Disease Control (DCR), Measurement is from Week 1, until the 90 days after the last dose, date of first documented progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, subject being lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.|To explore the anti-tumor efficacy of CN1 in patients with advanced solid tumor or B-cell lymphoma through DoR analysis., Assessed by the number of participants with Duration of Response (DoR), Measurement is from Week 1, until the 90 days after the last dose, date of first documented progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, subject being lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.
CN1 could promote T cell activation and cytokine secretion, thereby enhancing the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and could also regulate Treg cells, thus CN1 is considered to enhance the anti-tumor immune response and have potential antitumor activity.

In this multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study six dose levels are planned. Participants will receive CN1 by IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (every 3 weeks). After completion of treatment cycles, the participant will be assessed by the Principal Investigator and/or Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).
