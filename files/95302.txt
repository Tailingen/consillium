Clinical Value of Molecular Genetic Analyzes in Gynecological Malignomas
The aim of the planned research project is to find out the clinical significance of molecular genetic analyzes in gynecological malignomas. In particular, it will be investigated how the knowledge of a molecular-genetic finding affects the therapeutic decision of the physician. Furthermore, genetic changes in the tumor tissue will be compared with the changes in CTCs, DTCs and cfDNA.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: molecular genetic analyses
Influence of molecular genetic findings to the therapy decision, It will be analyzed if the physicians selection of a therapy is influenced by a present molecular genetic finding. Therapy recommondation based on molecular genetic analysis will be compared with the acutal therapy decision., 3years
