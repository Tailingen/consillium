Pembrolizumab in Patients Failing to Respond to or Relapsing After CAR T Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Lymphomas
Single center, phase I/II trial of pembrolizumab after CTL019 for CD19+ lymphomas. Patients will have CD19+ diffuse large B-cell, follicular, or mantle cell lymphomas relapsed/refractory after CTL019. 12 total patients will be enrolled. Safety of pembrolizumab (primary endpoint) will be determined using a Bayesian monitoring rule for treatment-related adverse events causing drug discontinuation. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall response rate and progression-free survival.
