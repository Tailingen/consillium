Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL) Pre-/Post-Radiation Treatment for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the use of the Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL), Urolift®, in prostate cancer (Pca) participants seeking or undergoing radiotherapy for relief of urinary obstructive symptoms.
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)|Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL)
Mean change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) - Arms: PUL placement post-EBRT and PUL placement post-BT, IPSS is an eight-question written screening tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

A mean change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be considered effective if the following condition is met:

≥ 30% or ≥ 4 point IPSS reduction 3 months after PUL., 3 months post-PUL placement|Mean change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) - Arm: PUL placement pre-BT., IPSS is an eight-question written screening tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

A mean change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be considered effective if the following condition is met:

* 30% or ≥ 4 point IPSS reduction 3 months after BT from pre-PUL baseline., 3 months post-BT
Mean change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS is an eight-question written screening tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Mean change in IPSS score will be reported, 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Mean change in peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), Qmax is the quantity of urine measured over a specified period of time. A significant outcome would be a greater than 50% change in Qmax., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Quality of life scores from last question on IPSS questionnaire, QOL score (last question in the IPSS questionnaire): If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?

With answer options on a 0-6 scale with 0 being delighted and 6 being terrible., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Mean change in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII) scores, The Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII) is a self-administered questionnaire with four questions about urinary problems during the past month regarding physical discomfort, worry about health, how bothersome symptoms are, and whether the symptoms are interfering with doing usual activities.

Mean change in BPHII score will be reported., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Mean change in the MSHQ total score, Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) is a 18-item questionnaire focused on assessing three core function domains (erection, ejaculation and satisfaction).

Mean change in the MSHQ ejaculation total score will be reported., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Urinary incontinence measured by number of pads used, Assessment of urinary incontinence associated with the procedure measured by change number of pads used per day., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Urinary incontinence measured by quality of stress or urge, Assessment of urinary incontinence associated with the procedure as measured by quality: stress or urge., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Urinary incontinence measured by cough stress test, Assessment of urinary incontinence associated with the procedure as measured by cough test., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Urinary incontinence measured by time to resolve, Assessment of urinary incontinence associated with the procedure as measured by time to resolve., 6 and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms)|Mean change in post-void residual (PVR), Assessment of PVR, the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination., 3, 6, and 12 months post-BT (pre-BT arm) or post-PUL placement (Post-BT & Post-EBRT arms
Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL)/ UroLift® is an FDA-approved device for the treatment of obstructive symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (also called prostate gland enlargement). This study seeks to evaluate UroLift's efficacy in a unique cohort of participants with obstructive symptoms who are candidates for radiotherapy or those who developed obstructive symptoms after radiotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to achieve urinary obstructive symptom relief in prostate cancer participants undergoing radiotherapy treatment with placement of PUL. This will be quantified using primary effectiveness endpoints:

* For PUL placement post-EBRT and post-BT: ≥ 30% or ≥ 4 point International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) reduction 3 months after PUL.
* For PUL placement pre-BT: ≥ 30% or ≥ 4 point IPSS reduction 3 months after Brachytherapy (BT) from pre-PUL baseline.

The team will also assess participant outcomes with regard to International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak urine flow (Qmax),post-void residual (PVR), quality of life (QOL) scores, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII) scores, Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) scores, and urinary incontinence at 6 and 12 months of PUL placement post-External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT), post-BT, and pre-BT.
