* This is a two-arm, non-randomized, multicenter, prospective study in adult patients with RRMM, who are administered Teclistamab (TECVAYLI™) or Talquetamab (TALVEY™), in the post-marketing setting.
* Teclistamab (TECVAYLI™) is a humanized IgG-4 PAA bispecific antibody designed to target the CD3 receptor complex on T cells and BCMA on B-lineage cells.
* Talquetamab (TALVEY™) is a humanized IgG-4 bispecific antibody designed to target the CD3 receptor complex on T cells and GPRC5D-expressing multiple myeloma (MM) cells This study will investigate the use of prophylactic tocilizumab to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS associated with teclistamab or talquetamab administration, to enable administration of the step-up dosing regimen of teclistamab or talquetamab in an outpatient setting.
