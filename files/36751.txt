Image-guided Brachytherapy for Vaginal Cancer (EMBRAVE)
The goal of this clinical study is to improve clinical outcomes of patients with vaginal cancer who are treated with curative intent by primary radio(chemo)therapy and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT).

Being an observational, prospective registration study, wherein neither an experimental treatment is compared to the standard treatment, nor groups of patients are compared.

The specific aims are:

* to develop evidence-based recommendations for curative intent treatment with primary radio(chemo)therapy and IGABT.
* to identify prognostic parameters for oncological outcomes, morbidity and quality of life.

The study aims to enroll at least 300 patients. Oncological events will be evaluated at 2 and 5 years of follow-up. Acute and late morbidity events will be evaluated at end of treatment, 2 and 5 years of follow-up.
