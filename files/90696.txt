Effect of Flutamide on Biomarkers in Blood and Tissue Samples From Patients at High Risk of Ovarian Cancer
Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from patients with a high risk of developing ovarian cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. We hypothesized that (i) preclinical biologic evidence exists for the role of androgens in ovarian cancer development and (ii) flutamide treatment of women at high risk for ovarian cancer may identify meaningful tissue biomarkers of androgen action and of ovarian cancer initiation. This phase II trial studied the effect of flutamide on biomarkers in blood and tissue samples from patients at high risk of ovarian cancer.

Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF-1) Expression in Ovarian Endosalpingiosis, CSF-1 levels were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The modified H-Score assess extent of nuclear immunoreactivity applicable to steroid receptors.

The modified H-scores total range is 0-300. A lower modified H-score indicates weakly staining nuclei. A higher modified H-score indicated strongly staining nuclei.

OBJECTIVE: Compare the biomarkers of patients at high risk for ovarian cancer who are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy and are interested in taking flutamide vs patients at high risk for ovarian cancer who are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy and are not interested in taking flutamide (control) vs patients who are undergoing oophorectomy for a medical indication (control).

OUTLINE: Patients who elected not to receive flutamide received prophylactic oophorectomy or oophorectomy for a medical indication. Patients who elected to receive flutamide received 125mg once daily for 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then underwent prophylactic oophorectomy. All patients underwent blood and ovarian tissue sample collection at the time of surgery for biomarker laboratory studies. Proteomic, microarray, and polymorphism analysis were performed on the blood and tissue samples.
