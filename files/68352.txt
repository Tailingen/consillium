Assessment of Early-detection Based on Liquid Biopsy in Lymphoid Malignancies
ASCEND-LYM is a prospective, multi-center, observational study aimed at detecting early stage lymphoma and constrcuting prognostic model by combined assays of cfDNA methylation and other biomarkers. The study will enroll approximately 493 participants including lymphoid malignancies and benign diseases.
