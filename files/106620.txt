Bevacizumab Plus Chemotherapy for Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients as 1st Line Treatment
Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively and prospectively the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of standard chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.

All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international guidelines as standard therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Number of Participants with AE, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which administrations were every 3 weeks., Every 3 weeks up to 18 weeks
Number of Participants with Response Rate, In this observational study investigators are going to assess standard schedules in which the disease evaluation was performed every 6 weeks, Disease evaluation at Week 6|Percentage of Patients with Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Patients Overall Survival, 1 year
In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response, progression free survival and estimation of overall survival
