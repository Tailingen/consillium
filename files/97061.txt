This study was designed to investigate whether the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib combined with low-dose lenalidomide(10mg) as a maintenance regimen could improve the outcome and prognosis of patients with high-risk multiple myeloma after induction and consolidation of VRD-based regimen.

PD is defined as \>=25% increase from lowest value in serum M component or urine M-component; difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase \>10 mg/dL); bone marrow plasma cell percent \>/=10%; new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas development or definite increase in existing bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas size; hypercalcaemia development., through study completion, a average of 1 year
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) + Complete Response (CR) Rate, Using IMWG criteria, through study completion, a average of 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death., through study completion, a average of 1 year|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug., through study completion, a average of 1 year
