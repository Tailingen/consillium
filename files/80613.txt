DRUG: MM-121|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Cetuximab
Dose Escalation: To Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Escalating Doses of the MM-121 Plus Cetuximab and the MM-121 Plus Cetuximab Plus Irinotecan Combination, To establish the safety of escalating doses of MM-121 in combination with cetuximab or in combination with cetuximab and irinotecan in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose.. Dose-escalation conducted using standard 3+3 model to determine maximum tolerated dose. Reports of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were assessed to determine the MTD., From date of first dose to 30 days after termination, the longest 48.1 weeks|To Further Determine the Safety Parameters of the MM-121 + Cetuximab and MM-121 + Cetuximab + Irinotecan Combination by Determining the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the Combination(s) (Via Recording of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)): MM-121 Doses, Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort. RP2D = one dose lever lower than the MTD

Objective Response Rate, To determine the number of patients reporting an objective response using RECIST v 1.1 where a Partial Response (PR) is defined as \>20% decrease in tumor burden from baseline and a Complete Response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance from tumor burden from baseline. Objective Response is presented as the total # patients with PR or CR., Patients were assessed for objective response from time of first dose through treatment termination, the longest treatment duration being 48.1 weeks|Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on plasma samples obtained weekly for the first six weeks of the study and then on day 1 of each additional cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed to calculate standard PK parameters, including the maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Serum levels of MM-121 were measured at a central lab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data is presented per dose level of MM-121 (12 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 40/20 mg/kg) and per study part (Part 1 or Part 2), Collections taken for all patients at Cycle 1, Week 1 at pre-infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 2.5, 4, 6 and 24 hours after starting the infusion of MM-121|Pharmacokinetic Parameters of MM-121, Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on plasma samples obtained weekly for the first six weeks of the study and then on day 1 of each additional cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121.
