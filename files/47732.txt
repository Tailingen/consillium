Precision Medicine for L/GCMN and Melanoma 2
The primary objective is to evaluate the possibility of using minimally and non-invasive technologies (skin patch and breath analyzer) based on the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the early identification of metastases. The secondary objective is to evaluate the usability of these technologies in the follow up of high-risk melanoma patients.

Early identification of metastases, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the possibility of using minimally and non-invasive technologies (skin patch and breath analyzer) based on the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the early identification of metastases., 24 months
Follow-up of high-risk melanoma patients, The secondary objective is to evaluate the possibility to follow-up high risk melanoma patients using minimally invasive technologies based on the detection of changes in the patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)., 24 months
This is a unicentric national prospective observational study aimed at evaluating the use of two devices (skin patch and breath analyzer) for the non or minimally invasive diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with a total duration of 24 months. The study will be based on the obtention of different patterns of volatile organic compounds using the aforementioned devices for melanoma patients with and without metastasis. The results will be compared with the standard procedures for the detection of metastatic melanoma (standard imaging techniques such as PET, MRI, etc.) and correlated with standard prognostic biomarkers (cfDNA mutations in BRAF, NRAS, etc.) obtained using liquid biopsy.
