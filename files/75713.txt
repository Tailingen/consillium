A Randomized Secondary Adjuvant Treatment Intervention Study Comparing Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan to SOC Therapy in eBC Patients With Molecular Relapse
Prospective, multi-center, randomized, open label comparative Phase III study in patients with intermediate to high-risk (as defined in the SURVIVE trial) HER2-positive or HER2-low early breast cancer, who participate in the SURVIVE trial and experience a molecular relapse, as assessed based on a positive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) result, with 2:1 allocation to:

* Arm A: Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (i.v. 5,4 mg/kg, q3w) + endocrine therapy (if hormonal-receptor-positive) for 16 cycles or until relapse, if earlier
* Arm B: Continuous treatment of physician's choice (may include endocrine treatment, CDK4/6-Inhibition, T-DM1, Olaparib, Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, Capecitabine or Neratinib)
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan|OTHER: Physicians Choice (PhC).
ctDNA clearance rate 12 months after randomization, To compare ctDNA clearance rate twelve months after randomization between patients in the experimental arm (Arm A) versus patients in the standard of care arm (Arm B). ctDNA is measured as per RaDaR assay (see 5.8).

Endpoint:

ctDNA clearance rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a ctDNA negative blood test result at a given time point: (Patients with negative cfDNA at 12 months)/(all patients), from enrollment to end of treatment after 12 months
