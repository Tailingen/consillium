A PK Study Testing Single Oral Dose of Elacestrant in Subjects With Normal or Severely Impaired Hepatic Function
This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the PK, safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of Elacestrant.
Hepatic Impairment
DRUG: Elacestrant dihydrochloride
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Predose 240 hours after drug administration|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), Predose 240 hours after drug administration|AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-âˆž), Predose 240 hours after drug administration
A total of 16 subjects will be recruited and divided between the following two Groups:

Group 1: 8 subjects with severe hepatic impairment Group 2: 8 subjects with normal hepatic function (control group)

On Day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg Elacestrant (2 x 100 mg tablets). Safety assessment and blood sampling for Elacestrant analysis on plasma will be performed at predefined time points up to 240 hours post.

The total duration of study participation for each subject (from screening to the follow up call) is anticipated to be approximately 6 weeks.
