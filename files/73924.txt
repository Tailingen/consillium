Modified Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin (mCAPOX) for Patients with GI Malignancies
This study is a single arm, non-randomized feasibility study with tolerability and toxicity evaluation as primary endpoints which seeks to determine if a modified administration schedule of capecitabine with oxaliplatin will result in less toxicity than standard FOLFOX or CAPOX regimens.
