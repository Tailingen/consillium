A Study of Tislelizumab in Combination With Investigational Agents in Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the antitumor activity, safety, and tolerability of tislelizumab plus investigational agent(s) with or without chemotherapy. This study is structured as a master protocol with separate sub- studies. Sub-study 1 includes participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression (≥ 50%), and Sub-study 2 includes participants with NSCLC with low or negative (PD-L1) expression (\< 50%).
