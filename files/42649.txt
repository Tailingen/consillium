3D Structural Imaging of Human Breast Tissues
This project aims to develop an advanced ex vivo medical microscopic imaging technology. By developing breast tissue staining techniques, acquiring microscopic images, and performing structural reconstruction, we seek to observe the 3D structure of breast tissue. This includes examining cell distribution, mammary ducts, and blood vessel distribution, to explore the different biological characteristics between normal breast tissue and various types of cancerous tissues.
Human Breast Tissues
DEVICE: Multi-photon microscopy
Accuracy dependency on staining dye selection, Using other types of staining agents, compare the diagnostic accuracy of the results with those of traditional pathological staining agents., 3 years
Comparison between 3D pathology vs. FFPE on breast cancer samples with a focus on image contrast, Verify whether the contrast and other conditions can provide pathologists with critical information for interpretation. The images will also be compared with the results observed using traditional pathology methods., 3 years
