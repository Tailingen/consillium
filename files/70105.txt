Exploratory Study of IMM01 for Injection in the Treatment of Refractory or Recurrent Hematologic Malignancy
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics profile, efficacy and immunogenicity of IMM01 in subjects with refractory or recurrent hematologic malignancy.
Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: IMM01
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Incidence and characteristics of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), 48 weeks of treatment|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and characteristics of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Evaluated during the first treamtment cycle of 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose（MTD ）, MTD is the highest dose in patients with DLT incidence \<30%., 48 weeks of treatment
Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the immunogenicity of IMM01 in patients with refractory or recurrent hematologic malignancy, 48 weeks of treatment|Overall Rate Response (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a partial response (PR) or critical response (CR), When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 48 weeks of treatment|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a critical response (CR), partial response (PR) or disease stable (SD), From start of treatment to the last subject enrolled completes approximately 48 weeks of treatment]|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from date of initial documentation of a response (PR or CR) to date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD), From start of treatment to the last subject enrolled completes approximately 48 weeks of treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the duration from the start of treatment until tumor progression or death of any cause, From start of treatment to treatment termination visit, up to 48 weeks|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Plasma Concentration observed in patients with IMM01 dosed, 48 weeks of treatment|time to maximum concentration (Tmax), time to maximum concentration observed in patients with IMM01 dosed, 48 weeks of treatment
IMM01 is administered via intravenous infusion once week of cycle 1- 12 (4 weeks per cycle).

The accelerated titration method and the traditional "3+3" method will be adopted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in dose-escalation phase.

Once the RP2D is determined, will explore for Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,NK/T-cell lymphoma, AML, MDS and MM cohorts.
