Optimal Sequencing of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Standard Platinum-based Chemotherapy in First-Line NSCLC
This is a multicenter randomized phase II to determine if the administration of standard platinum-based chemotherapy before MK-3475 in with Chemotherapy naive stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will improve the overall response rate (ORR) compared to MK-3475 administered before chemotherapy. Patients will be given Pembrolizumab as maintenance up to 2 years: Carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1, The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial to determine the overall response rate (ORR per RECIST 1.1) in Chemotherapy naive patients with stage IV NSCLC after the administration of standard platinum-based chemotherapy before MK-3475 (arm A) and administration of MK-3475 administered before standard platinum-based chemotherapy (arm B). Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 Months
Compare Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1, To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first line carboplatin-based chemotherapy followed by MK-3475 to patients treated with MK-3475 prior to first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy., 24 Months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), To characterize the adverse events related to MK-3475 by frequency, type and grade in patients with Chemotherapy naive advanced NSCLC based on the sequence of administration with first-line chemotherapy. A count of participants experiencing an adverse event is summarized here, the detailed summary is in the adverse events section of this report., 24 Months
Evaluate the ORR Per irRC, To evaluate the ORR per irRC of MK-3475 administered prior to or after treatment with first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated NSCLC., 24 Months|Evaluate PFS Per irRC, To evaluate the PFS per irRC of previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC who are treated with MK-3475 administered prior to or after first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy., 24 Months|Evaluate Response Duration of MK-3475, To evaluate the response duration of MK-3475 based on schedule of administration with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC., 24 Months|Evaluate the Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC who received MK-3475 administered prior to or after treatment with first line carboplatin-based chemotherapy., 24 Months
While a genotype-directed strategy has been established as effective in treatment selection for patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients at this time will have a readily identifiable actionable molecular target. Furthermore, genotype-directed therapy has not been validated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC will continue to rely on standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Given the plateau in effectiveness of this approach, novel treatment strategies are clearly warranted.
