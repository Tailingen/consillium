A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of ILIxadencel Administered Into Tumors in Combination With Checkpoint Inhibitor (CPI) in Patients With ADvanced Cancer
Patients in the Phase 1b part of the study will be treated with ilixadencel at an increasing dose and frequency, in combination with standard doses and schedules of checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) pembrolizumab. The Phase 1b study will determine the optimal dose and schedule of ilixadencel. Patients in the Phase 2 part of the study will be randomly assigned to receive either ilixadencel (at the dose determined in Phase 1b) combined with the CPI, or only the CPI.

Note: Recruitment to Phase 1b of the study has been completed.

Despite improvements achieved with the use of CPIs, 50-80% of cancer patients do not respond to this therapy. There is growing evidence that combining CPIs with other forms of immunotherapy has the potential to improve the desired effects of both CPIs and immunotherapies. This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of the immunotherapy ilixadencel when used in combination with a CPI. A Dose-escalation Committee (DEC) will monitor the study for any significant safety issues during Phase 1b.

Note: Recruitment to Phase 1b of the study has been completed.

The study did not move forward to Phase 2.
