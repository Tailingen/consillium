Macrophage Imaging Using Ga-MMR-VHH2 in Lung Cancer Patients
Phase II study to evaluate the clinical potential of 68GaNOTA-anti-MMR-VHH2 for in vivo imaging of Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR)-expressing Macrophages by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) planned for surgical resection.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2
Correlation of uptake of 68GaNOTA-Anti-MMR-VHH2 in a NSCLC lesion before surgery with the immunohistological MMR-staining of the excised lesion., PET/CT and immunohistochemistry will be assessed using a (semi-)quantitative scale., Resection of lesion up to 21 days after PET/CT
