Anti Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Pre-operative Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity (measured by the amount of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1/ALDH1+ cells before and after treatment) of pre-operative bevacizumab in combination with conventional chemotherapy in breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant treatment, compared to a control arm receiving chemotherapy alone.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: no bevacizumab
Measure of the anti-cancer stem cell activity, The anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity is measured by the amount of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1/ALDH1+ cells after 4 cycles of treatment compared to the amount before treatment, 4 months
Evaluation of the safety of the treatment, Evaluation of the safety of the treatment at each cycle, estimated by the number of patients with clinical and biological adverse events coded according to the CTCAE, 8 months|Evaluation of the disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival and overall survival, The disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival and overall survival are calculated from the inclusion to the time of the event, 5 years|Evaluation of the pathological complete response rate, Evaluation of the pathological complete response rate according to the classification of Sataloff, 8 months
