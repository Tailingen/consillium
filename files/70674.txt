IKS03 in Patients with Advanced B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
This first-in-human study will evaluate the recommended dose for further clinical development, safety, tolerability, antineoplastic activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IKS03, a CD19 targeting antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with advanced B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: IKS03
Recommended Dose for Expansion (Part 1), RDE will be determined using dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and all other available study data, Up to 20 months|Objective Response Rate (Part 2), Antineoplastic effects will be assessed by Criteria for Response Assessment: The Lugano Classification (Cheson 2014), up to 42 months
Evaluation of the immunogenicity of IKS03 (Part 1 and 2), Occurrence of ADA measured in serum at selected timepoints during the study, Up to 42 months|Plasma Concentrations of IKS03 (Part 1 and 2), Pharmacokinetic profile will be characterized by concentrations of IKS03, Up to 42 months|Determine recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Part 2), Based on evidence of antitumor activity, acceptable tolerability, evidence of achieving target plasma concentration, Up to 42 months
The study will consist of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part 1) and dose-expansion (Part 2). The dose-escalation part (Part 1) of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of IKS03 to establish a recommended dose for expansion (RDE); and the dose-expansion part (Part 2) of the study is to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of IKS03 at the RDE.
