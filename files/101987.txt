PET-CT Imaging of Neuro-endocrine Tumors and Preliminary Clinical Evaluation
Through the investigators involvement in an international consortium, the investigators had the opportunity to acquire a new type of synthetizer for the radiolabelling of such tracers. The investigators propose in this project to develop on their site, the radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC and to evaluate prospectively the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, compared with the current imaging OctreoScan®. The objectives of this project are: - to validate the radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC on their site with a new synthetizer - and clinically evaluate, through a prospective preliminary study, the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT with 68Ga-DOTATOC in comparison with other standard imaging examinations.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
PROCEDURE: 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT Imaging
Evaluation of PET imaging, The diagnostic performance of PET-CT will be calculated and compared with other standard exams as the gold standard histology and clinical follow-up., Inclusion (day 0)
Reproducibility, The reproducibility of the new method of radiolabelling will be evaluated by the number of failed syntheses, Inclusion (day 0)|Tolerance, Tolerance of the tracer will be assessed by the collection of possible side effects, Inclusion (day 0) and until end of follow up (day 28)|Impact on the therapeutic management, The impact on the therapeutic management of patients will be studied by the analysis of questionnaires with or without taking into account, the results of the PET-CT with 68Ga-DOTATOC., End of follow up (day 28)
