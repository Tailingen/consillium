T-cell Therapy with CRISPR PD1-edited Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients with Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess wether it is safe and feasible to treat patients with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes that have been silenced for PD-1, using CRISPR-Cas9.
Melanoma Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: TIL therapy
Feasibility, Assess feasibility measured by the number of subjects who undergo surgery and successfully undergo CRISPR-TIL infusion, From surgery to CRISPR-TIL infusion (5-10 weeks)|Incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events, Determine the safety and tolerability measured by the incidence rate of grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events by severity and their relationship to the CRISPR-TIL infusion., From admission to 2nd evaluation (3 months after CRISPR-TIL infusion)
Objective response rate, Assess the clinical effect of the treatment by use of the objective response rate (using RECIST 1.1)., From treatment until the 12 months evaluation scan.
In this study the investigators will treat patients with advanced (inoperable) or metastatic melanoma with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in combination with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and high-dose interleukin-2. The TILs are harvested from a patient tumor and expanded a thousand-fold in a laboratory over approximately 6 weeks before being infused back into the patient. This is a well known and tried treatment regimen, often called TIL-therapy or TIL-ACT. In this study the investigators will add CRISPR-Cas9 modification to the production process of the TILs to silence the expression of PD-1 on the surface of the infused cells. The aim of this study is to demonstrate wether treatment with these PD1-deficient TILs (CRISPR-TILs) is safe and feasible.
