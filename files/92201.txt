General Objectives -To identify the efficacy of the nutritional supplement Ocoxin-viusid to increase the quality of life of patients with epithelial advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer. Specific Objectives - Identify the influence of the research product on the nutritional status and quality of life of patients. - Describe the toxicity of the research product. - Identify the adverse reactions to the chemotherapy scheme and quantify the interruptions to it by acute toxicity.

Quality of life. It will be measured as: - EORTC Questionnaire QLQ-C30 (Score of each item and general score). Measurement time: at the beginning and 3 weeks after the 3rd cycle of QT - EORTC Questionnaire QLQ-OV28 (Score of each item and general score). Measurement time: at the beginning and 3 weeks after the 3rd cycle of QT - Karnofsky index (Score of 0-100 points at intervals of 10). Measurement time: at the beginning, in each cycle of QT and 3 weeks after the 3rd cycle of QT
