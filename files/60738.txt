Anesthesia, TIVA, Balanced Anesthesia, NK Cell
Anesthetic method was reported to have an impact on postoperative long-term outcome in cancer patients. In this study, we will investigate the effect of different anesthetic methods on NK cell activity, cytokine response and postoperative outcome in colorectal cancer patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC. We will compare propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with balanced anesthesia to determine the effect of propofol, inhalation agent, and opioid on tumor genesis, recurrence, NK cell activity, cytokine response, and postoperative outcome.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: anesthetic method
Postoperative immune function (NK cell count), Postoperative immune function will be measured at baseline, POD#1, and POD#7. Postoperative immune function will be investigated by measuring NK cell count., Postoperative day 1
