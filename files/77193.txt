Neoadjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Combined With Chemotherapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary object of this study is to determine tumor major pathological response (MPR) rate and pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer who subjected to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and molecular biomarkers related to the clinical response.
