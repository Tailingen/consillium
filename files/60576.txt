RC48-ADC Combined With S-1 for First-line Treatment of Advanced Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma With Moderate Expression of HER2
This study was a single-arm, open, multi-center Phase Ib/II clinical trial to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC48-ADC plus S-1 in first-line treatment of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with moderate expression of HER2.
Advanced Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: RC48-ADC|DRUG: S-1
dose-limiting toxity, through study completion, an average of 1 year|ORR（Objective Response Rate）, The proportion of patients whose tumors shrink by a certain amount and remain so for a certain amount of time, including CR+PR cases., Imaging tests were performed every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first year of treatment to assess efficacy, and every 8 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year
PFS(progression-free survival), Time from randomness to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., Imaging tests were performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from the first year of treatment to assess efficacy, and every 7 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|DOR(Duration of Response ), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, Imaging tests were performed every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first year of treatment to assess efficacy, and every 8 weeks (±7 days) after 1 year|OS(Overall Survival), Time from randomization to death from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months|AE(Adverse Event), The drug safety was assessed by investigator(s) according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 2 years
