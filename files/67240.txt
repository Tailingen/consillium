The present study is initiated to evaluate quality of life, period of hospitalization and complication rates in patients with colorectal cancer receiving treatment with stoma surgery. Prior to surgery patients are randomized to different preoperative education programs. In Arm A patients receive a new specific education program (Krankenhaus Nordwest concept) conducted by a specialized therapist (stoma-therapist). In Arm B patients receive the standard preoperative education program. Standardized questionnaires are used to evaluate quality of life and period of hospitalization at baseline and four weeks after surgery in Arm A vs. Arm B
