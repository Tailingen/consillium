Study of Cipatinib in Patients With HER2 Positive or Uncertain Advanced Breast Cancer
Cipatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cipatinib in patients with HER2 positive or uncertain advanced breast cancer:

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cipatinib, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of cipatinib and its metabolites
3. To assess preliminary antitumor activity
4. To determine preliminary regimen for phase II study
5. To determine the relation of expression of HER-1 and HER-2 to the antitumor activity.

The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) regimen of cipatinib will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of six experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) after completing one treatment cycle., 3 weeks
