BRE-10: Biomarker Optimization of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer
Adult men and women with early-stage, IHC/FISH-defined HER2-positive breast cancer will have a MammaPrint®/BluePrint® assay performed on the diagnostic biopsy specimen, ordered by the treating Oncologist as standard care

Number of participants that have a pathological complete response (pCR), This is defined as the absence of any residual invasive carcinomancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and any resected lymph node tissue, 16 weeks
Participant outcomes using the Quality of Life (QOL) and EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaires, Number of participants having good outcome versus low outcomes. High score means worse health outcomes and low score means better health outcomes, Baseline|Participant outcomes using the Quality of Life (QOL) and EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaires, Number of participants having good outcome versus low outcomes.

Adult men and women with early-stage, IHC/FISH-defined HER2-positive breast cancer will have a MammaPrint®/BluePrint® assay performed on the diagnostic biopsy specimen, ordered by the treating Oncologist as standard care. Patients whose tumors have a HER2-enriched molecular subtype on the MammaPrint®/BluePrint® assay and are recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy by their treating Oncologist will be recruited for study enrollment
