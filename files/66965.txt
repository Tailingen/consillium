INTER-PATHOLOGIST READER STUDY
This is a post study histology analysis from previously obtained pathology slides.
Nevi, Dysplastic
Study Success, This is a data collection study. Study success is considered when the interpathology agreement is improved when compared to the agreement identified in Elmore et al. \[5\]. \[(classes/agreement): class I (eg, nevus or mild atypia) / 92% (95% confidence interval 90% to 94); class II (eg, moderate atypia) / 25% (22% to 28%); III (eg, severe atypia or melanoma in situ) / 40% (37% to 44%); IV (eg, pathologic stage T1a (pT1a) early invasive melanoma) / 43% (39% to 46%); and V (eg, â‰¥pT1b invasive melanoma) / 72% (69% to 75%).\], 8 months
This is a post study histology analysis. Pathologists will use digital histology slide scans of suspicious nevus/nevi obtained from previously conducted studies to provide histopathology gradations of histological features as outlined in the Orlucent histology atlas (LBL0713 Histopathology Atlas for Grading of Dysplastic Nevi and DEF0713-1 Histopathology Definitions for LBL0713).
