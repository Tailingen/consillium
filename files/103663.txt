High Tidal Volume Induces Inflammation In Normal Lungs
Objective: To compare the effects of a protective versus a conventional ventilatory strategy, on systemic and in lung production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in patients without lung disease.

Hypothesis: High tidal volumes induce inflammation in patients without lung disease Design: Prospective control-randomized study. Patients and Setting: Twenty patients without lung disease and submitted to mechanical ventilation admitted to one trauma and one general adult intensive care unit of two different university hospitals.

Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation either with tidal volume (VT) of 10-12 ml/kg predicted body weight (high VT group) or with VT of 5-7 ml/kg predicted body weight (low VT group) with an O2 inspiratory fraction (FIO2) enough to keep arterial oxygen saturation \> 90% with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O during 12 hours after admission to the study.
