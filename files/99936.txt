Comparison of Pain Levels in Fusion Prostate Biopsy and Standard TRUS-Guided Biopsy
The aim of this study was to compare the pain levels in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided standard 12-core prostate biopsy (SPB) and multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MpMRI)-guided fusion prostate biopsy (FPB).
Pain Due to Certain Specified Procedures|Prostate Cancer|Biopsy
PROCEDURE: Standard transrectal 12 core biopsy|PROCEDURE: MRI- US fusion prostate biopsy (FPB)
To detect painful steps of biopsy procedure by asking patients verbally, to ask patients most painful step of procedure that verbally defined them before biopsy as 1: insertion of the probe into the rectum, 2: probe manipulation, and 3: the piercing of the biopsy needle, Within 5 minutes after biopsy|Over all Visual analogue Score (VAS) score of procedure(From 0 to 100 points, 100 is max pain score according to patient), pain assessment was performed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Within 5 minutes after prostate biopsy
The study included patients that underwent prostate biopsy under local anesthesia (intrarectal 2% lidocaine gel + periprostatic nerve block) due to suspected prostate cancer. Patients detected with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score (PIRADS) â‰¥3 lesion on MpMRI underwent MpMRI-guided FPB (Group I) and the patients who had no suspected lesions or had a PI-RADS \<3 lesion on MpMRI underwent TRUS-guided SPB (Group II). Pain assessment was performed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 5 min after the procedure. Following the procedure, the patients were asked to indicate the most painful biopsy step among the three steps (1: insertion of the probe into the rectum, 2: probe manipulation, 3: the piercing of the biopsy needle).
