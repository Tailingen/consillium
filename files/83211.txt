A Study of SHR3680 in Treating Patients With Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of SHR3680 with bicalutamide in the treatment of patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Hormone-Dependent Prostate Cancer
DRUG: SHR3680|DRUG: Bicalutamide
rPFS, Time from randomisation to radiologically confirmed progressive disease or death due to any cause, Approximately 70 months|OS, Time from randomisation to death due to any cause, Approximately 70 months
Time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression, Time from randomisation to the first time of PSA progression according to the criterion of PCGW3, Approximately 70 months|Time to skeletal-related events, Time from randomisation to the first occurrence of a fracture or treatment for the fracture. The skeletal-related event is defined as the occurrence of either pathological or clinical fracture, spinal cord compression, bone-related radiotherapy or surgery, Approximately 70 months|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects with measureable disease at baseline who achieved a complete or partial response in their soft tissue disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria, Approximately 70 months|Time to initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, Time from randomisation to the initiation of antineoplastic subsequent to the study treatment, Approximately 70 months
This is an open, multicenter, randomized phase III trial. This clinical study compares the efficacy and safety of SHR3680 with bicalutamide in the patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Approximately 572 patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SHR3680 or bicalutamide treatment. Primary endpoints of the study are radiological progress-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).
