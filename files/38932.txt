Rhabdomyosarcoma and Malignant Soft Tissue Tumours of Childhood
Objective of the study objectives was to explore survival advantage for an intensified chemotherapy strategy in a randomised trial.

IVA (ifosfamide, vincristine, actinomycin D) or a 6 drug combination (IVA + carboplatin, epirubicin, etoposide) both delivered over 27 weeks. Cumulative dose / m2 = ifosfamide 54g (both arms), epirubicin 450 mg, etoposide 1350 mg (6 drug). Delivery of radiotherapy was determined according to site and / or response to chemotherapy ± surgery.

The study was powered to detect 10% difference in 3 year OS.
