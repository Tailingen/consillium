Cigarette smoking has harmful effects on cancer patients' treatment and prognosis, but there are systemic barriers to delivering smoking cessation interventions to cancer patients. One solution for addressing these barriers is to give patients immediate access to smoking cessation treatment via a smartphone application. The Quit2Heal smartphone app is engaging and tailored to the specific needs of cancer patients, and can be integrated into routine cancer care. The goal of this study is to determine whether Quit2Heal provides higher quit rates than the current standard smoking cessation app.
