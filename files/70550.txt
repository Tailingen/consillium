The Evaluation of Manual Therapy for the Prevention of Radiation-Induced Fibrosis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The subjects in this study are the patients with head and neck cancer after completion of the radiotherapy. Radiation-induced fibrosis is inevitable and there is no effective treatment to prevent it. Therefore, there are two parts in this study :

The first part is a pilot study. There will be 10 subjects included and manual therapy and rehabilitation will be arranged for 6 months. The manual therapy would be once a week at most, and the rehabilitation would be twice a week at most.

The second part is a randomized controlled study. 60 patients would be randomized divided into two groups. The group 1 is manual therapy(once a week at most) and rehabilitation(twice a week at most), and the group 2 is rehabilitation only(twice a week at most). Patients would be evaluated at baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 12th month. The evaluation is including the degree of superficial soft tissue fibrosis, numerical rating scale of pain, range of motion(neck), range of motion(shoulder), width of mouth opening, EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ H\&N 35, and functional oral intake scale. Besides, swallowing video fluoroscopy would be done at baseline, 6th, and 12th month.

When the subject completes the evaluation in the 12th month, the study is ended.

Because the radiation-induced fibrosis is progressed with time, we will follow up the condition of subjects at the next year and the following third year.
