Factors Associated With High Mortality of Gastric Adenocarcinoma in Thailand Versus Japan
The differences in patient's clinicopathological characteristic between high and low prevalence of gastric cancer region should be further examined to elucidate factors that associate with poor survival rate of patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate characteristics of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and factors associated with different outcome in Thailand and Japan to find a clue to improve patients' survival in low prevalence country such as Thailand.

This is a retrospective cohort study. It was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand and Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease, Japan. Eligible cases were selected by using standardized search protocols: formal computer searches of all patients seen at out-patient clinic and/or hospitalized for gastric cancer between 2010 and 2014.Two physicians, who were informed the definition of each variable, individually reviewed chart of patients.
