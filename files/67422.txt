Validation of Coregistered CT-PET Imaging in Determining Tumor Volume and Atelectasis in Patients With Operable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Tumor Associated Atelectasis
CT-PET image fusion has the potential to differentiate 'tumor' from 'atelectasis' much better than the CT-scan in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who also have atelectasis.

This however has never been validated on a histological level. In this study patients with non small cell lung cancer and atelectasis who are eligible for surgery undergo a CT-scan and a PET-scan prior to surgery.

The resection specimen will be compared to the preoperative imaging.
