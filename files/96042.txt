A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Patients With Inflammatory or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab (Avastin), before surgery and/or radiotherapy, in participants with inflammatory or locally advanced operable breast cancer. Participants will receive 5-fluorouracil, epidoxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), followed by paclitaxel, given concomitantly with bevacizumab. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is \<100 individuals.

DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Epidoxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Paclitaxel|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab
Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response Following Principle Investigator Review, Pathological complete response was defined as absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the tumor remnants after surgery following primary systemic therapy., Up to 7.5 years
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Up to 7.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Breast-Conserving Surgery, Rate of breast conversing surgery is defined as percentage of participants who achieved breast conversing surgery out of the ITT population without inflammatory breast cancer, as these participants received mastectomy irrespective of their response to neoadjuvant treatment., Up to 7.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease-Free Interval, Disease-free interval was defined as the time from enrollment until recurrence of tumor or death from any cause, and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The percentage of participants without events at Months 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 is presented., Months 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from enrollment of participant to death from any cause., Up to 7.5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Adverse Event, An adverse event was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., Up to 7.5 years
