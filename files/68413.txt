Neoadjuvant Itraconazole in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacodynamics effects of itraconazole in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

DRUG: Itraconazole
Changes in Tumor Tissue Microvessel Density [MVD] From Baseline, Images of DAPI (4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole) , CD31 (cluster of differentiation 31 ), and CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34) were taken from the same field of view and then merged., Baseline and Post Treatment (after 7-10 days of itraconazole bid)

This is a phase 0 clinical trial. While clinical data including safety will be recorded, the principal outcomes are pharmacodynamic endpoints. Specifically, the investigators seek to identify: (1) effects of itraconazole on tumor angiogenesis, (2) effects of itraconazole on the Hh pathway, (3) biomarker predictors of these effects, (4) the correlation between itraconazole pharmacokinetics and these effects, (5) the correlation between different biomarkers.

Up to 15 eligible patients with previously diagnosed or suspected NSCLC planned for resection will undergo a study-specific core needle biopsy, imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced \[DCE\]-, diffusion weighted imaging \[DWI\]-, and arterial spin labeling \[ASL\] magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]), skin punch biopsy, and collection of peripheral blood. Subjects will then receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily for 7-10 days, following which they will undergo repeat imaging, skin biopsy, and blood collection. Subsequently they will undergo surgical resection. Due to the safety profile of itraconazole when used as an antifungal agent , all histologic subtypes of NSCLC will be eligible for the trial. The itraconazole dose of 600 mg, higher than an anti-angiogenic dose, has been shown to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.
