A Study to Learn if 27T51, a Mucin-16 (MUC16) Protein Targeting Immune Cell Therapy, Administered Alone or in Combination is Safe and How Well it Works for Adult Participants With Recurrent or Treatment Resistant Ovarian Cancers
This study is researching an experimental CAR T cell therapy called 27T51, referred to as study drug. The study drug is a MUC16 targeting immune cell therapy focused on adult female participants with recurrent or difficult to treat epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

This study has two (2) major parts:

Phase 1a Dose Escalation and Phase 1b Dose Expansion. The aim of the dose escalation part will be to test the safety of 27T51 in a small number of participants to find the highest dose given to humans without unacceptable side effects. The aim of the dose expansion part will be to test 27T51 at the established dose level(s) from the dose escalation part and may include other medications given in combination with 27T51.

Information collected from this study will help researchers understand more fully whether this immune cell therapy, also known as CAR T cell therapy, can be safely used to treat solid tumors such as ovarian cancer.
