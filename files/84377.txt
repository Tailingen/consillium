A Study of Fluvestrant Combined With Oral Vinorelbine in Hormone Receptor-positive Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a single-center phase II study designed to evaluated the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant in combination with oral vinorelbine in hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer
Hormone Receptor Positive Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: fluvestrant + oral vinorelbine
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as the time from first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, approximately 1.5 years
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR will be calculated as the proportion of patients in the Efficacy Evaluable patient Set who achieve complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), approximately 6 months|Incidence and Severity of adverse events, hematologic toxicityï¼Œhepatotoxicity and so on, approximately 1.5 years
This is a single-group, single-center phase II trial. Patients with hormone-receptor-positive, Her2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not previously received any systemic antitumor therapy for advanced disease were treated with fulvestrant combined with oral vinorelbine as a first-line regimen. Key issues to be addressed in this study: to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant combined with oral vinorelbine in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Thirty patients are planned to be enrolled.
