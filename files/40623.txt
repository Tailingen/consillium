Tagraxofusp in Treating Patients With Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm After Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies the side effects of tagraxofusp in treating patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm after stem cell transplant. Tagraxofusp is a type of immunotoxin that is made by linking a protein called IL-3 to a toxic substance. Tagraxofusp may help find cancer cells that express IL-3 and kill them without harming normal cells.
Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: Tagraxofusp-erzs
Number of Participants That Received Planned Tagraxofusp Post Transplant, Participants completed at least 75% of planned tagraxofusp doses in at least 4 cycles of therapy., Up to 1 year
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Participant alive and disease free one year post transplant, From treatment start date to date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Number of participants alive one year post transplant, From treatment start date to death, assessed up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the safety of tagraxofusp-erzs (tagraxofusp) in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) after autologous (auto) or allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BPDCN receiving maintenance therapy with tagraxofusp after auto-HCT or allo-HCT.

II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in patients with BPDCN receiving maintenance therapy with tagraxofusp after auto-HCT or allo-HCT.

OUTLINE:

Within day 45 and 180 after stem cell transplant, patients receive tagraxofusp-erzs intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1-3 of cycles 1-4 and days 1-2 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.
