Phase I/II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of LiPlaCis in Patients With Advanced or Refractory Tumours
Liposomal formulations are frequently used today in the treatment of cancer. LiPlaCis is the first targeted liposomal formulation with a tumour triggered release mechanism to undergo clinical development in oncology and it is expected that LiPlaCis will improve the therapeutic index of cisplatin compared to conventional cisplatin.

Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs in the treatment of cancer due to its documented efficacy in a number of tumour types. Furthermore, it seems highly likely that cisplatin will remain an important drug in the future treatment of cancer. However, the drug is associated with a number of serious toxicities that complicates or necessitates discontinuation of therapy - e.g. need for pre-hydration, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting.

Thus, there is a well-established need for improving cisplatin therapy in cancer patients. One option here is improving the formulation of the drug, so that a more selective up-take of cisplatin administered takes place at the tumour sites.

Based on the results of the pre-clinical studies of LiPlaCis, it seems clear that LiPlaCis offers the potential to improve cisplatin therapy to the benefits of cancer patients.

In a prematurely stopped Phase I Dutch study a Recommended Dose (RD) for a Phase II study was never reached which was the aim of the finished Phase I dose escalating part of this study for advanced or refractory solid tumors.

In the Phase 2 part of this study, patients with advanced breast cancer with a biopsy examination showing a pattern compatible with sensitivity to LiPlaCis or patients with skin cancer will be included.
