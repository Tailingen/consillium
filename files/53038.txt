NIraparib and Quality of LifE is a Longitudinal Study Evaluating in Real Life the Tolerability of Niraparib.
This is a longitudinal, national, open, multi-centre phase IV study which will recruit up to 141 patients with ovarian cancer in late relapse treated with niraparib according to the labelling In France.

The aim of NiQoLe, phase IV study is to evaluate tolerability of Niraparib and the management by the physicians of the side-effects in real life in France. The study will also generate complementary data of NOVA trial on longitudinal follow up of closed symptoms and side effects reported by the patients especially with the NCI PRO (Patient-Reported Outcome)-CTCAE system. Specific oncogeriatric data will be collected among on a subgroup of elderly patients.
