TACE Combined With Lenvatinib for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Prolong)
This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in which subjects will be treated with lenvatinib combined with TACE in un-resectable HCC patients who had not received systematic treatment or TACE treatment in the past.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Lenvatinib|PROCEDURE: TACE
Objective response rate（ORR）, The percentage of patients who have best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to mRECIST., up to 12 months
Intrahepatic ORR and Extrahepatic ORR, The percentage of patients who have best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to mRECIST intrahepatic or extrahepatic, respectively., up to 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the beginning of treatment of TACE to the time of tumor progression or death from any cause (according to mRECIST standard), up to 12 months|Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response rate, A decrease in AFP of more than 20% in AFP+ patients treated with lenvatinib is defined as an AFP response.AFP response rate defined as the percentage of AFP response patients in all AFP positive patients., up to 12 months|Time to progression（TTP）, The time from the beginning of treatment of TACE to the time of tumor progression. (according to mRECIST standard), up to 12 months|Adverse events(AEs), AEs(adverse events) evaluated by the CTC-AE 5.0, up to 18 months
Only 30% of HCC patients received radical resection. Most of the patients are in the advanced stage and can only receive palliative treatment such as TACE or systemic treatment. Lenvatinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which mainly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) receptor-1, 2, 3; fibroblast growth factors(FGF) receptor-1, 2, 3, 4; platelet derived growth factor receptor(PDGFR)α; RET and KIT and showed significant anti-tumor effect in REFLECT study. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib and TACE in unresectable HCC patients.
