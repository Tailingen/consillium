Metabolic and Microbial Profiling of Lung Cancer
This pilot study will establish non-invasive sample collections, including breath, saliva, blood and urine pre-surgery and at the participant's one-month post-surgery follow-up visit. Participants with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage I-III will be recruited.

Number of Participants Needed for Feasibility, The primary objectives is to assess the feasibility of adding these non-invasive sample collections to pre- and post-surgery visits the following outcomes (counts) will be gathered - (number eligible for trial, number that consent to participate, number that provide pre-surgery samples, number that provide post-surgery samples) using a 95% exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for each feasibility estimate., One month|Pre-Surgery and Post-Surgery Metabolic Signatures, Metabolic assessments will be taken before and after surgery of lung cancer biomarkers to examine a series of paired t-tests to determine which markers significantly change between the two time points for participants., One month post surgery|Pre-Surgery and Post-Surgery Microbial Signatures, Metabolic assessments will be taken before and after surgery of lung cancer biomarkers to examine a series of paired t-tests to determine which markers significantly change between the two time points for participants., One month post surgery
Identification of Lung Cancer Stage Specific Signatures, For lung cancer examine whether pre-surgery, post-surgery or change from pre- to post- surgery metabolic or microbial measures are different depending on lung cancer stage. Consideration of the metabolic or microbial measures as outcomes and use a general linear models framework to see if lung cancer stage (included as a class variable, but then examined as an ordinal variable using a contrast statement in general linear model) is associated with any marker., One month post surgery|Identification of Signatures Associated With Pulmonary Function, For pulmonary function, the same approach as for lung cancer stage, except that pulmonary function will be considered as a continuous variable in the model. Pulmonary function can be examined at both time-points (pre- and post- surgery) thus we can examine the relationships between pulmonary function measures and biomarker measures at each time points (and the change in measures over time)., One month post surgery
Primary Objective

* To evaluate the feasibility of adding non-invasive sample collections in the pre-surgical setting and at the post-surgery follow-up visit.
* To identify and assess metabolic and microbial signatures collected at pre- and post-surgery and determine which are indicative of lung cancer.

Secondary Objective

* To identify signatures which are associated with lung cancer stage.
* To identify signatures which are impacted by patient's pulmonary function status.
