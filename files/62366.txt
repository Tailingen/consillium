DRUG: SIACI of cetuximab and bevacizumab
Number of Treatment Related Adverse Events, The number of treatment-related adverse events will be assessed and graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version 5.0., 1 month post injection|Composite Overall Response Rate (CORR), The overall response proportion along with a 95% confidence interval will be estimated via binomial proportions.
