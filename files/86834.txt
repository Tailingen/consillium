Using Genetic Polymorphisms to Predict the Efficacy and Toxicity - A Gastric Adenocarcinoma Study
This is an open-label, non-comparative phase II study of sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Docetaxel
Objective response rate, Tumor responses in measurable lesions are to be evaluated by the tumor response guidelines validated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Group . The new version 1.1 was published in 2009., Every 6 weeks
Progression-free survival, Be calculated as the duration between the first date of randomization and the date of disease recurrence or progression according to RECIST (failed), taking the status of tumor at the treatment has been completed as the reference, or death (failed), or the date of withdrawal (last contact date, censored), or the scheduled data analysis date (censored)., Every 6 weeks
There are two primary objectives in different steps. In the first step, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.

In the second step, the primary objective of this study is to screen the predictive biomarkers of three different chemotherapeutic drugs and also investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving sequential capecitabine plus oxaliplatin followed by docetaxel plus capecitabine in patients with unresectable gastric adenocarcinoma.
