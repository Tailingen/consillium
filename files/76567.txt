To evaluate the pathologic response, downstaging(ypT0-2N0M0)rate, After surgery with pathology data
Tumor regression grade & MR volumetry, To evaluate the tumor regression grade \& MR volumetry, After surgery with pathology data for TRG, at the pretreatment work-up and 1-4 days befor surgery|Acute/ late toxicities, To evaluate the acute and late toxicities, preoperative CCRT to 3 months after surgery
Radiotherapy using tomotherapy is delivered in 5 Gy daily fractions for a total of 25 Gy in 5 fractions.

A bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m2/d)and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/d) is delivered concurrently on day 1-5 during radiotherapy.

Total mesorectal excision is performed within 6±2 weeks. The pathological response of downstaing is the study endpoint.
