Omacetaxine for Consolidation and Maintenance
The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the safety and tolerability of omacetaxine for consolidation in patients age 55 and older with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first complete remission following induction with cytarabine and an anthracycline, and also to assess the safety and tolerability of omacetaxine for maintenance in patients age 55 and older with acute AML in first complete remission following 3 consolidation courses with omacetaxine.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Omacetaxine
Disease Status Assessment Prior to Each Consolidation Cycle, Disease status will be assessed by a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy prior to each of 3 consolidation cycles (to ensure that patients are still in remission)., 14 days|Assessment of Disease Status, Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be obtained., 1 month|Bone Marrow Aspirate to Confirm Continuous Remission, Bone marrow aspirate to confirm continuous remission will be obtained before starting maintenance and at 3 and 6 months from the start of maintenance., 3 months|Maintenance Toxicities, Toxicities will be monitored by history, physical examination, and laboratory monitoring during maintenance., 24 weeks
Consolidation Toxicities, Toxicities will be monitored by history, physical examination, and laboratory monitoring (CBC, serum chemistries to include renal and liver function tests) obtained weekly during consolidation and monthly during maintenance according to standard of care (Appendices C and D). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0 (available at the NCI web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)., 12 weeks
