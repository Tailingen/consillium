The Effect of Pushing Technique With Saline on Success of Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Placement
The aim of this project is to determine the effect of pushing with saline technique on the success of peripheral IV catheter placement in a pediatric hematology and oncology sample. This research is a randomized controlled experimental study.
Nurse's Role
OTHER: Pushing with saline technique|OTHER: Traditional method
Catheterization Description Form, The form contains the catheter information regarding the children. It includes 7 questions including the time elapsed since the last vascular access, causes of catheter removal complications (infiltration, vascular damage, etc.), IV catheter location, IV catheter size (number), and peripheral vein where the catheter was placed. Primary endpoint of the study is Catheterization Description Form., Immediately after the procedure.
The sample of the study consists of children who aged 0-17. It is planned to collect the research data in Akdeniz University Hospital Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Outpatient Clinic. Data Collection Tools are 'Personal Information Form for Children', 'Catheterization Description Form' and 'The Difficult Intravenous Access (DIVA) Score for children '. DIVA Score will be used pre-intervention to determine whether patients have a difficult vein. Children with DIVA score of 4 and above will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The attempt to place an IV catheter in children in the intervention group will be carried out by "pushing with saline" (SF) technique. In this way, it is predicted that the success of IV intervention in difficult vascular access will increase and the number of attempts will decrease significantly. Peripheral catheter placement in the control group will be performed with the traditional method routinely implemented by nurses.
