KEYMAKER-U01 Substudy 2: Efficacy and Safety Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) When Used With Investigational Agents in Treatment-naïve Participants With Anti-programmed Cell Death Receptor Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01B/KEYMAKER-U01B)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with MK-4830 in treatment-naïve participants with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC that is PD-L1 positive.

This study is one of three pembrolizumab substudies being conducted under one pembrolizumab umbrella master protocol (MK-3475-U01/KEYMAKER-U01).

The pembrolizumab+ MK-0482 arm was added with Amendment 6.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|BIOLOGICAL: MK-4830|BIOLOGICAL: MK-0482
Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until either the earliest date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 24 months|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 24 months
The master screening protocol is MK-3475-U01(KEYMAKER-U01) - NCT04165798
