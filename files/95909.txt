A Prospective, Open-label, Randomized Controlled, Multicenter Clinical Study of Haplo-HSCT Using a TBI or TMLI Conditioning Regimen for Pediatric ALL
This study aims to compare the effects of two different conditioning regimens on patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT): Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Total Marrow, Central Nervous System and Lymphoid Irradiation (TMLI). Both regimens are supported and recommended by literature; however, there is no definitive evidence favoring one over the other. We hypothesize that the TMLI regimen, compared to the TBI regimen, may more effectively eliminate leukemia cells in the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, thereby reducing the risk of relapse, while also minimizing damage to normal tissues, thus reducing conditioning-related toxicity and transplant-related mortality. This study aims to provide evidence for the optimal conditioning regimen for haplo-HSCT in pediatric ALL patients, with the goal of improving patient quality of life and survival outcomes.
