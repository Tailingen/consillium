Concordance Between 2 Means of Temperature Measure in Neutropenic Patients Hospitalized in Intensive Hematology Care Units
Connected medicine "2.0" is a major challenge that will lead in the near future to profound changes in medical practices. Our study is part of this technological transformation, which is already taking the form of multiple devices available to practitioners: connected pill dispensers, integrated monitoring and surveillance systems (telemedicine), connected sensors, etc.

However, a symptom as crucial and simple as body temperature has not been measured by real-time enteric capsule in a context of neutropenia. We therefore wish to study the concordance between the peripheral (tympanic) temperature and that measured by a capsule ingested in a cohort of patients hospitalized in the USIH. If the measurements are clinically reliable and truly allow anticipation of antimicrobial treatments, a medico-economic evaluation will be proposed between the two options in the context of USIH before its possible generalization.
Haematological Malignancy
DEVICE: Enteric capsule
Evaluation of the concordance between the body temperature measured at the periphery by ear thermometer and the body temperature measured per enteric capsule, the temperature in degrees Celsius measured by the 2 systems (left and right average for the auricular measure) and analysis of the concordance, 6 months
Estimate of the theoretical administration date of the anti-infective if enteral temperature had been taken into consideration, The time required to start anti-infective treatments according to the 2 measurement methods, in hours (effective start up thanks to the ear and theoretical measurement indicated by the enteric measurement), 6 months|Description of curves of temperature in the neutropenic patient measured continuously, Description of curves of temperature in the neutropenic patient measured continuously, 6 months|Satisfaction of patient towards enteric capsule, auto-questionnaire, 6 months
