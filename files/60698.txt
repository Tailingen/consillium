Primary Pain Palliation in Bone Metastases Treated With Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound
Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) has demonstrated to be effective for pain control through thermally-induced cell death and periosteal denervation caused by cortical heating relative to acoustic energy absorption. There is also evidence that a high intensity focused ultrasound beam can penetrate through the cortical bone to the medullary space, producing thermal necrosis of cancer tissue. However, little is known about the potential effects of MRgFUS as first line therapeutic modality for pain palliation in skeletal metastases.

Our hypothesis sought to assess the clinical performance of MRgFUS primary treatment of painful bone metastases and determine the potential of this technique for local tumor control.
Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Bone
PROCEDURE: MRgFUS
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) for the primary treatment of painful bone metastases, Patients will be monitored for major or minor adverse events, 6 months
To correlate the treatment response to extent of tumor necrosis as determined by follow-up imaging, necrosis of the actual lesion will be analyzed according to area on non-perfused volume at the end of the procedure, 6 months
Unlike previous studies, in which patients were enrolled for MRgFUS treatment because of the failure of other therapies, our study will be conducted in patients not previously treated with EBRT to the targeted lesion.

This is an important new feature, especially given the advantages of MRgFUS, such as lack of ionizing radiation, the ability to conduct treatment on an outpatient basis and the possibility to repeat the treatment as necessary.
