Auto-HSCT-Supported Dose-Dense Chemotherapy with Adebrelimab As First-Line Treatment for ES-SCLC
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-supported dose-dense chemotherepy with adebrelimb works to treat extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in adults. It will also assess the safety of this treatment approach.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-supported dose-dense chemotherepy with adebrelimb improve the median progression free survival and 12-months overall survival rates? What medical problems do participants experience whild undergoing this treatment?

Participants will:

Complete two 21-days cycles of standard-dose etoposide and carboplatin, followed by G-CSF for stem cell mobilization.

Receive dose-dense chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell reinfusion for two 21-day cycles.

If eligible, participants will receive etoposide and carboplatin plus adebrelimab for four cycles.

Finally, participants may enter a maintenance phase with adebrelimab.

Throughout the trial, participants will:

Visit the clinic every 21 days for check-ups and tests. Imaging examination every 6 weeks. Followed up by telephone every 2 months
