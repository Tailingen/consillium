Evaluation of JSKN016 Combination Therapy in Subjects with NSCLC
This is a Phase Ib clinical study conducted in China to evaluate the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with JSKN016 in combination therapy. The enrolled subjects are all in the locally advanced or metastatic stage of non-small cell lung cancer.
