Gene-activated Matrix for Bone Tissue Repair in Maxillofacial Surgery
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of gene-activated matrix ("Nucleostim") for regeneration of bone tissue in maxillofacial area. Patients with congenital and acquired maxillofacial defects (sockets of extracted teeth, bone defects after injuries, surgeries, excision of benign neoplasms and pseudotumors, etc.) or alveolar bone atrophy will be included into the study.

DEVICE: Gene-activated matrix "Nucleostim"
Quantity of newly-formed bone tissue in the field of gene-activated matrix implantation, To determine the quantity of newly-formed bone tissue the morphometric parameters of regenerate will be measured on CT scan using special tools ("ROI", region of interest, etc.)

The morphometric parameters of bone regenerate include:

* average density (in HU);
* size (length, width, height) and volume., 60 days
Pain scores on the visual analog scale, 60 days|Surgical failure rate, 60 days|Adverse Events, 60 days|Edema scores on the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale, Level of edema at the surgical site will be assessed by physician using 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale., 60
All patients enrolled into the study will receive standard surgery procedures indicated in accordance with medical care standards for the certain disease. Maxillofacial bone defects (formed after injuries, surgeries, excision of benign neoplasms and pseudotumors, teeth extraction, etc.) or areas of alveolar bone atrophy will be the filled by gene-activated matrix "Nucleostim". Safety and efficacy of implanted osteoplastic material will be assessed by physical examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, X-ray examination within 60 days after operation.
