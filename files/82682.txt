Screening With Whole Body MRI For Detection Of Primary Tumors In Children And Adults With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) And Other Cancer Predisposition Syndromes
This study is evaluating Whole Body MRI as a possible screening tool to diagnose cancer for people with LFS and other inherited cancer predisposition syndromes.

Individuals who carry the TP53 mutation have a higher risk of developing different types of cancer over their lifetimes. This gene has been associated with Li Fraumeni syndrome in some families, but not all families that have cancer histories consistent with Li Fraumeni syndrome will have the mutation. Currently, there is no standard method of monitoring LFS carriers, family members, or others individuals with cancer predisposition syndromes to detect cancers in the early stages, when they may be more easily treated.

The main aim of the study is to test a relatively new medical technology called Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in patients with these syndromes, to see if cancers can be detected at an early stage which may, in turn, allow for more effective treatment. The investigators have chosen Whole Body MRI scanning because this scan allows doctors to look at the entire body in one examination. By using this technology, participants are not exposed to radiation, which is of particular importance for individuals who have a higher cancer risk due to a diagnosis of LFS.
