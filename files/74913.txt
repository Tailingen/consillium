First-line Treatment of MCapOX + Cetuximab Vs. MFOLFOX6 + Cetuximab for RAS/BRAF Wild-type, MSS, Unresectable Left-Sided MCRC: a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Phase III Study
This multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase III study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first line mCapOX plus Cetuximab versus mFOLFOX6 plus Cetuximab for RAS/BRAF wild-type, MSS, Unresectable Left-Sided mCRC.
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)|Capecitabine|Cetuximab
DRUG: mCapOX plus Cetuximab|DRUG: mFOLFOX6 plus Cetuximab
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the period from randomization to disease progress or death. Includes first-line induction therapy and maintenance therapy., up to 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants acquired Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) during treatment. Based on RECIST 1.1., 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients who acquired Complete response (CR), Partial response (PR), or Stable disease (SD) during treatment. Based on RECIST 1.1., 6 months|Time to Failure of Strategy (TFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to \[secondary disease progression after reintroduction of first-line induction chemotherapy following maintenance therapy disease progression\] or \[all-cause death\].

If participants progressed on maintenance therapy after first-line induction chemotherapy without reintroduction of first-line induction chemotherapy or progressed during first-line induction chemotherapy, TFS equals PFS, up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the period from randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years|Adverse Event rate, The rate of adverse event after treatment, up to 3 years|Pharmacoeconomic, Including CERs (Cost-Effectiveness Ratios) and ICERs (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios).

CERs：Defined as the ratio of the total costs of a medical intervention to the health benefits gained from that intervention.

ICERs：Defined as the ratio of the difference in costs between two alternative interventions（Arm A and Arm B） to the difference in their effectiveness., up to 3 years|Quality of Life, Assessment of quality of life through the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ), up to 3 years
Study participants who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the mCapOX + cetuximab or mFOLFOX6 + cetuximab treatment groups, and those who have achieved control of their disease (Complete response \[CR\] + Partial response \[PR\] + Stable disease \[SD\]) after a maximum of 12 cycles of first-line induction therapy in both groups will continue to receive Capecitabine or Capecitabine + Cetuximab maintenance therapy until disease progression or toxicity is not tolerated or informed consent is withdrawn.
