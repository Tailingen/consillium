Prostate Oligometastatic Cancer Management Driven by Disease Biology et/or Immunoactivity (PROMETEO)
Currently, despite the advent of next-generation imaging has improved the detection of Oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC), prognostic biomarkers able to stratify patients and monitor treatment response are lacking and urgently needed. Mounting evidence suggests that molecular profiling of the disease and host immune activity evaluation can reveal OMPC heterogeneity and address the above unmet clinical need.

This study aims at combining the analysis of several biomarkers to improve the prognostic stratification of OMPC patients

Currently, despite the advent of next-generation imaging has improved the detection of Oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC), prognostic biomarkers able to stratify patients and monitor treatment response are lacking and urgently needed. Mounting evidence suggests that molecular profiling of the disease and host immune activity evaluation can reveal OMPC heterogeneity and address the above unmet clinical need.

Liquid biopsy, defined as the sampling and analysis of tumor-derived analytes \[i.e.: circulating tumor cells (CTCs), or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)\] from blood, represents a powerful tool to assess in real-time the evolving landscape of cancer, identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers and detect resistance to therapies in several cancers, including Prostate Cancer (PC).

Additionally, the same blood sample allows the profiling of tumor-associated components, such as circulating immune cells, which may give clues at the systemic level about the dynamic and complex host-tumor interaction. It is non-invasive, easily repeatable, and cost-effective. In this regard, preliminary results derived from clinical studies indicate that the analysis of tumor material circulating in peripheral blood, combined with the study of the host immune response might be pivotal. This study aims at combining the analysis of several biomarkers, associated with both tumor (CTC and cfDNA) and host (TCR), with a micro-invasive approach, such as liquid biopsy, to improve the prognostic stratification of OMPC patients compared to conventional laboratory test (PSA) and imaging exams (Choline- or PSMA-PET imaging).
