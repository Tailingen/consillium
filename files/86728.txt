TRC105 Combined With Standard-dose Bevacizumab for Two Patients With Metastatic And Refractory Choriocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether TRC105 in combination with Bevacizumab is effective in the treatment of two patients with metastatic and refractory choriocarcinoma.
Choriocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: TRC105|BIOLOGICAL: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival of Two Patients With Metastatic and Refractory Choriocarcinoma, Progression Free Survival of Two Patients With Metastatic and Refractory Choriocarcinoma determined according to RECIST 1.1 including measurement of serum β- hCG. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. A 5 mm absolute increase is also required to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small., Assessed every 8 weeks for up to 35 Months|Objective Response Rate of Two Patients With Metastatic and Refractory Choriocarcinoma by RECIST 1.1 Including Measurement of Serum β- hCG, To determine the Objective Response Rate of two patients with metastatic and refractory choriocarcinoma by RECIST 1.1 including measurement of serum β- hCG. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) categorizes response as:

Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) - \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Assessed every 8 weeks for up to 35 Months
Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, Adverse event frequency and severity according to CTCAE version 4.0., Assessed weekly during and up to 28 days after completion of study protocol over a maximum period of 35 months.
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor types. TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody to CD105, an angiogenic target highly expressed on the tumor vessels and the tumor cells in choriocarcinoma. Together, these antibodies may be efficacious in metastatic and refractory choriocarcinoma, a tumor type that is highly vascular and expresses endoglin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether TRC105 in combination with Bevacizumab is effective in the treatment of two patients with metastatic and refractory choriocarcinoma.
