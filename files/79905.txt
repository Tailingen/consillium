Effect of Patient Position on Computerized Tomography Guided Celiac Trunk Neurolysis
Computerized tomography-guided Celiac plexus neurolysis has become a popular technique. As, it has Cross-section imaging system to avoids anatomic structures injury, it has high density resolution that clearly display the retro-peritoneal anatomic structures ,it allow an optimal puncture site selection and measured the angle and depth of the needle insertion accurately with display the range of the neurolytic agent diffusion
Upper Abdominal Malignancy
DEVICE: Double needle celiac neurolysis (DNCN)|DEVICE: Single needle celiac neurolysis (SNCN)
Failure rate of patients positioning, Positioning failure means failure to put patient in prone or lateral position, For 5 min before needle insertion
Time to achieve analgesia, Time to achieve pain score less than 3, for one hour after performing the procedure|Failure of block, Failure of block is defined as patient having pain visual analogue scale greater than 3, For 1 week after performing the procedure
The aim of this study was to evaluate analgesic efficacy of a computerized tomography guided left lateral antero-crural approach near the origin of celiac trunk with patients position on their right side immediately after the procedure using a single needle injection technique for upper abdominal malignancy compared with the classic 2 needle posterior antero-crural injection technique and possible complications.

All patients will take thin computerized tomography section in the axial plane to detect the site of celiac plexus and coronal plane for correct site for needle placement.

Computerized tomography slices thickness will be from 3 mm at 5mm interval through all the abdominal and lower thoracic area. The celiac and superior mesenteric arteries will be identified after contrast injection.

When an ideal needle position and tip were confirmed, the stylet was removed and aspiration was performed to ensure that there was no blood is withdrawn.

A volume of 3 ml of lidocaine mixed with contrast was injected to confirm the position, after injection another cut has been taken to show the spread of contrast freely in the retro-peritoneal space around the celiac plexus and the aorta. After confirmation, that contrast was injected to surround the artery and make sure that there was no dorsal spread to avoid injury to somatic nerves. Also to make sure that there was no spread to the renal pelvis , injection of phenol 10% mixed with contrast through needle
