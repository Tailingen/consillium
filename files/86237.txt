Increasing HPV Immunization Rates: The Rural Adolescent Vaccine Enterprise
The goal of this study is to engage rural primary care clinics and community organizations to test interventions designed to increase HPV vaccinations in both male and female patients aged 9-26 years.
Human Papilloma Virus
BEHAVIORAL: Practice facilitation
HPV vaccine series completion, A primary outcome variable is the receipt rate of the full series of HPV vaccine among males and females aged 11-17 years. Practices will be block randomized in five waves every six months. Outcomes will be measured every three months in all clusters at every period, so that each cluster provides data points in both the control and intervention conditions. Practices in each wave will be stratified based on designation of pediatric or family medicine clinic to balance pediatric/family medicine clinics at each wave. Outcome data collection will be collected from Oregon's ALERT Immunization System beginning in quarter four and up to 17, for 14 longitudinal data collection points per practice., 3 months
The overarching goal of this study is to engage rural primary care clinics and community organizations to test interventions designed to increase HPV vaccinations in both male and female patients aged 9-26 years. Using a step-wedge randomized controlled trial, we will design and test the effectiveness of multi-component primary care practice-based interventions on the completion of the HPV vaccine series and will explore implementation timing in high and low functioning practices to determine how specific characteristics affect the delivery of the full series. Additionally, we will design and test the impact of a community organization-based intervention intended to educate the public about HPV and cancer risk and risk reduction via vaccination.
