Dose-Escalation Study of Oral Administration of LP-108 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Azacitidine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory MDS, CMML, or AML
A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of Orally Administered LP-108 as Monotherapy and in Combination with Azacitidine in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
AML/MDS|CMML|Relapse|Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Relapse Leukemia|Relapsed Adult AML
DRUG: LP-108|DRUG: LP-108 and azacitidine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LP-108: Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], At Cycle 1 Day 1 (24 h PK), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 1 (24 h PK)|The PK profile of LP-108: Area Under the Curve [AUC], At Cycle 1 Day 1 (24 h PK), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 1 (24 h PK)|The PK profile of LP-108: Time at Maximum Concentration [Tmax], At Cycle 1 Day 1 (24 h PK), Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 1 (24 h PK)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) for AML, Assessment will be based on revised recommendations of the ELN 2017., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|ORR for MDS, Assessment will be based on the proposed International Working Group 2006 criteria for MDS patients., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|ORR for CMML, Assessment will be based on international consortium proposal of uniform response criteria for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) for CMML patients., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment until objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is for all subjects achieving an objective response., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the start of LP-108 therapy until the earliest date of refractory disease or relapse., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment initiation until death from any cause., up to 13 cycles (one cycle has 4 weeks)
The primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-108 administered daily as a single agent dosed orally and in combination with azacitidine at 75 mg/m2 in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory MDS/CMML/AML; to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-108 as monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory MDS/CMML/AML.

Secondary objectives are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect of LP-108 (monotherapy or combination therapy) on ORR for AML, MDS, CMML, PFS, DOR, and OS
