Study of Perioperative NP137 and FOLFIRINOX in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
The objective of this study is to investigate whether adding the study drug, NP137, to a patient's treatment regimen (before surgery and in combination with chemotherapy afterward) can alter the behavior of pancreatic cancer..
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: NP137
Determining if NP137 can shift the primary tumor MAK's Signature Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) Mean Score towards a more epithelial phenotype, EMT score is determined by the mean expression of mesenchymal genes minus the mean expression of epithelial genes Therefore, a positive EMT score suggests a mesenchymal status (worse outcome), whereas a negative score indicates an epithelial status (better outcome)., 3-5 years
Pathological Response Rate, Pathologic response rate after treatment with NP137. The Pathological Response definition will follow the College of American Pathologists criteria, 3-5 years|Two-year metastasis-free survival, Metastasis-free survival at two years. Metastasis-free survival is defined as the time between the date of enrollment and the date of the 1st distant event occurrence ., 4-7 years|Disease free survival, Disease free survival defined as time from the date of enrollment until the date of the first cancer-related event, second cancer, or death from any cause., 5-8 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined by the date of enrollment to date of death from any cause, 5-8 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]), Descriptive of Adverse event during the trial., 5-8 years
The aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanism of action for a novel anti-Netrin-1 antibody (NP137) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pre-clinical data indicates that anti-Netrin-1 therapy can prevent/delay metastatic progression of disease by inducing cancer cell death through its dependence receptor Unc5b as well as prevent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).

This pilot study is designed to provide vital translational scientific information that will inform the design of future clinical trials for NP137. This information includes determining the optimal use of NP137 with cytotoxic, as well as the treatment setting of resectable pancreatic cancer.
