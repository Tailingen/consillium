A Study to Evaluate ATP150/ATP152, VSV-GP154 and Ezabenlimab in Patients With KRAS G12D/G12V Mutated PDAC (KISIMA-02)
The goal of this clinical trial is to test an experimental treatment (immunotherapy) in pancreatic cancer patients. The main research objectives are:

* to evaluate if the KISIMA-02 treatment is safe and well-tolerated (first part)
* to evaluate if the KISIMA-02 treatment has an impact on the time to observe a possible reappearance of the tumor (second part)

Participants will receive:

i) a therapeutic protein vaccine ATP150 or ATP 152 ii) a viral vector VSV-GP154 iii) an immune checkpoint inhibitor Ezabenlimab In the second part of the study, researchers will compare treatment group versus observational group.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: VSV-GP154|DRUG: ATP150|DRUG: ATP152|DRUG: Ezabenlimab
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Part A and B, Over at least 35 days|Disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization until confirmed relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Part C, Throughout the study, on average 2.4 years
Proportion of patients achieving ctDNA clearance, Part C, Up to 12 months|Proportion of patients experiencing ctDNA non-progression, Part C, up to 12 months|Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Part C, Throughout the study, up to 7.5 months
This is an open-label, phase 1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of a heterologous prime-boost vaccine (protein and viral vector) regimen without/with the PD-1 inhibitor Ezabenlimab.

COMPLETED - Part A (metastatic and locally advanced PDAC patients) Cohort A: ATP150/ATP152 and VSV-GP154 treatment

ONGOING - Part B (locally advanced and resected PDAC patients) Cohort B: ATP150/ATP152, Ezabenlimab and VSV-GP154 treatment Cohort B1, B2, B3: dose escalation

NOT STARTED YET - Part C (resected PDAC patients) Cohort C: ATP150/ATP152, Ezabenlimab and VSV-GP154 treatment (treatment versus observational arm)
