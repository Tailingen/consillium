The C-MERIT Screening Cohort: Contrast-enhanced Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment in Women With Dense Breasts
To learn whether a new imaging technology, Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM), compared to standard mammography, can better detect breast cancers in women with dense breasts
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast Enhanced Mammography
To identify female MDACC patients with dense breasts who undergo contrast-enhanced mammography, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

* To establish a cohort of 1,000 female MDACC patients with dense breasts who undergo screening contrast-enhanced mammography.
* To establish a comprehensive integrated database of imaging, clinical data, health measurements, and questionnaire data including data from the companion protocol PA17-0584.

Secondary Objectives:

* To perform within-subject comparison of the cancer detection rate between CEM and FFDM.
* To perform within-subject comparison of the sensitivity, specificity, and recall rates of CEM compared to low-energy (LE) images (FFDM equivalent) and compared to a combination of LE and DBT images among women with dense breasts.
* To evaluate the effect of the availability of prior imaging for comparison on the recall rates of CEM, FFDM and DBT.
* In patients who undergo screening breast ultrasound as a standard of care, to evaluate the performance of screening ultrasound for breast cancer detection and compare it with other imaging modalities of CEM, LE images, and DBT.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To combine imaging, blood biomarkers, health measurements and questionnaire data for assessment of breast cancer risk.
* To evaluate if the intensity of background parenchymal enhancement on CEM predicts breast cancer risk in women with dense breasts.
* To evaluate if patients consider CEM as a potentially acceptable imaging modality for routine breast cancer screening.
