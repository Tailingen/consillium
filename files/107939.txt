Pharmacogenomic-Guided Antidepressant Drug Prescribing in Cancer Patients
This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the clinical impact of a preemptive pharmacogenomics strategy to guide antidepressant therapy in cancer patients. Those enrolled onto the clinical trial will be randomized to either DNA-guided choice of therapy or clinical management alone. Scores on self-reported measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms along with quality of life will be compared between cohorts.
