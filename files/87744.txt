Intraoperative Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced or Recurrent Abdomino-pelvic Solid Tumors With the CivaSheet
This study is a pilot study of the CivaSheet, a new type of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) device that offers several advantages over existing techniques of performing IORT. The CivaSheet device in this study is already approved by the FDA and is not an experimental device. This study will allow us to determine how feasible it is to implant the CivaSheet into patients undergoing surgery for abdominal and pelvic tumors, and assess any possible side effects of the device. This study, if successful, may allow us to offer the CivaSheet more widely as treatment option to future patients.

DEVICE: CivaSheet|RADIATION: Brachytherapy|PROCEDURE: surgical resection
number of successful implantation of the device in patients, Feasibility is determined by successful implantation of the device into a patient who has been enrolled on the protocol and deemed appropriate for IORT at the time of surgery., 1 year
