DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Anal pap smear and oral swab for cytology and HPV testing
Prevalence (number/percentage) of HPV infection in oral and anal samples, PCR analysis will identify the presence of HPV in oral or anal mucosal cells and characterize the genotype of HPV., Up to 12 months|Prevalence (number/percentage) of abnormal HPV-related cytology in oral and anal samples, Cytology changes will be reported according to the Bethesda classification., Up to 12 months
Multivariate analysis to identify risk factors for HPV infection in oral and anal samples., Risk factors such as demographics, sexual conduct, and factors related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and IBD therapy will be evaluated through patient history research and the use of a self-administered questionnaire, Up to 12 months
Male IBD patients attending the IBD Clinic of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau will be screened for eligibility. Informed consent will be obtained from all eligible patients. An anal and oral swab will be performed on all patients to look for HPV infection (HPV DNA test) and cytologic alterations. Patients will be inspected to rule out the presence of HPV-related lesions. Moreover, a self-administered questionnaire will be completed by all enrolled patients. Information regarding IBD characteristics and treatment will be obtained.

According to local practice, patients with anal or oral squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) will be referred to a colorectal surgeon for further recommendations or treatment.
