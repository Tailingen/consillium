Velcade and Sorafenib in Unresected or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is an open label, non-randomized, single arm phase II study. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combination of sorafenib and VELCADEÂ® (bortezomib). The primary efficacy endpoint is Progression-Free Survival (PFS). The secondary objectives of this study are to:

Assess the response rate of this combination in this patient population and Assess the toxicity of this combination in this patient population
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Velcade and Sorafenib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival will be measured from the beginning of treatment until there is evidence of progressive disease or death from any cause. Progression is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Progressive Disease (PD), 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 36 weeks
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Tumor response is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI:) Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Overall response rate (ORR) is the percentage of patients who achieve a CR or PR, 42 days|Toxicity Profile, Toxicity is assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Toxicity profile is reported as the number of patients who received at least one dose of on-study treatment and experienced a grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event (AE). For a more complete listing of all AEs experienced by patients on study, please see the Adverse Event section., 42 days
* Pretreatment, a complete history and physical examination to include performance status, weight and concurrent non-malignant disease and therapy will be done before starting treatment. Prior surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy details will be noted.
* Prior to the initiation of treatment, laboratory studies should include a CBC with differential cell count, platelet count, urinalysis, complete metabolic profile, magnesium and electrocardiogram. A baseline imaging study of the tumor will be performed. Other X-rays will be done as clinically indicated.
* Physical examination, performance status and toxicity recording will be done before each course of therapy.
* During the study, patients will be followed with complete blood count (CBC), differential and platelet counts on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Chemistries will also be performed before each course within a 3 day leeway prior to treatment. Clinical schedules will be considered when scheduling patients for treatment, specimen collection and processing, and specimen shipment.
* Measureable and evaluable disease will be evaluated by the same imaging studies done at baseline and every 2 courses thereafter to determine tumor response.
* For patients on warfarin, International Normalized Ration (INR) testing will be performed prior to the first cycle, weekly during the first cycle, and then prior to day one for subsequent cycles if the INR is in an acceptable range during the first cycle. If the INR has not been in an acceptable range during the first cycle, the INR will be monitored weekly until the value is stable on three consecutive measurements one week apart.
* Since Sorafenib is a competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) patients will be assessed each cycle for medications or changes in diet that would affect CYP3A4 metabolism.
