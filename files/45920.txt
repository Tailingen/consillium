OBSiDiAN in a Stapled Circular Esophagogastric Anastomosis After Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy
Oesophagectomy is very invasive surgery. A leakage at the level of the connection between oesophagus and stomach made during surgery causes a lot more problems and can lead to death. Studies show that the leakage rate sometimes goes up to 40 per cent. The chance of dying if you develop a leak after surgery is 15%, while the overall chance of dying during hospitalisation for this procedure is about 4%. We want to investigate whether the use of this new type of 'glue' (Obsidian®) can reduce the number of leaks. We invite you to participate in a clinical trial with the aim of investigating whether Obsidian® is safe and can reduce the number of leaks after oesophageal surgery in patients with oesophageal cancer. We want to apply a new type of 'glue', Obsidian®, at the level of the new connection between oesophagus and stomach.

STUDY PRODUCT Autologous BioMatrix: Obsidian (medical device class III)

STUDY POPULATION Subjects ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years of age scheduled for elective Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with a circular stapled intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.

SAMPLE SIZE A total of 90 patients will be included in the study. ENROLEMENT PERIOD Based on an annual number of 70-80 esophagectomies in University Hospital Ghent, we predict an enrolment period of 3 years.

STUDY DURATON Considering a 3 years enrolment period and a 1 year follow up we predict a study duration of 4 years.

PRIMAIRY ANALYSIS

• Anastomotic leak within 30 days post operatively. Anastomotic leak type I, II and III is defined according to the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG).
