A Multivariate Index Assay for Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment in Women With Adnexal Mass and High-Risk Germline Variants
The objective of this project is to validate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values of the AMRA blood test for assessing risk of cancer in women at high risk for ovarian cancer, due to the presence of a symptomatic adnexal mass.
Adnexal Mass
DEVICE: OVAnex
OVAnex, OVAnex is a multivariate index assay assessing ovarian cancer risk. The Ovanex MIA uses seven biomarkers with a stepwise algorithm to generate a risk score which ranges from 0 to 20., 12 months
