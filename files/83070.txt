A New Clinical Pathway for Personalized Management of Borderline Resectable and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
NORPACT-3 is a nationwide, Norwegian single arm prospective study that evaluates the resectability rates and survival in patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer who received primary chemotherapy. Eligible patients are treated with primary chemotherapy possibly followed by surgical exploration and resection. All Norwegian centres performing pancreatic surgery have agreed to collaborate in this trial. The assignment of the medical intervention is not at the discretion of the investigator, but follow the national Norwegian guidelines regarding diagnostic work up, oncological and surgical treatment and follow up. The primary aim is a national resection rate of 50% in BRPC and 15% in LAPC in patients initiating primary chemotherapy, with adequate overall survival and morbidity/mortality (after resection median overall survival of 24 months, 1 year survival 80%, and 5 year survival \>20% + 90 day postoperative mortality ≤5%, 90-day postoperative major morbidity (Clavien Dindo grade 3) ≤40%).
