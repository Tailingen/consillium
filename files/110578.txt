Induction Chemotherapy With TP+5-FU or TP+Cetuximab Followed by Radioimmuptherapy for Locally Advanced or Not Resectable SCCHNN
This multicentre, randomised Phase II Pilot Study evaluates the efficacy of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or Cetuximab, followed by Cetuximab with radiotherapy.

Response Rate (CR, PR), RECIST criteria, 3 months after end of therapy
Overall Response Rate (CR, PR, PD, SD), RECIST, until 3 months after therapy|Locoregionally monitoring, after one year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), 1, 2 and 5 years after start of therapy|Adverse reactions, Information about acute toxicity (grade, relation to study drug) during study treatment and until 3 months after end of radiotherapy will be collected for each patient using CTCAE 3.0 criteria list.

Information about late toxicity (grade) will be collected after 3 months of radiotherapy and until 60 months after radiotherapy using RTOG/EORTC toxicity criteria.

Kind and number of toxicities will be described according to grade. The highest grade of each patient and toxicity will be analysed., During treatment and until 60 months after end of radiotherapy|Overall-Survival, 1, 2 and 5 years after start of therapy
It will be evaluated whether 5-FU can be replaced by immunotherapy with cetuximab within a taxane/cisplatin-containing induction-chemotherapy scheme for advanced carcinoma of the head and neck. As 5-FU causes severe mucosal toxicities which are added to known toxicities of cisplatin, a combination-therapy with reduced toxicities and same efficacy would be a acceptable alternative to patients.
