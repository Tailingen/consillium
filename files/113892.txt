A Study of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Combined With Interventional Therapy in Advanced Liver Malignancy
The purpose of this study is to collect the date on the safety and potential effectiveness of CART cells combined with interventional therapy in patients with advanced liver malignancy.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic|Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: CAR-T cell
Number of patients with adverse event, adverse event is evaluated with CTCAE, version 4.0, 6 weeks
Number of patients with tumor response, summarize tumor response by overall response rates, 8 weeks|Detection of transferred T cells in the circulation using quantitative -PCR, 8 weeks
Designer T cells are prepared by PBMC which from patients or suitable donator by leukapheresis, and then activated and re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). There are three options for CAR-targets: GPC3 for hepatocellular carcinoma; mesothelin for pancreatic cancer metastatic; CEA for colorectal cancer metastatic. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the participant by vascular interventional therapy or by intra-tumor injection at the dose of （1.25\~4）×107 CAR positive T cells/cm3 tumor bulk. The volume of cell products and the time of cell perfusion process lasted would depend on the ways of cell perfused.
