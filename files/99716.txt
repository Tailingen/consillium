Adaptive BRAF-MEK Inhibitor Therapy for Advanced BRAF Mutant Melanoma
This pilot early phase I trial studies how well encorafenib, binimetinib, and nivolumab work in treating patients with BRAF mutant stage IIIC-IV melanoma. Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with nivolumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving encorafenib, binimetinib, and nivolumab may kill more tumor cells.
