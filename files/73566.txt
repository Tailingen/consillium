BKM120 in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma After Failure of First Line Chemotherapy
There is a need for more effective therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who developed disease progression after first line therapy. Currently, there is no standard second-line therapy for this disease.

BKM-120 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor currently tested in clinical trials. In a cellular model of oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, it has shown that EGFR overexpression activated PI3/AKT pathway. Therfore, there is interest to see the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in this setting.
