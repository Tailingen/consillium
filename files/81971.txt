A Trial Evaluating Surufatinib Efficacy and Safety in Biliary Tract Carcinoma Patients
This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multi-center, phase IIb/III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib vs. Capecitabine as a second-line therapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 298 subjects are randomly assigned to two study treatment groups in the ratio of 1:1 by Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).

* Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib，once a day for 3 weeks as a cycle;
* Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral administration twice a day for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).

All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study treatment period, and the treatment and survival of the patients after progressive disease are recorded. Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and changes in electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.

Overall survival (OS), Compare the Overall survival (OS) rate between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.
Progression-free survival (PFS), Compare the Progression-free survival (PFS) rate between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.|Objective remission rate (ORR), Compare the Objective remission rate (ORR) rate between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.|Disease control rate (DCR), Compare the Disease control rate (DCR) rate between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.|Duration of response (DOR), Compare the Duration of response (DOR) rate between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.
Quality of life score, Compare the Quality of life score between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group. Using quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) to collect the score. Scale range is 30\~126, higher values are considered to be a better outcome., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.|Changes of tumor markers (CEA, CA199), Compare the Changable rate of tumor markers (CEA, CA199) between surufatinib group and Capecitabine group., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.|Detection of biomarkers, Correlation between mutation of tumor genes and efficacy; Changes in target-related markers before and after treatment., 5 months after the last patient enrolled.
This is a randomized, open-label, active-control, multi-center, phase IIb/III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib vs. Capecitabine as a second-line therapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). About 298 subjects are randomly assigned to two study treatment groups in the ratio of 1:1 by IWRS.

* Active group: 300 mg of surufatinib is given by oral administration once a day (QD) every 3 weeks;
* Control group: In each 3-week cycle, Capecitabine is given at 1250 mg/m2 by oral administration twice a day (BID) for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest period (equivalent to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose).

Patients are randomized with the following stratification factors:

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0 or 1);
* Years from the first diagnosis of BTC to the randomization date (≤ 1 year or \> 1 year);
* The primary site of the tumor (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer).

All patients will be treated based on the arm to which they have been randomized. Treatment on study will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other criteria for discontinuation from study treatment. The tumor assessments are performed with imaging every 6 weeks (+3 days) until progressive disease (RECIST v1.1) or death on the study treatment period, and the treatment and survival of the patients after progressive disease are recorded. Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and changes in electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.
