Letrozole and Metronomic Capecitabine in ER-positive HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer (B-001 Study)
A phase II clinical trial designed to test the effect of combining endocrinal therapy (Letrozole) with chemotherapy (Capecitabine) in first line treatment of advanced cases of female breast cancer with ER positive disease.

This is a randomized clinical trial that assigns patients with female breast cancer in the metastatic entity or advanced -beyond local disease treatment - entity into two arms. Arm A contains Letrozole with metronomic Capecitabine versus arm B that contains Letrozole alone. This is to be applied on ER positive HER2 negative tumours.
