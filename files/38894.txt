Perception About Benefits and Risks Related to Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Use in Patients With Lynch Syndrome
Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), according to the opinion by The Manchester International Consensus Group, should be considered for women wishing contraception because also positively impact endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer risk. The awareness of the effects of hormonal therapies in women at high risk of developing endometrial cancer, colorectal, breast, or ovarian cancer, such as those affected by Lynch syndrome (LS), is currently limited, with few published studies addressing these populations. Making informed decisions about CHC use in this context necessitates careful consideration of individual cancer risk and the potential benefits and risks associated with CHC use. Accurate information regarding the oncological risks associated with CHC use is essential for facilitating shared decision-making between women and their healthcare providers in this patient population.

This prospective study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of women with LS concerning CHCs and their potential effects on specific disease development and cancer risk, comparing them to the general population. By considering psychosocial factors and individual perceptions of cancer risk, this study seeks to contribute to informed decision-making, personalized counseling, and improved strategies for gynecologic cancer risk management in women with LS.
