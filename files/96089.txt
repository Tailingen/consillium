Neo-Sequence 1: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without Antiangiogenesis and Sequential Immunotherapy for HER2-negative MMR-proficient Locally Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
This is a single-institution, prospective phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and sequential immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophagogastric junction and gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with Her-2 positive or dMMR tumors will be excluded from the study. Six cycles of nab-paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and S-1 with or without bevacizumab, followed by three circles of nab-paclitaxel, bevacizumab, with or without S-1 combined with two cycles of PD-1 monoclonal antibody, will be administered as neoadjuvant therapy. Patients will receive different adjuvant treatments depending on the degrees of surgical radicality and the pathological reactions of tumors.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: SOX plus Paclitaxel with or without antiangiogenesis followed by PD-1 antibody
Event-free survival (EFS), The time from recruitment to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cause., From the recruitment to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years
