PTCs-based Precision Treatment Strategy on Recurrent High-grade Gliomas
This trial is an open-label, single-arm, phase 0/1 study of high-grade glioma that aims to evaluate the feasibility, preliminary efficacy and safety of the precision treatment strategy.
Recurrent High Grade Glioma
DRUG: Receiving chemotherapeutic or targeted drugs recommended by molecular tumor board.
The percentage of patients who accomplish the recommended regimen for at least 1 course., 24 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, From the first shot to 4 weeks after the last shot|Ratio of 6 months overall survival (OS), Percentage of patients who survived more than 6 months from the date of surgery to death, 6 months|Ratio of 12months overall survival (OS), Percentage of patients who survived more than 12 months from the date of surgery to death, 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival, time from the date of surgery to any types of progression, 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival, time from the date of surgery to death for whatever reason, 24 months
The investigators have established a precision treatment strategy, that select chemotherapeutic drugs or targeted drugs based on information from PTCs drug-screening or/and bioinformatic prediction. In this study, the investigators are going to exploit this strategy for the precision treatment of recurrent high-grade gliomas. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy via collecting the indexes comprising clinical presentation, results of imaging examination, clinical assays, KPS, neurological score, etc.
