Prostate Hypoxia FAZA
The purpose of this study is to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in prostate cancer using a special x-ray test called a positron emission tomography (PET)scan. Hypoxia may have an effect on how prostate cancer grows and responds to treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the methods used previously.
