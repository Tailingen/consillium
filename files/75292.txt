Vactosertib in Combination w/ Pomalidomide in Relapsed or Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, called Vactosertib, is safe and determine what the best dose is to treat future patients when given in combination with pomalidomide (POM). The study will also look to see if it has any effect on multiple myeloma, when given in combination with POM.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Vactosertib|DRUG: Pomalidomide
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum tested dose level of Vactosertib given in combination with POM for the treatment of relapsed or RRMM, the largest tested dose where multiple dose limiting toxicities are not observed, Up to 30 days after treatment ends (24 weeks + 30 days)
Overall response rate, overall response is the complete response \[CR\] + very good partial response \[VGPR\] + partial response \[PR\] based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria, Up to 6 months after beginning treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be measured from study entry to progression or death of any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 30 days after discontinuation of treatment|Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6), Number of patients who did not progress on treatment, at 6 months after beginning treatment, Up to 6 months after beginning treatment|Duration of Response, The time from the first confirmed response to progression of disease. Responses include Complete Response (CR), Stringent CR, Very Good Partial Response, Partial Response, Minor Response, Stable disease. Responses based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria, Up to 6 months after beginning treatment|clinical benefit rate, clinical benefit rate is the CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response \[MR\] based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria, Up to 6 months after beginning treatment|Overall Survival, Overall survival for all will be measured from study entry to death from any cause, Up to 6 months after progression
Primary Objective

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum tested dose level of Vactosertib given in combination with pomalidomide (POM) for the treatment of relapsed or relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)
* To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of Vactosertib in combination with POM at the MTD

Secondary Objectives

To evaluate the activity of the combination of Vactosertib/POM regimen in terms of:

* Overall response rate (complete response \[CR\] + very good partial response \[VGPR\] +partial response \[PR\]) and clinical benefit rate (CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response \[MR\]) based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria and the duration of response (DOR) in RRMM patients.
* Progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6)

Exploratory Objective:

To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib combination therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple myeloma.

Study Design To evaluate the bone remodeling and immunologic effects of POM/Vactosertib combination therapy and its correlation with clinical outcome in patients with multiple myeloma. This study is a Phase I, open label trial of Vactosertib in combination with standard doses of POM. The study will be conducted as a modified Fibonacci 3 + 3 dose escalation design to determine the MTD of Vactosertib in combination with standard doses of POM. Patients will receive combination Vactosertib/POM.
