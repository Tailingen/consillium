Cellular Immunotherapy for Patients With High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The main objective of this work is to conduct a clinical study for the development and application of a vaccine with autologous dendritic cells submitted to electroporation with Wilm's tumor 1 (WT1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), as an adjuvant treatment of high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, aiming to delay the progression of the disease or its relapse and increase overall and event-free survival.
