CUDC-907 Treatment in People With Metastatic and Locally Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Background:

The thyroid is a gland at the base of the throat. Thyroid cancer is a disease that people get when abnormal cells begin to grow in this gland. Researchers believe a new drug called CUDC-907 may be able to help people with thyroid cancer that has spread or has gotten worse.

Objective:

To see if CUDC-907 will shrink tumors in people with advanced thyroid cancer.

Eligibility:

People at least 18 years old who have been diagnosed with locally advanced and metastatic thyroid cancer.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood and urine tests

Electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test.

Review of their symptoms and how they perform normal activities

A scan will be performed. Some will have a computed tomographic scan (CT) that takes pictures of the body using a small amount of radiation. Some will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that uses a magnetic field to take pictures.

Bone scan (some participants)

Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan to produce a tumor image.

A sample of their tumor from a previous surgery. They may have a biopsy of their tumor if a tumor sample is not available from a previous surgery.

Participants will be given CUDC-907 in tablet form. They will take it by mouth once a day for 5 days, then take 2 days off, each week.

While taking the study drug, participants will have study visits that repeat the screening tests.

After they stop treatment, participants will have 3 follow-up visits over a year. They will repeat some tests. Then participants will be contacted by phone or e-mail every 6 months....

DRUG: CUDC-907
Number of Participants With a Clinical Response (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) Assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Clinical response, defined as a complete response + partial response (CR+PR) to CUDC-907 treatment, was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Approximately 6 months
Median Amount of Time Subject Survives Without Disease Progression After Treatment, Time in days from initiation of treatment until tumor grows more than 20%. Progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Approximately 6 months|Median Amount of Time Subject Survives After Therapy, Time in days from the initiation of treatment until death estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., Approximately 12 months|Correlation Between Mutation Status of Tumor and Median Amount of Time Subject Survives Without Disease Progression After Treatment, The amount of time subject survives without disease progression is compared by patient tumor mutation status., At disease progression|Correlation Between Activation of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (AKT) and EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK Pathways in Tumor Tissue and Median Amount of Time Subject Survives Without Disease Progression After Treatment, The amount of time subject survives without disease progression is compared by the protein levels of PI3K/AKT and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) in tumor tissue., At disease progression|Correlation Between Histone Deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Survivin Protein Levels in Tumor Tissue With Median Amount of Time Subject Survives Without Disease Progression After Treatment, The amount of time subject survives without disease progression is compared by the protein levels of HDAC2 and surviving in tumor tissue. Progression was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions., At disease progression|Count of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 12 months and 13 days
Background:

* There are no standard or effective systemic therapies for metastatic or locally advanced poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer.
* Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer are aggressive, with high mortality.
* CUDC-907 is a first-in-class dual inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and PI3K signaling.
* Approximately 80% of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancers have driver mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway or activation of the pathway.
* HDAC2 is upregulated in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and aggressive variants of differentiated thyroid cancer, and CUDC-907 treatment reduces HDAC2 levels in thyroid cancer cells.
* CUDC-907 inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth, invasion and migration in vitro.
* In addition to inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, CUDC-907 inhibits the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is also activated in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer.
* CUDC-907 inhibits growth and metastases in a mouse model of metastatic thyroid cancer.
* We hypothesize that CUDC-907 will cause cancer regression in patients with metastatic and locally advanced poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and aggressive variants of differentiated thyroid cancer.

Objective:

-To determine response to CUDC-907 treatment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients with locally advanced and metastatic poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and aggressive variants of differentiated thyroid cancer.

Eligibility:

* Age greater than or equal to 18 years
* Thyroid cancer that is refractory to or relapsed after standard treatment.
* Aggressive thyroid cancer confirmed on histology or cytologic analysis.
* Measurable disease.
* Last dose of chemotherapy or last radiotherapy treatment more than 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with this protocol, except for subjects with anaplastic/undifferentiated thyroid cancer who may enroll immediately after discontinuation of previous therapy.

Design:

* Open label, phase II trial to determine response to CUDC-907 treatment.
* Patients will be given 60 mg of CUDC-907 orally for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 days off (5/2 schedule).
* One cycle is 21 days. Patients may continue on treatment if there is no disease progression.
* Initial anatomic and functional imaging will be performed at enrollment and after 2 cycles of treatment. Thereafter, anatomic imaging will be performed every two cycles of treatment.
