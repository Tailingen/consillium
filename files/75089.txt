Disitamab Vedotin Combined With PD-1 and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer（RC48-C018）
This trial is a multi-center, open, single-arm, superior phase II clinical study.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin Combined With PD-1 and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
pathologic Complete Response, PCR, After completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) assessments were performed on the completely resected gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes. No evidence of residual active tumor cells was found (currently YpT0N0 in the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system), 3 months-6 months
Major pathologic response, MPR, Less than 10% of tumor cells were found in pathological resection specimens., 3 months-6 months|R0 resection rate, No residue under the microscope after tumor resection, 3 months -6 months|Objective response rate, ORR, Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and maintained for a certain period of time after neoadjuvant treatment (mainly for solid tumors). It includes complete remission (CR, Complete Response) and partial remission (PR, Partial Response) cases, 3 months-6 months|Relapse-free survival time , RFS, The time from the start of randomization to the recurrence of the disease or the death of the patient due to disease progression., 1-5 years|Overall survival , OS, The time from the start of randomization to death due to any cause. When the patients who were lost to follow-up before death are recorded, the time of contact with the patient is the last recorded time., 1-5 years
The study included 40 patients with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with clinical stage T3-4aN+M0; and confirmed after HER2 IHC results Patients with medium and high expression of HER2 (defined as: IHC 2+ 3+); the neoadjuvant treatment plan is: disitamab vedotin + PD-1 + capecitabine; the main goal of the study is to explore The effectiveness of disitamab vedotin combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and capecitabine in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, and ultimately provide a basis for the update of treatment decisions for locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma Proof of medical evidence.
