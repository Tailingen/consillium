To Assess the Correlation of High-resolution Specimen PET-CT Imaging, Using the XEOS AURA 10 PET-CT, With the Histopathology Results and Long-term Outcome of Patients Undergoing Resective Cancer Surgery.
This registry study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical impact of specimen PET-CT imaging by analyzing the correlation between specimen PET-CT images, intraoperative interpretations, and histopathological findings. Additionally, it assesses how these imaging insights influence clinical decision-making and long-term patient outcomes. Through this comprehensive analysis in a real-world setting, the study seeks to generate valuable insights that can enhance specimen evaluation processes and ultimately improve patient care.

To assess the correlation between the intra-operative interpretation of specimen PET-CT images and histopathological examination of the specimen and its impact on clinical decision-making., The concordance rate between the specimen PET-CT image interpretation and histopathological examination of the specimen. This will include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the intra-operative interpretation of specimen PET-CT images compared to final histopathological examination.

The concordance rate of the clinical decisions made based on specimen PET-CT images with the clinical decisions supported by final histopathological examination (e.g. additional resection during surgery, follow-up treatment strategy, etc)., Perioperative|To assess the correlation between long-term follow-up clinical outcome and specimen PET-CT imaging findings., The incidence of biochemical, local, regional and distant recurrence rate at 1, 2 and 3 years of follow-up.
