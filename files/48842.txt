Surveillance of Metabolic Parameters in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
A prospective, single center, cohort study for surveillance of metabolic parameters in patients who will receive chemotherapy after surgical resection of colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer
Incidence of newly developed diabetes mellitus, Incidence of newly developed diabetes mellitus in patients with colorectal cancer after post-operative chemotherapy, up to 12 months
Pre-operative incidence of diabetes, Pre-operative incidence of diabetes (\> 6.5% of HbA1c) and abnormal metabolic parameters (\> 23 kg/m2 of BMI or dyslipidemia) of patients with colorectal cancer;, up to 12 months|Incidence of developed poorly controlled glucose level, Incidence of developed poorly controlled glucose level in diabetic patients with colorectal cancer after post-operative chemotherapy;, up to 12 months|3-year recurrence-free survival & 5-year recurrence-free survival, 3-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival according to status of diabetes (\> 6.5% of HbA1c) and abnormal metabolic parameters (\> 23 kg/m2 of BMI or dyslipidemia), up to 36-60 months
Primary objective - Incidence of newly developed diabetes mellitus in patients with colorectal cancer after post-operative chemotherapy

Secondary objective - Pre-operative incidence of diabetes and characteristics of metabolic parameters of patients with colorectal cancer; Incidence of developed poorly controlled glucose level in diabetic patients with colorectal cancer after post-operative chemotherapy; 3-year recurrence-free survival according to status of diabetes and metabolic parameters; 5-year recurrence-free survival according to status of diabetes and metabolic parameters
