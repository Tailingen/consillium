A Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Obinutuzumab and Bendamustine Treatment in Participants With Refractory or Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab and bendamustine treatment in participants with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Participants receive up to six 28-day cycles of treatment. Treatment consists of intravenous (IV) administration of obinutuzumab and bendamustine. Treatment time is expected to last 6 months, and participant follow-up will last 2 years.

DRUG: bendamustine|DRUG: obinutuzumab
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator Using the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 Criteria, ORR was defined as percentage of participants achieving Complete Response (CR), incomplete CR (CRi) or Partial Response (PR).

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. An SAE was any AE that was any of the following: fatal, life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, and was considered a significant medical event by the investigator., Up to approximately 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants With AEs of Special Interest (AESIs), AESIs included any of the following: SAEs associated with the infusion of obinutuzumab: obinutuzumab serious infusion-related reactions, which were defined as AEs occurring during or within 24 hours following the administration of an infusion of obinutuzumab and considered related to obinutuzumab; serious infection; serious neutropenia; any tumor lysis syndrome (TLS); second malignancies., Up to approximately 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs), IRRs were defined as AEs occurring during or within 24 hours following the administration of an infusion and considered related to drug treatment., Up to end of treatment at 6 months|Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Prematurely, Up to end of treatment at 6 months|Percentage of Participants With Previous/Concomitant Diseases, Up to approximately 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Concomitant Medication, Concomitant therapies included any medication (prescription medication, over-the-counter medications, herbal/homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by subjects in the 7 days prior to screening until the end of treatment.
