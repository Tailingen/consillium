A Study to Assess Sorafenib Alone and in Combination With Low-Dose Interferon Following Unsuccessful Treatment With Sunitinib in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Cancer.
This study is to assess sorafenib as second treatment for patients that have previously received only sunitinib as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell cancer, and who either responded and then progressed with sunitinib or were intolerant to sunitinib. This study is to assess if combining the usual dose of sorafenib (200mg twice-daily) with low dose interferon (3 million international unit (MIU) five times a week) can treat kidney cancer more effectively than the current approved dose alone and if it is safe. In addition, for patients that respond to treatment with sorafenib alone or in combination with interferon before progressing, patients may receive sorafenib alone at an increased dose of 300mg twice-daily, provided that toxicities are acceptable and at the discretion of the investigator.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)|DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006) + Interferon
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free Survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of combination therapy to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\]) or death (if death occurs before progression is documented). PFS for subjects without tumor progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last tumor evaluation., From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 weeks
Response Rate, Response Rate was the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response \[CR\], Partial Response \[PR\] or Stable Disease \[SD\]) observed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks|Time to Progression, Time to progression was the time from treatment start date to disease progression. Subjects without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks|Duration of Response, Duration of Response was the time from date of first response (Complete Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]) to the date when Progressive Disease (PD) is first documented or to the date of death, whichever occurs first. Subjects still having CR or PR at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks|Overall Survival, Overall Survival was the time from treatment start date to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks
