Irinotecan and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer of the Esophagus or Stomach
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan and paclitaxel in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent cancer of the esophagus or stomach.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel
To determine the antitumor activity of irinotecan and paclitaxel in patients with unresectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia., 5 months
To evaluate the toxicities of irinotecan and paclitaxel in this patient population., 5 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of irinotecan and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or stomach.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia vs adenocarcinoma of the rest of the stomach).

Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-54 patients (13-27 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
