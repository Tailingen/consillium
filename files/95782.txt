The Effect of Case Management in Complex Cancer Pathways
Introduction: Case management (CM) has been proposed as a method for optimizing the course of treatment for complicated cancer patients. However evidence of the effect of CM is limited and methodologically rigorous research is needed.

Aim: To analyze effects of Nurse CM in complicated cancer care.

Methods: The study is designed as a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) including approximately 280 colorectal cancer patients.

Intervention group patients will be offered usual medical treatment plus supportive intervention from a case manager. Control group patients will receive usual medical and supportive treatment.

The intervention: Case managers are registered nurses and possess thorough knowledge of cancer treatment and pathways. Core intervention elements: Planned and ad hoc personal and telephone contacts, surveillance of care pathways, coordination and dissemination of care plan (including transfer of patient-specific information to other departments and general practice).

Primary outcomes: Patient evaluations of care pathways and "Quality of Life" (questionnaires).

Secondary outcomes: Use of health care services and care process measures (The National Health Insurance Service Registry and The National Patient Registry; and GPs' evaluations of continuity of care (questionnaire).

Schedule:

* "Case management used to optimize cancer care pathways: A systematic Review" has been published in BMC Health Services Research.
* The CM manual has been written. Questionnaires are under development and pilot testing.
* Two case managers have been appointed 1. January 2009.
* After training and pilot testing of the intervention the RCT will begin in March 2009. Inclusion period is 12 months.
