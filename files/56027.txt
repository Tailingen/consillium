Dose Escalation With SIB to Intraprostatic/Lymphatic GTV in High Risk Prostate Cancer
A single arm phase 2 study to study the outcome of dose-escalation with simultaneous integrated boost to intraprostatic lesion and positive lymph nodes. Prostate cancer patients with high risk of lymph node metastasis or oligo positive nodes in true pelvic area can be included. The boost volumes will be outlined by usin PET-CT and MRI data. Our hypothesis is that we will have fewer relapses in this very high risk patient group compared to matched historical controls with acceptable side effects.
