Study of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered to Contain Anti-CD19 Attached to TCR and 4-1BB Signaling Domains in Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a single center, single arm, open-label phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCR and 4-1BB (TCR/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as CART-19 cells) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Inclusion criteria are designed to include adult patients aged greater than 18 with B cell ALL, relapsed or refractory, with no available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have limited prognosis (greater than 12 weeks survival expectancy) with currently available therapies. The study product is CART-19 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express anti-CD19 scFv TCR:41BB administered by a single i.v. infusion of 1 to 5 x 108 transduced CAR T cells.
Patients With B Cell ALL, Relapsed or Refractory, With no Available Curative Treatment Options
BIOLOGICAL: CART-19|BIOLOGICAL: CART-19|BIOLOGICAL: CART-19|BIOLOGICAL: CART-19
Overall Complete Remission Rate at Day 28 After CART-19 Therapy, Overall Complete Remission Rate (ORR) which includes complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) at Day 28.

Overall Complete Remission Rate = CR+ CRi, 28 Days
Best Overall Response, For the secondary efficacy objectives for this study, the number of patients were computed with a best overall disease response of CR or CRi, where the best overall disease response is defined as the best disease response recorded from the start of the treatment until death, last follow up, relapse or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first., from the start of the treatment until death, last follow up, relapse or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months
