Molecular Epidemiology of Biliary Tree Cancers
This study is to learn if certain risk factors (environmental, viral, behavioral, medical, and dietary), tumor markers, and genetic changes can predict the development and outcome of biliary tree cancers. Establishing biomarkers models from patients may help doctors to further understand how biliary tree cancer is affected by different treatments, and why some people's cancer responds differently than others.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Significant factors that may contribute to the etiology of biliary tree cancer, through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To identify significant factors that may contribute to the etiology of biliary tree cancer.

II. To identify novel genetic loci that predispose to gallbladder cancers (GBC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CGC) diagnosis.

EXPLORATORY AND CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

I. To use the collected blood and tissue materials for exploratory analysis to identify markers that predict prognosis of biliary tree cancers.

II. To correlate the identified markers with results of specific aim I and II to test the interaction between the identified markers with environmental and genetic factors.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete a questionnaire over 20 minutes. Participants also undergo collection of blood and leftover tissue samples.
