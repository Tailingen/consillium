Rucaparib and Pembrolizumab for Maintenance Therapy in Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a multi-center, Phase I/II, single arm trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of oral rucaparib plus intravenous pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy in patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without progressive disease (PD), as confirmed on CT scans, after induction therapy with carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab (CPP) triplet therapy.
Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Rucaparib
Median duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression, The primary endpoint is median progression free survival (PFS) which is defined as the median duration of time from the start of treatment to progression. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 5 years
Median duration of time from the start of treatment until death, The secondary endpoint is median overall survival (OS) which is defined as the median duration of time from the start of treatment until death., Up to 5 years|Response rate, Percentage of patients who achieve a complete or partial response after at least one cycle of maintenance therapy with rucaparib and pembrolizumab. Response assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRecist)., Up to 5 years
