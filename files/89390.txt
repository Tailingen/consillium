Analysis of Olaparib Response in Patients With BRCA1 and/or 2 Promoter Methylation Diagnosed of Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olaparib in patients diagnosed of advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with methylation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 promoters assessed in DNA from metastatic lesions and absence of BRCA1 and 2 germline mutations.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) out of the patients from the efficacy population. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as an \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

Tumor response will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1). Efficacy population is a subset of the intend to treat population that has received at least one dose of study medication and has performed at least one tumor response assessment according to RECIST v.1.1 (unless a progression, death or unacceptable toxicity is seen before the first tumor response assessment)., Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria.

CBR was defined as the percentage of patients with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) plus stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 24 weeks out of the efficacy population. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as an \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; SD is defined as a failure to meet criteria for CR or PR in the absence of progressive disease. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.

Efficacy population is a subset of the intend to treat population that has received at least one dose of study medication and has performed at least one tumor response assessment according to RECIST v.1.1 (unless a progression, death or unacceptable toxicity is seen before the first tumor response assessment)., Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks|Response Duration (RD), Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1) criteria. RD was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) to the first documented progressive disease (PD), or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as an \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; PD is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Through study treatment, up to 19 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.1). PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented progression disease (PD), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is defined using RECIST, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Up to 14 months|The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE) Related to Study Treatment, Safety assessments were performed at baseline and during the study: blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, performance status evaluation, 12-lead electrocardiogram, hemoglobin, red blod cells, platelet, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, mean cell haemoglobin, white blood cells, absolute differential white cell count, absolute neutrophil count or segmented neutrophil count and band forms, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalised ratio, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, fasting glucose, creatinine, total bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea/blood urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin and lactic dehydrogenase, urinalysis by dipstick, serum or urine pregnancy test, bone marrow or blood cytogenetic analysis.

AEs were graded according to NCI-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AE) v. 4.03, Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks|Correlation Value Between BRCA1 Methylation Status and Efficacy Outcome Data, To evaluate the effect of methylation status with efficacy rate parameters it will be used chi-square test if both of them are quantitative, and will be used an ANOVA analysis if one variable is quantitative and the other one is qualitative., Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks|Correlation Value Between BRCA2 Methylation Status and Efficacy Outcome Data, To evaluate the effect of methylation status with efficacy rate parameters it will be used chi-square test if both of them are quantitative, and will be used an ANOVA analysis if one variable is quantitative and the other one is qualitative., Through study treatment, and average of 8 weeks
Patients must have received at least one previous regimen in the advance disease setting and must have at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed according to RECIST v.1.1. Potential eligible patients will be screened to assess somatic (s) BRCA promoter methylation at an reference central laboratory. Germinal (g) BRCA mutational status will be analyzed also centrally at 'Myriad Genetics GmBh' laboratory unless the BRCA mutational status is already known based on a Myriad previous report. Patients with a positive methylation status on at least one of the two genes and lacking of known deleterious or suspected deleterious mutations in both genes could be enrolled in the study and receive olaparib.

Blood and tumor samples collected from all screened patients could be used for the biomarker analysis, including the assessment of germline methylation status and gene expression levels of BRCA1/2. An early efficacy review will be performed after 12 evaluable patients are enrolled; if at least 4 of them show tumour response, additional patients will be included to complete a total of 34 patients.
