Nerve Coaptation in LTP Flap Breast Reconstruction
The sensory recovery of the breast remains an undervalued aspect of breast reconstruction and surgical reinnervation is not regarded as a priority by most reconstructive surgeons. A prospective study was conducted of all patients who underwent either innervated or non-innervated lateral thigh perforator (LTP) flap breast reconstruction in Maastricht University Medical Center and returned for follow-up between February 2016 and April 2019. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing of the breast.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Sensory nerve coaptation
The sensory recovery of the reconstructed breast as assessed by Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, The sensory recovery of the breast to touch was tested at different follow-up moments after the initial surgery. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing. Nine areas of the breast, indicating native skin and flap skin, were tested. Mean monofilament values were calculated for each area and compared between groups., Through study completion up to 27 months postoperatively
