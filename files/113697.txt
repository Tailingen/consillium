Feasibility and Accuracy of Nanosensor-based Cancer Diagnosis at the Point-of-care (Chedza)
Prospective feasibility and validation study of a novel, near-to-care modality for diagnosis of malignancy among cancer suspects.
Breast Neoplasms|Lymphoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast Microhalography (CEM)
Accuracy for diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Accuracy (proportion of true positive and true negative out of total number assessed) of CEM in comparison with standard diagnostic approach., Day 1, at time of diagnosis|Accuracy for diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, Accuracy (proportion of true positive and true negative out of total number assessed) of CEM in comparison with standard diagnostic approach., Day 1, at time of diagnosis|Time to diagnosis, Time from diagnostic procedure to knowledge of test result by the treating clinician, Day 1, at time of diagnosis|Proficiency in testing using CEM platform, Proportion of personnel of varying laboratory experience and training modalities with proficiency using CEM platform, Day 1, At completion of training
Accuracy for sub-type diagnosis (aggressive vs. indolent) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Accuracy (proportion of true positive and true negative out of total number non-Hodgkin lymphoma) of CEM in comparison with standard diagnostic approach., Day 1, at time of diagnosis|Accuracy for molecular subtype diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, Accuracy (proportion of true positive and true negative out of total number of invasive breast cancers), compared with standard diagnostic approach, for the molecular subtype diagnosis of invasive breast cancer into estrogen-receptor positive, triple-negative, and other estrogen-receptor negative categories., Day 1, at time of diagnosis
Prospective feasibility and validation study of a novel contrast microhalography (CEM) device for diagnosis of malignancy in Botswana. Consenting patients identified by their providers as requiring a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or percutaneous biopsy for assessment for possible lymphoma or breast cancer will undergo standard diagnostic procedure. Concurrently these patients will have additional FNA fluid tested using the portable novel nanosensor-based device (CEM). Diagnosis made from standard anatomic pathology, flow cytometry, and/or cytology will be compared with the diagnosis made using the CEM platform. Assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the CEM platform will be performed. Assessment of training requirements for CEM platform will be completed.
