Ultrasound-guided Biopsy of the Pleura as a Supplement to Extraction of Fluid in Patients With One-sided Fluid in the Pleura
The research group will investigate the diagnostic effect of early introduction of ultrasound guided pleural biopsy in the work-up of patients with one-sided pleural effusion, suspected of malignant pleural effusion.
Malignant Pleural Effusion|Exudative Pleural Effusion
PROCEDURE: ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy|PROCEDURE: Thoracentesis
Proportion of cases with conclusive pleural workup to provide and plan treatment in patients diagnosed with malignant pleural effusion., Our primary endpoint includes both patients who will receive palliative care and patients who will receive active treatment. For patients receiving palliative care, the presence of malignant cells is sufficient. However, for patients receiving active treatment, the primary endpoint is defined as a definite and treatment-guiding pathological result (immunohistochemistry, mutations, oncodrivers, culture and biochemistry) as decided by a multidisciplinary team conference., 26 weeks post randomization

Patients with unilateral pleural effusion with high protein content (exudative pleural effusion) are likely to have malignant pleural effusion. In the Danish guidelines, patient undergo two thoracentesis before more invasive procedures, due to the relatively low incidens of pleural TB and mesothelioma. The aim of the research group is to investigate the effect of early introduction of ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy taken at the optimal sport for thoracentesis. The research group will randomise half of our patients with unilateral pleural exudate to up-front ultrasound-guided biopsy and the other half usual care eg. a second thoracentesis, to see if there is a benefit of early pleural biopsy in the work-up of patients with unilateral pleural effusion, suspected of malignant pleural effusion.
