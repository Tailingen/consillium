Placebo-Controlled Trial of IFx-Hu2.0 Followed By Pembrolizumab In Checkpoint Inhibitor Naïve Patients With Advanced Or Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma
This Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate Objective Response Rate (ORR) of IFx-Hu2.0 as an adjunctive therapy to pembrolizumab in adult patients (≥18 years) with advanced or metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma. A total of 118 participants will be randomized to receive either IFx-Hu2.0 or placebo intralesional injection in a single lesion, followed by pembrolizumab.
Advanced Or Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: IFx-Hu2.0|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as proportion of subjects who achieve confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at approximately 24 weeks assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) following RECIST v1.1. Tumor response assessments will be performed at baseline and every 3 months for the first 24 months, thereafter every 6 months for up to 5 years., 12 weeks post-treatment initiation and confirmed on a second response assessment at least 28 days after the initial response assessment
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time (months) from the date of randomization to the date of the documented disease progression based on BICR assessment according to RECIST v1.1, or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects without progression or death will be censored on the date of last disease assessment., up to 5 years
