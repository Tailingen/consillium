Total Marrow and Lymphoid Irradiation Before Donor Transplant and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation and how well it works with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation targets cancer in bone marrow and blood, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before a donor transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before donor transplant and cyclophosphamide after transplant may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.

Will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the competing risk method as described by Gooley et al. (1999)., From start of treatment until non-disease related death, or last follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months|Quality of life -Questionnaire, Assessed using a. 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.

The eight sections are:

* a1. vitality
* a2. physical functioning
* a3. bodily pain
* a4. general health perceptions
* a5. physical role functioning
* a6. emotional role functioning
* a7. social role functioning
* a8. mental health, Up to 24 months|Quality of life-Function Assessment, Assessed using b. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT).

* b1.physical well being
* b2. Social and family well being
* b3. Emotional well being
* b4. Functional well being
* b5. Additional concerns., Up to 24 months|Quality of life -Symptom Inventory, Assessed using c. M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). MDASI is a multi-symptom patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure for clinical and research use.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the safety/feasibility of combining a total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) transplant conditioning regimen with a post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis strategy, through the assessment of: adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration and complications: including acute GvHD, infection and delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GvHD at 100 days post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).

II. To estimate the CI of chronic GvHD at 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

III. To estimate GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

IV. To describe the kinetics of immune reconstitution and T cell repertoire in the first year post alloHCT.

V. To estimate overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and CI of relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

VI. To characterize quality of life using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), and M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at 100 days, 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

VII. To assess bone marrow cellularity from bone marrow samples. VIII. To assess the clonogenic potential of cells from bone marrow samples. IX. To assess stromal damage from bone marrow samples. X. To evaluate cytokines and oxidative stress markers.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.

Patients undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -4 to 0, then undergo bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus given by continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) on days 5-90, and filgrastim beginning on day 5 until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is at least 1,500/mm\^3 for 3 consecutive days.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 24 months.
