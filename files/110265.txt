Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Compared to Standard Treatment
The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of Time restricted eating in patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, comparing it to the standard hormonal treatment.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Insulin Resistance
BEHAVIORAL: Time restricted eating
PCOS Rotterdam criteria, Ovary volume \>9ml, presence of 12 or more follicles, biochemical or clinical signs of hyperandrogenism and anovulation., 3 months
Insulin resistance (IR), HOMA-IR was calculated with insulin and glucose fasting levels to determine the severity of insulin resistance, 3 months
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients were given a written informed consent. Patients were recruited through social media and digital questionnaires, to make sure they met the criteria. There was a semi aleatory distribution of the patients into three different groups, one group underwent time restricted eating with no hormonal treatment (TRE group), the second group received hormonal treatment combined with time restricted eating (combined group) and the last group received only hormonal treatment (HT). PCOS was diagnosed using Rotterdam criteria, which were evaluated according to the ultrasound, blood samples and self reported menstrual cycle.

Blood samples and transvaginal ultrasound were taken at day 0 and 90 to evaluate hormonal status, including insulin and glucose.

Homeostatic assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to determine insulin resistance, as well as metabolic disfunction.

After data collection, statistical analyses was done to determine the effect of the different approaches.
