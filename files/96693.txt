A Study to Assess the Anti-Tumor Activity and Safety of Odronextamab in Adult Patients With B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Who Have Been Previously Treated With Other Cancer Therapies
This study is researching an investigational drug, odronextamab, in adult patients B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL).

The main purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of odronextamab in destroying cancer cells and to learn more about the safety of odronextamab.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* To see if odronextamab works to destroy cancer cells
* Side effects that may be experienced by people taking odronextamab
* How odronextamab works in the body
* How much odronextamab is present in the blood

It is a health questionnaire that consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems., Approximately 194 weeks following the first dose
