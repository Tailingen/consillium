Caelyx Adjuvant in Elderly Breast Cancer
This is an open label Phase II study in elderly patients (65y or older) with early breast cancer who are candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy. A scheme with liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) and cyclophosphamide (endoxan) will be used. The aim is to study the cardiac effects of liposomal doxorubicin with new non-invasive techniques, ie strain rate imaging, classical echocardiography, and special blood tests measuring troponin I and BNP.
Breast Cancer|Elderly
DRUG: Caelyx|DRUG: endoxan
Investigate the effect on cardiac strain rate imaging (SRI) of Caelyx|The relation between cardiac SRI and classical ejection fraction measurement.|The relation between strain rate and blood markers such as troponin-I and BNP
To assess the tolerability of Caelyx containing regimens in elderly breast cancer patients.
