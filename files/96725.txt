A Phase 2 Feasibility Study of Abraxane and Carboplatin in Epithelial Neoplasms of the Uterus
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of treatment with carboplatin and Abraxane in this patient population and determine the nature and degree of toxicities following treatment. The single stage open label Phase II feasibility study is designed to estimate the proportion of patients who can tolerate the proposed regimen for 6 cycles with no more than two dose level reductions.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin AUC|DRUG: Abraxane
Tolerability Measured Completion of Dose Regimen, Tolerability for an individual patient will be defined as remaining on the study for 6 cycles with two or fewer dose reductions., 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at Month 24, PFS is defined as the time from first dosing to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS was estimated beyond the collected data using Kaplan Meier methods., Up to Month 24|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Measured by RECIST 1.1 at Month 24, ORR is the number of patients whose best tumor response outcome by Month 24 is a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

Per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1.):

CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, Up to Month 24
