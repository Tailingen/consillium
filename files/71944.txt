Melanoma Inhibitory Activity (MIA): A Serological Marker for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma
Uveal Melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. Most tumors metastasize to the liver. So far no sensitive or specific serological tumor marker is routinely used. The marker "Melanoma inhibitory activity" is a promising marker. Study hypothesis is to detect metastatic lesions in an early stage. This would increase life expectance of our patients

PROCEDURE: Treatment of metastatic disease
Serum is taken from each melanoma patient at every follow up after signed concent. With ELISA the marker MIA is evaluated. An increase of MIA serum level will lead to search for metastasis by oncologists.
