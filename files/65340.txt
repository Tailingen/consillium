Tipifarnib and Osimertinib in EGFR-mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase 1a/b, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation (1a) and dose expansion (1b) study. The purpose of this study is to measure safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy with the combination of tipifarnib with osimertinib in patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.
NSCLC
DRUG: Tipifarnib|DRUG: Osimertinib
For Dose Escalation determine a safe and tolerable Phase 2 dose of tipifarnib when used in combination with osimertinib, Occurrence of DLTs during first treatment cycle, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|For Dose Escalation characterize the safety of the combination DLTs will be listed for patients who complete the evaluation period for DLT, Descriptive statistics of adverse events per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), DLTs will be evaluated at the end of cycle 1 (28 days), but also through study completion, an average of 1.5 years|For Dose Expansion characterize the safety profile of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 using descriptive statistics of adverse events, Descriptive statistics of adverse events per the NCI CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|For Dose Expansion characterize the safety profile of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 using the percentage of patients who discontinue the combination for related adverse events, Percentage of patients who discontinue the combination for tipifarnib and/or osimertinib related adverse events prior to completing 6 cycles of treatment, First 6 cycles of treatment (28 day treatment cycle)
To evaluate the efficacy of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib, Objective Response Rate (ORR), measures evaluated according to RECIST v.1.1 assessed by investigator, Assessed every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of study at approximately 2 years|To evaluate the efficacy of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib, Duration of Response (DOR) assessed from (CR) or (PR) until (PD), initiation of new anticancer treatment or study withdrawal, Assessed every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of study at approximately 2 years|To evaluate the efficacy of tipifarnib in combination with osimertinib, Progression-free survival (PFS) measures evaluated according to RECIST v.1.1 assessed by investigator, Assessed every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter up to end of study at approximately 2 years|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time of last concentration measured and from time 0 extrapolated to infinity, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Maximum plasma concentration, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Time to maximum observed concentration, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Terminal elimination rate constant, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Terminal half-life, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To study pharmacokinetics (PK) of tipifarnib and osimertinib in combination, Apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution, Cycles 1-6 (28 day treatment cycle)|To evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as an indicator or response in both ctDNA positive and negative patients by changes in genetic alterations, Determine prevalence of tumor-derived genetic alterations of ctDNA collected at baseline, on-treatment and at disease progression, Monthly for duration of trial participation (an average of 2 years)|To evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) clearance rates for patients positive at baseline, Clearance rates for patients who are ctDNA positive at baseline, Monthly for duration of trial participation (an average of 2 years)|To evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) time to detection changes associated with disease progression, Time to detection of ctDNA changes associated with disease progression, Monthly for duration of trial participation (an average of 2 years)
