A Retrospective Cohort Study on the Risk of Serious Infections in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Receiving Tocilizumab
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the risk of serious infections in rheumatoid arthritis patients with tocilizumab is higher than in those with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors using the nationwide real-world data.
Infection|Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: Tocilizumab|DRUG: Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab)
Hazard ratio for serious infections, The ratio of the hazard rates of the serious infections in tocilizumab initiators vs. TNFi users, January 2013 to December 2018
Hazard ratio for six subdivided groups of serious infections by organ class, The ratio of the hazard rates of six subdivided organ-specific serious infections (respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urological and gynecological infections, skin and subcutaneous tissue, sepsis, and others) in tocilizumab initiators vs. TNFi users, January 2013 to December 2018
This observational, retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) data will evaluate whether the risk of serious infections (SIs) in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with tocilizumab is higher than in those with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. We will compare incidence rates between two groups and estimate relative risks of SIs in tocilizumab users using the time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. Various covariates potentially related to RA severity and occurrence of infection will be assessed and used for adjustment.
