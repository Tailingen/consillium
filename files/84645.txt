PVSRIPO in Recurrent Malignant Glioma
This is a phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in adult patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma.
Malignant Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: PVSRIPO
Objective Radiographic Response Rate, Assess objective anti-tumor response based on iRANO criteria., 24 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.|Objective Radiographic Response Rate, Assess objective anti-tumor response based on iRANO criteria., 36 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.|Duration of Objective Radiographic Response, Assess time of confirmed response to confirmed progressive disease/death., 24 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.|Duration of Objective Radiographic Response, Assess time of confirmed response to confirmed progressive disease/death., 36 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.
Overall Survival, Overall Survival, relative to external control group(s), 24 and 36 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.|Landmark Survival, Overall survival at 24 and 36 months and greater, 24 and 36 months post-infusion and through study completion.|Disease Control Rate Following PVSRIPO Infusion, The percentage of patients classified as non-progressive by radiographic response based on standard criteria., 24 and 36 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion and through study completion.|Safety of PVSRIPO: proportion of patients who experience grade 3, 4, or 5 AEs, Within each cohort for those randomized prior to protocol version 7, as well as for those patients retreated with PVSRIPO, the proportion of patients who experience grade 3, 4, or 5 AEs that are possibly, probably, and definitely related to protocol treatment will be estimated., While on study; average of 12 to 36 months after initial PVSRIPO infusion.
This is a Phase 2 study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in adult patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy (anti-tumor response and survival) of PVSRIPO in recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma.

Patients will be administered PVSRIPO intratumorally via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Retreatment with PVSRIPO is allowed, provided retreatment eligibility criteria are met.

All patients who receive PVSRIPO treatment will be included in efficacy and safety analyses.
