Evaluation of Efficacy and Toxicity of Nivolumab Monotherapy for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After First-line Treatment Failure Based on Second-generation Sequencing and Liquid Chip Platform
In order to understand the efficacy and side effects of lung cancer immunotherapy, at least 30 patients with lung cancer who were treated with immunotherapy were enrolled. The second-generation sequencing technology and liquid phase factor platform were used for detection, and clinical imaging and other evaluation methods were used to explore the immunotherapy efficacy and side effects affecting lung cancer。
