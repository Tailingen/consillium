A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Faricimab in Patients With Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to Pathologic Myopia
This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, active comparator-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of faricimab in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This non-inferiority study will compare 6.0 mg faricimab versus 0.5 mg ranibizumab administered at a pro-re-nata (PRN) dosing regimen after an initial active IVT treatment administration at randomization (Day 1).
