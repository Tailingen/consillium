Angiogenesis in Early Breast Cancer for Prognosis Prediction
This study will investigate the association of angiogenesis in breast cancer measured by magnetic resonance imaging and biomarkers with long-term prognosis of patients.
Breast Lesions
PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance imaging
To investigate whether breast cancer with a higher angiogenesis activity is associated with a unfavorable outcome., 5 years from completion of enrollment
To investigate whether angiogenesis of breast cancer is associated wit lymph node status, at completion of enrollment
This study will investigate the association of angiogenesis in breast cancer measured by magnetic resonance imaging and biomarkers with long-term prognosis of patients.
