Clinical Study of Utidelone Injection in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This trial is an open, two-stage, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Utidelone in advanced solid tumors (excluding breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer) that have failed standard of treatment or were unable to perform standard treatment.

This trial is divided into 2 stages, screening stage and expansion stage. In the screening stage, 10 patients were enrolled for each tumor type(including Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, Esophageal cancer, Stomach cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Cholangiocarcinoma, Ovarian cancer and Other solid tumors). Based on the results of the tumor type screening stage, the sponsor and the main investigator will have a discussion and have the alignment of tumor types to enter the expansion stage. The expansion stage will refine the inclusion / exclusion criteria and may adjust the treatment plan based on the tumor type and the combination drug selection. A total of 30-50 patients (including patients enrolled in the screening stage) were enrolled in each specified tumor type during the expansion stage.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: utidelone injection
Tumor response to utidelone treatment, Reflected by percentage of tumor size reduction or regression, assessed by imaging techniques and expressed as Objective Response Rate (ORR) ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST. 1.1., 12 months from first study treatment
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), 12 months from first study treatment|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from first study treatment to disease progression or death from any cause as documented by the investigator, 18 months from first study treatment|Safety profile associated with utidelone injection, Observe and record incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and severe adverse effects associated with utidelone injection, 18 months from first study treatment
