Mindfulness Meditation and Qigong for Colorectal Cancer Survivors
Colorectal cancer imposes threats to patients' well-being. Although most physical symptoms can be managed by medication, psychosocial stressors may complicate survival and hamper quality of life. Mindfulness and Qigong, two kinds of mind-body exercise rooted in Eastern health philosophy, has been found effective in symptoms management, improving mental health, and reducing stress. With these potential benefits, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is planned to investigate the comparative effectiveness of mindfulness and Baduanjin intervention on the bio-psychosocial wellbeing of people with colorectal cancer. A 3-arm RCT with waitlist control design will be used in this study. One hundred eighty-nine participants will be randomized into (i) Mindfulness, (ii) Baduanjin, or (iii) waitlist control groups. Participants in both the Baduanjin and mindfulness groups will receive 8-weeks of specific intervention. All three groups will undergo four assessment phases: (i) at baseline, (ii) at 4-week, (iii) at 8-week (post-intervention), and (iv) 6-month post-intervention (maintenance). All participants will be assessed in terms of cancer-related symptoms and symptom distress, mental health status, quality of life, stress level based on physiological marker. Based on prior research studies, participants in both the mindfulness and Baduanjn intervention group are expected to have better symptoms management, lower stress level, better mental health, and higher level of quality of life than the control group. This study contributes to better understanding on the common and unique effectiveness of mindfulness and Baduanjin qigong, as such patients and qualified healthcare professionals can select or provide practices which will produce maximum benefits, satisfaction, adherence, and sustainability.

Change of Baseline Sleep Quality at mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) and 6-month post-intervention, * Administration of the Chinese version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
* The PSQI is a self-report questionnaire that assesses multiple dimensions of seep over past one month.
* The 19-item scale generates 7 'component' scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of the seven component scores yields one global score of subjective sleep., Baseline, Mid-Intervention (week 4), Post-intervention (week 8), 6-month Post-intervention|Change of Baseline Cancer-related Symptom Distresses at mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) and 6-month post-intervention, * Administration of the the Chinese version of Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)
* The scoring of the 32-item MSAS yields a MSAS Global Distress Index (10 items), the Physical Symptom Subscale score (12 items), the Psychological Symptom Subscale score (6 items), and a Total MSAS score., Baseline, Mid-Intervention (week 4), Post-intervention (week 8), 6-month Post-intervention|Change of Baseline Health-related Quality of Life at mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) and 6-month post-intervention, * Administration of the Chinese (HK) version of the Short form-12 (SF-12)

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer. Lifestyle modification and development of self-regulatory and self-care skills for maintaining psychological and physical well-being are especially important for recurrence prevention and long-term illness management. Mind-body practices are popular among cancer patients for being non-pharmacological, holistically beneficial, in addition to its feasibility for sustainable self-practice and self-care. Despite the popularity of practising qigong and mindfulness meditation among local patients, a systematic study on their effectiveness for cancer patients has yet to be conducted.

Qigong and mindfulness meditation represent two distinct forms of mind-body practices: dynamic and static. With both approaches attending to the breath, Qigong relies on physical exertion to arrive at mental and psychological changes while mindfulness meditation begins at mental level but can also impact physical health. Yet current knowledge on mind-body practices tells little about these contrasting approaches. Hence, this study not only aims to provide evidence for the psychophysiological effectiveness of qigong and mindfulness meditation for colorectal cancer patients, but also elucidate how these two fundamentally contrasting approaches differ in psychophysiological outcomes, rebalancing of dysfunctional cortisol rhythm, and affect long-term practice compliance.

Adopting a 3-arm randomized controlled trial design, this study will first independently study the effectiveness of Baduanjin qigong and Mindfulness meditation for Chinese colorectal cancer patients compared to controls on cancer-related symptoms and symptom distress, mental health, quality of life, biomarkers and mindfulness level. Another main objective is to examine the commonalities and differential effectiveness between a movement-based (Baduanjin qigong) and a mind-based (Mindfulness meditation) practice on the above outcomes, magnitude and pace of change, and the extended compliance throughout the 8-month study. A final objective is to examine the relationships among physical, psychological, and psychophysical variables and how these interactions between the mind and body. This study envisions advancing relationships change across the time.

189 Chinese-speaking patients with colorectal cancer will be recruited from local hospital and community organizations, then randomized into an 8-week (90-min/week) (i) Baduanjin qigong intervention, (ii) Mindfulness meditation intervention and (iii) No-intervention waitlist control. Participants will be assessed on 4 time points at (i) baseline prior randomization, (ii) mid-intervention (4th week), (iii) post-intervention (8th week) and (iv) 6 months post-intervention.

The measurement of both physiological and psychological outcomes will offer a comprehensive understanding on the mental and bodily changes after each intervention and their maintenance. Results will further support the reciprocal evidence-based mind-body practices which can be easily learned, self-practiced and incorporated into patients' lifestyles.
