Ledipasvir+Sofosbuvir and Sofosbuvir+Velpatasvir for Pts With Indolent Bcell Lymphoma Associated With HCV Infection
This is a non-randomized, a single arm, phase II multicentre study of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (genotype 1 and 4) or sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir (genotype 2 and 3) for patients with hepatitis C virus-associated indolent B-cell lymphomas (HCV-RNA positive).
Indolent B-cell Lymphoma|Hepatitis C
DRUG: Ledipasvir+Sofosbuvir|DRUG: Sofosbuvir+Velpatasvir
SVR12, Sustained virologic response (SVR12) defined as undetectability of HCV-RNA 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy, 12 weeks from the end of the treatment
ORR, Overall response rate (ORR) of lymphoma: CR is defined by the complete disappearance of all detectable sites and symptoms; PR is defined as a more than 50% reduction. Responses different from CR/PR are defined as stable disease (SD); progressive disease (PD) is considered an increase in size of more than 50% of previously documented disease or the appearance of new lesions. Lymphoma response will be assessed 12 weeks after the end of antiviral treatment, 12 weeks from the end of treatment|PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time between enrolment and progression or relapse or death from any cause., 36 months|EFS, Event-free survival (EFS) defined as time between enrolment and failure of treatment or death as a result of any cause, 36 months|OS, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time between enrolment and death from any cause, 36 months|ORR for lymphoma, ORR for lymphoma according to Matutes criteria (Matutes et al, Leukemia 2008) only in patients with splenic-marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 12 weeks from the end of treatment|Rapid virological response, rapid virologic response (RVR), 4 weeks|Extended rapid virological response, extended RVR (eRVR), 4 weeks|Early virological response, early virologic response (EVR), 4 weeks|Toxicity - Incidence of Adverse Events, toxicity will be classified according to definitions of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 4.03 (CTCAE). It will be determined by the incidence of severe, life-threatening (CTCAE grade 3, 4 and 5) and/or serious adverse events, 12 months
The study includes an antiviral treatment with interferon-free regimen followed by lymphoma restaging; following the end of antiviral treatment patients will be evaluated for sustained virological response and safety parameters every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years. ORR and vital status will be also evaluated.
