Avelumab for Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether avelumab, an investigational antibody against programmed death-ligand (PD-L1), has an effect on recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer. Avelumab is designed to block the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a known immune checkpoint, and PD-L1. By blocking this interaction, the immune system may be stimulated, allowing it to more effectively recognize and attack the cancer.
Nasopharyngeal Cancer
DRUG: Avelumab
Overall Response Rate, Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 6 months
This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of Avelumab for patients with recurrent/metastatic, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Upon study entry, all patients will receive Avelumab 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Treatment will be given until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision or patient withdrawal. Dose interruptions may occur per pre-specified criteria for grade 3 or higher toxicity.
