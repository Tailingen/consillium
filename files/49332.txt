Expanded Access [11C] Methionine PET Imaging
The participants are being asked to get this PET scan because the participants have or may have cancer in the central nervous system (head, neck, or spine), and the investigator and the patient's physician thinks that this scan may provide useful information for the participant's treatment.

Primary Objective

To provide expanded access to L-\[11C\]methionine as a positron-emitting tracer in children and young adults for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) and head and neck to guide therapeutic management of disease.
Central Nervous System Tumor|Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: L-(11C) methionine
Participants receive an intravenous injection of a small (tracer) dose of L-\[11C\]methionine. Approximately 10 minutes later, patients undergo PET scanning to evaluate localization of the tracer.
