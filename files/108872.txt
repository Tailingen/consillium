A Study of Nivolumab in Participants With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head & Neck (SCCHN) - Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
The purpose of the study is to capture the utilization of nivolumab among participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) since its approval, and to describe the health related quality of life (HRQoL) among participants treated with nivolumab in a real-world setting.

This is a phase 4 prospective chart review study with patient reported outcome (PRO) administration. The study population consists of participants diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and are being treated with nivolumab. Eligible participants will be enrolled and observed from enrollment up to eight weeks. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected at enrollment. PROs will be administered at enrollment and again at a follow-up standard of care visit approximately eight weeks after enrollment.
