Study of FF-10502-01 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
A Phase 1/2a, dose-escalation study of FF-10502-01 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas. A total of up to 9 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the MTD. Phase 2 will consist of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include subjects with Pancreatic Cancer. Cohort 2 will include subjects with another tumor type enrolled in the Phase 1 dose-escalation phase who have demonstrated Clinical Benefit by Week 16.

Subjects will receive doses of FF-10502-01 intravenously (IV) weekly for three weeks, repeated every 28 days (= 1 cycle). Disease assessments, based on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance image (MRI), and, for lymphoma, \[18F\]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans, will be obtained at Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until documented progression of disease (PD). Subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit will be allowed to continue therapy with FF-10502-01 until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness or changes in the subject's condition that prevents further study participation.
