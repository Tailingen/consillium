Neoadjuvant Targeting of Myeloid Cell Populations in Combination With Nivolumab in Head & Neck Ca
The primary objective of this study is to assess safety and feasibility of pre-operative nivolumab in combination with BMS-986253 (anti-interleukin-8) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) who will undergo surgery.

DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: HuMax-IL8
Safety of neoadjuvant Nivolumab in combination with HuMax, Adverse events will be reviewed to determine the safety of the combination of investigational products in the neoadjuvant setting. AEs and other toxicities will be graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0 (CTCAE)., Up to 100 days after the last dose of study drug|Feasibility of neoadjuvant Nivolumab in combination with HuMax, Adverse events will be reviewed to determine the feasibility of the combination of investigational products in the neoadjuvant setting.
