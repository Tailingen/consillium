Intra-arterial Chemotherapy Combined with Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy for HNSCC
This study pioneers a novel approach by integrating a new auxiliary chemo-immunotherapy regimen, which is then followed by an evaluation of the potential for surgical resection. For those patients who remain non-resectable, a tailored treatment plan is proposed, consisting of arterial infusion chemotherapy in conjunction with radiotherapy, succeeded by a series of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The efficacy and safety of this integrated therapeutic strategy are meticulously assessed, with the goal of enhancing survival outcomes for patients with T4bNanyM0 HNSCC.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab-jsgr|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
1 year Event-free Survival rate (1y-EFS rate), EFS is the time from the starting date of neoadjuvant therapy to the date of first record of any of the following events: radiographic disease progression; local or distant progression or recurrence as assessed with imaging or biopsy as indicated; or death due to any cause. Radiographic disease progression during neoadjuvant phase that precludes surgery will be considered an event; a secondary malignancy will not be considered an event., 1 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 30 days post-neoadjuvant|Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathological complete response (pCR) is measured as the percentage of participants with a pathological complete response as assessed by the central pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. pCR is defined as having no residual invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the resected primary tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes., Up to 30 days post-surgery|Major Pathological Response (MPR), The percentage of participants with a major pathological response (mPR) as assessed by the Central Pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. mPR is defined as ≤10% invasive squamous cell carcinoma within the resected primary tumor specimen and all the sampled regional lymph nodes., Up to 30 days post-surgery|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from starting date of neoadjuvant therapy to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to 5 years|Percentage of Participants Experiencing An Adverse Event (AEs), Percentage of participants experiencing any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Local Recurrence-free Survival (LRFS), Percentage of patients in a treatment group who are alive without local recurrence., through study completion, an average of 5 years|Distant Metastases-free Survival (DMFS), DMFS will be defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first distant metastasis or date of death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first., through study completion, an average of 5 years
