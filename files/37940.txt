Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIB, Stage III, or Stage IV Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER-2-neu, CEA peptides, GM-CSF, Montanide ISA-51 vaccine
Safety of the 4-peptide mixture, Adverse events, 30 days following last vaccine|Number of patients with an immune response to the peptides, T cell responses against the peptides as measured in the sentinel immunized node, through Day 22
Immunogenicity of the peptide mixture measured in the peripheral blood, T cell responses against the peptides and/or tumor, through Day 22
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 causes an immune response in patients with stage IIB, III, or IV colorectal cancer.
* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination comprising HER-2-neu and carcinoembryonic antigen synthetic peptides, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and Montanide ISA-51 on days 1, 8, and 15. On day 22, patients undergo removal of the lymph node into which the vaccination site drains to determine whether the immune system is responding to the vaccine.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
