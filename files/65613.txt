Previous study has confirmed the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies (including pembrolizumab or sintilimab). However, the CR rate of PD-1 antibody monotherapy is too low. Previous studies have demonstrated that decitabine may activate the T cells and enhance the efficacy of PD-1 antibodies in Hodgkin Lymphoma. Thus, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with decitabine in the treatment of NK/T cell lymphoma.
