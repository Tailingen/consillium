Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Tirabrutinib and Idelalisib With and Without Obinutuzumab in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of the combination of tirabrutinib and idelalisib with obinutuzumab in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The study has a 6 participant per arm safety run-in to evaluate safety prior to the enrollment of subsequent participants. The treatment period is adaptive, with a duration of active treatment up to two years and a total follow-up on study for up to 30 days post end of treatment, or up to Week 25 should a participant discontinue treatment prior to Week 25 for reasons other than disease progression.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Tirabrutinib|DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Rate of Complete Response/Complete Remission (CR), as Assessed by Investigator Using Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 Criteria at Week 25, Rate of CR per modified IWCLL 2008 criteria at Week 25 was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CR/complete remission with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi) at Week 25. CR: meeting following criteria and no disease related symptoms: no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow sample must be normocellular with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules; platelets \> 100,000/µL; hemoglobin \> 11 g/dL; and neutrophils \> 1500/µL. CRi: CR criteria (no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow \[hypocellular\] with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules), persistent anemia/thrombocytopenia/neutropenia unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity., Week 25
Rate of CR With Bone Marrow Minimal Residual Disease (CR/BM MRD) Negativity, as Assessed by the Investigator Using the Modified IWCLL 2008 Criteria at Week 25, Rate of CR/BM MRD at Week 25 was defined as percentage of participants who achieved CR/CRi per modified IWCLL 2008 criteria and also achieved BM MRD negativity at Week 25. CR: meeting following criteria and no disease related symptoms: no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow sample must be normocellular with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules; platelets \> 100,000/µL; hemoglobin \> 11 g/dL; and neutrophils \> 1500/µL. CRi: CR criteria (no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow \[hypocellular\] with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules), persistent anemia/thrombocytopenia/neutropenia unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity. MRD response was assessed with four-color-flow cytometry (FACS) and MRD negativity was defined as one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes \[0.01%\], ie,\<10\^-4 and participants were defined as MRD negative if their disease burden was below this threshold., Week 25|Rate of CR With Peripheral Minimal Residual Disease (CR/PB MRD) Negativity, as Assessed by the Investigator Using the Modified IWCLL 2008 Criteria at Week 25, Rate of CR/PB MRD at Week 25 was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CR/CRi per modified IWCLL 2008 criteria and also achieved PB MRD negativity at Week 25. CR: meeting following criteria and no disease related symptoms: no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow sample must be normocellular with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules; platelets \> 100,000/µL; hemoglobin \> 11 g/dL; and neutrophils \> 1500/µL. CRi: CR criteria (no lymphadenopathy \> 1.5 cm/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly; lymphocytes \< 4000/μL; bone marrow \[hypocellular\] with 30% lymphocytes and no B-lymphoid nodules), persistent anemia/thrombocytopenia/neutropenia unrelated to CLL but related to drug toxicity. MRD response was assessed with FACS and MRD negativity was defined as one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes \[0.01%\], ie,\<10\^-4 and participants were defined as MRD negative if their disease burden was below this threshold., Week 25|Overall Response Rate (ORR), as Assessed by the Investigator Using the Modified IWCLL 2008 Criteria at Week 25, ORR was assessed based on modified IWCLL 2008 criteria and was defined as percentage of participants achieving a CR, CRi, partial remission (PR; including nodular partial response \[nPR\]), and PR with lymphocytosis (PR-L). CR and CRi: meeting all the criteria that have been defined in Outcome measures 1, 2 and 3. PR: ≥ 2 of these: ≥ 50% decrease in lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, size of liver, size of spleen, and 50% decrease in bone marrow infiltrates; and ≥ 1 of these: neutrophils \> 1500/μL or ≥ 50% increase from Baseline, platelets ≥ 100,000/µL or ≥ 50% increase from Baseline, hemoglobin \>11 g/dL or ≥ 50% increase from Baseline. PR-L: meeting PR criteria; however, a lymphocytosis related to treatment may be present. nPR: All criteria for a CR/CRi were fulfilled, but the bone marrow showed lymphoid nodules., Week 25|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as 1 or both of the following:

* Any AEs with an onset date on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug
* Any AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug

A SAE is defined as an event that, at any dose, resulted in any of the following: death, life-threatening, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or a medically important event or reaction., First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum: 105 weeks) plus 30 days
