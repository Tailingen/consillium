Inotuzumab Ozogamicin in Treating Patients With B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia With Positive Minimal Residual Disease
This phase II trial studies how well inotuzumab ozogamicin works in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia with positive minimal residual disease. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody called inotuzumab linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin attaches to B cell-specific CD22 cancer cells in a targeted way and kills them.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Recurrent B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin
Relapse-free survival (RFS), Up to 4 years
Incidence of adverse events, Will continuously monitor treatment-related toxicities using the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey. For the purpose of toxicity monitoring, toxicities are defined as any treatment-related grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse events occurring any time during the trial., Up to 4 years|Overall survival, Up to 4 years|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, Up to 4 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as well as safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this setting.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 day and then periodically every 6 months.
