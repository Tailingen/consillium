Observational Study for the Evaluation of Immune-mediated Endocrinological Adverse Events in Patients With Hematological Malignancies and Subjected to Treatment With Immune-checkpoint Inhibitors
Retrospective / prospective observational study of endocrinological adverse events in hematologic patients treated with immunological checkpoint inhibitors
Hematological Malignancies
Evaluate the incidence, type and severity of immune-related endocrine side effects, to evaluate the incidence, type and severity of immune-related endocrine side effects (thyroid disease, hypophysitis, diabetes) in patients treated with ICIs, through haematological-endocrinological management., through study completion, an average of 2 years
search for predictive criteria for the appearance of immune-mediated endocrine toxicities, correlation between patients characteristics and occurrence of immune-mediated endocrine toxicities, through study completion, an average of 2 year|impact of toxicity on the continuation of therapy, rate of patients who discontinued therapy due to toxicity, through study completion, an average of 2 year|monitoring system for early diagnosis and management of toxicities, assesment of toxicities since first cycle and comparison with medical history, through study completion, an average of 2 year
