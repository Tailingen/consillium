Pilot Project of Adaptive Thoracic Radiotherapy for Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is intended to assess the feasibility of adjusting a radiation plan during its course to accommodate for a shrinking tumor target. The investigators hypothesize that an adaptive radiotherapy (RT) planning strategy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with chest-confined disease will allow for safe delivery of higher doses of chest RT than a non-adaptive RT planning approach without subjecting normal critical structures to unacceptable doses of radiotherapy.
