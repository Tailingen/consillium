Electromagnetic Fields Versus Placebo For Child-Pugh A and B Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The primary goals of this study are to compare overall survival and quality of life in subjects with Child-Pugh A or B advanced hepatocellular carcinoma when treated with a device emitting radiofrequencies modulated at specific frequencies or with a device emitting unmodulated radiofrequencies.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: TheraBionic Device|DEVICE: Placebo Device|DEVICE: Quality of Life Assessment
Overall Survival, Overall survival assessment will be recorded in days and will represent the period starting at the date of treatment initiation and finishing at the date of patient death. Living patients at the time of analysis will have the date of last contact (consultation visit or phone contact) used to define overall survival., Baseline to 6 months|Quality of Life Survey, Patient-reported hepatobiliary-specific disease-related symptoms will be assessed by the 18-item FACT-Hepatobiliary (Hep) subscale every cycle for the first 6 cycles then every other cycle thereafter, at the end of treatment, and at every 3 months during follow-up., Baseline to 6 months
Progression-Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) will be compared between groups using a 2-sided log rank test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for PFS will also be generated and median progression free survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each group, Up to 2 years|Proportion of Patients With Disease Control, Proportion of patients who respond and the corresponding 95% Clopper Pearson exact confidence intervals. Patients who are removed from study before the 6-month time point will be considered to not have disease control at that time point., At 4 months and 6 months and up to 2 years|Proportion of Participants That Are Progression Free, we will determine the proportion of patients who are progression free after 12 weeks (after 2nd 6-week visit) and compare this between groups using a Fisher's exact test. In addition, the corresponding 95% Clopper Pearson exact confidence intervals will be calculated for the 4 month and 6 month progression free survival rates., At 12 weeks, 4 months and 6 months and up to 2 years|Incidences of Adverse Events - CTCAE version 5.0, Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\], version 5.0, type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be assessed., Up to 28 days after study treatment administration or until death|Changes in Alfa-Fetoprotein Levels, Investigators will examine whether these is any association between the AFP levels (potential biomarker for response) and the objective response observed for each participant. Average alfa-fetoprotein levels will be examined over time, and these changes in alfa-fetoprotein rates after 6 months will be examined for each Response category (complete response/ partial response/ stable disease/ progressive disease) and tested using a 1-way ANOVA to see if the change in AFP level differs by response category., 6 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Item GP5, Participants will answer a single item question from the FACT-G questionnaire "I am bothered by side effects of treatment" Scoring scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) to assess for side effects to assess for patient rated treatment tolerability., At baseline and every 6 weeks up to 6 months|Frequency of Adverse Events - PRO-CTCAE, The frequency and nature of patient-reported symptomatic adverse events will be assessed using 10 items from the PRO-CTCAE item library. PRO-CTCAE items will assess mucositis (2 items; severity, interference), dry mouth (1 item, severity), fatigue (2 items; severity, interference), decreased appetite (2 items; severity, interference), nausea (1 item, severity), and headache (2 items; severity, interference) to measure potential adverse events associated with the study intervention. Participants will select the one response that best describes their experience with a scoring scale(s) of None to Very Severe or Not at all to Very Much., At baseline and every 8 weeks up to 6 months
