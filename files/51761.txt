Single vs. Double Drain in Modified Radical Mastectomy
Seroma is a common complication following modified radical mastectomy(MRM). Closed drainage is used routinely to reduce incidence of seroma. Usually two drains are used in patients who underwent MRM to reduce post operative seroma. It is often associated with significant patient discomfort and prolonged fluid drainage.

The aim of this study is to evaluate effect of number of drains on seroma formation rate, postoperative pain and hospital stay during the immediate postoperative period after mastectomy for breast cancer.

seroma formation, fluid collection beneath the flap sufficient to cause patient discomfort and pain, 30 days post surgery
Duration of hospital stay,,, 30 days after surgery|wound infection, as described by center of disease control (CDC) criteria, 30 days after surgery|postoperative pain, measured on visual analogue scale (1 to 10) in first 24 hours after surgery., 30 days after surgery|hematoma, blood collection under the flap, 30 days after surgery|flap necrosis, flap discoloration due to compromised blood supply of flap, 30 days after surgery
Modified Radical mastectomy is commonly performed procedure for carcinoma breast. After surgery two drains are placed, one in axilla and one beneath the flap. The use of two drains is associated with significant post operative discomfort and pain. On the other hand two drains have not been proven to decrease post operative seroma formation.
