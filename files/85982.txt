Study of Anti-PD-1 Antibody SHR-1210 Plus Nimotuzumab in the Treatment of Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

The incidence of esophageal cancer is ranked seventh in the world, and the mortality rate ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. The investigators designed a single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 combined with nimotuzumab as second-line therapy in patients with advanced cancerous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
