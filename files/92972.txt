The Effect of MDT Plus SDM on Survival Benefit of Advanced Gastric Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the long-term effect of surgery in metastatic gastric cancer patients who are accessed as having opportunity for surgery under Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) evaluation. The main question it aims to answer is:

Does surgery extend survival time in metastatic gastric cancer patients who are accessed as having opportunity for surgery under Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) evaluation?
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: surgery
overall survival, From diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer to any cause of deathï¼Œassessed up to 5 years
progression free survival, From diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer to tumor progression or any cause of death, assessed up to 2 years|safety of surgery, any grade of adverse event, after surgery, assessed up to 24 weeks
Select metastatic gastric cancer patients that have the opportunity to undergo any forms of surgery through MDT. Then further evaluate these patients' risks and benefits. Let patients make their finally decision through shared-decision making (SDM). According to the actual decision, the patients are divided into surgery group and non-surgery group.
