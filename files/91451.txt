Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

DRUG: lapatinib ditosylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Evaluation of antitumor activity as measured by objective response (CR+PR) evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Response will be classified by type and duration and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for the interim looks, will be calculated., At least 6 months
Adverse events will be classified by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0, At study closure, adverse events will be classified by type, grade, duration and probable relation to treatment., Up to 12 months|Time to progression evaluated using the RECIST, Product limit method will be used to estimate time to progression. We will have approximately 84% power to test the alternative with a one-sided 5% level test., Time from start of treatment until disease progression or date of last follow-up, up to 12 months|Changes in biochemical response as measured by biomarker data, A proportional hazard model will be used to determine the association of selected markers with time to progression., Up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck following treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Secondary objectives of this study are to estimate time to progression, describe the adverse event profile, and to obtain preliminary assessments of changes in pre- versus post-treatment measurements for selected biomarkers in tumor cells from these patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
