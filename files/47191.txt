A Study Using Subject-specific MRD to Adopt Treatment After HSCT for Subjects With MDS
The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate if pre-emptive intervention using Azacitidine and / or donor lymphocytes or tapering of immune suppression in measurable residual disease (MRD) positive subjects can prevent clinical relapse. Participants will undergo MRD surveillance and be subjected to intervention in case of MRD positivity. Results will be compared with NMDSG14B, part one, in which MRD was analyzed in included patients without recieving intervention.
