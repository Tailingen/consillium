Microwave Ablation Versus Liver Resection for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
Thermal ablation has been recommended by worldwide guidelines as first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while evidence regarding its efficacy for primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is lacking. The goal of this observational study is to study the efficacy of ablation in treating iCCA by comparing its prognosis with surgery. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Whether microwave ablation could achieve similar efficacy with liver resection in treating iCCA
* What is the risk factor for ablation or surgery in treating iCCA
* What kind of iCCA patients could receive ablation as their first-line treatment In this real-world multicenter cohort study, we will collect data of iCCA patients from hospitals who underwent microwave ablation (MWA) or liver resection (LR) for tumors within Milan criteria. Survival will be compared between patients treated by MWA or LR.
Overall Survival|Disease-free Survival
PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation (MWA) versus Liver Resection (LR)
Overall survival, OS was defined as death related to any cause and was indexed from the date of ablation or surgery until last contact or death, More than 3 years]|Disease-free survival, DFS was defined as the time interval between first treatment and recurrence or death, whichever occurred earlier., More than 3 years
