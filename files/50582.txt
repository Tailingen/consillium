Comparison of Proton Pump Inhibitor and H2 Receptor Blocker on Prevention of Bleeding From Iatrogenic Ulcer After Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Neoplasms: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial
after endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) of early gastric cancer, conventional proton pump(PPI) inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists have a controversial effect on preventing bleeding from artificial ulcers. the aim of this study was to investigate whether a stronger acid suppression (high dose PPI) more effectively prevents bleeding after ESD
Delayed Bleeding
DRUG: high dose proton pump inhibitor|DRUG: H2RB
bleeding incidence after ESD, time to occur delayed bleeding within one month after ESD
the size of healing ulcer after ESD, follow up endoscopy for the healing of iatrogenic ulcer after one month ESD
