Effect of Addition of Steroids on Duration of Analgesia
The purpose of the study is to investigate the differences in post-procedural pain scores and narcotic use among patients who receive a Superior Hypogastric Nerve Block (SHNB) with and without corticosteroid performed as part of the Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) procedure.
Uterine Fibroids|Adenomyosis
DRUG: Triamcinolone|DRUG: Bupivacaine|OTHER: Iohexol contrast
Change in Pain Intensity Measure (mm), The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing "No Pain" and 100 mm representing "Worst Possible Pain"., Baseline, 240 hours
Investigators will enroll a total of 28 women undergoing the UAE procedure with 14 subjects in each study arm. This investigation is a single blind randomized control trial investigating the post-procedural analgesic effect of adding a corticosteroid (Triamcinolone) as an adjuvant to a SHNB that contains bupivacaine for patients undergoing UAE, compared to patients undergoing nerve block for pain control following UAE with local anesthetic only. Before and after the procedure, patients will be asked to complete online surveys in order to record their pain score (measured on the Visual Analog Pain Scale), opioid and other pain medication use, and other symptoms, such as nausea.
