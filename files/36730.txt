Chemotherapy With Anlotinib in Advanced Cervical Cancer
STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The primary hypothesis is whether chemotherapy with Anlotinib improves overall survival in advanced cervical cancer.

TRIAL DESIGN: The study is a prospective, single-arm, observational clinical study. The study will be performed on an intent-to-treat population. All the enrolled patients received chemotherapy with Anlotinib.

PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Overall survival, defined as the observed length of life from entry into the study to death from any cause or the date of last contact.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
Overall survival, The time from the first day of treatment until death from any cause, Up to 3 years
Progression-free survival, The time from the first day of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, or as the date of the last follow-up., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Adverse Events were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version 4.0., Up to 3 years|The average score of FACT-Cx TOI [Functional Assessment], The HRQL instruments used in this trial were the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-Cx) Trial Outcome Index (TOI), for which a higher score indicates better HRQL., Up to 3 years
Patients with advanced (metastatic, persistent, and recurrent) cervical cancer will be recruited from Zhongda Hospital. Only patients who treated with paclitaxel plus nedaplatin will be included in the analysis. All patients receive paclitaxel (135-175mg /m\^2) and nedaplatin (100 mg/m\^2) infusion on day 1, and then take Anlotinib 12mg/d orally on day 7-21, every 3 weeks. Once patients reached CR or PR, Anlotinib was continued on 12mg/d maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was noted.
