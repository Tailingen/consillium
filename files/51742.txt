Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using radiation therapy with 5 fractions of radiation to treat prostate cancer with guidance of radiation using the Calypso 4D Treatment System (Calypso).A number of recent studies have used 5 radiation fraction to treat prostate cancer over 2-3 weeks as compared to the typical treatment which would involve 40-42 smaller radiation fractions over 8-9 weeks. This type of radiation using a smaller number of treatments has been called hypofractionated radiation therapy.

The Calypso is a new technique which uses beacons implanted into the prostate which using radio signals are able to localize and track the position of the prostate continuously during radiation therapy. The Calypso system has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for guidance of radiation therapy during the treatment of prostate cancer and is being utilized all across the United States. However, it has not been tested for hypofractionated radiation therapy.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Percentage of Patients With a Minimally Detected Decline (MDD) in Quality of Life (QOL), To evaluate the safety of the proposed hyperfractionation regimen of 5 fractions of radiation to treat prostate cancer with guidance of radiation using the Calypso 4D Treatment System (Calypso, and to compare it to that expected from conventional treatment, which would involve 40-42 smaller radiation fractions over 8-9 weeks.

Percentage of patients with a MDD in Quality of Life (QOL) surveys for urinary incontinence (UI), urinary obstructive (UO), bowel (BS), and sexual (SS) domains were reviewed at 6 months and 24 months., 24 months
Percentage of Patients With a PSA Nadir of <3.35 ng/ml at 12 Months, To estimate one year prostate specific antigen (PSA)control of prostate cancer when treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using continuous real-time evaluation of prostate motion., 1 Year|Relation Between Dose Distribution and Toxicities., To look at the relation between dose distribution and toxicities and to determine if reconstructed delivered doses are more predictive of toxicity than planned doses., 5 years|Relation Between Reconstructed Delivered Dose Distributions., To determine the relation between reconstructed delivered dose distributions, accounting for prostate translation and rotation, and tumor control probabilities., 5 years|Frequency of Required Interventions., To assess the frequency of required interventions (interruptions) based on real-time prostate translations and rotations to verify that the proposed planning target volume(PTV) margins and action level are appropriate and practical. This will be assessed by the percentage of patients with no interventions for any fraction, the percentage of patients with 1-2 fractions interrupted and the percentage of patients with more than two fractions interrupted and the percentage of patients that had an interruption of the beam at least once for all 5 fractions., 5 years
