Quality Of Life in Patients With Malignant Biliary Obstruction
You may have symptoms like itching, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, fevers and chills. The treatment you will receive to relieve the blockage is also intended to relieve symptoms and improve your quality of life. The purpose of this study is to find out if relieving the blockage in your bile duct improves your quality of life.

To determine how surgical or percutaneous drainage affects HRQL scores in patients with MBO, and to determine if these changes are sustained or change over time., conclusion of the study
To identify factors associated with changes in HRQL after drainage(e.g. diagnosis, level of obstruction, degree of pruritus), conclusion of the study
Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) may arise in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, primary gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, or metastatic disease to the liver or portal lymph nodes. MBO is often accompanied by significant symptoms that may result in impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQL), including pruritus, fever, nutritional deficits, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. Approaches to the relief of MBO include surgical bypass and/or resection, percutaneous drainage with or without biliary stenting, or endoscopic stenting. The non surgical procedures may be done prior to attempted curative resection or for palliation in individuals with unresectable or recurrent disease.
