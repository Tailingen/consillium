HIVEC in Patients With Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Hyperthermic Intravesical Chemotherapy (HIVEC) with Gemcitabine (GEM) after Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors (TURBT) in the treatment of medium or high-risk group Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC).
Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: TURBT|PROCEDURE: HIVEC|PROCEDURE: Intravesical Chemotherapy|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Recurrence rate, The patients were observed for 2 years since they received HIVEC or intravesical chemotherapy，and cystoscopy was repeated every 3 months. If a new tumor-like organism is seen under the microscope, and pathology indicates urothelial carcinoma of the bladder after TURBT or cystoscopic biopsy, the tumor is considered to have recurred. 2-year recurrence rate = number of recurrence cases within 2 years / total number of enrolled cases \* 100%., 2-year
1-year recurrence rate, 1-year recurrence rate = number of recurrence cases within 1 years / total number of enrolled cases \* 100%., 1-year|Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, Recurrence free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of record recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 2-year|Time to treatment failure, Time to treatment failure is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of treatment discontinuation/termination, including any reason for discontinuation/termination, such as disease progression, death, withdrawal due to adverse events, subject's refusal to continue the study, or use of a new treatment., 2-year|Success rate of therapeutic operation, Success rate of therapeutic operation, 2-year|Quality of international prostate symptom score, IPSS is International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), 0\~35, the higher the score, the worse the symptom severity is., Evaluation was performed during the screening period and at 3, 12 and 24 months after initiation of treatment.|Quality of bother of score, BS is Bother of Score (BS), 0\~6, the higher the score, the worse the performance is.BS is the Bother of Score (BS), 0\~6, the higher the score, the worse the performance is., Evaluation was performed during the screening period and at 3, 12 and 24 months after initiation of treatment
In this study, patients with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) and planed to undergo Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors (TURBT) are randomized into HIVEC group and control group. In HIVEC group, HIVEC is performed with Gemcitabine Gemcitabine (3g/150ml NS) at 45 °C for 60 minutes within 4 weeks, once a week (±5 days) for 6 to 8 times, once a month to 1 year. For the patients in the control group, Intravesical Chemotherapy is administered after TURBT. The primary endpoint is 2-year recurrence rate. Secondary end points include 1-year recurrence rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, disease free survival (DFS) rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), Success rate of therapeutic operation, Instrument performance evaluation, quality of international prostate symptom score, quality of Urinary Symptoms Distress Score. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analysis include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
