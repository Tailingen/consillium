A Study Using 18F-FAZA and PET Scans to Study Hypoxia in Pancreatic Cancer
This is a diagnostic study to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in pancreatic cancer using an imaging test called positron emission tomography (PET). Hypoxia can influence how pancreatic cancer grows and responds to treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the approaches used previously. This study will assess whether or not PET scans using a tracer called 18F-FAZA (18F-Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside) can provide useful information about hypoxia in pancreatic cancer. Also as part of the study, a blood sample will be taken to study biomarkers (substances in the body that may be important indicators of hypoxia and/or pancreatic cancer) that may be useful in studying pancreatic cancer and hypoxia.

Complete response is a tumor reduction of \<5 mm, partial response is at least a 30% reduction, progressive disease is a 20% increase, and stable disease is no increase in shrinkage and no increase in growth., 2 years|Correlate FAZA PET uptake in pancreatic cancer with patient disease-free survival (DFS)., Kaplan-Meier actuarial method and/or the Cox proportional hazard model will be utilized., 2 years|Compare the pattern of FAZA uptake in different tumor sites (eg., lymph node metastases and liver metastasis)., Standardized uptake statistics will be calculated for each volume of interest (VOI): Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVMax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVMean) and standard deviation of standardized uptake values (SUVSD)., 2 years|Determine the feasibility of using dynamic and static PET imaging of FAZA uptake in patients with pancreatic cancer., 2 years
This is a single centre, single arm hypoxia study of pancreatic cancer with PET FAZA imaging.

PET-CT imaging of tumor hypoxia with FAZA will be done prior to the start of standard treatment for pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy. The FAZA PET-CT imaging session will last approximately 2.5 hours and include an initial dynamic scan to completely characterize the initial rapid phase of FAZA uptake, followed by a later static scan.
