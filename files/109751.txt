Predictive Gene Profiles and Dynamic Measurement of Treatment Response in Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The study aims include:

* Exploring potential predictive molecular profiles to immunotherapy/chemotherapy
* Investigating the role of circulating tumor DNA as a dynamic biomarker during immunotherapy/chemotherapy
* Identifying possible resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy/chemotherapy

Materials and methods:

Approximately 150 patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC assigned for immunotherapy or chemotherapy will be candidates for inclusion during a 1-2 years period.

A comprehensive molecular profiling will be made from the diagnostic biopsy. Before every treatment-cycle a blood sample will be taken to quantify ctDNA. At time of progressive disease during/after first line treatment, patients will be asked to participate in a new biopsy and a comprehensive molecular profiling will be performed.

The tissue and blood samples collected will be stored in a biobank. Clinical data will be collected to perform a comprehensive database.

Analysis:

Potentially predictive molecular profiles for immunotherapy/chemotherapy will be found by comparison of treatment outcome for patients with specific molecular characteristics.

Through quantification of ctDNA during treatment and upon progression, the role of ctDNA as a dynamic biomarker will be further strengthened.

Differences in molecular profiles pre- and post-treatment may reveal resistance mechanisms to treatment. Molecular profiling on progression can be valuable in second-line treatment guidance.
