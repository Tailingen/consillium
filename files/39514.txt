Many breast cancer survivors experience problems with mental abilities such as memory, attention, and concentration (known as cognition). Increasing physical activity has been shown to improve cognition in adults; however, little is known about whether this is helpful for cancer survivors as well. This study will test whether a physical activity intervention can improve cognition in breast cancer survivors and help the development of physical activity guidelines for cognition in breast cancer survivors.
