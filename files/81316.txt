Toripalimab Plus Surgery vs Surgery Alone for Resectable Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, we intend to demonstrate that PD-1 treatment added to salvage surgery could further decrease the rate of disease progression and improve the survival outcome of patients with resectable locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with those treated with salvage surgery alone.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|PD-1|Surgery
DRUG: Toripalimab|PROCEDURE: salvage surgery
Disease-free survival, Defined as the time interval from randomization to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever come first., 2 years
Objective Response Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1., 3-5 weeks|Major Pathological Response Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with no more than 10% viable tumor cells which is identified on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining within the recurrent nasopharyngeal tumor and/or regional lymph node after neoadjuvant PD-1 treatment., 4-6 weeks|Overall Survival, Defined as the time interval from randomization to death due to any cause., 2 years|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival, Defined as the time interval from randomisation to the date of first distant metastases., 2 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomisation to the date of first locoregional relapse., 2 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., up to 2 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H&N35), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H\&N35) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., up to 2 years
Through multicenter, open-label, randomised clinical trials, patients with resectable locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma are randomized into salvage surgery plus PD-1 treatment group and salvage surgery alone group. The efficacy and safety of patients between these two groups are compared.
