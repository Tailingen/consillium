The Efficacy of Vocal Function Exercises for Laryngeal Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine if the systematic practice of Vocal Function Exercises (VFE) improves selected measures of voice production in participants who have previously been irradiated for early glottic cancers compared to participants who receive the present standard of care, namely, vocal hygiene counseling. It is hypothesized that a prescriptive vocal exercise program (VFE) will improve the voice production of individuals who have been previously treated for laryngeal cancers when compared to participants who receive vocal hygiene alone.
