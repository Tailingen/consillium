Efficacy and Safety of Recombinant Asparaginase in Infants With Previously Untreated Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL)
This non-controlled multicentre phase II study is designed to assess the safety and to describe (in relation to children of higher age) the pharmacodynamics of recombinant ASNase (rASNase) for first-line treatment of infants (\< 1 year of age at diagnosis) with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
