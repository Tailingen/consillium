Microwave vs. Radiofrequency Ablation for Benign Thyroid Nodules: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial Study
Compared with traditional treatment methods, ultrasound-guided thermal ablation is more targeted, less invasive and more reliable. The study compared microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation to evaluate the efficacy and safety in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules with a multicenter data, which will provide a basis for clinical treatment.

Volume reduction rate of thyroid nodules, volume reduction rateï¼ŒVRR=(Volume before treatment - volume at follow-up)/Volume before treatment, up to 12 months.
Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive treatment has accurate positioning, higher targeting, no need for general anesthesia, less trauma for patients, and more reliable efficacy.Currently, it mainly includes percutaneous anhydrous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation for the treatment of thyroid nodules.Currently, radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation are mainly used to treat thyroid nodules.

This study was a randomized, parallel, positive control, and non-inferiority multicenter clinical study.Radiofrequency ablation was used as the positive control.Follow-up was conducted at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation. The primary endpoint was the rate of nodule volume reduction at 12 months after surgery.
