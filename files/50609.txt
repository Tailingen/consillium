AMG 199 is a novel half-life extended (HLE) bispecific T cell engager (BiTEÂ®) molecule designed to direct T cells towards MUC17-expressing cells. This is a first-in-human study in adult subjects with MUC17-positive solid tumors including gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, collectively referred to as "solid tumors" in this clinical investigation to assess AMG 199 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity, with additional exploratory objectives to assess pharmacodynamics (PD), correlative biomarker analysis, and immunogenicity.

The primary end point is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 199 in adult subjects, and determine the MTD and RP2D. The secondary end point is characterize the PK and anti-tumor activity of AMG 199.
