Window of Opportunity Study of VS-6063 (Defactinib) in Surgical Resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Participants
This is an open label neoadjuvant (treatment with VS-6063 prior to mesothelioma surgery) study in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma who are eligible for surgery. Subjects will receive VS-6063 (defactinib) 400 mg twice daily for 12, 21, or 35 days or 100 mg formulation twice daily for 21 days. Pre- and post-treatment biopsies and blood samples will be collected. The purpose of this study is to assess biomarker responses from tumor tissue. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response rate to VS-6063 (defactinib) will be also be assessed.

Number of Patients With at Least One Adverse Event, Adverse events will be graded by the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) 4.0 and summarized according to the worst grade observed since the first treatment dose., Cohort 1, 40 days; Cohort 2, 42 days; Cohort 3, 28 days; Cohort 4, 28 days.|To Evaluate the Tumor Response to VS-6063 (Defactinib), Modified RECIST criteria for assessment of response in malignant pleural mesothelioma Ann Oncol 2004. Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the in the volume of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) at least a 20% increase in the volume of target lesions Stable Disease (SD):

Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter., Cohort 1, 40 days; Cohort 2, 42 days; Cohort 3, 28 days; Cohort 4, 28 days.
