Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Intratumoral Injection of CAR-NK Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of intratumoral NKG2D CAR-NK cell injection guided by endoscopic ultrasound in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-NK
Maximum tolerated dose, Determine the optimal agent for NKG2D CAR-NK at maximum tolerated dose, within 28 days after NKG2D CAR-NK treatment|Dose limiting toxicity, Describe the adverse events of limiting further increases in the dose of NKG2D CAR-NK, From enrollment of the first subject to completion of follow-up of the last subject（up to 2 years））
Effectiveness evaluation, Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1, At weeks 4，8 and months 3，6，9，12，16，20 and 24 after treatment|Cell continued survival time in vivo, Detect the copy number of NKG2D CAR DNA in peripheral blood at each visit point after the end of the infusion, until any 2 consecutive test results were negative, At weeks 4，8 and months 3，6，9，12，16，20 and 24 after treatment
