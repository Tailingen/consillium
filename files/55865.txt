Best CR/CRi/CRh, Analysis of best CR/CRi/CRh (taken into count: number of neutrophils, platelets and bone marrow blasts) to describe efficacy of magrolimab in combination with intensive chemotherapy, Up to 28 days
Overall Survival, Analysis of overall survival, OS (Time from study inclusion until death from any cause), up to 28 months|Event Free Survival, Analysis of event free survival, EFS (Time from study inclusion until end of induction (after up to two induction chemotherapies), hematological relapse or death from any cause (whichever comes first)), up to 57 days|Relapse Free Survival, Analysis of relapse free survival, RFS (only for patients achieving CR); Time from achievement of complete remission until hematological relapse or death from any cause (whichever comes first), up to 28 months|Rate of allo HSCT, Rate of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, After induction cycle, up to 28 days|Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), Evaluation according to EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, Registration, during treatment and end of treatment

To assess patient-reported quality of life during magrolimab treatment: 30 questions assessing the quality of life of oncology patients across 10 subscales will be analyzed. All subscales have a score range from 0 to 100 points.

Function subscales: a higher score represents a higher quality of life. Symptoms subscales: higher score represents higher level of symptoms/problems, i.e., represents lower quality of life., up to 4 months|Quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), Evaluation according to EQ-5D-5L User Guide, Registration, during treatment and end of treatment

To assess patient-reported quality of life during magrolimab treatment within five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.

Level 1 is coded as a '1', Level 2 is coded as a '2' and so on. Higher levels indicate lower quality of life.., up to 4 months|Rate and severity of adverse events, Rate and severity of adverse events for patients treated with magrolimab and induction chemotherapy (Start of treatment up to end of treatment), up to 4 months
