Safety and Efficacy of Venetoclax With Escalating Doses of Omacetaxine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Safety and Efficacy of Venetoclax With Escalating Doses of Omacetaxine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This will be a single arm, open label Phase Ib dose-escalation study of the combination of VEN and OM, conducted using an innovative Bayesian Optimal Interval-design, to find the MTD in participants with AML failing treatment with venetoclax-containing regimens. Treatment plan will consist of an induction phase, followed by a consolidation phase if applicable.

This is a Phase Ib study of VEN and OM, the investigator will conduct a Bayesian Optimal Interval-designed trial following the approach of Yuan et al 40 to find the MTD with a target DLT rate of 2%, 4 pre-specified doses, and between 24 and up to 30 participants. Beginning with the first participant treated at the lowest dose of OM 0.625 mg/m2 q12h with VEN 400 mg, dose escalation and de-escalation of OM will involve a comparison of the observed DLT rate (p) at the current dose with a pair of fixed, pre-specified boundary rates: λe (escalation) with p ≤ 0.157; λd (de-escalation) with p ≥ 0.238; or otherwise remain at the same dose per the dosing schedule. The trial will start with a cohort size of 1 participant (unless DLT is experienced) and escalated for each subsequent participant until the first DLT occurs and the current dose cohort is expanded to 3.40 In a simulation of these conditions with a target DLT rate of 20% (1), the percentage correct selection of the MTD is between 60% with enrollment of 20 participants and 70% with enrollment of 24 participants. Implementation of the trial design will be performed using R package 'BOIN'. If the investigator observes an unexpected toxicity in Cohort 1 the investigator will use OM 0.5 mg/m2 daily with VEN for Cohort -1 Following each cycle, participants will be evaluated for complete response (CR) by International Working Group (IWG) criteria 41
