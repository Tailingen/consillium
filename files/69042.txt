Pembrolizumab, INCB081776, and Radiation Therapy for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study is evaluating INCB081776 when given in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and palliative radiation therapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 12 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 12 months.

DRUG: INCB081776|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Palliative RT
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Frequency of AEs through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs, through clinical laboratory blood sample evaluations., Participants will be followed for 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of treatment (up to 12 months on study)|Duration of Adverse Events, Duration of AEs through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs, through clinical laboratory blood sample evaluations., Participants will be followed for 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of treatment (up to 12 months on study)|Severity of Adverse Events, Severity of AEs through physical examinations, by evaluating changes in vital signs, through clinical laboratory blood sample evaluations. Severity will be reported by Grade between 1 (mild) and 5 (death)., Participants will be followed for 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of treatment (up to 12 months on study)
Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants having CR or PR per RECIST 1.1. The irradiated lesion (lesion A) will not be included in the analysis., up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of participants having complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., up to 12 months|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from earliest date of response until the earliest date of disease progression or death per RECIST 1.1 due to any cause, if occurring sooner than progression., up to 12 months
Primary Objective

• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of INCB081776 in combination with pembrolizumab and standard palliative radiation therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Secondary Objectives

• To determine the preliminary efficacy of INCB081776 in combination with pembrolizumab plus palliative radiation therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The irradiated lesion (lesion A) will not be included in the analysis.
