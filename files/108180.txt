Different Bowel Preparations in CT Colonography: is Diet Necessary? A Randomized Controlled Trial
The aim of this study is to compare a new regimen of reduced bowel preparation that does not include low fiber diet with another reduced bowel preparation including low-fiber diet.

overall quality of bowel preparation using a 0-3 scale for each parameter (Homogeneity of solid-fluid fecal tagging, volume of residual fluid, colon distension)., the evaluation of overall quality of bowel preparation on CT colonography images including: homogeneity of tagging, presence of unmarked solid stool residues, the evaluation of volume of residual fluids and colon distention., 1 day
compliance of patients, A 0-10 visual analogical scale (VAS) was used with 0 corresponding to no discomfort and 10 to severe discomfort with severe impact on patient's daily activities. Intermediate values corresponded to intermediate values of tolerance., 1 day
Bowel preparation should be safe and well tolerated by patients, particularly in a screening setting. For this reason, limited bowel preparations have been extensively investigated. Usually, they combine the use of low-fibre diet and faecal/fluid tagging. The ingestion of a positive contrast agent (either barium, iodine or a combination of the two),needed to differentiate stool or fluid residues from true colonic lesions, is now considered mandatory. A low-fibre diet has the aim of improving residue homogeneity and facilitates tagging; however, there aren't significative evidences at support. The aim of this study is to compare a new regimen of reduced bowel preparation that does not include low fiber diet with another reduced bowel preparation including low-fiber diet. Primary outcome is the overall quality of bowel preparation.
