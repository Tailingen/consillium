Mechanical Nerve Stimulation in the Treatment of Post Prostatectomy Incontinence
During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve Stimulation (TMNS) in women could induce pressure increment of the external urethral sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33 women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on the overactive bladder syndrome. Furthermore pilot studies in men who are incontinent after a radical prostatectomy have shown promising results. A randomized investigation of TMNS applied in the immediate period after a radical prostatectomy to investigate effects on both continence and erectile function is on going.

The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence in men who are still incontinent more than 1 year after a radical prostatectomy. A medical vibrator is used daily for a period of 6 weeks and the results of the treatment is then evaluated. The participants will be randomized to 2 groups. Group 1 starts vibration treatment at base line and group 2 starts after 6 weeks when group 1 is done. The groups are compared at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks.

The stimulation will be performed at the frenulum of the glans penis every day for 6 weeks with an amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. Results will be evaluated on the basis of questionnaires, micturition diaries and diaper tests.

If the investigators are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence symptoms in the subjects the investigators asses that vibration can be a way of reestablishing normal continence in men after a radical prostatectomy.
Urinary Incontinence|Radical Prostatectomy
DEVICE: Transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation (TMNS) (FERTI CARE)
24 hour Diaper test (weight in grams) at 6 weeks, Participants will be provided diapers and they will wear them for 24 hours. The weight of all used diapers is then measured to assess how much urine is leaking.

The main outcome measure is the difference in leakage between groups 1 and 2 at 6 weeks (when group 1 has received treatment and group 2 has not)., Assessment at baseline and again after 6 weeks
24 hour Diaper test (weight in grams) at 12 weeks, Participants will be provided diapers and they will wear them for 24 hours. The weight of all used diapers is then measured to asses how much urine is leaking.

Here the leakage between groups 1 and 2 is measured at 12 weeks (when both groups have received treatment )., Assessment at baseline and again after 12 weeks|Micturition diary, The number of involuntary incontinence and normal micturition episodes are evaluated based on a patient diary. Here the difference in number of incontinence episodes between groups 1 and 2 are calculated at 6 weeks (when only group 1 has received treatment) and at 12 weeks (when both groups have received treatment)., Assessment at baseline after 6 weeks and again after 12 weeks|Validated symptom score (ICI-Q), The ICI-Q symptom score includes changes in incontinence and micturition patterns and patients' subjective assessment of their symptoms.

The scores are evaluated and differences between groups 1 and 2 are calculated at 6 weeks (when only group 1 has received treatment) and at 12 weeks (when both groups have received treatment)., Assessment at baseline after 6 weeks and again after 12 weeks|International Prostate symptom score (I-PSS)questionnaire, The total score as well as storage and voiding domains are evaluated, Assessment at baseline after 6 weeks and again after 12 weeks
