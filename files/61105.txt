Long-Term Outcomes of Different Surgical Techniques for Sacral Tarlov Cysts: A Prospective Cohort Study
Brief Summary

The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of different surgical techniques for sacral Tarlov cysts in adult patients aged 18-75 years diagnosed with symptomatic sacral Tarlov cysts. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does one surgical technique result in better pain relief (measured by VAS score) and functional recovery (measured by JOA score) compared to others?
* How do different surgical techniques impact the long-term recurrence rate and complication rate?

Researchers will compare three surgical techniques:

1. Partial cyst wall resection with nerve root sleeve plasty.
2. Partial cyst wall resection with nerve root sleeve reinforcement and reconstruction.
3. Autologous fat/muscle with fibrin glue microscopic cyst filling.

Participants will:

* Undergo one of the three surgical procedures based on clinical indications.
* Complete preoperative and postoperative assessments, including pain and functional scoring, as well as MRI evaluations at baseline and during follow-up.
* Participate in a follow-up program for up to 2 years to monitor outcomes and recurrence.
