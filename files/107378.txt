Metronomic Chemotherapy With Capecitabine for Pancreatic Cancer
The latest guidelines recommend Gemcitabine plus Capecitabine as the first choice of adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer patients in good physical condition. In order to prolong the survival of patients and improve the cure rate, metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine is a safe, effective and economical treatment mode after adjuvant chemotherapy. This study is trying to determine that compared with observation group, if capecitabine metronomic medication is a better choice after adjuvant chemotherapy.

Capecitabine (Xeloda Â®) is currently the most biologically active oral fluoropyrimidine drug, and is widely used in adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. It is usually taken twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) for 2 weeks, followed by a 1 week break before repeating the next dosage cycle. In this study, capecitabine will be prescribed as dosage of 500mg/m2, and maintain for a whole year after the standard treatment in stage II/III pancreatic cancer patients. 1 year disease-free survival is set as the primary outcome, OS, RFS, AEs and exploratory biomarkers including effects of metronome chemotherapy on immune cells, such as NK cells, T cells, TAMs, B cells, etc are also observed as the secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis are made to see compared with observation group, whether this metronomic therapy of capecitabine ( 500mg/m2) will bring benefit to pancreatic cancer patients.
