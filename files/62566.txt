Evaluation of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With and Without Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in Uterine Serous Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to estimate whether the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy improves progression free survival when compared to paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in Uterine Serous Papillary Carcinoma (USPC) patients overexpressing Her2/neu at 3+ level by immunohistochemistry (IHC)or positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized Phase II evaluation of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel with or without Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with HER2/neu+ advanced stage/recurrent disease with an emphasis on determining the progression free survival in USPC patients and assessing immunologic markers predictive of trastuzumab response.
