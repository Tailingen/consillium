Predicting Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Across Solid Tumors Using a Live Tumor Diagnostic Platform
This study is being done to collect tissue samples to test how accurately a tumor response platform, Elephas, can predict clinical response across multiple types of immunotherapies, chemoimmunotherapy and tumor types.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Tissue Collection
Accuracy of the Elephas Score for predicting clinical response in neoadjuvant patients, Assessed based on pathologic complete response (pCR) during checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment. Clinical non-response will be defined as non-pathological complete response. Patients who cannot have pathologic complete response determined will be excluded from the primary analysis., Up to 3 years|Accuracy of the Elephas Score for predicting clinical response in locally advanced/metastatic patients, Assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) score for best overall response \[complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)\] during checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment. Clinical non-response will be defined as either stable disease (SD) or disease progression (PD). Patients who cannot have best response determined will be excluded from the primary analysis., Up to 3 years
