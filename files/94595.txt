Phase 1b of Lurbinectedin in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
To learn if adding lurbinectedin to the combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab can help to control advanced cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Lurbinectedin
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

* To identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of paclitaxel/bevacizumab/lurbinectedin in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.
* To assess macrophage counts by image cytometry in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab/lurbinectedin.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess objective response (OR) and duration of response (DOR).
* To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as proportion of patients with OR or stable disease (SD) \> 4 months.
* To estimate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for at least 12 months

Exploratory Objectives:

--To assess differential effects from baseline, within and between patient treatment cohorts, on macrophage and hypoxia markers, CSF1/R and MHCII, plasma biomarker (VEGF, VEGFR, IL6, IL8, FGF, PDGFAA), tumor and macrophage-derived exosomes, resident macrophage populations in tissue pre-enrollment and after induction bevacizumab (CD11b +CD68, CD11b +CD14/CD15/CD33, CD11b +CD11c, MHCII, CD168+, CD4/CD8, NK, Treg) by multicolor tissue cytometry, as well as serial changes in vivo imaging such as tumor size, macrophage-specific imaging, ADC for cellularity, and DCE for vasculature.
