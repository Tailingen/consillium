The Application of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Relapsed and Refractory Malignant Hematologic Tumors
This study is an open, single-arm, prospective, Phase I/II clinical study using "3+3" dose escalation and dose expansion to investigate the safety, maximum tolerated dose, in vivo pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary efficacy of CAR-T cell injections for the treatment of relapsed/refractory malignant hematological neoplasms in subjects.
