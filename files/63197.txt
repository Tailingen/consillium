DLT was defined as any of the following occurred events within the first 28 days of the administration of TAK-228 that were considered by investigator to be possibly related to therapy: Grade \>=3 nonhematologic toxicity except for inadequately treated Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting and diarrhea, Grade 3 hyperglycemia lasting \<=14 days, Grade 3 rash lasting \<=3 days; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage or requiring platelet transfusion; Grade 3 anemia requiring blood transfusion; Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>7 days; Grade \>=3 neutropenia of any duration with fever \>=38.5 degree celsius and/or systemic infection; Any other \>=Grade 4 hematologic toxicity; Inability to administer at least 75 percent (%) of planned doses of TAK-228 within Cycle 1 due to treatment-related toxicity and any clinically significant occurrence that the investigators and sponsor agreed would place participants at an undue safety risk., Baseline up to Day 28 in Cycle 1 (Cycle length= 28 days)|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation, Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to Cycle 12 Day 58) (Cycle length= 28 days)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Daily Dosing Arms, AUC24: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Daily Dosing Arms, AUC24: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Weekly Dosing Arms, AUC168: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From 0 to 168 Hours for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 168 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|Weekly Dosing Arms, AUC168: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From 0 to 168 Hours for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 168 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|AUClast: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Time of Last Measurable Concentration for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 168 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|AUClast: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Time of Last Measurable Concentration for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 168 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)|AUCâˆž: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Infinity for TAK-228 on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 168 hours) post-dose (Cycle length= 28 days)
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). BOR was defined as the best response recorded after the first dose of study drug until subsequent therapy. As per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines, CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression (PD). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Baseline Up to 1 Year 7 Months
The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-228. TAK-228 is being tested to treat East Asian participants with advanced nonhematological malignancies for whom standard anticancer treatment is not available or is no longer effective. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK and will determine the RP2Ds of TAK-228.

The study will enroll approximately 46 participants, including at least 6 Japanese participants at RP2D dose level. Participants will be assigned to one of the following treatment arms:

* TAK-228 Once Daily
* TAK-228 Once Weekly

This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 12 months, unless in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months. Participants will be followed for 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
