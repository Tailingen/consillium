Feasibility of Assessing Lymphoma Response to Precise Local Injection of Candidate Chemotherapy Agents
Many cancer patients are prescribed drugs to which their cancer is already resistant - and thus suffer toxicity with no potential for benefit. Previous attempts to assess chemoresistance or sensitivity in vitro have failed. This is a feasibility study in human patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent lymphoma to determine how human cancerous lymph nodes in situ respond to standard of care therapeutics precisely microinjected with the CIVO(tm) microdosing system.
Lymphoma
DRUG: Multiple drug microinjection: rituximab, vincristine, doxorubicin, bendamustine, prednisolone or a combination of them
Evaluation of the response to locally injected drugs, 1-3 days post injection after injection
Evaluate the safety profile of multiple simultaneous microinjections using custom syringe, up to 28 days
