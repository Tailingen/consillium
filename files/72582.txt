Study of Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) Treatment Response Assessment With Fluciclovine PET MR
The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between brain malignancy volume as defined by post-contrast T1 weighted and F18 Fluciclovine before and following LITT. We hypothesize that imaging with F18 Fluciclovine will be superior to anatomic MR imaging in lesion volume assessment before treatment and that residual F18 Fluciclovine defined tumor will predict local post-LITT disease recurrence.

To establish the relationship between brain malignancy volume as defined by post-contrast T1 weighted and F18 Fluciclovine before and following LITT., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

-To estimate the accuracy of F18 Fluciclovine PET MR for laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) treatment response assessment as determined by T1 post-contrast MR brain imaging.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess changes in F18 Fluciclovine defined disease with LITT.
* To assess the volume change of the idealized quantitative T1 values of lesions compared -To assess the volume change of idealized quantitative T2 values of lesions compared to -Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI - To assess the ability of CEST imaging to differentiate treatment change from residual disease in brain malignancy following LITT.
* Multiple B Value Diffusion Imaging (Adv Diff) - To assess whether Adv Diff can differentiate treatment changes from residual disease in brain malignancy following LITT.
* Gradient- and Spin-Echo DSC perfusion imaging - To assess whether GESE DSC improves differentiation of treatment change from residual disease in brain malignancy -Adv ASL perfusion imaging - To assess the ability of Adv ASL to differentiate treatment change from residual disease in brain malignancy following radiation therapy.
* Exploratory Objectives
* To assess the relationship between post-LITT enhancing brain tissue and F18 -To assess changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) values after LITT.
