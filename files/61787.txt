An Internet-based Program to Help Cancer Survivors Manage Pain
To determine whether an Internet-based pain coping skills program plus enhanced usual care, compared to enhanced usual care alone, yields significant improvements in the co-primary outcomes of pain severity (as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)) and pain interference (also measured by the BPI) from baseline to the post-intervention assessment for cancer survivors with persistent pain.

BEHAVIORAL: Internet-based pain coping skills program
Pain Severity, The Pain Severity via Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) subscale score is the mean of 4 items measuring current pain, pain on average, and pain at its worst and least in the past 7 days on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine)., Change from Baseline to 10 week|Pain Interference, The Pain Interference via Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) subscale score is the mean rating of 7 items measuring impact of pain on walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, sleep, general activity on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)., Change from Baseline to 10 week

This will be converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME)., Baseline and 10 week|Opioid/analgesic medication use, 7-day medication diaries to capture participants' use of all medications each day during a 7-day period. Self-reports will be converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MME)., Baseline, 10, 22, and 24 week|Health-Related Quality of Life, Health-Related Quality of Life will be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (Short Form-6b). The six items are summed to give a score from 6 to 30, with higher scores representing better physical function., Baseline, 10, 22, and 24 week|Pain Management Self-Efficacy, Pain Management Self-Efficacy will be assessed with the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale. The self-efficacy for pain management subscale (PSE) consists of five items summed to give a score from 50-500, the self-efficacy for physical function subscale (FSE) consists of nine items summed to give a score from 90-900, and the self-efficacy for coping with symptoms subscale (CSE) consists of eight items summed to give a score from 80-800. For all subscales, higher scores represent greater self-efficacy., Baseline, 10, 22, and 24 week
This is a parallel group randomized controlled, prospective study that examines the effect of an Internet-based pain coping skills program on pain severity and pain interference among adult cancer survivors experiencing persistent cancer-related pain. The study also explores the effects of an Internet-based pain coping skills program on opioid/analgesic medication use, health-related quality of life, pain management self-efficacy and various other factors relevant among populations with persistent pain (i.e., fatigue, sleep, emotional distress, positive affect, pain impact, perceived cognitive problems, and cognitive performance), as well as qualitative assessments of participants experiences with pain and the intervention. A total of 250 participants will be enrolled (125 per arm) and randomized into the internet program arm (plus enhanced usual care) or Enhanced Usual Care alone.

Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 9 months (from randomization at week 0 to the final follow-up assessment at week 34).
