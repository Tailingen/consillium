Tilelizumab Combined With Nab-Paclitaxel for High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma Which is Not Completely Resectable: a Multi-center Study
This is a phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab when given in combination with nab-paclitaxel as treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR NMIBC) which is not completely resectable. Patients will receive treatment with tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 4 treatment cycles over 12 weeks followed by transurethral resection biopsy.
