Adrenal Function in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer
Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer may have hypofunction of the adrenal cortex either from tumour metastasis or other mechanisms. Since lung cancer patient may have to undergo stressful investigation and treatments, undetected hypofunction of the adrenal cortex may be hazardous. Knowledge of the size of the problem may help determine whether routine check is warranted.
