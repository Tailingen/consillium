Trial of Dasatinib Plus Ixabepilone in 2nd or 3rd Line Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary objective for the Phase I portion of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and for the Phase II portion of the study is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives are response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall toxicity.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Ixabepilone
Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Dasatinib When Given in Combination With Ixabepilone (Phase I), The MTD of dasatinib (taken daily, continuously) when given in combination with ixabepilone (administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort design. The total sample and the number of patients who receive each dose in this design depends on the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dosage. The MTD was defined as the dose at which ≤ 1 of 6 patients experienced DLT, and above which ≥ 2 of 6 patients experienced DLT., MTD was assessed during the first cycle of combination therapy (days 1-28).|Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Ixabepilone When Given in Combination With Dasatinib (Phase I), The MTD of ixabepilone (administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) when given in combination with dasatinib (taken daily, continuously) was determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort design. The total sample and the number of patients who receive each dose in this design depends on the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dosage. The MTD was defined as the dose at which ≤ 1 of 6 patients experienced DLT, and above which ≥ 2 of 6 patients experienced DLT., MTD was assessed during the first cycle of combination therapy (days 1-28).|Determination of the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase I), DLTs were assessed using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as any grade 4 hematologic event or any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic event occurring during cycle 1 that is attributable to dasatinib, ixabepilone, or the combination. The following events were excluded from this definition: grade 4 neutropenia lasting for 3 days or less; grade 3 nausea responsive to antiemetics; grade 3 infection with normal ANC or grade 1 or 2 neutrophils; grade 3 diarrhea responsive to optimal use of antidiarrheal therapy., DLTs were assessed during the first cycle of combination therapy (days 1-28).|Evaluation of Progression-free Survival (PFS) of the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase II), Disease progression was determined through radiology imaging measurements and by clinical or symptomatic progression during or after treatment. Progression is defined per RECIST v1.0 guidelines as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., PFS was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression (assessed about every 8 weeks) or death, whichever came first, for up to 27.2 months.
Best Overall Response of the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase II), Best overall response is defined as the best response across all time points. Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements performed after every two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment or time of progression. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of LD of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%; Progressive Disease (PD) is the increase in existing lesions or new lesions., Response to treatment was assessed after about every 8 weeks of treatment, for up to 27.2 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate of the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase II), Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing stable disease (SD) of at least 24 weeks (from the start of treatment) plus complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response was evaluated via changes from baseline in radiological tumor measurements performed after every two treatment cycles and at the end of treatment or time of progression. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where CR is the disappearance of all target lesions; PR is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of target lesions; SD is neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of longest diameter of target lesions to be PR nor increase of \>=20%., Response to treatment was assessed after about every 8 weeks of treatment, for up to 27.2 months.|Incidence of Grade 3 Adverse Events (AEs) With the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase II), All treatment emergent adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, Adverse events were collected beginning on day 1 of treatment until one month after the end of study treatment.|Incidence of Grade 4 Adverse Events (AEs) With the Combination of Dasatinib and Ixabepilone (Phase II), All treatment emergent adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, Adverse events were collected beginning on day 1 of treatment until one month after the end of study treatment.
In the Phase I portion of the study, patients will receive study treatment according to the assigned dose level. Ixabepilone will be administered over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Dasatinib will be administered continuously starting on Day 1, Cycle 1 once daily (QD).

Three patients will be enrolled at dose level 0 and observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for 1 course of treatment.

Dose escalation or reduction will depend on the number of patients experiencing DLT as follows:

* If 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the next higher dose level.
* If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level.
* If 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 patients experience a DLT, then 3 patients will be enrolled at the next lower dose unless 6 patients have already been treated at that dose.
* If ≥2 of 6 patients experience a DLT at that dose level, then the MTD is considered to have been exceeded. At that point, 3 patients are treated at the next lower dose.
* If no more than 1 of the 6 patients experiences a DLT, then the dose level will be escalated 1 level.

Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experience DLT, and above which ≥2 of 6 patients experience DLT.

In the Phase II portion of the study, dasatinib and ixabepilone will be administered at the MTD determined during Phase I. Dasatinib will be started on Day 1, Cycle 1 and will be administered continuously once daily. Ixabepilone will be administered over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be treated with both agents for up to 8 cycles, after which stable or responding patients are eligible for monotherapy with dasatinib at the investigator's discretion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
