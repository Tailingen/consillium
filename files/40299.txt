Comparison of Time Taken to Diagnose Intraoperative Coagulopathies Using VET and SCL
The present study is a prospective multi-center observational trial comparing the time it takes to diagnose coagulopathies due to intraoperative bleeding using point-of-care (POC) viscoelastic tests or standard central laboratory tests (SCL tests).

The present study is a prospective multi-center observational trial comparing the time for diagnosing coagulopathies due to intraoperative bleeding using POC viscoelastic tests, such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and thromboelastography (TEG) and standard central laboratory tests (SCL test, such as PT-INR, aPTT, s-fibrinogen level, platelet count).

The study will be performed during surgeries that are expected to entail a moderate to severe amount of bleeding and warrant the use of either POC viscoelastic tests, SCL tests, or both to determine the possible association of coagulopathy.

The tests will be conducted when an intraoperative condition requires identifying possible associations of coagulopathies during and after surgical bleeding. The test results will prompt appropriate coagulation management.

The primary objective is to compare the diagnosis time for intraoperative coagulopathy upon using the POC viscoelastic test or SCL test. The time will be defined as the time lapsed from obtaining a blood sample for the POC viscoelastic test or SCL test to acknowledging the test results.

Researchers hypothesized that using POC viscoelastic tests would shorten the time for diagnosis compared to SCL tests.
