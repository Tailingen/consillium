Palliation Dysphagia Cancer Oesophagus Stent+Brachytherapy Versus Brachytherapy Only
We wish to improve the swallowing function of patients with advanced cancer of the oesophagus, by carrying out a randomised clinical study in which we compare primary stenting followed by brachytherapy in the stent, 8 G x 3 with standard brachytherapy 8 Gy x 3.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether patients who receive a stent followed by brachytherapy have a better swallowing function without more pain at week +2,compared to patients who receive brachytherapy alone.
