Toremifene in Treating Patients With Ovarian Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Hormone therapy using toremifene may fight ovarian cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of toremifene in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: toremifene
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the effects of toremifene in terms of response rate, duration of response, duration of survival, and toxicity in patients with chemotherapy resistant papillary carcinoma of the ovary.
* Assess whether a dose response effect is likely for this regimen in these patients.
* Assess quality of life of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

Patients receive one of two doses of oral toremifene daily for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed before therapy and then every 4 weeks during therapy.

Patients are followed every 12 weeks until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The study was closed before any patient accrual.
