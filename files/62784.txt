Single-cell Sequencing Analysis of Resectable/Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in treating patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC). However, there are limitations in this field. Treatment strategies and definitions for BRPC patients differ, and the efficacy and prognosis of neoadjuvant chemotherapy vary greatly.This study aims to utilize single-cell sequencing technology to investigate in-depth the composition and interactions of the tumor microenvironment in patients from the surgical-only group and the preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy group.
