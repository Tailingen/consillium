Prognostic Value of Each Codon-specific KRAS Mutation in Colorectal Cancer
This retrospective study reviewed 3,144 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. This study was designed to comprehend the clinicopathological characteristics associated with individual codon-specific KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
GENETIC: Mutation
5-year Recurrence-free survival (RFS) of KRAS wildtype and each codon-specific KRAS mutation, from the date of surgery to the event(recurrence and death) up to 5 years|5-year Overall survival (OS) of KRAS wildtype and each codon-specific KRAS mutation, from the date of surgery to the event(death) up to 5 years
Recurrence-related factor, Recurrence in 5 years after the date of surgery
This study was designed to comprehend the clinicopathological characteristics associated with individual codon-specific KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer including codon 12, 13, and 61. Furthermore, the main objective of this study was to determine whether KRAS codon 13 mutation could serve as a prognostic biomarker of colorectal cancer in a relatively large cohort of subjects. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated from the date of surgery and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. For analysis of risk factors for tumor recurrence, Cox proportional hazards regression model was used with the covariance input criterion set as \< 0.1. Patients were subdivided based on primary tumor location (colon versus rectum), and MSI status (MSS/MSI-low versus MSI-high).
