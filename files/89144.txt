The Effect of Norepinephrine and Dopamine on Radial Forearm Free Flap Tissue Oxygen Pressure and Microdialysate Metabolite Measurements
Vasopressors may be needed after head and neck microvascular reconstructions to maintain sufficient mean arterial pressure. This is crucial for the flap survival. The study hypothesis is that norepinephrine and dopamine used as vasopressors do not affect flap tissue oxygen level and microdialysate metabolites.
