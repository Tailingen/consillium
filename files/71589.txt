Comparison of Proton and Carbon Ion Radiotherapy With Advanced Photon Radiotherapy in Skull Base Meningiomas: The PINOCCHIO Trial.
In PINOCCHIO-Triayl, carbon ion radiotherapy is compared to proton and advanced photon radiotherapy in patients with skull base meningiomas. There will be two treatment arms with photons, one arm with hypofractionated photon radiotherapy, and one arm with conventional fractionation. The study is designed as descriptive study on feasibility of the investigated therapies aiming at a comparison of toxicities. The study will serve as a basis for further larger randomized protocols comparing efficacy of the therapies, assuming toxicity is comparable in all four treatment arms. Primary endpoint is toxicity, secondary endpoints are overall survival, progression-free survival and quality of life.
