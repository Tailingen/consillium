Lateral Thigh Perforator (LTP) Flap for Autologous Breast Reconstruction
The lateral thigh perforator (LTP) flap was previously introduced as an alternative flap for autologous breast reconstruction when the abdomen is not suitable as a donor site. In this prospective study all LTP flap breast reconstructions that have been performed since September 2012 are analyzed. In addition, the surgical refinements that were introduced over the years are reported.
