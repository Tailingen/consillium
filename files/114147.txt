Oral Docetaxel (ModraDoc/r) in Combination With Hormonal Treatment and Radiation Therapy in High-risk Prostate Cancer
The optimal treatment for HRPC patients has not yet been established. Recent trials suggest a benefit from early treatment with docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting, with an improvement in failure free survival in high risk and metastatic patients and increase in overall survival in the metastatic hormone-sensitive group. In these recent randomized controlled trials, patients were treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant docetaxel, assuming that early systemic treatment for high risk or metastatic disease could delay progression in patients with aggressive primary tumor characteristics.

With the fact that docetaxel is a known radiosensitizer, combined modality treatment with docetaxel during the radiotherapy could also lead to better local control and reduction of local recurrence. Several phase I and II studies have been done in HRPC patients, to evaluate the combination of high dose radiotherapy and concurrent weekly infusions with docetaxel.

Oral administration of docetaxel has many advantages above intravenously administered drugs for patients. Besides the higher patient convenience, possibly longer treatment duration can be achieved due to better safety. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously administered docetaxel, such as neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with the oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r.

The primary aim of the N15DOP study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of ModraDoc006/r when given in a weekly bidaily schedule in combined modality with high dose intensity radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients with high risk disease, including positive lymph nodes.

Phase IA part This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomized, single centre phase I study of ModraDoc006/r combined with ADT and radiotherapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer, as defined by node positive prostate cancer with all of the following primary tumor characteristics: stage ≥cT2c, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, any PSA level.

Phase IB part After determination of the MTD of ModraDoc006/r in the combined treatment with radiotherapy and hormonal therapy and good tolerability of the treatment without unexpected adverse events during the radiotherapy until 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, the study will be further conducted to the phase IB part. This part will explore the feasibility and tolerability of long term treatment with ModraDoc006/r.
