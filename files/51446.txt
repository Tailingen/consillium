A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) With Tremelimumab in Head and Neck Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-exploration and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
