Evaluation of Lymphoma Prognosis and Survivorship in Recently Diagnosed Patients, LEO Study
The goal of this infrastructure protocol is to build and maintain a large and diverse observational cohort study to support broad and cutting-edge research focused on NHL prognosis and survivorship. The LEO cohort will promote identification of clinical (including co-morbid diseases), epidemiologic (including lifestyle and other exposures), host genetic, tumor, and treatment factors that impact multiple outcomes (including event-free, overall and lymphoma-specific survival; new onset comorbidities; and patient-reported outcomes). This resource also will allow examination of the interaction among these factors in order to better understand the clinical and molecular epidemiology of outcomes in NHL. Ultimately, this approach will drive discovery and validation of treatment endpoints, improve prognostication, and identify novel approaches to improve short and long-term outcomes for NHL patients.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
Overall Survival (OS), Time from date of diagnosis to date of death, Time Frame: Short (<5 years), medium (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years)
Event Free Survival (EFS), Time from date of diagnosis to date of first defined event (disease progression, relapse or re-treatment for lymphoma, or death), Time Frame: Short (<5 years), medium (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years)|Lymphoma Specific Survival (LSS), Time from date of diagnosis to date of death due to lymphoma, Time Frame: Short (<5 years), medium (5-10 years), and long-term (>10 years)
1. To extend recruitment at all 8 LEO centers as part of LEO2.0 using a single IRB, with a goal of recruiting an additional 8,000 newly diagnosed NHL patients (with funding from the NIH renewal grant to enroll 3,400) focused on Hispanic (N=900), African Americans (N=580), and Asian (N=200) participants (doubling the current sample size for these groups; adolescent and young adult patients age 18-39 years (N=870; 87% increase); and non-metro and rural patients of all ages and race/ethnicities (N=1,208, 72% increase) for a total cohort of over 21,000 patients;
2. To review pathology at diagnosis and relapse of all LEO cases and maintain a central tumor bank for selected NHL subtypes that includes an H\&E slide, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples in a tissue microarray (TMA), and extracted tumor DNA and RNA;
3. To collect a peripheral blood sample and maintain a central biorepository of DNA, serum, plasma, and buffy coat;
4. To continue to prospectively follow all participants in the LEO cohort to ascertain disease progression/relapse, retreatment, transformation, second cancers, survival (including cause of death), updated exposures, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and other long-term health outcomes;
5. To annotate and harmonize all cases with clinical, epidemiologic, pathology and treatment data, including development of new informatics enhancements to capture clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs), digital pathology, and radiology images, geocoded data from residence at diagnosis with linkage to public databases to enhance data on environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors; and
6. Facilitate research projects that use this infrastructure, promote interactions with NCI-supported clinical trials networks, patient advocacy groups, and other collaborators, and to make the LEO resource accessible to patients and providers with publicly available risk calculators based on LEO data.
