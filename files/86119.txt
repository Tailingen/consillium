Palliative Lattice Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Patients With Sarcoma, Thoracic, Abdominal, and Pelvic Cancers
This is a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Lattice SBRT for patients with large tumors (≥ 4.5 cm) planning to undergo palliative radiotherapy.
Sarcoma|Thoracic Cancer|Abdominal Cancer|Pelvic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Research blood draw
Rate of Local Control, At 6 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-related, Non-hematologic Grade ≥ 3 Toxicity, -Graded using CTCAE v5.0, Through 6 months
Mean Change From Baseline - PROMIS Physical Function Assessment, * Each value is the mean of the changes from baseline PROMIS T-Score to timepoint PROMIS T-score.
* PROMIS Physical Function is a 10-item questionnaire assessing current self-reported physical function with answers ranging from 1 = cannot do to 5 = not at all/without any difficulty.
* A PROMIS T-Score of 50 corresponds to the mean of the general population. A magnitude of 10 on the PROMIS scale corresponds to a standard deviation.
* A high T-Score for PROMIS Physical Function Assessment correlates to a higher physical function, or positive outcome. Since the scale is standardized a score of 60 is one standard deviation higher, or better functioning, than the reference population mean., 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Mean Change From Baseline-PROMIS Global Health Physical Assessment, * Each value is the mean of the changes from baseline PROMIS T-Score to timepoint PROMIS T-score.
* PROMIS Global Health is a 2-item questionnaire assessing current self-reported physical function with answers ranging from 1=poor/not all all to 5=excellent/completely
* A PROMIS T-Score of 50 corresponds to the mean of the general population. A magnitude of 10 on the PROMIS scale corresponds to a standard deviation.
* A high T-Score for PROMIS Global Health Physical Assessment correlates to a higher global health physical assessment, or positive outcome. Since the scale is standardized a score of 60 is one standard deviation higher, or better physical assessment, than the reference population mean, 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Mean Change From Baseline-PROMIS Depression Assessment, * Each value is the mean of the changes from baseline PROMIS T-Score to timepoint PROMIS T-score.
* PROMIS Depression is a 4-item questionnaire assessing current self-reported depression with answers ranging from 1=never to 5=always
* A PROMIS T-Score of 50 corresponds to the mean of the general population. A magnitude of 10 on the PROMIS scale corresponds to a standard deviation.
* A high T-Score for PROMIS Depression Assessment correlates to more depression, or negative outcome. Since the scale is standardized a score of 60 is one standard deviation higher, or worse depression, than the reference population mean, 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Mean Change From Baseline-PROMIS Anxiety Assessment, * Each value is the mean of the changes from baseline PROMIS T-Score to timepoint PROMIS T-score.
* PROMIS Anxiety is a 29-item questionnaire assessing current self-reported anxiety with answers ranging from 1=never to 5=always
* A PROMIS T-Score of 50 corresponds to the mean of the general population. A magnitude of 10 on the PROMIS scale corresponds to a standard deviation.
* A high T-Score for PROMIS Anxiety Assessment correlates to more anxiety, or negative outcome. Since the scale is standardized a score of 60 is one standard deviation higher, or worse anxiety, than the reference population mean., 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Mean Change From Baseline-Numeric Pain Scale, * Each value is the mean of the changes from baseline Numeric Pain Scale score to timepoint Numeric Pain Scale score.
* The Numeric Pain Scale is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain
* The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) measures pain intensity in adults using a scale from 0 or "no pain" to 10 or "worst possible pain." This measure is unidimensional and evaluated on the 0-10 scale. A higher value on the scale correlates with a worse pain and a worse outcome., 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Patient Reported Toxicity as Measured by PRO-CTCAE Assessment (Gastrointestinal Cancer Sites), * The PRO-CTCAE Measurement System characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities. The higher the score the worst the symptoms.
* Severity options include none=1, mild=2, moderate=3, severe = 4, very severe=5.
* Interference options include not at all=1, a little bit=2, somewhat=3, quite a bit=4, very much=5
* Frequency options include never=1, rarely=2, occasionally=3, frequently=4, almost constantly=5, Baseline, 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Patient Reported Toxicity as Measured by PRO-CTCAE Assessment (Pelvic Cancer Sites), * The PRO-CTCAE Measurement System characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities. The higher the score the worst the symptoms.
* Severity options include none=1, mild=2, moderate=3, severe = 4, very severe=5.
* Interference options include not at all=1, a little bit=2, somewhat=3, quite a bit=4, very much=5
* How often options include 1=never, 2=rarely, 3=occasionally, 4=frequently, 5=almost constantly
* Severity of difficulty getting/keeping erection, ejaculation problems, decreased sexual interest, vaginal pain 1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=very severe
* Experienced unusual vaginal discharge options include 1=not at all, 2=a little bit, 3 = somewhat, 4=quite a bit, 5=very much, Baseline, 2 weeks post-treatment (approximately week 4), 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months|Patient Reported Toxicity as Measured by PRO-CTCAE Assessment (Sarcoma Cancer Sites), * The PRO-CTCAE Measurement System characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities.
