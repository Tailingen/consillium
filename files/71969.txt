Effect of a Hyperproteic Hyperenergetic Enteral Formula on Body Composition and VEGF in AML During Hospital Stay
A randomized controlled clinical trial in two groups of supplementation with high protein enteral formula and a normocaloric enteral formula in two groups of 37 patients .
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Adult

Effect of use of hyperproteic, hypercaloric enteral formula in body composition and VEGF, The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the use of a hyperproteic hypercaloric enteral formula (Supportan DKN.) With a standard enteral formula (Fresubin® Original DRINK) in patients with AML during antineoplastic treatment., 21 days

Patients with acute myeloid leukemia have a high risk of suffering sarcopenia, which decreases the oncology therapy clinical response, functional ability and quality of life. Chemotherapy is used in these patients, some of them inhibit angiogenesis and act in an important way in physiological processes of muscle anabolism. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR) play a crucial role in both normal and malignant angiogenesis. Activation of the VEGF pathway leads to endothelial cell activation, proliferation and survival.

The objective of this study is to compare the effect of the use of a high protein, high energy enteral with omega 3 formula (Supportan DKN) against a standard enteral formula (Fresubin® Original DRINK) on body composition, days of hospital stay, quality of life, associated muscular strength with levels of VEGF in patients with acute myeloid leukemia during induction chemotherapy.

An open clinical trial was designed, in which a group of patients will receive, as part of their nutritional requirements a hyperproteic hyperenergetic enteral formula versus standard formula during the 21 days of the first cycle of antineoplastic treatment. We will measure body composition, muscle strength and serum concentrations of VEGFR in both groups to be able to compare its effect.
