Phase I-II Study on Treatment of Advanced Oropharynx Cancer in Elderly Population by Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy With Treatment Volume Reduction and Combination Chemotherapy
It is currently estimated that above 50% of new cancer cases are diagnosed in the elderly population\[1\]. With the increased life expectancy in the industrialised countries, the incidence of head and neck cancers has significantly increased in the last decade with rates estimated between 24-40% in patients over 70 years old \[2-4\]. It is estimated that with the improvement in quality of life and treatment modulation, the incidence will continue to rise in the coming years. Because the current available prospective studies often exclude patients above 65 or 70 years old, the data and guidelines on head and neck treatment for these patients population remain limited.

Treatment of elderly patients with advanced stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using RapidArc® or Helical Tomotherapy® at a dose of 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the PTV (GTV) and 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions to the first disease-free lymphatic relay bilaterally as well as a combination Cisplatin chemotherapy at a reduced dose.

Obtain a locoregional control that is similar to historical data, Obtain a locoregional control that is similar to historical data, therefore above 90%, while decreasing toxicity rates related to treatment in an elderly population at risk. We aim to recruit 10 patients for a confidence interval of 72 to 96% on the locoregional control rate. Kaplan-Meier curves will be obtained to calculate the locoregional control rate for these patients. Analysis will be conducted after each group of 5 patients. If a recurrence is document in 1 patient or more outside the CTV in each 5 patients group, the study will be interrupted., April 2015
