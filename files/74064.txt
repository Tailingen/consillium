This is a multicenter, open-label, single-agent phase I/II clinical study of MCLA-129 in patients with advanced solid tumors to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and antitumor activity of MCLA-129. The study consists of two parts: Part I is a phase I dose- finding study in patients with advanced solid tumors, including a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase; Part II is a phase II parallel cohort expansion study to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and PK profile of MCLA-129 in sub-cohorts of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors.
