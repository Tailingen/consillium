A Phase 1/2, Open-label, Dose Finding Study to Evaluate CC-122 in Combination With Ibrutinib and Obinutuzumab in Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 alone and in combination with ibrutinib and obinuzutumab.

CC-122 has multiple activities, including immune modulation of several immune cell subsets and antiproliferative activity in CLL. CC-122 has also been shown to have a tolerable safety profile with some preliminary signs of efficacy with early human experience.

DRUG: CC-122|DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Number of Participants and Severity of AEs, Number and severity of adverse events using the NCI CTCAE criteria (version 4.03), including DLTs, Approximately 60 Months|Determination of Non Tolerated Dose (NTD) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Determination of the NTD and MTD in CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab, 52 weeks
CC-122 Plasma Concentrations When Administered Alone or in Combination With Ibrutinib or Obinutuzumab, CC-122 plasma concentrations when administered alone or in combination with ibrutinib or obinutuzumab, Approximately 60 Months|Ibrutinib Plasma Concentrations When Administered in Combination With CC-122, Geometric mean concentration of Ibrutinib when administered alone or in combination with CC-122, Approximately 60 Months|Best Overall Response (BOR), Best overall response \[CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PRL (applicable to Arm B only)\] CR = Complete Response CRi = Complete response with incomplete marrow recovery nPR = nodular Partial Response PR = Partial response PRL= Partial response with lymphocytosis, Approximately 60 Months|Minimal Residual Disease Response Rate, Minimal Residual Disease Response Rate in bone marrow and peripheral blood, Approximately 60 Months|Duration of Response, measured from the time the response is first met until the first date that progressive disease or death is documented. Participants who neither progress nor die or who withdrew consent or are lost to follow-up prior to documentation of progression will be censored at the date of their last adequate response assessment., Approximately 60 Months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), will be calculated as the time from irst IP (i.e. any study drug) dose date to the first documented progression or death due to any cause during or after the treatment period, whichever occurs first., Approximately 60 Months|Cmax When Administered Alone or in Combination With Ibrutinib, Peak (maximum) drug plasma concentration, Approximately 60 Months|Tmax of CC-122 When Administered Alone or in Combination With Ibrutinib, Time to peak (maximum) drug concentration, Approximately 60 Months|AUC of CC-122 When Administered Alone or in Combination With Ibrutinib, Area under the concentration -time curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t, Approximately 60 Months
The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subjects with CLL/SLL. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab, to determine ibrutinib concentrations when given alone and in combination with CC-122 and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 at selected dose levels/regimens.
