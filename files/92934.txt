A Study of LymphoseekÂ® as a Lymphoid Tissue Targeting Agent in Pediatric Patients With Melanoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, or Other Solid Tumors Who Are Undergoing Lymph Node Mapping
Open label, non-randomized, multi-center, within-subject comparative study to evaluate the tolerability and the diagnostic utility of Lymphoseek with optional comparison to VBD in pediatric subjects with melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other solid tumor. Subject age will range from neonatal through 17 years.
Rhabdomyosarcoma|Melanoma
DRUG: Tc99m tilmanocept|DRUG: Vital Blue Dye (optional)|PROCEDURE: Lymph Node Mapping
Average Number of Lymph Nodes Identified Intraoperatively Per Subject, 1 Day|Subject Localization Rates, The proportion of subjects with Lymphoseek-identified lymph nodes, 1 Day
Proportion of Subjects Who Underwent Preoperative SPECT or SPECT/CT, 1 Day|Proportion of Subjects With a Lymph Node Identified Preoperatively Using SPECT or SPECT/CT, 1 day|Average Number of Lymph Nodes Identified Preoperatively Using SPECT or SPECT/CT Per Subject, 1 Day|Agreement of the Number of Nodes Identified by Preoperative SPECT or SPECT/CT to Intraoperative Localization, Average difference in number of LNs identified preoperatively with SPECT/CR and number of LNs identified intraoperatively per subject, 1 Day|Upstaging, The proportion of patients with pathology-positive lymph nodes who had at least one pathology-positive lymph node that was identified by Lymphoseek and had no other pathology-positive lymph nodes (i.e., identified by any other method), 1 Day|Nodal False Negative Rate for Nodes Identified, The number of pathology-positive lymph nodes that were missed intraoperatively by mapping agent divided by the total number of pathology-positive lymph nodes for that mapping agent. Population is all subjects with pathology-positive nodes. False negative rate represents the failure rate of the mapping agent to identify sentinel lymph nodes., 1 Day|Nodal Sensitivity, The number of pathology-positive lymph nodes that were identified intraoperatively by mapping agent divided by the total number of pathology-positive lymph nodes for that mapping agent. Population is all subjects with pathology-positive nodes. Sensitivity rate represents the success rate of the mapping agent to identify sentinel lymph nodes., 1 Day|Nodal Agreement of Central Pathology Assessment With Local Pathology Assessment of the Excised Lymph Node(s) to Confirm the Presence/Absence of Tumor Metastases, Number of nodes whose local and central pathology results agree divided by the number of nodes with nonmissing local and central pathology results, 1 Day|Change in Subject Nodal Staging Before and After Surgery Based Upon Nodes Identified, Change in subject nodal staging was assessed via shift tables to show the number of subjects with each combination of presurgery and postsurgery nodal staging. Presurgery staging was based on standard-of-care clinical assessment. Postsurgery staging was based on the pathology results of the nodes identified., 1 Day|Number of Changes in Postsurgical Treatment Plan in Relation to Nodes Identified by Lymphoseek, Changes to postsurgical treatment plan will be compared to baseline treatment plan., 1 Day
