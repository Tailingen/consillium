This Study Aims to Find the Best Dose of BI 907828 (Brigimadlin) in Patients With Different Types of Advanced Cancer (Solid Tumors)
This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumors). The purpose of this study is to find out the most suitable dose of BI 907828 (brigimadlin) the participants can tolerate. The most suitable dose is used in the second part to find out whether brigimadlin makes tumors shrink.

In this study, brigimadlin is given to humans for the first time. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer. Brigimadlin is taken as a tablet. Participants either take a dose of brigimadlin on one day every 3 weeks or on two days every 4 weeks.

The participants are in the study for as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment. The doctors regularly check the participants' general health during the study.
