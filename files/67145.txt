Safety and Toxicity Study of IMM27M in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a single arm, open label, multi-center and fist in human dose escalation study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced and metastatic solid tumor.
Oncology|CTLA4 Haploinsufficiency
DRUG: IMM27M
a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the DLT of IMM27M, 3 weeks|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE), 3 weeks|the rate of adverse events, the rate of adverse event (AE), severity and relationship of IMM27M based on CTCAE 5.0, 48 weeks
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|Dose escalation: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a partial response (PR) or better, 48 weeks|Dose escalation : Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a critical response (CR), partial response (PR) or disease stable (SD) with at least 12 weeks, 48 weeks|Dose escalation : Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to date of first documented evidence of PD, 48 weeks|Dose escalation: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of first dose of study drug to date of first documented PD, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 48 weeks|Dose escalation: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a critical response (CR), partial response (PR) or disease stable (SD), 48 weeks|Incidence of anti-IMM27M, To evaluate the immunogenicity of IMM27M in patients with malignancies;, 48 weeks|Peak Time (Tmax), the Peak Time (Tmax) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|Area Under the Curve (AUC), the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|t1/2, the t1/2 in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|Plasma clearance (CL), to observe the Plasma clearance (CL) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin), the Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks|Average Plasma Concentration (Cav), the Average Plasma Concentration (Cav) in advanced and relapse patients with IMM27M dosed, 48 weeks
Dose escalation (Ia) will recruit 16 disease progress after stand of care(SOC) , no tolerance of SOC solid tumor patients, including malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, triple negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell cancer of head and neck, pancreatic cancer, etc.

IMM27M will be dosed every three weeks (Q3W), the study will be conducted by adjusted 3+3 dose escalation study design, the fist dose is 0.1mg/kg based on the non-clinical study data and NOVEL assessment, the dose level will be 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mg/kg, the first dose will recruit 1 patient to avoid patients under no efficacy dose, then the conventional 3+3 study design will start since second dose.

Patients will be observed 3 weeks after the dose, this is also the DLT observation period, patients will be dosed until intolerability, progressed, death or informed consent withdraw, the total duration of treatment will be 48 weeks.
