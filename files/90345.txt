DecipHER Trial - DC1 Tx for Early-Stage TNBC and ER Low Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to find out if an investigational vaccine called Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccine given together with standard of care chemotherapy drugs can help people with Triple Negative and HR low positive breast cancer.
