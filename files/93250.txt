Reducing Colorectal Cancer Death Through Mailed Outreach Screening
The main study aim is to develop, implement and disseminate a pilot population-based mailed FIT outreach screening program in the Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on having an office visit, by conducting a proof-of-concept 3-arm parallel-design pragmatic randomized trial to (1) Compare the effects of usual care (UC), screening invitation + reminder (invitation-reminder), or screening invitation + mailed FIT kit + reminder (mailed-FIT); (2) Explore whether the FIT completion rate varies by age or race/ethnicity; and (3) Explore barriers to use of mailed outreach screening for Veterans.

The Number of Participants Who Completed the Mailed FIT Test Screening Within 6 Months, The completion rate of mailed FIT test within 6 months of the mailing of the screening invitation. The absence of FIT result in the electronic medical record (CRPS) will be considered a failure to complete the FIT test, 6 months
The Number of Participants Who Received Any Colorectal Cancer Screening Test in the 6-month Period After Enrollment Into the Study., The receipt of any colorectal cancer screening test in the 6-month period after enrollment into the study. For patients in the usual care arm, 6 months was counted from the date of mailed letter to arms 2 and 3 within that block of participants., 6 months
This study seeks to establish the foundation to systematically study and improve the delivery and effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the VA by developing, implementing and disseminating a pilot mailed-FIT screening outreach program that does not rely on having a clinical office visit. The investigators specifically address the need to identify and remediate potential failures to identify and offer screening to eligible Veterans through multilevel interventions. The investigators will also create electronic data linkages to, in future studies, enable evaluation of FIT performance characteristics and help close critical evidence gaps for optimizing screening among Veterans. As this is a pilot study, the focus is to assess feasibility of a population-based screening outreach approach through the development, implementation and dissemination of a mailed FIT outreach program in the Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on having an office visit.
