A Study of ABM-1310 in Patients With BRAF V600-Mutant Relapsed and Drug Resistant Primary Malignant Brain Tumors
Overall Design: This is a phase I, open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer efficacy of ABM-1310 in patients with BRAF V600-mutant relapsed and drug resistant primary malignant brain tumors.

The study including four periods of screening (28 days), treatment (no more than 2 years), safety follow-up and survival follow-up.

This study consists of two stages: dose escalation and dose expansion. During the dose escalation stage, a classic "3+3" design will be used to guide dose escalation to determine MTD and RP2D. Three to six subjects are expected to be enrolled in each dose group and at least 6 subjects are enrolled in the MTD/highest dose group. The total number of subjects enrolled during the dose escalation stage will depend on the amount of DLT and the total number of dose levels explored. If DLT is not observed in the first 3 subjects enrolled for each dose level, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC, including investigators, pharmacologists, and the sponsor's medical specialists, and other experienced members specially invited as necessary) will review the cumulative safety data of subjects at each dose level and decide whether to proceed with dose escalation upon the completion of study treatment at least for the DLT evaluation period (28 days of Cycle 1).

The dose expansion stage in this study will be initiated at the MTD or the optimal dose determined by the SMC as a fixed dose level (MTD or the optimal dose needs to be reviewed by the SMC and subjects are safe and tolerable at that dose level). The dose expansion stage is expected to include the following two cohorts of relapsed and drug resistant primary malignant brain tumors with BRAF V600 mutations:Cohort 1: GBM, N = up to 25 patients; Cohort 2: In addition to GBM, other primary malignant brain tumors, N = up to 15 patients.

In this study, the corresponding sample size for each cohort/tumor type may be determined according to the actual efficacy and safety data obtained. After each cohort included the first 10 patients, the available safety, efficacy, and PK data were analyzed. Based on the analysis results, the sponsor decided whether to continue recruiting patients for the study.
Primary Malignant Brain Tumor

MTD, MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which DLT is observed in ≤ 1/6 subjects at one single dose group., From the enrollment of subjects to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) or up to treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 28 days.|Recommended Phase 2 Dose(PR2D), RP2D will be a dose either below or equal to MTD, From the enrollment of subjects to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) or up to treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 28 days.|Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT), DLT will be evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0 criteria, cycle 1（28 days）|The incidence of treatment-related adverse events AE(s), Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal laboratory values, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal vital signs, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal physical examinations, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal ophthalmic evaluation, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal ECG, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation|Number of participants with abnormal Karnofsky PS, Safety and tolerability of ABM-1310 monotherapy, Up to 28 days from treatment discontinuation
