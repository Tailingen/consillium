Safety and Tolerability of Different Dose Combinations of Ridaforolimus With MK-2206 or MK-0752 for Participants With Advanced Cancer (MK-8669-049)
This is a two part study of the drug MK-8669 (ridaforolimus) given with MK-2206 or MK-0752. In Part A of the study, the preliminary maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the drug combinations will be found by giving sequentially higher doses of the study drugs. An expansion cohort of participants may be enrolled to confirm the MTD. New cohorts at other dose levels may be enrolled, depending on the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the planned cohorts. In Part B, an assessment of the efficacy of the drug combinations against selected advanced cancers will be made so that a recommended dose to be used in Phase 2 studies (RPTD) can be found. As of 19 July 2012 the MK-0752 arms of the study were fully enrolled and closed to further recruitment. As of 30 November 2012, no additional participants with prostate cancer will be enrolled.
