Evaluation of Safety and Activity of an Anti-PDL1 Antibody (DURVALUMAB) Combined With CSF-1R TKI (PEXIDARTINIB) in Patients With Metastatic/Advanced Pancreatic or Colorectal Cancers
Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are the most common gastrointestinal cancers in Western countries and are both associated with significant morbidity and mortality. An intriguing similarity between CRC and PDAC is the fact that the newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, seem to have limited efficacy as single agents in both of these tumor types. Recent preclinical studies point towards alternatively activated (M2-type) macrophages as possible culprits in inducing local immune protection from cytotoxic T cells and resistance to PD1/PD-L1 targeted agents. We hypothesize that CSF1R blockade will deplete the tumor microenvironment of M2 macrophages, thus favoring the induction of a cytotoxic anti-tumor T-cell response following PD-L1 blockade with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. So we propose to conduct a Phase I dose escalation study in order to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of a combined treatment associating an anti-CSF1R (PEXIDARTINIB) with an anti-PD-L1 (DURVALUMAB) in patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancers. Dose escalation part will determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Pexidartinib given in combination with Durvalumab. Extension part will evaluate the clinical activity of the combination at the RP2D.

part 1 (dose escalation part) : Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), A DLT is defined as one of the following toxicities occurring during the DLT assessment window (i.e. 1 cycle = 28 days) related to Durvalumab, Pexidartinib or both: any Grade ≥4 irAE, any Grade ≥3 irAE, that does not downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days, any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days of the initiation of maximal supportive care, Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (ANC \< 500/μL) lasting ≥ 7 days, Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia, Grade ≥ 4 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding and lasting \> 72 hours, AST/ALT \> 10 x ULN, AST/ALT \> 3x ULN with bilirubin \>2x ULN, any other study drug related toxicity considered significant in the opinion of the investigators, any other Grade ≥ 3 major organ adverse event with some exceptions., during the DLT assessment window (i.e. 1 cycle = 28 days)|part 2 (extension part) : objective response rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients (described on the efficacy-evaluable population) who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response at 16 weeks of treatment. ORR is based on tumor assessments (measurements according to RECIST 1.1 criteria)., 16 weeks of treatment
The duration of response (DoR), in parts 1 and 2, from the time of first documented response (CR or PR as per RECIST 1.1 criteria) until the first documented progression or date of death due to underlying cancer, or censored at the date of the last available tumor assessment, assessed up to 52 weeks.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), in parts 1 and 2, PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., from the date of inclusion until the date of the first progression or date of death from any cause, up to 52 weeks.|Adverse events reporting, based mainly on the frequency of adverse events based on the common toxicity criteria (CTCAE-V4.03) grade., from the signature of the ICF and the first intake of study drug until 90 days after the last study drugs intake or until initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment|Area under the Pexidartinib plasma concentration (AUC) versus time curve, analyzed by measurement of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-4h, AUC 0-6h. For each time frame: at pre-dose of both study drugs and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post- Pexidartinib dosing., Cycle 1 Day 1, C1D15, C2D1 and C3D1|Peak Pexidartinib plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax will define Tmax (time at wich Cmax is observed). For each time frame: at pre-dose of both study drugs and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post- Pexidartinib dosing., Cycle 1 Day 1, C1D15, C2D1 and C3D1
This study will be a 2-part Phase I study comprising a dose-finding escalation part (to determine MTD/RP2D, safety and PK) followed by an extension part at RP2D. In the dose-escalation part, successive cohorts of 3 patients will receive Pexidartinib (given orally every day at escalating doses, five dose levels possible, Plexxikon), in combination with Durvalumab (given IV every 4 weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg, AstraZeneca). The dose escalation scheme will be done using a Likelihood Continual Reassessment Method (CRML). After each new cohort of 3 patients is evaluated, model will be fitted and results will be discussed in a teleconference between the investigators, the sponsor, representatives of AstraZeneca and Plexxikon, and the statistician who will decide of the next dose to be assigned to the next cohort (Dose Escalation Meetings). In both parts, patients will continue to receive study drugs as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity including DLTs or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent. If a DLT or a toxicity meeting the DLT definition but occurring outside of the DLT period, resolves to Grade ≤2 or the patient's baseline level within 14 days after toxicity onset, dosing may be resumed if agreed by the Sponsor at the same DL. The extension part will comprise two independent cohorts of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC cohort) or colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC cohort) and biopsiable disease, and will allow the assessment of anti-tumor activity based on a Gehan design allowing to quickly identify treatments with low efficacy.
