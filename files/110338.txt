Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel With XELOX in Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis
IPXELOX will investigate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of intraperitoneal paclitaxel in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.

Study hypotheses: Intraperitoneal paclitaxel administered to subjects at the recommended phase 2 dose will show manageable safety and tolerability and anti-tumor efficacy with systemic capecitabine and oxaliplatin in advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
