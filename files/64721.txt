Bortezomib in Intrahepatic Cholangiocellular Carcinoma
This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of bortezomib in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.Half of participants will receive bortezomib while the other half will receive best supporting care.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Bortezomib
Objective response rate, Objective response rate include response from stable disease to complete response based on RECIST 1.1, at least 2 months
changes of platelet count, changes of platelet count after injection of Bortezomib, 7 days|occurrence of peripheral neuritis, occurrence of any feeling of numbness of limbs, 7 days
There's no standard second-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.

Previous study indicated high mutation/deletion rate of PTEN gene in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and poor prognosis of those patients with PTEN mutation/deletion. The investigators also found that the activity of proteasomes elevated in cholangiocarcinoma cells with PTEN mutation/deletion.

So the investigators suppose proteasomes inhibitor could improve prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with PTEN mutation/deletion
