The Effect of Proton Pump Inhibitor and Polaprezinc Combination Therapy for Healing of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection-induced Ulcer
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced technique that enables en bloc resection of superficial tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. ESD, however, is a time-consuming procedure that requires a high level of endoscopic skill to achieve a desirable oncologic outcome. Several procedure-related complications may occur after ESD. Especially, iatrogenic ulcer bleeding after ESD can be a concern for both endoscopists and patients. In order to reduce the bleeding rate, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are administered after ESD. In addition, ulcer protective agents such as rebamipide can be added to PPIs for accelerating ulcer healing. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of polaprezinc for healing of iatrogenic ulcer.
