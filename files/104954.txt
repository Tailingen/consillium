Melanoma Checkpoint and Gut Microbiome Alteration With Microbiome Intervention
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral microbiome study intervention (SER-401) or matching placebo in combination with anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy (nivolumab) in participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study also intends to assess clinical outcomes, the impact of microbiome study intervention administration on the microbiome profile, and its association with clinical and immunological outcomes.

Percentage of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), Investigators recorded AEs during each participant interaction. Symptoms were evaluated by the Investigator using the CTCAE version 5.0. This system grades AEs on a 1 to 5 scale: Grades 1 and 2 indicate mild to moderate events; Grade 3 denotes severe events; Grades 4 and 5 signify life-threatening or fatal outcomes.

A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event that either occurs after the initiation of study intervention, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to have worsened in severity or frequency, regardless of its relation to the intervention. Adverse events deemed 'Possibly', 'Probably', or 'Definitely' related to the intervention were labeled as treatment-related adverse events (TRAE)., Up to 2 years
Mean Change From Baseline in the Number of Newly Appearing Spore-forming Species, Engraftment was defined as the number of spore-forming species detected in SER-401 that were absent in participant baseline samples, and present post-microbiome-treatment, also referred to as newly appearing dose species., Up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who attain a best overall response of complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions), as determined by RECIST version 1.1. Confirmation of response by a repeat tumor assessment is not required., Up to week 52|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for ≥ 24 weeks as best response by RECIST v1.1., Up to week 52|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization to date of first documented progression of disease, date of death due to any cause, or date of most recent participant contact that documented progression-free status, Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization until death or last contact if still alive at the time of final data collection (after completion of anti-PD-1 therapy)., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, Defined as time from date of documented CR or PR to date of first documented progression of disease, date of death due to any cause, or date of most recent participant contact that documented response (ie, scan date)., Up to 2 years|Absolute Change in the Percentage of CD8 Cells in Tumor Tissue From Baseline at Cycle 2., Absolute change in the percentage of CD8 cells in tumor tissue from baseline at Cycle 2., At cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study in adult participants with anti-PD-1 therapy naïve, unresectable or metastatic melanoma to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-401, or matching placebo in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab). Prior to initiating microbiome study intervention and nivolumab, participants will undergo an antibiotic or antibiotic placebo treatment lead-in to prime the gut microbiome for engraftment of the oral microbiome study intervention. Study intervention groups will be assessed for safety, changes in the microbiome, changes in the percentage of tumoral CD8 T cells, and antitumor activity. Participants must have measurable disease that can be biopsied and consent to baseline and on-treatment biopsies, as well as stool and blood biomarker collection throughout the study.
