OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Mucositis according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Scale, WHO scale is a combined patient-reported and clinician assessed rating scale that ranges from 0 ( no oral mucositis) to IV (Life threatening mucosistis)., Up to 22 days or until discharge, whichever came first|Average oral pain, Patient is asked to rate their pain on a 0 - 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain., Up to 22 days or until discharge, whichever came first|Taste, Taste according to the Chemotherapy Induced Taste Alteration Scale (CiTAS) which is an 18-item scale that measures four dimensions of taste: decline in basic taste, discomfort, phantogeusia and parageusia, and general taste alterations. Items are stated on a Likert scale 1 - 5 (where 1 = no difficulty or absence of the disturbance and 5 = maximum difficulty or disturbance., Up to 22 days or until discharge, whichever came first|Xerostomia, Xerostomia severity (0-10 scale), Up to 22 days or until discharge, whichever came first
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Examine mucositis severity, oral pain, taste changes, and xerostomia in patients undergoing PBM, a new standard of care for oral mucositis.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Patients have their medical records reviewed on study.

GROUP II: Nurses complete surveys on study.
