Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus in Subjects With Metastatic, Mismatch Repair Deficient Solid Tumors After Immunotherapy
To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus by estimating the overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in patients with metastatic dMMR solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease progression or to inability to tolerate treatment).

Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease progression or to inability to tolerate treatment), ORR will be determined. For this study ORR will be defined as the percentage of patients who achieve either a complete response (CR = disappearance of all target tumors); or a partial response (PR = â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target tumors) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) following review of imaging (CT-CAP or PET-CT) data., Up to approximately 24 weeks after achieving therapeutic sirolimus levels, up to 7 months total
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, the duration of time from treatment initiation to progression of known metastases or new metastatic site, or death from any cause after a timeframe of 24 weeks, will be determined following treatment with sirolimus in patients with metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease progression or to inability to tolerate treatment). Group median number of months will be reported., Approximately 24 weeks after sirolimus initiation, up to approximately 7 months total|Response Duration (RD), RD, defined as the duration of time from documentation of tumor response until the time of disease progression will be determined following treatment with sirolimus in patients with metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease progression or to inability to tolerate treatment). Group median number of months will be reported., Up to ~24 weeks from the time of tumor response, up to 7 months total|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival, the duration of time from the start of treatment initiation for patients diagnosed with metastatic mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid cancer after immunotherapy (either due to disease progression or inability to tolerate treatment) to death from any cause, will be determined. Group median number of months will be reported., Approximately 24 weeks after sirolimus initiation, up to approximately 7 months total
Despite recent therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, treatment alternatives for patients with metastatic mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors remain scarce. Pre-clinical data suggests that dMMR tumors are susceptible to rapamycin (sirolimus), an mTOR inhibitor. In these tumors, characterized by higher levels of oxidative stress, sirolimus can exert a cytotoxic effect, led by the failure to repair DNA damage by inhibition of antioxidant enzymes such as FOXO3a triggered by Akt hyperactivation.

This proposal presents a phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with dMMR solid tumors after immunotherapy. The investigators hypothesize that sirolimus will increase the overall response rate (ORR) by 20%.
