PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With 125I Seed Implantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma's Extrahepatic Metastasis: Efficacy and Safety
This study aims to explore the effectiveness and safety of 125I seed implantation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastases, and to compare the efficacy differences between PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy and the combination of PD-1 inhibitor and 125I seed implantation.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 80 eligible patients admitted to Jiangxi Provincial Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to March 2025, with 40 patients in each group. Data including patients' basic characteristics, tumor staging, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, etc., were collected. Parameters of seed implantation and details of metastatic lesions were recorded.

Through regular follow-ups after treatment, the degree of pain relief (evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), tumor control efficacy (response rate, RR; local control rate, LCR), survival outcomes (local progression-free survival, LPFS; progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS) were assessed. Additionally, indicators such as blood cell analysis, liver and kidney function, and treatment-related adverse reactions were monitored, providing a clinical basis for optimizing comprehensive treatment regimens for HCC with extrahepatic metastases.
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma|125I Seeds Implantation
PROCEDURE: 125I seed implantation|DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitors
Progression - free Survival (PFS), It is the time interval from the start of treatment (initiation of PD - 1 inhibitor therapy or combination treatment) to the occurrence of tumor progression (defined by imaging criteria such as RECIST) or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Tumor progression includes the development of new lesions, increase in the size of existing lesions, or clinical deterioration indicative of disease advancement., Eligible patients who received assigned study treatment (monotherapy/combination) between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025 were enrolled. Follow-up was measured from treatment start to first progression/death, with survival cutoff in Apr 2025 (max 62 months).
Overall Survival, The length of time from either the start of treatment or diagnosis until the death of the patient from any cause., Patients who received assigned study treatment (monotherapy/combination) between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025 were enrolled. Follow - up measured from treatment start to death, with survival cutoff in Apr 2025 (max 62 monthsï¼‰.
