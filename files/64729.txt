A Study of LY2584702 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The main purpose of this trial is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2584702 that may be safely administered to participants with advanced/metastatic cancer.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: LY2584702
Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD): highest dose where \<33% participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs were adverse events (AEs) during Cycle 1 that met any 1 of the following criteria using National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) grading: any ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (except nausea/vomiting, diarrhea or hypophosphatemia without maximal symptomatic/prophylactic treatment) that was not related to study disease, any ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, any Grade 4 hematological toxicity of \>5 days duration or any febrile neutropenia. Investigators, together with the sponsor, could declare a DLT during Cycle 1 if a participant experienced increasing toxicity and it was clear that further treatment would expose the participant to excessive risk. The MTD was below the level required for efficacy, therefore, the study was terminated early and the recommended Phase 2 dose was not calculated., Parts A and B, Baseline through Cycle 1 (1 cycle=28 days)
Pharmacokinetics, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax results on Day 1 and on Day 8 (steady state) are reported., Parts A and B, Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 8 (predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 hours postdose)|Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Tumor response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) was small changes that did not meet above criteria including persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s)., Parts A and B, Baseline through study completion [up to Cycle 10 (1 cycle=28 days)]|Pharmacokinetics, Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) With Once Daily (QD) LY2584702 Dosing, Results for AUC from time 0 to infinity \[AUC(0-inf)\] and AUC from time 0 to 24 hours \[AUC(0-24)\] on Day 1 and Day 8 (steady state) are reported for participants on a QD LY2584702 dosing regimen., Part A, Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 8 (predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hours postdose)|Pharmacokinetics, Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) With Twice Daily (BID) LY2584702 Dosing, Results for AUC from time 0 to infinity \[AUC(0-inf)\] and AUC from time 0 to 12 hours \[AUC(0-12)\] on Day 1 and Day 8 (steady state) are reported for participants with a BID LY2584702 dosing regimen., Parts A and B, Cycle 1: Day 1 and Day 8 (predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hours postdose)
The main purpose of this trial is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2584702 that may be safely administered to participants with advanced/metastatic cancer.
